<P>In a three-day pretrial hearing, Oklahoma City Bombing defendants Timothy McVeigh and

Terry Nichols argued for separate trials. They also pressed the government to turn over

classified information that they said may prove Iraq was involved in the bombing. The

following is a transcript of the Oct. 3, 1996 morning proceedings.</P>

22                             PROCEEDINGS



23       (In open court at 9:00 a.m.)



24            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.



25            We're resumed in 96-CR-68.  The appearances appear to







                                                                 253







 1   be the same, and we're ready for oral argument on the



 2   respective motions for severance.  And we'll proceed in the



 3   order in which the defendants are named in the indictment, so



 4   we'll proceed with the motion filed on behalf of Mr. McVeigh



 5   first.



 6            Mr. Nigh, are you going to argue that?



 7            MR. NIGH:  I am, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  All right.  You may proceed to do so.



 9            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, as Mr. Nigh goes to the



10   lectern, I announce we have no objection to receiving



11   Government's exhibit, the declaration of Mr. Gillette, that I



12   had asked overnight to read.



13            THE COURT:  Yes.  Thank you.



14            MR. TIGAR:  And a copy of Defense H which has been



15   received by agreement should be with your Honor.



16            THE COURT:  So that's Government Exhibits 14 and



17   Mr. Nichols' Exhibit H?



18            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.



19            THE COURT:  And H is agreed to?



20            MR. CONNELLY:  It is, your Honor.



21            THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Nigh.



22              DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON SEVERANCE



23            MR. NIGH:  Thank you, your Honor.  May it please the



24   Court.



25            THE COURT:  Counsel.







                                                                 254







 1            MR. NIGH:  All of the evidence that we heard yesterday



 2   concerning the problems faced by jurors in providing



 3   individualized treatment to capital defendants is relevant to



 4   this Court's determination of the severance motions.  But I



 5   want to come back to the Eighth Amendment implications of a



 6   decision later.  The reason is, your Honor, that I submit that



 7   whether Tim McVeigh ever has to face a capital sentencing



 8   proceeding is largely dependent upon whether he must go to



 9   trial in the first stage in front of a jury that hears evidence



10   concerning Terry Nichols' nine-and-a-half-hour statement to the



11   FBI.



12            Whether or not Tim McVeigh's Sixth Amendment rights to



13   confrontation and Fifth Amendment rights to due process of law



14   would be violated by a joint trial has to be determined in



15   light of what the Government says its evidence will be in this



16   case and what the Government has said about its method of



17   proof.



18            The evidence that the Government suggests can be



19   effectively not considered by the jury are -- through the use



20   of a limiting instruction in this case is more detailed, it



21   requires the testimony of more witnesses, it concerns more



22   specific statements, it relates more directly to the



23   co-defendant, is more hotly contested by the Government, and



24   the declarant and is more devastating to the co-defendant than



25   any case in which a federal court has held that a limiting







                                                                 255







 1   instruction would be effective.



 2            This is a bit of a tightrope, your Honor, in terms of



 3   demonstrating for the Court why the statements are vitally



 4   important to the Government's case.  In order to do so, it



 5   requires some reference to what the Government says its proof



 6   will be.  I don't want to, by making reference to that



 7   evidence, create the prejudices we hope to avoid, but at the



 8   same time, I want to be able to make a coherent argument.  What



 9   I will do is make reference to those matters that are public



10   record and anything else in very general terms.  I'll make



11   specific references to page numbers in the brief.



12            The reason that I have to approach it that way, your



13   Honor, is in part because the Government's offer of proof



14   contained in its response brief talks about the evidence that



15   it will use to support a particular proposition.  Some of it



16   relates only to Mr. Nichols.  And of course, at trial, we would



17   be required to bring that out in front of the jury.  But it's



18   not necessary for me to bring it out specifically here.



19            The Government has provided a relatively detailed



20   outline about how it intends to prove its case, and it begins



21   with sub A under its outline at page 3 of its brief.  In sub A,



22   your Honor, what I can safely say without violating any



23   protective orders is that sub A relates to motive and none of



24   it is exclusively specific to Mr. McVeigh and none of it is



25   incriminating.  There -- I won't even estimate the thousands







                                                                 256







 1   upon thousands of people that hold the same views that the



 2   Government ascribes to Mr. McVeigh.  The evidence only becomes



 3   incriminating as outlined by the Government when it's linked



 4   with the testimony of Michael Fortier and has implications for



 5   the specific facts alleged in this case.



 6            Of course, your Honor, we have a defense to that



 7   aspect of the case, and that is the scorched earth cross-



 8   examination of Michael Fortier that is going to occur at trial



 9   and the jury's determination of his credibility.



10            Sub B in the Government's proof concerning why this



11   evidence from Terry Nichols' statement isn't important concerns



12   the acquisition of a particular item.  That is at page 6 of the



13   Government's brief.  It is an acquisition that is entirely



14   innocent by itself.  It only becomes incriminating when



15   provided context and meaning through witness testimony.  And



16   perhaps most importantly, your Honor, the Government says that



17   it occurred in late 1993, a time prior that the Government



18   alleges in the indictment the conspiracy began.



19            Sub C in the Government's brief is entitled



20   Acquisition and Storage of Components.  And they begin in



21   September of 1994, the references at page 6 of the Government's



22   brief.  This I can -- I can say because there was evidence



23   concerning this at the preliminary hearing and it's a matter of



24   public record already.  The Government in part will rely upon



25   its suggestion that Tim McVeigh's fingerprint was found on a







                                                                 257







 1   receipt for a fertilizer purchase.  Of course, your Honor, that



 2   evidence, assuming it can be proven, is subject to many



 3   innocent interpretations.



 4            Sub 2 under C of the Government's brief at page 7 is



 5   in reference to acquisition of what the Government says is



 6   other components.  The Government will, of course, have to



 7   prove each of those allegations through witness testimony.  It



 8   will require analysis and inference, and it will require the



 9   testimony of specific witnesses.



10            Sub 3 is the burglary that the Government alleges.  As



11   the Government notes in its brief, any link to Tim McVeigh is



12   premised upon the testimony of Michael Fortier.  And the



13   defense to that, of course, is the same as in reference to the



14   motive evidence.



15            October 18 is another acquisition according to the



16   Government which is dependent upon eyewitness accounts.



17            Subparagraph 5 is a November 19, 1994, robbery that



18   the Government alleges was a part of this.  Again, the only



19   link to Tim McVeigh is through the testimony of Michael and



20   Lori Fortier.



21            Subparagraph 6, which is referenced in paragraph 24 of



22   the overt acts section of the indictment -- and it appears at



23   page 10 of the Government's response brief, is Mr. Nichols'



24   undelivered letter -- the Government's theory is that that



25   letter was never delivered to Mr. McVeigh.







                                                                 258







 1            Then, your Honor, I come to paragraph 7 in the



 2   Government's outline, and I think that an analysis of that



 3   paragraph is absolutely critical to a determination of whether



 4   the jury can effectively ignore Terry Nichols' statement.



 5   Paragraph 7 appears in the Government's brief at page 11, in



 6   the response brief, and it's in reference to the alleged



 7   Oklahoma City trip in December of 1994.  And it is entirely



 8   premised upon the testimony of Michael Fortier.  I have



 9   detailed in our reply brief that statement again at page 15.



10            If Mr. Fortier, in fact, provides the testimony that



11   the Government says that he will provide in reference to that



12   trip and testifies that Tim McVeigh made the statements that



13   Michael Fortier says that he made, the Government will, by



14   virtue of that evidence, have created a factual vacuum that



15   only the statements of Terry Nichols can fill.  It is in part



16   because of that statement and the things that the Government



17   says Michael Fortier will say that the jury will be absolutely



18   unable to avoid consideration of Terry Nichols' statements.



19            In sub D, the Government -- this is at page 12 of the



20   Government's brief.  They call this the final stage preparation



21   and execution.  There are four key dates there:  April 14,



22   April 15, April 17, and April 18.  Each and every one of those



23   allegations requires the testimony of eyewitnesses.  And it



24   requires a finding for it to be incriminating against



25   Mr. McVeigh that Mr. McVeigh was the Robert Kling at Elliott's







                                                                 259







 1   Body Shop.  We have detailed in previous briefs why we believe



 2   that that eyewitness testimony is simply not credible and how



 3   it can be impeached and how we can support the theory that Tim



 4   McVeigh was not Robert Kling.  And I would ask the Court in



 5   reference to those allegations and those very important dates



 6   to pay particular attention to what the Government says about



 7   forensic evidence in that regard.



 8            Through this series -- and its a chronological series



 9   of events, your Honor -- the Government through its proof is



10   going to lead the jury to the absolute brink April 19 of 1995.



11   They have created a chronological picture.  But there are



12   critical gaps in the Government's proof as it relates to Tim



13   McVeigh.  And those gaps can only be filled with the



14   out-of-court statements of Terry Nichols.  The first one is in



15   reference to April 16, 1995, only three days before the



16   explosion at the Murrah Building.  And of course, Terry



17   Nichols' statements will fill that gap.



18            The second one relates to April 18, 1995, only one day



19   before the explosion at the Murrah Building.  The Government in



20   its brief at page 15 refers to those two days and the evidence



21   concerning those circumstances as those fateful days.



22            At the point in the trial when we get to a



23   consideration of what happened in the critical days surrounding



24   the explosion at the Murrah Building, the Government will have



25   to introduce the testimony of perhaps four separate FBI agents







                                                                 260







 1   concerning Terry Nichols' post-arrest statements and may rely



 2   upon the testimony of Agent Smith, Crabtree, Foley and



 3   Jablonski.  And those FBI agents will testify about the



 4   nine-and-a-half-hour statement made by Terry Nichols on



 5   April 21 and 22 of 1995, which was a statement almost entirely



 6   about the activities of Tim McVeigh as Terry Nichols suggested



 7   that they occurred on April 16 and April 18 of 1995, and his



 8   actions which he said were taken at the directive of



 9   Mr. McVeigh on April 20 of 1995.



10            Even if the Government limits its presentation to what



11   it has called the core admissions concerning the trip to



12   Oklahoma City on April 16, the use of the pickup truck on



13   April 18, the day before the bombing, and cleaning out the



14   storage locker on April 20, the Government cannot prevent



15   counsel for Mr. Nichols bringing out each and every statement



16   that Mr. Nichols made which explain his activities and place



17   the blame on Tim McVeigh in a statement in which he mentioned



18   Mr. McVeigh no less than 60 times in which every sentence and



19   almost every paragraph begins with something like Mr. McVeigh



20   said or Mr. McVeigh did.



21            Based upon that evidence, the Government will have to



22   ask the jury to find that because of those statements, they can



23   conclude that Terry Nichols was in Oklahoma City with Tim



24   McVeigh in the vicinity of the Murrah Building only three days



25   before the bombing and that they took steps during that trip to







                                                                 261







 1   make the bombing possible.  They will also ask the jury to



 2   conclude that because of those statements, Terry Nichols was



 3   with Tim McVeigh and that Tim McVeigh, at least -- either alone



 4   or with Terry Nichols, had Terry Nichols' pickup truck on



 5   April 18, 1995, one day before the bombing.  And the Government



 6   will ask the jury to conclude that based upon that, Mr. McVeigh



 7   and Mr. Nichols took steps to make the April 19, 1995,



 8   explosion occur.



 9            They will also ask the jury to conclude that based



10   upon those statements, that Mr. Nichols took Mr. McVeigh's



11   possessions out of a storage locker -- that the Government says



12   is very important to its case -- on the day after the bombing.



13            In trying to respond to the Court's limiting



14   instructions if the joint trial occurs, the jury will still be



15   asked to find that Tim McVeigh was present in Oklahoma City on



16   April 16, with Terry Nichols in the vicinity of the Murrah



17   Building, with Terry Nichols on April 18, the day before the



18   bombing with Terry Nichols in his truck, and that Mr. McVeigh's



19   possessions were in a storage locker and they were removed by



20   Mr. Nichols the day after the explosion but without making



21   reference to the only evidence in the court that will provide



22   them the basis to make such a finding.



23            This is especially true of the Government, because the



24   Government has no evidence with which to bridge the gap.  It is



25   simply too much to ask a jury in light of the other







                                                                 262







 1   instructions that the Court will have to give them consistent



 2   with the Government's theory of this case.



 3            In reference to a conspiracy charge, the Court will



 4   have to instruct the jury that the acts and statements by Terry



 5   Nichols in a conspiracy can be considered against Timothy



 6   McVeigh.



 7            In reference to the Government's aiding and abetting



 8   charge, the Government will have -- the Court will inform the



 9   jury that an act or statement in furtherance of a common scheme



10   or plan can be considered against the other defendant.



11            As it was pointed yesterday, your Honor, jurors are



12   simply human beings.  And we recognize that there are some



13   things that we simply cannot reasonably ask them to do.  We try



14   not to make their job completely impossible.  We have taken



15   extensive steps in this case to prevent prejudicial pretrial



16   publicity.  We have taken specific steps in reference to the



17   statements at issue here to prevent their dissemination



18   publicly because they may never be admitted at trial against



19   Tim McVeigh.



20            All of these -- we do these things even though we know



21   that the jury will be instructed not to consider evidence



22   outside of court or previous ideas gained from the media.  But



23   there are some things that are just simply insurmountable.



24            The law as announced by the United States Supreme



25   Court and by other federal courts makes it clear that these are







                                                                 263







 1   precisely the kinds of statements that cannot be admitted at a



 2   joint trial in a manner consistent with the Sixth Amendment.



 3   The principle that was enunciated by the Supreme Court in



 4   Bruton relates to the right of a defendant to cross-examine and



 5   confront the witnesses against him.  We have never maintained,



 6   your Honor, that Terry Nichols' statements were facially



 7   incriminating.  They are not.  But in the context of this case,



 8   they were practically a confession as to Timothy McVeigh.



 9            The problem is created by the evidentiary vacuum



10   created by Michael Fortier's statements about what might happen



11   in those fateful days surrounding April 19, 1995.  Richardson 



12   vs. Marsh holds that Bruton's rationale should be applied when



13   its logic validly applies.  There is no more compelling case, I



14   would submit, your Honor, in which to apply Bruton's rationale



15   than the case before the Court.



16            There are a number of lower Federal Court decisions



17   cited by the Government in its response in which severance has



18   been denied.  But I would submit that none of the facts in



19   those cases even superficially approach the powerful nature of



20   the facts in this case.  And I'll start with Richardson itself.



21   The statement in Richardson, of course, was redacted not only



22   to admit any reference to the declarant's co-defendant -- any



23   reference to the declare's co-defendant's existence at all.



24   The leading case relied upon by the Government is the Tenth



25   Circuit decision in Markopoulos.  In that case, there was no







                                                                 264







 1   reference at all to the co-defendant, and the statement was



 2   completely redacted to make any reference to the co-defendant.



 3            In United States vs. Clark, the testimony or the



 4   declarant's out-of-court statement and the facts supported by



 5   the declarant's testimony were not at issue.  They were not



 6   even contested.



 7            The Fifth Circuit's statement in Jobe, the statement



 8   was redact -- by retracted by the declarant, and that evidence



 9   was presented to the jury; and the statements there were simply



10   not powerfully incriminating or devastating.



11            Perhaps the Seventh Circuit's decision in United 



12   States vs. James illustrates the point perhaps better than any



13   other why this case is distinguishable from those cases in



14   which severance hasn't been granted.  In James, the statement



15   by the declarant was the out-of-court statement and was that



16   the defendant was a member of the Crips gang.  It was not



17   powerfully incriminating in any means.



18            In the context of this case, if we were talking about



19   a statement by Terry Nichols on April 21, 1995, that Tim



20   McVeigh was a member of the Michigan Militia, maybe we could



21   live with that.  The statement wouldn't be true, but it is



22   illustrative of the extremely inferential incrimination type of



23   statement that doesn't lead to severance.  And it doesn't



24   approach the facts in this case.



25            Olano and Adams, the other cases cited by the







                                                                 265







 1   Government in this regard, are distinguishable for the same



 2   reasons.  It is also true, your Honor, that we cannot cite for



 3   the Court a case in which statements that were not directly



 4   facially incriminating have led to a reversal for failure to



 5   grant a severance.  And I would submit the reason for that,



 6   your Honor, is any case in which the facts have come anywhere



 7   close to the facts in this one, severance has been granted; and



 8   of course, there was no issue for appeal and no reason for a



 9   reported decision.



10            The Government in its responses also argued that when



11   part of the statements are alleged to be false or the



12   Government's theory suggested the statements were false that no



13   Sixth Amendment problem was created.  And I would agree with



14   that, your Honor.  And I think that it's true; but until the



15   Government says that it doesn't intend to rely upon any of



16   these statements in order to prove the truth of the matter



17   asserted, that is not the case that we face at the present



18   time.



19            In its response brief, the Government also argues that



20   the reason for having joint trials are particularly strong in



21   this case.  I would submit that all of the reasons submitted



22   there are the reasons that severance is not always granted in



23   those cases in which a defendant's constitutional rights are



24   not violated.  The normal preference is for joint trials unless



25   a specific trial right is sacrificed.  The costs, the burdens,







                                                                 266







 1   and the delays are all reasons to try defendants jointly if it



 2   can be done in a manner consistent with the Constitution.



 3            I would submit, your Honor, that severance in this



 4   case will lead to minimal delay and that the burden on all of



 5   the parties involved in this and all of the people interested



 6   in it will be much less by doing two trials right than doing



 7   one trial wrong.



 8            The Government also has argued that it is not enough



 9   for us to demonstrate prejudice; that in addition to prejudice,



10   the remedy to be fashioned is in the discretion of the Court.



11   And that, of course, is correct.



12            But in -- the additional problem in this case, your



13   Honor, is that the Government has taken away the Court's



14   discretion.  The Government will not give up Terry Nichols'



15   statements even on pain of severance.  The Government will not



16   accept redaction of Terry Nichols' statements, even if it could



17   be done upon pain of severance.  And the only remedy left is



18   for separate trials.



19            I want to speak very briefly about the additional



20   argument concerning antagonistic defenses.  We have outlined in



21   the briefs in a detailed manner the antagonistic nature of the



22   defenses that we will be required to utilize at a joint trial.



23   The degree of the antagonism will be influenced by whether



24   Terry Nichols' statements are introduced to the jury.  If that



25   happens, Mr. McVeigh is going to have an interest in proving







                                                                 267







 1   some of those statements are false.



 2            Under the circumstances of this case, your Honor, we



 3   submit that the test is of Zafiro has been met.  I don't want



 4   to go into the specifics of why the defenses will be



 5   antagonistic.  We set that forth in the brief, and I will rely



 6   upon the statements that are made there.  But it also leads to



 7   the Eighth Amendment considerations that are involved because



 8   this is a capital prosecution.



 9            It is beyond dispute that a defendant in a capital



10   trial is entitled to individualized sentencing consideration by



11   the jury.  It -- it is also, I think, beyond dispute that that



12   process must be more difficult for a jury when two capital



13   defendants are tried together.  And the analogy that we have



14   made in reference to this in the brief is Dante's lizard and



15   fellow soul.  But we do not argue for a prosaic rule about it



16   at all, your Honor.  We only submit that the proof that we have



17   provided in the briefs proves that at the second stage, the



18   defenses must be mutually exclusive and antagonistic.  In order



19   for Mr. Nichols mitigation defense to be accepted,



20   Mr. McVeigh's mitigation defense would have to be rejected.



21            In a single defendant capital trial, it is the



22   Government vs. one defendant.  If two defendants are tried



23   together in a capital trial, it may very well be that it is the



24   Government vs. one defendant and then the Government vs. the



25   next defendant.  But in this case, it is going to be the







                                                                 268







 1   Government and Terry Nichols vs. Timothy McVeigh's theory and



 2   the Government and Timothy McVeigh vs. Terry Nichols' theory;



 3   and the jury may well resolve the issue by virtue of the



 4   conflict alone.



 5            Acceptance of one of the defendants' mitigation



 6   defenses will preclude the acceptance of the other, and that is



 7   the test as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Zafiro and its



 8   progeny in the terms of the first stage, but it has equal



 9   application at the second stage.



10            Your Honor, returning to the Bruton problem, the



11   Government may make claims about the strength of its case, and



12   we may make claims about the strength of our defense and our



13   ways of defeating the Government's case.  And of course, the



14   truth will only come out at trial.  But there is one thing



15   about the trial that is certainly true, and that is that all of



16   the evidence in the Government's case, whether it is the



17   testimony of Michael and Lori Fortier, forensic evidence from



18   the FBI lab, business records and inferences or interpretation



19   of business records, or the testimony of critical



20   eyewitnesses -- all of that evidence will be subjected to the



21   process of adversarial testing.



22            There were some very glowing statements made by the



23   witnesses yesterday concerning Mr. Jones and his abilities, and



24   it does not pain me to tell the Court that I believe all those



25   statements to be true and probably have more faith in Mr. Jones







                                                                 269







 1   than any of those witnesses.  But there is one thing that



 2   Mr. Jones cannot do, and that is to cross-examine Terry Nichols



 3   while he is seated at counsel table.  And that is the evidence



 4   that will be spread before the jury in a joint trial that is



 5   not subject to adversarial testing.



 6            In the final analysis, your Honor, the Government does



 7   not realistically argue that the jury will be able to follow



 8   the limiting instruction and consider the evidence to find the



 9   facts against Terry Nichols but not consider the evidence to



10   find those same facts against Tim McVeigh.  The Government



11   argues instead that a limiting instruction at a joint trial



12   based upon some language from federal cases is a reasonable



13   practical accommodation.



14            If these trials are severed, your Honor, and



15   Mr. McVeigh is convicted by a jury and sentenced to death, it



16   will be done on the basis of evidence that is admissible



17   against him.



18            If these cases are tried jointly and the jury convicts



19   Mr. McVeigh and sentences him to death, the jury will have made



20   that decision after hearing and considering evidence that was



21   not admissible against Mr. McVeigh as a matter of law.



22            That, your Honor, on the facts of this case, is no



23   reasonable, practical accommodation.



24            We pray for the separate trials that due process



25   demands.







                                                                 270







 1            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Nigh.  Mr. Tigar.



 2            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, with the Court's permission



 3   Mr. Thurschwell will address the Court briefly on the Bruton



 4   aspect of severance, and I will deal with the remainder of it.



 5            THE COURT:  That's agreeable.  Mr. Thurschwell.



 6              DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON SEVERANCE



 7            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Thank you, your Honor.  Your Honor,



 8   the circumstances of the admission of Mr. Nichols' statement at



 9   trial are predictable today.  What is -- the Government has



10   announced that it views Mr. Nichols, quote, core admissions



11   regarding his certain associations with Mr. McVeigh in the days



12   prior to the bombing as the most incriminating evidence against



13   him.



14            When they put their witness on the stand to testify



15   about Mr. Nichols' statement, their direct examination will



16   bear down on Mr. McVeigh's name, his identity and his role.  On



17   cross-examination, predictably, Mr. McVeigh will contest that



18   evidence in various ways, again focussing on the very same



19   information.  Since that's the statements that harm his client,



20   Mr. Jones will bear down on those statements, attempting to



21   show that those statements are false.  Again, statements



22   mentioning Mr. McVeigh by name will be the focus of the



23   cross-examination.



24            On cross-examination by counsel for Mr. Nichols --



25            THE COURT:  Just a moment.  Does Mr. McVeigh have a







                                                                 271







 1   right of cross-examination on that testimony --



 2            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor --



 3            THE COURT:  -- if it's clearly limited?



 4            MR. THURSCHWELL:  I believe -- I'm uncertain of the



 5   law, but I believe he would have to, given the practical



 6   realities.  It seems to me that he would be able to -- there is



 7   no reason, to the extent that he can use a witness called by



 8   the Government to make his own defense, that he should be -- he



 9   would be entitled to use that witness called by the Government



10   for that purpose.



11            THE COURT:  Well, but that would undercut any limiting



12   instruction.  Normally, when a witness testifies in a multiple



13   defendant trial about something that is not admissible against



14   the co-defendant, the limiting instruction starts right there.



15   Members of the jury, you -- the next witness is being called



16   only as a witness against the defendant, Mr. Terry Nichols.



17   You will not consider this testimony in any way with respect to



18   Mr. McVeigh.  That would be the kind of limiting instruction



19   that I think the Government has in mind.



20            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Well, your Honor, I -- I'm -- I



21   believe that since Mr. Nich -- Jones would be unable to call



22   Mr. Nichols in his own defense because of Mr. Nichols' Fifth



23   Amendment right, it seems to me that cross-examination of the



24   agent or -- and I'm not sure it would make any difference if he



25   could recall the agent, under some admissibility theory.  I







                                                                 272







 1   mean, I -- it seems to me that he might very well have given



 2   the Chambers vs. Michigan argument, at a minimum that he could



 3   call the agent in his own case to focus on Mr. Nichols' alleged



 4   inculpatory statements regarding Mr. McVeigh.  He will -- and



 5   to not allow him to do that would be to deny him evidence, what



 6   a jury might very well view to be crucial evidence exculpatory



 7   to his client.



 8            If he does that in his own case -- if he is prohibited



 9   on cross-examination in the Government's case from addressing



10   that, he still would be permitted to do it in his own case.



11   The net result would be the same.  The jury will be again



12   focussing on statements by Terry Nichols about Mr. McVeigh that



13   would have predictable spillover effect --



14            THE COURT:  I would expect the Government to object to



15   that as hearsay, exculpatory hearsay.



16            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Even if Mr. McVeigh's cross-



17   examination is -- is prohibited, by the limiting instruction,



18   Mr. Nichols will have the opportunity --



19            THE COURT:  Yes.  There's no doubt about that.



20            MR. THURSCHWELL:  -- to stand up and focus on the very



21   same statements.  And what Mr. Nichols will do is attempt to



22   show that those statements do not implicate him as the



23   Government argues in the crime.  One of the methods he will be



24   attempting to employ is to demonstrate, using other statements,



25   that Mr. -- that Mr. Nichols allegedly made at the same time as







                                                                 273







 1   part of the same statement that demonstrate, one, his own



 2   innocence, Mr. Nichols', regarding these very same admissions



 3   mentioning Mr. McVeigh by name; and two, other statements that



 4   by -- that I don't want to get into here given the constraints



 5   of the public hearing, but statements that would be strongly



 6   inculpatory of Mr. McVeigh and tend to show Mr. Nichols' good



 7   faith in appearing at the police station voluntarily and



 8   proceeding to -- to speak to the -- speak to the Government



 9   agents.  He would have the right for -- reasons that I --



10            THE COURT:  Yes.  You can get into anything that would



11   negate the inference of a consciousness of guilt.



12            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Absolutely.  And as a result, even



13   leaving Mr. Jones' cross-examination aside, the net result



14   would be a strong focus during the Government's presentation of



15   this witness allegedly simply in Mr. Nichols' case on



16   Mr. McVeigh's name and role in the offense.



17            No court, as Mr. Nigh pointed out, has ever proved the



18   admission of a co-defendant statement in these circumstances



19   approaching this over a Bruton objection, and there are very



20   good reasons for this.  The Bruton question really -- really



21   addresses two -- the Bruton addresses two questions.  The first



22   is would admission of this evidence directly against the



23   defendant -- the co-defendant's statements against the



24   defendant violate the confrontation clause.  If it would not,



25   then the limiting instruction, even if a jury doesn't follow







                                                                 274







 1   it, will not violate the defendant's constitutional right and



 2   there's no Bruton problem.  The answer to that question has



 3   been answered by this Court in an earlier opinion:  It will



 4   violate Mr. McVeigh's confrontation clause rights.



 5            The second Bruton question therefore, and the only one



 6   at issue here, is whether a jury can obey a limiting



 7   instruction in the circumstances in which this admission --



 8   these alleged admissions will be put in to disregard the



 9   evidence with respect to Mr. McVeigh.



10            And as the scenario I have just suggested suggests,



11   that would be -- we believe it would be impossible, and no



12   court has ever held that it would be possible.  The



13   Government's response really is not -- again as Mr. Nigh



14   pointed out, to contest that a jury would somehow be able to



15   disregard this evidence but focuses on the legal question of



16   what the requirements of Bruton are and what the Government



17   argues is that it is -- only devastating or powerfully



18   incriminating statements are the statements that qualify for



19   treatment under Bruton -- exclusion under Bruton.



20            The short answer to that contention is provided by



21   Cruz vs. New York, which we site in our reply brief.  In Cruz,



22   Justice Scalia, who's also the author of the Richardson case,



23   specifically points out that devastation, in quotes, is not to



24   be -- and what would go along with all that is all the other



25   correlates, powerfully incriminating, the other language that







                                                                 275







 1   they lift from Bruton and Richardson is not to be evaluated on



 2   a case-by-case basis as the Government does at length in its



 3   brief, but is one of the justifications in the first instance



 4   for excluding evidence confessions by co-defendant of the type



 5   involved here.  In other words, the Government is putting the



 6   cart before the horse or losing forest for the trees.  I'm not



 7   sure which cliche applies more aptly, but the Government



 8   ignores the fact that it's not the devastation that matters for



 9   confrontation clause and Bruton purposes, but the fact that the



10   jury is going to be able to or not be able to follow the



11   instruction.  That is clear.



12            And I will -- the citations are in our brief.  But in



13   the context from which these -- these small quotations,



14   powerfully incriminating, devastating to the defendant's case



15   are lifted from the Bruton case and the Richardson case, it's



16   perfectly clear and I will not harp on that.  I think it is



17   worth noting, though, it's -- the mistake that the Government



18   makes, which, again, as we argue, is essentially to substitute



19   a harmless error test for the confrontation clause test of



20   Bruton, is -- has been made by people -- both people who have



21   never loved Bruton, as Justice White's dissent in Cruz makes



22   clear, and people who have loved Bruton too much, as Justice



23   Stevens' dissent in Richardson makes clear.



24            Both those dissents apply essentially the same test



25   that the Government is attempting to apply here, as did the







                                                                 276







 1   Court -- the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the



 2   opinion that Justice Scalia reversed in Richardson, finding



 3   that because the statement was powerfully incriminating, the



 4   completely redacted statement in Richardson was powerfully



 5   incriminating, it therefore would violate Bruton.



 6            Justice Scalia said, No, powerful incrimination is not



 7   the issue.  And he says in Footnote 3 of that case that, of



 8   course, it's incriminating in that case.  The issue is whether



 9   a jury will be able to follow the instruction or not.  That is



10   the legal issue here.  Okay.  So -- and the answer to that



11   question, I believe, is clear and is clear today.



12            Let me spend -- devote two minutes to our alternative



13   argument made in a our brief.  Even if the statements, the



14   core -- so-called core statements were deemed admissible under



15   Bruton by this Court, as I referred to earlier, Mr. Nichols



16   will have -- must have the opportunity to assure that that



17   statement is -- those statements are put in their context under



18   Rule 106 and 611(a), the rule of completeness, so that the --



19   to assure that no exculpatory information is omitted by virtue



20   of the limitation of the Government's presentation and to



21   ensure that the statement is not distorted.



22            Similarly, but on different grounds under Crane vs. 



23   Kentucky, Mr. Nichols has the right to assure -- to contest the



24   credibility the governments claims about the credibility of a



25   confession that he has made.







                                                                 277







 1            Now, in Crane vs. Kentucky, as in most such cases, the



 2   circumstances that the -- that the defendant wants to introduce



 3   in response to the Government's introduction of his confession



 4   would tend to show that this is not a reliable confession.



 5   This is not something that the court or the jury should



 6   believe.



 7            The reverse is the case here.  The Government is going



 8   to contend based on certain statements made by Mr. Nichols



 9   that -- that these statements are false and that their falsity



10   tends to show that he was implicated in the crime.  Nothing in



11   Crane's logic suggests that -- that a defendant shouldn't have



12   the same due process right to show that that -- that



13   credibility evaluation which is being used against him -- Just



14   as the court in Crane, the Government was arguing it was a



15   credible confession and what the defendant is saying now is not



16   credible, it's the same issue.



17            The -- in order to contest the Government's claims



18   about the credibility of Mr. Nichols, we must be allowed to put



19   in evidence tending to show that what I said on that day was



20   true and I'm -- among other things -- and some of that evidence



21   tends to show (1) his innocent explanations and (2) other



22   statements he made, some of which are extremely inculpatory of



23   Mr. McVeigh or may be construed to be so that tend to bolster



24   his credibility as a citizen who goes down to the station house



25   and tells the Government everything he knows after hearing that







                                                                 278







 1   the Government is looking for him.



 2            On both those bases, those additional statements come



 3   in; and even if the original core statements, so-called "core



 4   statements," are deemed not to be sufficiently inculpatory or



 5   powerfully devastating, these ancillary statements clearly are.



 6   And therefore, the Bruton problem arises yet again.



 7            Thank you, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  Well, I have a couple of questions.  One



 9   is -- and of course, you know, you're not bound by your answers



10   in terms of intent and plan; but one question I have is whether



11   you intend to suggest to the jury that these statements were



12   involuntary.  I mean, we've done that, you know, motion to



13   suppress; but that does not prevent the contention that the



14   circumstances make them involuntary.  I don't know.



15            MR. THURSCHWELL:  That's -- that's a strategy



16   decision, your Honor, that, to my knowledge, has not been made



17   by our team.  We -- I think I -- I referred to the statement as



18   voluntary before.  Obviously, we have called it involuntary in



19   the context of the suppression motion.  We do believe for the



20   reasons we stated there that it was involuntary.  How we will



21   present it to the jury, I would have to confer briefly with



22   Counsel; and I'm not sure we could come to that conclusion.



23            THE COURT:  As I said, I can't bind you by your



24   answers now anyway, because you have the right to react to the



25   Government's evidence.  But that may be a -- a matter that I







                                                                 279







 1   have to consider -- I mean could consider.



 2            Another question is with respect to the bringing in



 3   the additional statements from the FBI witnesses that you



 4   characterized as exculpatory, would you also intend in a



 5   defense case to put on evidence to corroborate some of those



 6   statements with witnesses?



 7            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Absolutely, your Honor.



 8            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, certainly, the circumstances



 9   under which Mr. Nichols was interrogated would explain some



10   obvious gaps.  I mean, he made -- he made some mistakes about



11   dates and events and ordering of events under the pressure of



12   the moment.  That's the only answer we can give to the first



13   question.



14            With respect to the second question, to the extent the



15   Government seeks to say that these statements of Mr. Nichols



16   are untrue or to spin that web, then we have and we have found



17   and we will present corroborating evidence.  And that should be



18   considered together with the 106 contentions as to which the



19   parties are in disagreement.



20            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.



21            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Thank you, your Honor.



22            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Tigar, your portion of the



23   argument.



24            MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, we have asked and



25   received from the Court, I believe, permission to file a brief







                                                                 280







 1   no more than ten pages, a statement about the Government's



 2   17-page factual recitation.



 3            THE COURT:  Yes.



 4            MR. TIGAR:  And I will not tax the Court's patience by



 5   trying to deal with that today.  I'm going to go beyond what's



 6   been said before and direct the Court's attention to two texts



 7   that we believe control the decision.  The first is, of course,



 8   Rule 14, if it appears that a defendant is prejudiced by a



 9   joinder.  Now, the Government says, and wrongly, that we think



10   that that should be construed differently in capital cases than



11   in noncapital cases.  Well, not quite so.  What we say is that



12   the Rule 14 should be construed differently in every case.



13            The words "whether one is prejudiced" are rather like



14   Justice Scalia's favorite expression, "life is a fountain";



15   that is to say, they have no meaning unless they are attached



16   to circumstances.  And the circumstances of a capital case are



17   different.



18            And the second text therefor is that of the federal



19   death penalty statute.  Congress has chosen, as our witnesses



20   said yesterday and admitted -- even the Government's



21   witnesses -- to make individual jurors sovereign in capital



22   cases.  Congress has chosen a particular method of doing what



23   the Supreme Court said on that day in 1976 was the



24   constitutionally acceptable task of every death penalty



25   statute; that is, that it must guide and focus the jury's







                                                                 281







 1   objective consideration of the particularized circumstances on



 2   the individual offense and the individual offender.  That from



 3   Jurek vs. Texas.



 4            We today tendered as Defense H an exhibit authored by



 5   the Government's own expert; and if you'll look at Exhibit H,



 6   that is Mr. Hoffman's article, when the Court has it.  At the



 7   bottom of page 13 and the top of page 14, there is a compelling



 8   statement.  They tried to prepare us, says a juror, but were we



 9   prepared, no, I do not feel like we were.  We understood what



10   we were doing, but the way we were supposed to come up with



11   that verdict using these specific instructions were confusing.



12   The manner in which those 40 pages were written, it was of very



13   little use to us.  When the bailiff brought all the evidence



14   in, we all looked at each other and said now what do we do.



15            There is, as Justice Scalia has said, that tension,



16   your Honor, between the desire for uniformity in capital



17   sentencing and the desire for individualization that has led



18   Justices Scalia and Thomas to retire from the debate; but we in



19   this room don't have that luxury, your Honor.  We have to take



20   the statute Congress gave us; and the statute Congress gave us



21   prefers jury sovereignty to the questionable virtues of



22   consistency that might be obtained by Judge Matsch sentencing.



23            Under those circumstances, this individual



24   consideration is what's paramount; and what this Hoffman



25   article shows us is that jurors are physically, emotionally,







                                                                 282







 1   spiritually, and intellectually exhausted by the task of



 2   considering life or death for one individual without regard to



 3   the burdens placed on them by considering it for two.



 4            Death is different, your Honor.  And it is different



 5   despite what the Government says.  They cite to your Honor two



 6   cases that we did not cite in our brief, Buchanan and



 7   Lonberger.  In Buchanan vs. Kentucky, which the Government



 8   taxes us for not citing, there was one defendant charged with a



 9   capital count and another defendant who was not so charged.



10   Justice Scalia begins his opinion by saying there are two



11   narrow issues to consider; neither one of which is severance.



12   The capital defendant there had not moved for severance in the



13   court below, nor did he on appeal.  It appeared to be some



14   procedural effort to gain an advantage by getting out from



15   under Whitherspoon by virtue of the joinder.



16             Lonberger demonstrates, indeed, by reaffirming Jurek,



17   whose language I began by quoting to the court -- Lonberger



18   doesn't apply because it is not simply a harmless error case;



19   that is, it is not simply a case that says we're not going to



20   disturb what happened in the trial court below.  It is in which



21   the very footnote relied upon by the Government says that the



22   court will not fashion a due process rule for application in



23   federal habeas.  So it is twice removed from the reality that



24   confronts the decision that is before your Honor.



25            Similarly, I suppose, one can dismiss the citation to







                                                                 283







 1   the Steiker article.  I know Jordan Steiker.  He's my colleague



 2   at Texas.  He recognized that bifurcation is an Eighth



 3   Amendment requirement, and that is what we are talking about



 4   here.



 5            And so the question is how do we deal with the other



 6   objections to severance.  And let's look at them in a Rule 14



 7   context.  Your Honor asked the question of corroboration.  It's



 8   a key question.  Who are Mr. Nichols' witnesses?  Lana Padilla



 9   is Mr. Nichols' witness.  Oh, yes, she who found the letter.



10   Marife Nichols is Mr. Nichols' witness.  Josh Nichols is



11   Mr. Nichols' witness.  James Nichols now cleared of those



12   nonsense charges.  He is his.  Mr. Donohue, who will say that



13   Mr. Nichols is out there riding the tractor during the day and



14   working when certain key telephone calls are made.



15            Our cross-examination of experts is very different,



16   because the Government concedes Mr. Nichols wasn't there.



17   The -- the whole Oklahoma City details:  They don't concern us.



18            These are all matters, your Honor, in which we would



19   in our defense case present matters that have nothing whatever



20   to do with Mr. McVeigh and to the extent the Government calls



21   those witnesses, we have extensive, lengthy cross-examination



22   to the extent permitted by your Honor under the scope rule, if



23   we didn't have to -- if not, we'll call them in our own case.



24   But the point is these are things that cut against the



25   Government's assertion that there is an economy aspect to this.







                                                                 284







 1   And I'll talk more about that.



 2            And then there's the factor that Judge Campbell



 3   referred to inadvertently.  Think about the risk, your Honor.



 4   Here's a capital trial in which everybody agrees the evidence



 5   is highly charged.  Limiting instructions are sought.  Limiting



 6   instructions are obtained.  They are given.  The witness comes



 7   on.  A witness says something.  A question is asked.  A lawyer



 8   forgets what the instructions are.  And all of a sudden,



 9   somebody moves for a mistrial; or the case proceeds to trial



10   because the mistrial isn't granted, and now you've got a



11   reversal as to both.



12            In other words, it seems to me that in a global



13   consideration of costs and risks, your Honor, the Government's



14   cost estimate simply don't make sense.  And the same can be



15   said for their continuing duty notion.  I mean, why start down



16   the road with the idea that in the middle, the trial will be



17   aborted, which is what the Government suggestion is under the



18   continuing duty rationale simply because something is done?



19            And I'll say this before I talk more about the law:



20   We're willing to help the Court.  We have proposed joint



21   hearings on expert admissibility issues.  Similarly, in a trial



22   that was held, whoever is tried first in a joint trial, we



23   would expect counsel for the other defendant to be on call so



24   that at times when hearings on admissibility issues out of the



25   sight and hearing of that first jury were held, those other







                                                                 285







 1   lawyers could come in on -- on foundation questions:  Is this



 2   really an expert, or -- or -- or is this a kind of expertise,



 3   or whatever?  We'd have to work out the details, but we're



 4   willing to work with the Court so that these sorts of details



 5   resolved in the first trial would not have to be chewed over



 6   again in a second trial, thus minimizing what is the biggest



 7   time waster in complex cases, and that is hassling over those



 8   sorts of technical problems.  This is, after all, a case with



 9   200 witnesses.



10            There's another factor that's -- that's unique about



11   this case, and that is in the Government's factual statement,



12   the Government begins by telling the Court that it is going to



13   rely upon advocacy as one main prop of its proof.  Indeed, it



14   talks about a blueprint.  Now, interestingly enough, your



15   Honor, this invokes the cases we have cited to the Court.  We,



16   of course, are not suggesting First Amendment protection for a



17   bombing that took those lives.  We don't suggest that.  It



18   would be ridiculous to do it.  But what the Government wants to



19   do is to make a leap from clearly protected expression, the



20   contents of a library, the contents of things that people said



21   and wrote, to criminal liability.  Very well.  The law permits



22   them to do it.



23            But the Supreme Court in Noto, which is in 367 U.S.,



24   speaking of that principle strictissimi juris -- some Latin



25   thing that means be careful if you're in the court.  But







                                                                 286







 1   whatever that is, it means that when advocacy is sought to be



 2   used as the basis for criminal liability, special care must be



 3   taken.



 4            Then in a joint trial in United States vs. Spock,



 5   where the defendants were alleged to have issued a statement



 6   authored a statement that then made them liable for criminal



 7   conduct by draft-age young men, the First Circuit took it



 8   further; and in 416 F.2d at page 173, applying the lesson of



 9   Noto and Scales, which immediately precedes Noto in volume 367



10   U.S., the court said that you've got to be very careful not to



11   have the spillover that one person's advocacy would -- would be



12   construed by the jury to make an inference that they actually



13   did the conduct and especially that one person's advocacy



14   didn't taint a case against a co-defendant who was thought to



15   hold similar views.



16            I'm not going to go into detail about this, your



17   Honor; but it is a -- vast difference between having a book in



18   your library which is the evidence in one part and then a sort



19   of proselytizing and the other evidence that might come out



20   that would make these things very different as to these two



21   defendants.



22            Paradoxically, no, Mr. Kelley is not here.  We should



23   congratulate him, because he just won a case called Rice vs. 



24   Paladin Enterprises, which is not in F.Supp. yet, but is 1996



25   WL 515786 applying that Brandenburg vs. Ohio advocacy standard







                                                                 287







 1   with respect to a book about, you know, how to be a hit man.



 2   And whatever one might think about that literature, that First



 3   Amendment issue is here.



 4            Then we have the disparity question, your Honor -- the



 5   disparity and the quantum of evidence.  And I'm not going to go



 6   into detail.  There are gaps in contact between Mr. Nichols and



 7   Mr. McVeigh, November, December, January, '94, '95, and then



 8   that February - April period.



 9            But there is Michael Fortier.  The Government talks



10   about Michael Fortier during -- that name has been public.  I



11   can talk about it.  It's in their statement of facts.  Michael



12   Fortier says things.  Now Michael Fortier therefore is a



13   hearsay declarant.  Much of what Michael Fortier has to say



14   about Terry Nichols, he gets from another hearsay declarant, or



15   an 801 declarant, which is the same thing.  That triggers Rule



16   806.



17            And what does Rule 806 give us the right to do, your



18   Honor; and what 806 does is give Mr. Nigh and Mr. Jones and



19   Mr. Burr and Ms. Merritt the right to do when Mr. Nichols is a



20   declarant, because this sword has two edges and we know it.  It



21   gives us the right to admit anything that would be admissible



22   if the declarant had testified as a witness.  Rule 806 is a



23   license, your Honor, to do everything that the Sixth Amendment



24   cross-examination rights would have entitled somebody to do to



25   that declarant.







                                                                 288







 1            So in a joint trial where Mr. Nichols' statement comes



 2   in, this table gets to go after him just as though he had taken



 3   the stand and so putting an enormous price on his



 4   constitutional privilege not to do so.  And if the declarant in



 5   somebody else's statement is Mr. McVeigh, we get the same right



 6   to go after him, just as though he had taken the stand.  And



 7   again, that puts an enormous price on whatever -- on his



 8   privilege not to take the stand in his own defense.  So that's



 9   the disparity question, your Honor.



10            And the spillover prejudice antagonistic defenses,



11   we've dealt with in our memorandum.  I'm not going to talk



12   about that.  The Tenth Circuit is with us there.



13            Next point in my laundry list, lesser included



14   offenses.  It has been clear in the federal courts ever since



15   1895 that no one is entitled to a lesser included offense



16   unless they present some evidence in support of the LIO.



17   That's Sparf in 156 US.



18            Now, in this case, if one defendant's whole theory is



19   I wasn't there, didn't have anything to do with it, whatever,



20   and the other defendant's theory of defense is, well, I did



21   know a person accused of being a perpetrator and I certainly



22   was that person's business associate and friend, but what I did



23   certainly did not amount to aiding and abetting and I certainly



24   had no anticipation that that person was going to commit a



25   crime involving danger to human life.  That person, the second







                                                                 289







 1   person, would be entitled to a longer list of lesser-included



 2   offense instructions than the first person because the first



 3   person's defense would be all or nothing.



 4            I can't predict, your Honor, what the defense posture



 5   is going to be and that's the problem, is that nobody can



 6   predict what it's going to look like at the end of the case.



 7   But the high likelihood that it's going to look like what I



 8   said means you have this disparity and that the Beck vs. 



 9   Alabama rights are going to be compromised.



10            Next rule, Rule 403 of the Rules of Evidence.  The



11   Government states -- and correctly -- that much evidence that



12   is admissible, regardless of whether the cases are tried



13   separately or together.  Well, yes.  Rule 401 says that in the



14   federal courts, anything is relevant if it has any tendency to



15   prove a proposition in issue, and 402 says relevant evidence



16   comes in.  But in a separate trial of Mr. Nichols, it beggers



17   belief to think that every single item of evidence that would



18   be admissible in a separate trial of Mr. McVeigh comes in



19   against Mr. Nichols.  Because a Rule 403 determination would



20   have to be made that at some point, hey, it's just cumulative.



21   This distinction that it doesn't come in arises because the



22   Government is flat wrong about aiding and abetting law in the



23   federal courts.  Aiding and abetting in federal law requires



24   proof that some principal did commit the offense, oh, sure, but



25   the focus in an aiding and abetting case -- and Mr. Nichols is







                                                                 290







 1   charged under Section 2 -- is on the aider and abetter's



 2   conduct.



 3            And the Supreme Court has made that clear ever since



 4   an old, old case called Hicks vs. United States in about 1893,



 5   150 U.S. 442.  I got that all out of my favorite LaFave-Scott



 6   hornbook starting at about page 576, and I'll just rest on that



 7   because the Government's law is just wrong as a matter of



 8   hornbook law.



 9            But there's a different part of this aiding/abetting



10   business that I think is interesting.  Aiding and abetting



11   instructions under 18 U.S.C. Section 2, your Honor, tell us



12   that aiders and abetters and principals are the same thing.



13   Statutorily, we've abolished the common law distinctions and



14   we've made all aiders and abetters into principals.  So we



15   spend the guilt phase telling people that aiding and abetting



16   is the same thing as the principal offender for liability



17   purposes, and then the Government would -- then we have to take



18   the penalty trial to tell them that really individual treatment



19   is the order of the day.  We'd ask the jurors to unlearn



20   everything that the guilt phase instructions tell them.  This,



21   we submit, is impossible.  Why is it impossible?  It's



22   impossible because, contrary to the Government's assertion, we



23   don't trust jurors that much.  We understand there some things



24   they can't do.



25            Why am I talking in parables and Mr. Nigh is talking







                                                                 291







 1   in parables?  Because we haven't released to the media a whole



 2   bunch of evidence that is exchanged in discovery because we



 3   don't want prospective jurors to see it.  Why?  Because even if



 4   they said that they could disregard it, we'd have doubt about



 5   the reliability of that answer.  Rule 403 says we don't trust



 6   jurors all the time.  Change of venue says we don't trust



 7   jurors all the time.  And all the other functions the court



 8   performs ex parte.



 9            The Government says there's a scandal of inconsistent



10   verdicts.  Those dicta have been used.  But it's interesting



11   that the Government cites a case United States vs. Standefer in



12   which the recipient of a bribe is convicted after the giver was



13   acquitted.  And that recipient said, hey, that's not fair.



14   That's the scandal of inconsistent verdicts.  And the



15   Government argued to the Supreme Court that nonmutual



16   collateral estoppel doesn't apply against the Government in



17   criminal cases.  Why?  Because the jury system gives you



18   inconsistent verdicts.  That's just one of the things that it



19   does, and the Government shouldn't be punished for that.



20            Mr. Grant finally admitted -- and he came clean -- he



21   wants judge sentencing because he wants consistency.  And he



22   didn't like that Thomas case where one juror who got two others



23   to go along held things up.  Okay.  That's his preference.  I



24   don't argue with that.  But Congress made our choice.  Congress



25   made the single jury sovereign, and that's the choice that







                                                                 292







 1   we've got to look at.  We put on witnesses yesterday to talk



 2   about that.  Texas, 400 people on death row in Texas.  400.



 3   We're not proud of that.  But after Penry, no joint trials.



 4            The Government in its brief said, oh, here are five



 5   jointly tried cases.  One of them Barrientes, pre-Penry, was a



 6   joint trial held over a defendant's objection.  Two of the



 7   cases in their list were McMahon and McCormick.  They were



 8   co-defendants.  So that counts as one case.  The state moved



 9   for severance in that case, your Honor, and the defense opposed



10   it because joint defense counsel didn't want to lose the money



11   that they had been paid in fees to represent these two men



12   jointly.  Yes, your Honor.  And that -- what I'm telling you



13   was found by Judge Clinton for the court in Ex Parte McCormick



14   at 645 S.W.2d 801.  We've distinguished the other cases,



15   supposedly great examples of joinder in our fair state, in our



16   brief, and I don't need to talk about them further.



17            The fact is that this also goes, by the way, to the --



18   to the Government's exhibits showing that there have been



19   joined trials where there have been life sentences.  Fine.



20   That's the sound of one hand clapping, your Honor, because we



21   don't know what would have been the result, the -- the mix of



22   results in the absence of joinder.  That is, we don't know how



23   many fewer or more or whatever, so we say that's just



24   irrelevant.



25            Which brings me then to Dr. Bronson.  Dr. Bronson was







                                                                 293







 1   much attacked yesterday.  And maybe some people don't like the



 2   way he does the coin-flip multiplication, but the fact is that



 3   his study shows that there's a difference.  You can criticize



 4   his study saying he didn't allow people enough time to fill out



 5   the forms.  He didn't exercise controls.  He should have used a



 6   two-tail instead of a one-tail, even though the two-tail would



 7   have come up with the same results.  The fact is that what



 8   Mr. Bronson has done is the only study anybody knows of.



 9            Dr. Hastie attacks it and says it's of low value, but



10   importantly enough, it bears out -- it bears out what



11   Mr. Stevenson and Judge Campbell and all of the other witnesses



12   said.  And who does the Government put up against it?



13   Dr. Hastie, aptly named, who after 72 hours of contemplating



14   some motions, without having conducted a study of his own feels



15   free to opine in answer to Mr. Ryan's last question which we



16   permitted to be given in two installments that he thinks



17   joinder is okay.  Well, what -- what sociological social



18   science peer review colleague important research basis is there



19   for that conclusion drawn out of the air by a man who doesn't



20   read the newspaper?



21            I'm sorry.  I mean no disrespect, your Honor, but it



22   is the Senor Swentsis theory of sociology.  Is it all right?



23   Yes, it's all right.  What Dr. Hastie does admit, however, on



24   cross-examination that were he confronted with this issue of



25   two human lives being held in the hands of jurors, he'd be







                                                                 294







 1   troubled by it.  And we submit under these circumstances with



 2   all the risks out there, troubled is enough.  His other



 3   criticisms, the difficulty of research, that the people had the



 4   same last name was Alvarez in Fresno County and that people in



 5   Fresno County don't know that Alvarez is a very common name,



 6   something like Smith.  I've tried cases in Fresno County, your



 7   Honor, where the defendant's name was Chavez and the witness's



 8   name was Chavez and the juror's name was Chavez and everybody



 9   got along fine.  The other study where it's Abel and Baker, no



10   such criticism.



11            Mr. Hastie tells us another fact.  Dr. Hastie --



12   excuse me.  He's a part of "The Story" movement -- I love



13   that -- because he acknowledges what Mr. Stevenson told us.



14   Mr. Stevenson says from his experience as a trial lawyer,



15   trying these cases, that "The Story" is everything.  And



16   Dr. Hastie says, oh, yes, in terms of what I know about



17   cognitive psychology, "The Story" is everything.  And the



18   problem of "The Story" is that -- everybody's one is different



19   but different in ways that cut against each other.



20            Mr. Nichols, a father, stable family, he's got



21   children, working his way, he may be different from



22   Mr. McVeigh.  And so I put something on that talks about the



23   solidity of Mr. Nichols' character and what's good for him.



24   Mr. McVeigh's lawyer has got to attack it in just the way the



25   witnesses were saying.  They have got to try to turn it on its







                                                                 295







 1   head so that the characteristics that Mr. McVeigh has that



 2   Mr. Nichols doesn't share are good and, in the process, attack



 3   and undermine Mr. Nichols' positive -- what we'd say are



 4   positive characteristics in a way that the Government does not.



 5            There is this risk, as our people have said, of



 6   intertwining.  Your Honor, in Payne vs. Tennessee, the Supreme



 7   Court overruled Booth vs. Maryland and permitted victim impact



 8   evidence to be introduced.  It is a form of evidence



 9   particularly powerful, which is why it has always when



10   considered by the Supreme Court and led to these divisions and



11   all of these different opinions by concurring and dissenting



12   justices.



13            At 9:01 in the morning on the 19th of April, 1995,



14   your Honor, somebody got out of a Ryder truck and ignited a



15   fuse.  Whoever that was could see the people in that building



16   and see them going in and out.  The person who did that -- and



17   the witnesses said there were two people in that truck.  Let's



18   say the persons who did that are in a very, very different spot



19   when it comes not only to the guilt phase but to the emotional



20   pull of the testimony of victims in any penalty phase.  And for



21   that reason alone, your Honor, in addition to all the others,



22   we pray for severance.



23            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Tigar.



24            Mr. Connelly, you're going to argue this for the



25   Government?







                                                                 296







 1            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.  May it please the



 2   Court . . .



 3            THE COURT:  Yes.



 4                  PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON SEVERANCE



 5            MR. CONNELLY:  The decision whether this case should



 6   be tried one time or two rests in the Court's sound discretion.



 7   The legal standard is clear and, I believe, undisputed in light



 8   of today's arguments.



 9            There is a preference for joint trials.  The



10   preference may be overcome only if the defendants establish



11   that they would be compromised in a specific trial right or



12   that the jury would be prevented from making a reliable



13   determination of guilt or innocence and in this case



14   punishment, as well.



15            The defendants' only claimed specific trial right is



16   the Bruton claim.  The other claims, mutual antagonism,



17   spillover prejudice, all go to an argument that the jury cannot



18   reliably determine guilt or innocence and punishment if



19   necessary in a joined case.



20            Defendants' arguments all boil down -- both their



21   specific trial right argument and their spillover prejudice and



22   the antagonistic defenses argument -- to a single premise:



23   That juries cannot be trusted to follow this court's



24   instructions to consider each defendant individually based on



25   the evidence admissible as to that defendant.







                                                                 297







 1            We, in contrast, consistent with the teachings of the



 2   Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit, and the practices of federal



 3   courts, including this court, have more faith in our jury



 4   system.



 5            Before addressing the Bruton arguments and the other



 6   arguments, I'd like to address the benefits of a joint trial,



 7   because those benefits, as the Tenth Circuit teaches us, must



 8   be weighed against defendant's claims of prejudice.  That is,



 9   under Zafiro, it's necessary but not sufficient that the



10   defendants establish prejudice.



11            The benefits of a joint trial are manifold and all



12   apply with particular force in this case.  The Supreme Court



13   has explained that joint trials conserve funds, cut down on the



14   inconvenience and trauma to victims and witnesses, and also



15   promote speedy justice.



16            Each of those factors is particularly strong here.



17   The costs are extraordinary.  The number of witnesses is



18   tremendous.  The number of victims is unprecedented.  And of



19   course, two trials would substantially delay the final



20   resolution of this case.



21            More importantly, perhaps, than any of these



22   considerations is the burden that will be placed on the courts



23   and the parties in the extraordinary circumstances of this case



24   in holding a second trial after the first was already



25   completed.  It will be extraordinarily difficult even in the







                                                                 298







 1   first instance for this court to empanel and death qualify 64



 2   jurors as to twelve jurors who will actually sit, plus six



 3   alternates, plus 46 jurors that must be available for



 4   peremptory strikes and seat that jury that can fairly determine



 5   and impartially determine the guilt or innocence and



 6   appropriate punishment for a defendant.



 7            This burden will not just be doubled if court has to



 8   empanel another 64 jurors, but will also be multiplied in ways



 9   unknown because that second empanelment will have to take place



10   after the first jury has already heard -- all the evidence has



11   already been publicly disseminated and that first jury's



12   verdict, the evidence and the determination of punishment has



13   already been made known.  For that reason, we would conclude



14   counsel -- your Honor, is an additional factor in this



15   extraordinary case urging the Court that if it can be done --



16   and we believe it can fairly and consistently be done -- to



17   hold just one jury trial.



18            The second consideration, or actually about the fourth



19   or fifth consideration the Supreme Court cited in favor of



20   joint trials is that it avoids inconsistency of verdicts.  The



21   Supreme Court in Zafiro, Richardson and other cases has called



22   inconsistent verdicts scandalous.



23            THE COURT:  Well, what do you -- I don't understand



24   the inconsistent verdict argument.



25            MR. CONNELLY:  I think an example --







                                                                 299







 1            THE COURT:  You mean at a trial together, one person



 2   could be found not guilty and there can be differences among



 3   the counts?  I mean, both could be found not guilty, obviously,



 4   but I'm saying that the results of the jury's deliberation may



 5   be quite different with respect to two defendants because one



 6   of the things that we always say in a joint defendant trial is



 7   this is really two trials taking place at the same time.  You



 8   have to consider it that way.  Particularly I say that in the



 9   beginning where I know, as would be true here, that some of the



10   evidence would be admissible only against one of the accused.



11            MR. CONNELLY:  That is correct, your Honor, and the



12   Supreme Court in Buchanan vs. Kentucky, which is joint trial



13   involving a capital and noncapital defendant has said that that



14   jury in that trial has the broader perspective.  That sitting



15   together and hearing all the evidence come in and evaluating



16   the guilt and innocence and, indeed, in Buchanan the relative



17   culpability for sentencing purposes of those two defendants can



18   bring a more consistent verdict and a single perspective.



19            THE COURT:  But you wouldn't set aside a verdict as to



20   one defendant found guilty on a count because another defendant



21   was found not guilty on the same count?



22            MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely not, your Honor.



23            THE COURT:  Even if it's the conspiracy count.  As



24   Mr. Tigar has mentioned, the Supreme Court has said that's the



25   jury system.  Even though in a civil case, we would say it's







                                                                 300







 1   inconsistent verdicts.



 2            MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct.



 3            THE COURT:  In a criminal case, we don't.



 4            MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct.  There can be



 5   inconsistencies and irrationality even in a single case even as



 6   to a single defendant.  Those risks, the Supreme Court has



 7   taught, are increased when you bring two juries into the



 8   picture to make the same findings based on the same evidence.



 9   And it will be the same evidence, your Honor.  There's no doubt



10   about it because contrary to Nichols' argument here, this is a



11   single conspiracy.  A conspiracy is not one in which we've



12   charged stretched conspiracy laws like, for example, charging a



13   drug courier with a drug lord and the jury is going to sit



14   there and hear 95 percent of the case will pertain to the drug



15   lord and then in the end, they will say, oh, this courier also



16   got involved and drove from California and through Colorado



17   back east, trying to bring the drug lord's drugs back to



18   distribute in the east.



19            This is not a case where there will be any disconnect



20   between the evidence.  The evidence is unified.  And that's



21   made clear not just by our arguments in our brief and the



22   factual recitations set forth there, but by the face of the



23   indictment.



24            By no means, your Honor, are we asking this Court or



25   anyone else to assume that the indictment's allegations are







                                                                 301







 1   true.  It's a matter that we intend to prove to jury trial, but



 2   the proof will be unified.  If you look at the indictment every



 3   step of the way, McVeigh and Nichols, Nichols and McVeigh are



 4   alleged to have conducted a joint operation.



 5            The first overt act begins in September 1994 and most



 6   significantly back then when they acquired one ton of ammonium



 7   nitrate.  It's alleged that they did so jointly.  The proof



 8   will establish they did so jointly.  Whether or not the jury is



 9   convinced of that, that's something the defense can attack, but



10   the proof that will come in at trial.  The Government's theory



11   and Government's proof will show they acted jointly in that



12   regard.



13            The next significant act was the October 1994 burglary



14   of explosives.  Again, the Government's proof will establish



15   and the indictment alleges that was a joint act.



16            THE COURT:  Well, you've made it clear in your first



17   15 pages or so what you intend to prove.



18            MR. CONNELLY:  And again, I'm not -- we're not asking



19   the Court to accept that.



20            THE COURT:  No.  I -- yeah.  I -- but I mean, we have



21   to be somewhat careful about what is said here in open Court.



22            MR. CONNELLY:  I agree.  And I think just reading the



23   indictment, your Honor, makes clear that this is a unified



24   charge and a unified proof at trial will be a single conspiracy



25   and it will not be a case where 90 percent or anything like







                                                                 302







 1   that of the evidence applies to one defendant but not the



 2   other.  In fact, 95 percent of the evidence at the trial will



 3   apply to both.



 4            THE COURT:  All right.  We're coming to the part that



 5   obviously will not.  And that's Mr. Nichols' statements on



 6   April 21 and 22.



 7            MR. CONNELLY:  That is right.



 8            THE COURT:  Have you made a final decision that you're



 9   going to insist upon the use of those statements?



10            MR. CONNELLY:  We have, your Honor.  It's two core



11   points:  The April 16 statements that are partly true and



12   partly false will be offered both as to their truth and try to



13   prove their falsity, but the core point that Mr. Nichols



14   admitted to being in Oklahoma City with Mr. McVeigh and



15   admitted driving back to Kansas with Mr. McVeigh will be



16   offered.  A lot of the other extraneous statements around



17   that -- that trip and that meeting, we will demonstrably prove



18   will be false.



19            As to April 18, the only other part of the statement



20   mentioning McVeigh that we will insist on introducing at trial,



21   even as Mr. Nigh pointed out, upon pain of severance is the



22   statement that he loaned his truck to Mr. McVeigh on that date.



23   That will be offered virtually exclusively for its falsity.



24   That is an important piece of evidence that sets up the falsity



25   of many, many of his statements that Mr. Nichols made at that







                                                                 303







 1   time.  We would submit that that does not raise, by itself, a



 2   confrontation clause.  The real problem or the real issue is as



 3   to April 16.



 4            THE COURT:  Well, I have some trouble with your



 5   position on that and you've cited a number of cases, of course,



 6   that deal with the requirement for Bruton that the statement



 7   must be incriminatory of the co-defendant and we understand



 8   that to be true.  But what troubles me is that when you are



 9   admitting a statement which is on its face not incriminatory,



10   indeed exculpatory of the declarant, and then you're admitting



11   it for the purpose of then proving that it's false, the real



12   purpose of admitting that statement is to incriminate.



13            MR. CONNELLY:  Incriminate the declarant.



14            THE COURT:  Yes, but the statement necessarily



15   incriminates the co-defendant, as well, doesn't it?



16            MR. CONNELLY:  Not in the sense that confrontation is



17   required.  What incriminates the co-defendant is the



18   Government's proof of falsity, which the co-defendant has an



19   opportunity to cross-examine and confront.



20            THE COURT:  Well, except that there's no ability to



21   cross-examine the declarant on the statement that generates the



22   whole sequence of the later proof of falsity.  So it just seems



23   to me that when you say a false exculpatory statement is



24   nonincriminatory, I have trouble following that.



25            MR. CONNELLY:  Well, I think that's a teaching of the







                                                                 304







 1   Supreme Court in the Tenth Circuit.  I think also in Krohn with



 2   a similar --



 3            THE COURT:  Well, Krohn is quite a bit different.  All



 4   that is is a pitch by a salesman.  And I tried that case.



 5            MR. CONNELLY:  I understand, your Honor.  That's why I



 6   mentioned it to you.  I think the teaching, the general



 7   principle -- each case, obviously, is different on its facts.



 8   The principle is is there a need for the nondeclarant to



 9   confront that statement and if we were introducing a statement



10   by Mr. Nichols saying, for example, I did not see Mr. McVeigh



11   from April 16 until April 18, did not hear from him after I



12   dropped him off in the 16th until the 18th, our theory of that



13   is false.  Mr. McVeigh need not confront him on that and has no



14   right to confront him under the Sixth Amendment or under the



15   rules of evidence because that has not come in for its truth.



16   That is not exculpatory.  A lack of involvement on that day is



17   not incriminating.



18            THE COURT:  I take it -- and I mentioned this, as



19   you'll recall, with Mr. Thurschwell, I -- I take it that your



20   position is that the FBI agents testifying about these



21   statements are not subject to cross-examination by counsel for



22   Mr. McVeigh.



23            MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely.  I think that's made by



24   clear by the Constitution.  The Sixth Amendment gives that --



25   do you --







                                                                 305







 1            THE COURT:  No.  I understand that.



 2            MR. CONNELLY:  Okay.  Our --



 3            THE COURT:  I agree.



 4            MR. CONNELLY:  The Court was absolutely right.  I



 5   think the Sixth Amendment makes clear he has a right to



 6   confront a witness against him.  If the Court limits the



 7   instruction, the FBI agent is not a witness against



 8   Mr. McVeigh.



 9            THE COURT:  Now, can you suggest to me what the



10   limiting instruction would be here beyond the obvious that I've



11   already mentioned that I would say almost from the beginning



12   and, of course, repeat several times including before and after



13   these FBI agents testify that you may not consider this



14   evidence against Mr. McVeigh?  Would there be anything that you



15   would add to that?



16            MR. CONNELLY:  I think, certainly, the Court should



17   underscore it and say that it comes in as an admission of



18   Mr. Nichols and it's admissible under that theory.  As to



19   Mr. McVeigh, he has no right to confront him.  It's



20   presumptively unreliable as to Mr. McVeigh.  I think the Court



21   certainly can come up with as strong instruction as it deems --



22            THE COURT:  I'm just asking you what you would have me



23   say.



24            MR. CONNELLY:  I certainly at a minimum would have you



25   say what you've indicated you would say; that this evidence is







                                                                 306







 1   offered only against Mr. Nichols.  Mr. Nichols' only statement



 2   that comes in against him under Rules of Evidence because he



 3   said it.  But it has no presumptive reliability, no reliability



 4   at all.  Should be put out of your mind as to Mr. McVeigh.  The



 5   question then becomes under Bruton, is this the type of



 6   statement that a jury can be expected to put out of its mind



 7   and I think in that sense, we have to look clearly at Bruton.



 8   Bruton is admittedly a far different case than this case.



 9   There was a full-blown confession that linked -- and I think



10   it's important, given the fact that Mr. McVeigh concedes that



11   this case is different from Bruton, to read Richardson, which



12   said we're limiting Bruton to its precise facts and the precise



13   facts in Bruton and in Cruz vs. New York was a full blown



14   confession in which the outboard declarant, the co-defendant,



15   fully implicated the defendant in the crime connected.



16            There are many, many cases and Mr. Nigh has attempted



17   to distinguish each one of them and we would submit each one is



18   distinguishable on its facts because none of them involved a



19   trip to Oklahoma City on April 16 but beyond a particular



20   factual circumstances, the reasoning of each is the same.  In



21   the Jobe case, for example, Fifth circuit, a check kiting



22   prosecution.  The bank president said I didn't know anything



23   about the check.  It was handed to me by the teller and I



24   relied on him.  I later asked him what happened and he says I



25   don't know.  He gave me no answer.  That testimony came in and







                                                                 307







 1   was never retracted.  There was an additional statement in that



 2   case that was retracted and an even more incriminating



 3   statement, but that particular statement saying I relied on the



 4   teller and the teller assured me it was okay and never



 5   explained after I questioned him later, that clearly was blame



 6   shifting, that clearly was a core element of that check kiting



 7   prosecution.  The Fifth Circuit said that's not a full



 8   confession.  The rationale of Bruton does not apply.



 9            I think, again, the James case, Mr. Nigh talked about,



10   cited in our brief, Seventh Circuit, a co-defendant said the



11   defendant is a member of a Crips gang.  It didn't just stop



12   there.  It said members of the Crips gang dealing drugs.  This



13   was a drug trafficking prosecution against members of the Crips



14   gang.  Clearly, that is incriminating; more incriminating on



15   its face than the statement that I was in Oklahoma City with



16   Mr. McVeigh three days before the bombing, but the Seventh



17   Circuit held that it's not the type of facially devastating



18   confession that Bruton was meant to go to.



19            So I think, your Honor, if we accept the proposition



20   that Bruton applies to full blown confessions and we accept the



21   Supreme Court in Richardson that Bruton is limited to its



22   precise facts, that Bruton does not get them where they want to



23   go here.  There is no specific trial right that will be



24   compromised by admitting Mr. Nichols' statement about his own



25   conduct with Mr. McVeigh and limiting that to consideration







                                                                 308







 1   against the case against Mr. Nichols.  This is clearly one of



 2   the situations outside Bruton where the Supreme Court has



 3   adhered to the almost invariable assumption that jurors can



 4   follow their instructions.



 5            I think under the law, the facts are established.



 6   It's a facially nonincriminating statement.  Facially innocent,



 7   according to Mr. McVeigh's own characterization of it.  The



 8   question, therefore, is does Bruton apply to facially



 9   incriminating statements.  There is no case, none in the 25



10   plus years since Bruton was decided that holds that Bruton



11   applies to facially incriminating statements.  So this is the



12   case by their own admission that the defendants are asking this



13   Court to extend Bruton, extend Bruton in a way the Supreme



14   Court has never extended it and has refused to extend it.  And



15   extend it in a way inconsistent with numerous, numerous



16   decisions of federal courts of appeals.



17            THE COURT:  I don't know of a case, though, that has



18   this point which is -- and it's my understanding of your



19   position that this is so -- that the statements is -- the



20   statements some of them are facially nonincriminating, but you



21   are going to say to the jury that they are incriminating



22   because of what the declarant knows about the co-defendant.



23            MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely, your Honor.  And we will



24   have --



25            THE COURT:  Isn't that like almost suggesting to the







                                                                 309







 1   jury that the co-defendant is making an admission of guilt, the



 2   declarant is make an admission of guilt of the co-defendant?



 3            MR. CONNELLY:  No, your Honor.  And let me try to



 4   explain why in our view it's not.



 5            THE COURT:  All right.



 6            MR. CONNELLY:  That proposition depends on us proving



 7   that, in fact, the co-defendant, Mr. McVeigh, was involved in



 8   the bombing.  We have to prove that with independent evidence.



 9   Taking Nichols' statement on its face alone gets us nowhere.



10            THE COURT:  I understand that.



11            MR. CONNELLY:  So the question is can we prove with



12   independent evidence that Mr. McVeigh was linked to the bombing



13   and was, in fact, the bomber.



14            THE COURT:  But the end -- excuse me for the



15   interruption, but the end result is that in closing argument,



16   you would be saying to the jury what was in the declarant's



17   mind?



18            MR. CONNELLY:  Well, I think that would be a second



19   step, your Honor.  I think that's a key point is that the first



20   step is proof.  Look at all this proof, ladies and gentlemen of



21   the jury, that Mr. McVeigh was the bomber.  And only if we



22   establish that proposition does Mr. Nichols' statement become



23   relevant.  If we don't establish that proposition with



24   independent evidence, then Mr. Nichols' statement drops out.



25            THE COURT:  Do we tell the jury that?







                                                                 310







 1            MR. CONNELLY:  Well, I think that's something that



 2   would clearly understand for themselves in terms of logical



 3   decision-making.



 4            THE COURT:  Is that a part of the limiting



 5   instruction?



 6            MR. CONNELLY:  It could be.  I think it's certainly



 7   going to be obvious from the arguments that Mr. Nichols'



 8   statement really has no significance as to him unless we can



 9   independently prove that Mr. McVeigh was the bomber and I think



10   that's very different from a Bruton situation where the



11   co-defendant says he did it.  On its face by itself, that is



12   probative evidence and that is evidence not just probative but



13   devastating because a jury can rely on that alone and decide



14   based on that alone if they disregard the limiting instruction



15   that the co-defendant is guilty.



16            That's not going to happen here.  There is no risk of



17   that happening here.  The case against Mr. McVeigh will rise or



18   fall on the Government being able to prove what he did by



19   independent proof, documentary, testimonial and otherwise, on



20   April 14, April 15, April 16 as well, April 17, April 18 and



21   19.  The fact of the matter is, that putting Mr. McVeigh in



22   Oklahoma City in April 16 is far less important and is not



23   important at all in light of the fact that he was in Oklahoma



24   80 minutes; after the bombing roughly 80 miles north of



25   Oklahoma City on the day of the bombing.  That is far more







                                                                 311







 1   powerful and that fact is undisputed and more undisputable than



 2   anything that may have happened earlier, so I think that the



 3   Bruton -- I don't think it's by any means a technical argument



 4   we're making.  I think it's an argument that's consistent,



 5   fully consistent with the rationale of Bruton, that being is



 6   this a type of statement that the jury may be tempted to rely



 7   on exclusive of the other proof and despite the Court's



 8   limiting instructions and despite the Court saying don't



 9   consider this declarant to be a witness against the



10   co-defendant, the jury can't be trusted for that.  It's just



11   too great a risk that the jury will say we can't put out of our



12   mind that the co-defendant charged or admitted that the



13   defendant did the bombing or did the crime.  This is not that



14   case.  Logically, the analysis will be at the tail end.  The



15   statement will come into the jury's deliberations if they act



16   logically and they are presumed to do so, your Honor, and there



17   is no reason to think they would do otherwise.  After



18   concluding that Mr. McVeigh was the bomber, then what did



19   Mr. Nichols' admissions about his actions with and how does



20   that affect the case against Mr. Nichols.  Not against



21   Mr. McVeigh.  So we would urge the Court to apply the rationale



22   of Bruton, to restrict it in the manner the Supreme Court has



23   indicated it should be restricted and to reject the defense



24   attempt to extend it to a factual scenario that's never been



25   extended to and that there's no logical reason to do so.







                                                                 312







 1            The -- I'll certainly happy to address any other



 2   questions the Court has on Bruton.



 3            THE COURT:  You may move on.  Thank you.



 4            MR. CONNELLY:  The second claim for guilt phase



 5   severance is that there will be mutually antagonistic defenses.



 6   This was precisely the claim the Supreme Court rejected in



 7   Zafiro.  There was finger pointing among defendants in that



 8   case.  Indeed, far more finger pointing than would possibly



 9   exist in this case.  There, there were four defendants.  Two of



10   them, Garcia and Soto, were delivering a box of drugs over to



11   defendant Zafiro's apartment.  They were caught with the drugs.



12   What did they do?  They finger pointed each other.  Zafiro



13   said it was -- Garcia said it was Soto's box of drugs.  Soto



14   said it was Garcia's drugs.  It didn't stop there, your Honor,



15   because Zafiro shared the apartment with the boyfriend and they



16   were charged, as well.  They pointed a finger at each other, so



17   there was finger pointing to go around, double the amount that



18   could possibly happen here.



19            The Supreme Court held that mutually antagonistic



20   defense are not a per se ground for severance and that the



21   Court properly declined to sever the cases there.



22            There is, your Honor, no specific trial right in the



23   words of Zafiro to be free of a trial where there's finger



24   pointing back.  The defendants would like to be able to point



25   the finger at the other defendant who is not sitting in that







                                                                 313







 1   chair, not sitting at that table and not have to worry about it



 2   being pointed back.  The courts have recognized that the



 3   fairest way to determine guilt or innocence is to have it all



 4   out in a single trial in which they will introduce competent



 5   evidence and all the evidence that they have to introduce of



 6   finger pointing must be competent evidence and any evidence



 7   that indicates guilt or innocence of these defendants will



 8   surely be presented by the Government in its case in chief



 9   against each of these defendants.



10            So Zafiro says there's no specific trial right to be



11   free of finger pointing.  There is no case in the three-plus



12   years after Zafiro in which courts have required severance on



13   this ground.  And in fact, the courts after Zafiro have



14   questioned whether this remains a valid ground for severance.



15   Let's assume even that it does.



16            The only case in the Tenth Circuit prior to Zafiro



17   which upheld this kind of ground as a basis for severance and



18   indeed compelled severance on it found the defenses were



19   mutually exclusive.  The defendants have not even come close to



20   arguing that their defenses are mutually exclusive.  On the



21   contrary, it is in Nichols' clear interest to prove or to



22   attack the Government's case against Mr. McVeigh because if



23   Mr. McVeigh is not proven to be bomber, then Mr. Nichols cannot



24   be guilty of aiding and abetting him.



25            So not only is there no -- not only need they not must







                                                                 314







 1   attack the other defendant, there's no reason -- logical reason



 2   why they should.



 3            The next ground for severance is spillover prejudice.



 4   This, again, is a ground that has been repeatedly rejected by



 5   the courts.  Rejected by the Tenth Circuit in Lane, rejected by



 6   this Court, obviously, in the Lane case.  Case after case



 7   rejects spillover prejudices as a basis for severance.  This



 8   clearly is an instance in which limiting instructions can be



 9   trusted to protect the other defendant's trial rights.



10            But in this case and I would submit even more so than



11   in Lane, there is not going to be a whole lot of evidence,



12   apart from the statement of Terry Nichols, that will come in



13   against only one defendant.



14            The two prime examples that Mr. Tigar gave -- and they



15   are consistent with the examples he gave in the brief -- are



16   motive evidence and evidence of co-conspirator statements.



17   Motive evidence, I'm not going to get into what particularly



18   motive evidence is, but evidence suggesting that Mr. McVeigh



19   had a motive to commit the bombing can clearly come in against



20   Mr. Nichols, as well.



21            There are two issues to be resolved in that instance.



22   Mr. McVeigh made a statement, for example, expressing outrage



23   at the Federal Government and expressing his state of mind



24   towards the Federal Government.  That statement is not hearsay



25   because it's not offered for its truth and we cite one







                                                                 315







 1   particular statement that they focus on most heavily in their



 2   briefs.  That statement will clearly not be offered for its



 3   truth of the matter, but, rather, just to show that Mr. McVeigh



 4   thought it was so and that because of that, Mr. McVeigh had a



 5   motive to carry out of the bombing.  So there is no hearsay



 6   objection even when it's introduced as to Mr. Nichols.



 7            The relevancy objection is also without merit because



 8   any evidence tending to make it more likely that Mr. McVeigh



 9   committed the bombing is relevant because Mr. Nichols is



10   charged not only with conspiring with him, but also with having



11   aided and abetted him, so the motive evidence, your Honor,



12   whether it be motive evidence pertaining to Mr. McVeigh or



13   motive evidence pertaining to Mr. Nichols, which, by the way,



14   is very similar in kind, will come in against both defendants



15   because it tends to prove conspiracy, tends to prove the state



16   of mind the day of the conspiracy and also tends to support the



17   aiding and abetting charge.



18            The second claim is that co-conspirator statements of



19   Mr. McVeigh -- Mr. McVeigh made a co-conspirator statement.



20   That evidence clearly comes in against Mr. Nichols, as well.



21   Clearly 801(d)(2)(e) and Mr. Tigar, for the first time, I



22   believe -- I didn't notice it in the brief -- made an 806



23   argument that he'll be able to attack Mr. McVeigh if that comes



24   in.  Well, that's true of every case.  Every conspiracy case.



25   The co-conspirator can attack the credibility of the person who







                                                                 316







 1   made the statement.  And in every case, the co-conspirator



 2   statements do come in and the defendant can attack it, but



 3   that's really just a rehash of the mutual antagonism claim.



 4   I'll be able to finger point at the co-defendant and he will,



 5   but that's not a ground for severance, certainly after Zafiro



 6   and it's not a ground upon which this Court should exercise its



 7   discretion to cure spillover prejudice.



 8            There's also been an argument made in the brief about



 9   a lot of Mr. McVeigh's co-conspiracy statements.



10   Co-conspirator statements will not come in against me because



11   there's evidence I withdrew.  We discussed that evidence in the



12   brief and we would submit based solely on public information,



13   that that argument is without merit.  By his own admission in



14   terms of the acts he undertook with and on behalf of



15   Mr. McVeigh during that final fatal and fateful week, there



16   will be ample ground upon which this Court can make the



17   preliminary finding required by % Borrgelais that this is a



18   preponderance of the evidence that the conspiracy existed and



19   that both remained a member of it.  So every co-conspirator



20   statement made by Mr. McVeigh will be equally admissible



21   against Mr. Nichols and that will be so whether this case is



22   one trial or two.



23            That brings me, your Honor, to the death is different



24   arguments and the death is different arguments are raised in



25   connection with both phases of this trial.  It's raised in







                                                                 317







 1   connection with an argument that this Court should differently



 2   evaluate the guilt phase of the trial because death is



 3   different.  It's also made in connection with an argument that



 4   the penalty phase cannot fairly be conducted on a joint basis.



 5            With respect to the guilt phase, there is no basis, we



 6   would submit, for adopting a special rule or special standards



 7   for severance.  The issues are the same.  Under Zafiro, will



 8   these defendants be denied any specific trial right or will a



 9   jury be prevented from making a reliable judgment of guilt or



10   innocence.  For reasons we've argued, we don't believe that



11   standard has been made met.  There is no basis, contrary to the



12   suggestions in the brief of Mr. Nichols, for holding that joint



13   trials in guilt phases in capital cases or presumptively to say



14   that the Government has a burden of proof proving by clear and



15   convincing evidence brought out that it will be fair.  The same



16   presumption in favor of fairness exists.  That's made clear



17   again by Buchanan vs. Kentucky, which is a joint trial of a



18   capital and a noncapital defendant in which the Supreme Court



19   cited the exact same standard and said that a joint trial



20   allows a jury to more get that broader perspective from which



21   it may more reliably arrive at a guilt or innocence



22   determination and may more reliably assess the relative



23   culpability of these two defendants in a sentencing phase.



24            THE COURT:  How do you see the sentencing phase here



25   in terms of the sequence?  That you would present aggravating







                                                                 318







 1   factor evidence against both at the same time?



 2            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.  I think that's true.  Virtually



 3   all.  I don't want to say all, but, certainly, most of the



 4   aggravating evidence in that case will be --



 5            THE COURT:  You don't intend to separate?



 6            MR. CONNELLY:  That's within the Court's sound



 7   discretion.



 8            THE COURT:  No.  I'm talking about your intention.



 9   That the aggravating circumstances -- the aggravating factors



10   are identified as the same in both notices of intention to



11   proceed with the death penalty.  And so your presentation at



12   the death penalty phase were both defendants to be convicted of



13   one or more of the counts that make them eligible, you would



14   put on just as you would at the guilt phase evidence concerning



15   both at the same time?



16            MR. CONNELLY:  That would be our proposal, your Honor.



17   We think there's no reason it couldn't be done that and, in



18   fact, shouldn't be done that way.  Obviously, the Court has



19   discretion in structuring the guilt phase.  In the Tipton, for



20   example, case recently affirmed by the Fourth Circuit.  The



21   Court did it in that fashion.  Did it in a joint fashion and



22   gave clear and consistent instructions to individualize.  The



23   Fourth Circuit said not only do we presume as a matter of law



24   that the jurors follow those instructions, but were fortified



25   in that instruction, even though in that case, there were three







                                                                 319







 1   for three death verdicts.  The Court of Appeals went out of its



 2   way to say we're fortified in our normal presumption that



 3   jurors follow their instructions by the care and



 4   individualization that they gave in determining each of the



 5   verdicts.  One of the defendants, for example, was charged with



 6   seven capital counts and the jury returned a death verdict on



 7   only two or three and so the Court, even though that contrary



 8   to -- virtually contrary to every other of the state's joint



 9   capital prosecutions returned all death verdicts.  The Court of



10   Appeals went out of its way, the Fourth Circuit, to note that



11   it give individualized consideration.



12            A different model would be the McCullough model where



13   judges say -- the only experience, I think, in the Federal



14   Court in this circuit of an in seriatim penalty phase and in



15   that case, the results were that one out of the three



16   defendants received a death sentence which was later overturned



17   for reasons unrelated by the Tenth Circuit.  So there are two



18   models.



19            We would propose in this case, given the fact that the



20   aggravating circumstances are so similar, it -- as charged are



21   identical, that there be a single penalty phase.



22            THE COURT:  Now, one of the things that troubles me --



23   and I guess it isn't necessary here, but you're down to twelve



24   jurors by that time.



25            MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct.







                                                                 320







 1            THE COURT:  And the length of the penalty phase case



 2   and being able to have a jury for a verdict is -- you've got



 3   twelve people.



 4            MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct.  And that is a --



 5            THE COURT:  I mean, I don't know how you keep any



 6   alternates around for a penalty phase.



 7            MR. CONNELLY:  I don't know that you can after the



 8   twelve have --



 9            THE COURT:  So you're at the risk and the length of



10   the penalty phase is relevant to that.



11            MR. CONNELLY:  Obviously relevant and it's a fact to



12   consider, but it's a factor that bears on severance.  We would



13   submit that factor is going to be the same whether it's one



14   trial or two.



15            THE COURT:  Well, not really because the mitigating



16   evidence would be twice longer with two defendants than one.



17            MR. CONNELLY:  True.  The aggravating would be --



18   would be virtually identical.  The mitigating would be longer.



19   I'm not sure how long a mitigating case they would intend to



20   put on.  But I mean, that is a risk -- I think the length of



21   the penalty phase hearing will be dwarfed by the length of the



22   trial, so I think that's a lesser risk than if you had to go



23   through a trial, for example, with twelve jurors.  I think even



24   if the penalty phase goes longer than expected, it will not be



25   as long as the trial itself.  Sure, that is a risk.  I would







                                                                 321







 1   say that's not a risk that counsel in favor of severance face;



 2   it's a risk that six federal courts have dealt with.



 3            THE COURT:  They have been lucky on it.  The jurors



 4   were still there.



 5            MR. CONNELLY:  We would submit, your Honor, that that



 6   certainly is a concern, but it's one that does not justify



 7   severance and -- and if it -- if it did happen, then we'd have



 8   to have a new penalty phase, but that can happen any time



 9   anyway.



10            THE COURT:  Yes.



11            MR. CONNELLY:  And we don't think that that is a



12   ground -- certainly, it's -- it's a valid consideration, but I



13   think it's outweighed by all the considerations strongly



14   favoring a joint trial and also a joint sentencing proceeding.



15            As to the argument that a jury can't be fair and that,



16   really, is, your Honor, making an argument for them that I



17   think has not -- they have not thought of and I'm -- but as to



18   the arguments that they -- these defendants have made really



19   focused on fairness.  And in terms of severance, the standard



20   Rule 14 is prejudicial joinder and the question is have they



21   shown prejudice.  We would submit that they have not shown --



22   in fact, quite the contrary -- any prejudice that would be



23   suffered from having to undergo a joint penalty phase



24   proceeding.



25            And in this regard, we think that the best evidence in







                                                                 322







 1   the first place to look is the track record of federal courts



 2   that have handled these proceedings.  We laid that out in our



 3   exhibits that there have been six in the last five years.  Six



 4   joint federal penalty phase proceedings.  In those six cases, a



 5   total of fifteen defendants have gone through those penalty



 6   phase proceedings.  Six of those fifteen defendant have been



 7   sentenced to death.  40 percent.  If you look at the -- in that



 8   same time period of five years, eight individual defendants



 9   have gone to individual penalty phase proceedings.  Five of



10   those eight defendants have been sentenced to death.  More than



11   60 percent.  These statistics rebut any notion that came in



12   through social science testimony or guesswork by defense



13   lawyers that defendants are likely to fare worse in a joint



14   proceeding than they would in a individual proceeding.  These



15   statistics, we believe, are most relevant in federal courts but



16   also in the other states we've surveyed.



17            You heard testimony from District Attorney Bob Grant



18   talk about the Colorado experience.  Limited though it may be



19   in terms of joint proceedings, there have been two.  None of



20   those four defendants were sentenced to death.  Obviously, a



21   lesser percentage of death verdicts in those cases than in the



22   individual cases in Colorado.



23            The same testimony came in through Dean Coats.



24   Oklahoma experience shows no indication that defendants are



25   likely to fair worse in joint proceeding than in individual







                                                                 323







 1   proceedings.



 2            And so, too, in Government Exhibit 14, the affidavit



 3   of a senior assistant attorney general in the state of



 4   California, results of that state likewise confirm the federal



 5   experience.  That jurors are no worse off in terms of the



 6   results, in terms of the track record being tried jointly than



 7   they are individually.



 8            The United States seeks a single trial and a single



 9   penalty proceeding, not because of any strategic advantage that



10   it will gain by either of those, but, rather, because of all



11   the considerations Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit, Federal



12   Courts of Appeals have cited as favoring joint trials.  We,



13   therefore, ask this Court to deny the severance motion and set



14   this case down for a single trial and a single penalty phase



15   proceeding in that case if that becomes necessary.  Thank you,



16   your Honor.



17            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Connelly.  I think if you



18   have rebuttal argument, I presume --



19            MR. JONES:  May we have just a moment, your Honor?



20            MR. TIGAR:  Three minutes, your Honor, if the Court



21   please.



22            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll --



23            MR. TIGAR:  I want to wait until -- to give those



24   folks a chance.



25            THE COURT:  Yes.







                                                                 324







 1            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, the Court indicated by its



 2   questioning Mr. Connelly that it is familiar with the concern



 3   that I would address in a rebuttal and so I see no reason since



 4   the Court is already familiar with it to argue it.



 5            THE COURT:  All right.  Then Mr. Tigar.



 6           DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON SEVERANCE MOTION



 7            MR. TIGAR:  Three minutes.  Mr. Connelly's argument,



 8   if the Court please, illustrates the problem.  Bruton, of



 9   course, is rooted in the Sixth Amendment, but Bruton doesn't



10   exhaust the rights available under Rule 14.  Mr. Connelly



11   proposes that if a declaration comes in from Mr. Nichols that



12   the problem of prejudice to Mr. McVeigh is cured by an



13   instruction that the declaration is presumptively unreliable as



14   to Mr. McVeigh.  Similarly, Mr. Connelly proposes that when



15   Mr. McVeigh's hearsay comes in or his nonhearsay, i.e.



16   statements that are -- of advocacy that the jury be told, oh,



17   they are not being admitted for their truth and, therefore,



18   Mr. Nichols is not prejudiced by not being able to cross-



19   examine, well, a more direct way of -- of branding each



20   defendant in turn as a liar does not occur to me.  And thus,



21   the -- what we have here, given the amount of out-of-court



22   statements, the sheer volume of them upon which the Government



23   wishes to rely is the kind of mechanical repetition of limiting



24   instructions which in the ordinary case might -- although I



25   doubt it -- do the job, but in a death case, in which







                                                                 325







 1   inevitably the character door is opened at a penalty phase is



 2   just unacceptable.



 3            See, in the ordinary case, the jurors are instructed



 4   that they can't make inferences from any of the evidence to a



 5   kind of bad person theory.  But in a death case, where the



 6   doors are wide open for evidence of character, good and bad



 7   about all sorts of things, those sorts of instructions, it



 8   strike us, are -- are particularly troublesome.  And that is,



 9   of course, the -- what under 806 makes this case different.  I



10   grant that the Bourjaily standard boujaily can be done.  Maybe



11   we call it Bourjaily nouveau because this is a new case, a new



12   issue, but in a conspiracy case where there could be joint



13   penalty phases, the inevitable carryover of the 806 attacks



14   into the penalty phase cannot be avoided.



15            And the final point of course, is that Judge Shea's



16   experience in McCullough is not the only district court in the



17   Tenth Circuit to have considered joinder in a capital case.



18   There is the New Mexico Gonzales case in which Dr. -- to which



19   Dr. Bronson referred.  Thank you.



20            THE COURT:  On the time for filing on -- in response



21   to the Government's statement of facts or that isn't right?



22   The statement of evidence it intends to use, you asked for some



23   time to respond.



24            MR. TIGAR:  I had asked for ten pages in seven days.



25   I asked for it on Tuesday, the 1st.  That would be Tuesday, the







                                                                 326







 1   8th at 5:00.  If that's acceptable with the Court.



 2            THE COURT:  Yes, it is.



 3            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you.



 4            THE COURT:  And I don't know if you wish, Mr. Nigh, to



 5   have similar opportunity.



 6            MR. NIGH:  Your Honor, we filed in our reply brief



 7   that we filed this past --



 8            THE COURT:  Everything.



 9            MR. NIGH:  -- Monday, a statement concerning the same



10   matters.



11            THE COURT:  Yeah.



12            MR. NIGH:  So I don't believe a supplement is



13   necessary.



14            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, the motions will stand



15   submitted then upon Tuesday and the filing of this additional



16   material.  We'll recess and then at the return from the recess,



17   we should have Mr. Kelley by then and deal with the media



18   motions and proceed then in accordance with the schedule that I



19   already provided to counsel.  Recess 20 minutes.



20            (Recess at 10:49 a.m.)



21       (Reconvened at 11:10 a.m.)



22            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.



23            Before calling up the motions regarding unsealing of



24   the sealed materials on the severance motion, is Mr. Kelley



25   here?







                                                                 327







 1            MR. KELLEY:  Yes.



 2            THE COURT:  Yes.  There you are.  Thank you.



 3            I have something I want to announce.  It was brought



 4   to my attention during this recess that a newspaper, The Denver 



 5   Post, today has on page -- I guess it's 3A -- under a line "By



 6   the Numbers in Courtroom," the following statement:  "A new



 7   order has been established in Judge Richard Matsch's recently



 8   reconfigured courtroom:  More space, less fuss.  The number of



 9   lawyers allowed for the defense and prosecution:  For suspect



10   Timothy McVeigh, four; for Co-defendant Terry Nichols, four,



11   and for the Government, seven."



12            I have no idea of the source of this report.  It is



13   false in its entirety.  No such rule has been adopted by Judge



14   Richard Matsch for a reconfigured courtroom or anywhere else,



15   and no such rule will be imposed until the matter is addressed



16   with counsel.



17            It's not my practice in this or any other case to



18   start putting limitations on lawyers and their ability



19   effectively to represent their respective parties without



20   giving them an opportunity to address it.



21            So, as I say again, I don't know where some of these



22   things come from; but that is false.



23            It was also brought to my attention by my own staff



24   people that there have been references to the Lane case, United 



25   States against Lane and three other defendants tried in this







                                                                 328







 1   court, wherein it has been represented that all of the



 2   defendants were found guilty, which is contrary to the fact.



 3   Two defendants were acquitted by a jury in a joint trial.



 4            Well, I'm not going to go ahead with an editorial, but



 5   I just want to set the record straight.



 6            Now, Mr. Kelley, you represent the media.



 7            MR. KELLEY:  I've never come in here with a great



 8   feeling of comfort, your Honor.



 9            THE COURT:  Well, I'm not attributing any of this to



10   you or your clients.



11            MR. KELLEY:  Nor was I the source.



12            THE COURT:  Yeah.



13            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, as I understand it, we're



14   here on objections to the provisional sealing of the severance



15   documents.



16            THE COURT:  Yes.  It's been identified as motions; but



17   really it's consistent with the practice that I established in



18   the memorandum opinion and order on sealing that the -- anybody



19   has the opportunity to object to the sealing; and we're under



20   that framework.



21            MR. KELLEY:  Mr. Watler for The Dallas Morning News is



22   not going to be here, has asked, your Honor, to consider his



23   objections and will stand on my arguments.



24            THE COURT:  Yes.



25     MEDIA'S ARGUMENT RE UNSEALING OF SEVERANCE MOTION MATERIALS







                                                                 329







 1            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, on January 24, you issued an



 2   order stating that five questions would be addressed whenever a



 3   party seeks to seal any court record.  I'm not going to read



 4   those back to you.  I think it's presumptuous to read to a



 5   judge his own words.  I won't do it.



 6            I want to focus my arguments first on Questions 1 and



 7   2, which focus on the stage of the proceedings involved when



 8   someone seeks to seal a document and inquires whether it's a



 9   stage in which by tradition and experience the public has been



10   permitted to observe; and secondly on the structural question,



11   and that is whether public observation contributes to the



12   functioning of the process, accountability and public



13   confidence.



14            What we're dealing with here is a little hard to



15   characterize.  It's motions to sever, arguments in support of



16   them, some of which have been excised when they deal with



17   factual matters or anticipated contentions of the parties and



18   appendices, which I presume provide factual support for those



19   things; and some of those items are discovered materials.



20            Whether we call these pleadings or evidence, your



21   Honor, I submit that they constitute material that the parties



22   want the Court to consider in deciding this motion.  And this



23   appears to me, although I have not attended the entire



24   proceeding, that this is the equivalent of evidence for the



25   Court's consideration, even though it's not offered in open







                                                                 330







 1   court.



 2            Regarding the significance of this stage of the



 3   proceedings, I found no case in which anyone has sought to



 4   close any part of a severance proceeding.  Counsel may have



 5   better electronic equipment than I, but I was unable to find



 6   any.



 7            We have proffered in our objections the analogy to



 8   this proceeding and a suppression hearing, which I think the



 9   Court in Waller and Press Enterprise made clear is a critical



10   stage proceeding that's sufficiently involved in the outcome to



11   invoke the highest First Amendment scrutiny before there can be



12   closure or sealing.



13            Now, the reason I think suppression is analogous is



14   although it deals with evidence, it's more or less a quasi



15   procedural question.  The severance hearing likewise is a



16   trial-shaping proceeding.  And I think we have seen that this



17   proceeding really dovetails from the suppression proceedings.



18   One of the focuses of these proceedings is the effect of the



19   Nichols' statement, April 21 and 22, and its effect in joint or



20   separate trials.



21            Why is the proceeding important in terms of structure?



22   The public is asking -- and I think it's obvious the public is



23   asking.  Some members of the public are asking, Why can't we do



24   this in just one shot?  Why do the witnesses, why do the



25   victims have to go through it twice?  That doesn't -- isn't







                                                                 331







 1   justice best rendered more swiftly than that and more



 2   economically than that?



 3            Others are asking, Why is it fair to try two



 4   defendants together when their cases are so divergent?  Is



 5   economy and appearances what's most important in the system



 6   rhetorically?



 7            I say those questions are as important as why the



 8   Court can or cannot admit this or that evidence at trial in



 9   terms of both structural significance, public confidence in the



10   system, and so forth.



11            Thus, we ask you to apply to what is requested to be



12   excluded from public view the Press Enterprise standard, which



13   requires proof of substantial probability with interference



14   with a higher value than public access and inability to achieve



15   that result through alternative means.



16            Here, the interest asserted -- and I believe those are



17   what your Questions 3, 4 and 5 essentially cover in the



18   January 24 ruling.  Here the interest asserted is trial



19   fairness.  To my observation, the Court's concern so far has



20   been the prospect of inadmissibility of evidence at trial,



21   detailed disclosures of evidence the jury may never hear.  And



22   that was the problem over Exhibit 72 at the suppression



23   hearing.



24            Here, with the exception of the continuing problem of



25   the Nichols' statement, as reflected in Exhibit 72 or







                                                                 332







 1   otherwise, is not inadmissibility at trial.  The problem is



 2   that the evidence is going to be admissible at trial.  That's



 3   what really everyone is asserting:  This evidence is going to



 4   come in, so we've got these problems with trying the case



 5   together.



 6            We're really just talking about evidence that is



 7   likely to be heard and publicized in the first trial and then



 8   the second trial, if there are two.



 9            I submit -- and I'll discuss this a little bit more



10   before I sit down -- that the discussion of evidence that is



11   not likely to be excluded at trial does not meet the Press 



12   Enterprise test.



13            I'd like to digress for just a second.  As I



14   understand it, your Honor has made no ruling on public access



15   to Exhibit 72 that was offered at the suppression hearings, and



16   I'm speculating that your Honor is withholding that ruling



17   until we see if we're going to have one or two trials and



18   whether it's going to be admitted, at least presumptively.



19            I would respectfully request a clarification of where



20   we stand on public access --



21            THE COURT:  Is that the 302 or the combination of



22   302's about Mr. Nichols?



23            MR. KELLEY:  It's the draft 302 that had the colored



24   highlighting.



25            THE COURT:  Yeah.







                                                                 333







 1            MR. KELLEY:  And just for our record, we'd just



 2   appreciate a clarification of where we stand on that.



 3            In the motions that have been presented by the parties



 4   in opposition to disclosure of this material, several



 5   contentions have been made.  One is that it is discovery



 6   material.  This Court has adopted a procedure where discovery



 7   material is considered presumptively problematic and



 8   provisionally filed under seal.



 9            Nonetheless, the issue of public access to material



10   submitted in support of a party's position doesn't depend on



11   where it came from.  That information has to be tested not by



12   whether it's discovery material but under the Press Enterprise



13   test, I submit.  When it's simply discovery material and



14   nothing more, it's been held that there is no right of access



15   to it.



16            When a party takes that information, just like any



17   other information, and submits it to the Court, seeking a



18   critical-stage determination, then it has to be treated as



19   court material, not discovery material.



20            The argument is made that by excluding just this



21   material that has been submitted under seal, the public still



22   gets what it needs to know to basically understand these



23   proceedings.  I submit that reflects a basic misconception of



24   how the First Amendment freedom of information system works.



25   It should not be subject to an ad hoc determination of what the







                                                                 334







 1   public needs to know.  That's for the public to decide.



 2            It's enough that under Press Enterprise we have a



 3   critical stage, we have information that the parties file and



 4   insist be part of the record and information that the Court has



 5   not stricken nor declared to be irrelevant or not part of the



 6   determination.  With that, the test is Press Enterprises, not



 7   some need-to-know formulation.



 8            Finally, it's contended that the public, including



 9   potential jurors, should not be permitted to hear the facts or



10   contentions not already known before the trial begins, even if



11   they're going to hear it anyway, which I submit is true of most



12   of what we're dealing with here.



13            That again in my view reflects a misconception.  It's



14   not the test under Press Enterprises II.  That was a celebrated



15   case involving multiple homicides in a hospital with lidocaine.



16   In the proceeding involved, the preliminary hearing, it was



17   essentially disclosure of the evidence that the prosecution



18   thought would establish guilt, as normally happens in



19   preliminary hearings.  And I know that preliminary hearings are



20   generally unknown to the federal system; but nonetheless, the



21   U.S. Supreme Court in that case dealt with a preliminary



22   hearing process.



23            The same test has been applied to a variety of things,



24   including bail reduction, change of venue, extradition, all



25   within the federal system.  And these are all proceedings, your







                                                                 335







 1   Honor, where the facts, whether known or unknown previously,



 2   come out.  They are adjudications that are important to shaping



 3   the trial, as this one is.  Nonetheless, the Press Enterprise



 4   standard is applied.



 5            The kind of information that would support a closure



 6   under that standard is information that creates so much



 7   prejudice that jurors can't possibly be expected to set it



 8   aside.



 9            Given what's already known about this case, it's hard



10   to imagine any evidence that is going to be heard at trial



11   anyway that if disclosed now before the first trial, if there



12   are two, or before the trial is going to create a substantial



13   probability of interference with fair trial rights.



14            Now, what we're asking this Court to do is to not take



15   the easy road, which is simply to keep everything not already



16   in public view out of public view and apply the Press 



17   Enterprise standard to all that has been sought to be sealed.



18            I recognize I've come in here on more than one



19   occasion and asked the Court to do something that involves a



20   lot of work, but we submit, your Honor, that that's what's



21   called for to protect the public rights to observe these



22   proceedings.



23            Does the Court have any questions?



24            THE COURT:  No, thank you.



25            I do have a question of the other parties, or the







                                                                 336







 1   parties, and that I don't think it's necessary for each of you



 2   to state your position unless it's different from the



 3   submission of this material under seal, because the material



 4   was submitted under seal and I presume done by counsel with the



 5   Court's memorandum opinion and order in mind and that it is the



 6   position of counsel for the Government and the defendants that



 7   those sealings were appropriate.



 8            MR. HARTZLER:  If I may go first?



 9            THE COURT:  You may.



10   PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT RE UNSEALING OF SEVERANCE MOTION MATERIALS



11            MR. HARTZLER:  That is largely correct.  Our



12   submission in the severance brief was overbroad.  Out of an



13   incredible abundance of caution, we excised virtually all the



14   facts from our brief; and if we were asked, I'm sure we could



15   go back and figure out what's in the public record and what's



16   not; but we thought that was probably -- would take more time



17   than it was worth.



18            But with that minor caveat, we are in accord with the



19   positions taken.



20            THE COURT:  Yes.  So what I understand you to just --



21   have just said is that some of what you sealed is in the record



22   publicly already.



23            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes.



24            THE COURT:  Yes.  And that may be some of the



25   defendants' as well.  I'm not sure.







                                                                 337







 1   DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT RE UNSEALING OF SEVERANCE MOTION



 2                              MATERIALS



 3            MS. WELCH:  Your Honor, we don't take a position



 4   different from our request that the matters be sealed.  I would



 5   like to say that given the nature of the information that was



 6   submitted under seal, we think it is clear that disclosure of



 7   that information would meet the substantial probability of



 8   prejudice to the defendants' fair trial rights; and so we would



 9   urge the Court to continue keeping under seal all matters that



10   relate to discovery that are submitted to the Court in order to



11   insure that this Court's decision is fully informed; and so we



12   would just urge the Court to follow the practice that was set



13   out of the two memorandums -- memorandum opinions that have



14   been previously entered.



15            We question whether or not this proceeding does



16   qualify as a proceeding that meets the First Amendment



17   right-of-access test; but because we feel that the nature of



18   the evidence submitted under seal without question meets the



19   substantial probability test, we don't think it's necessary to



20   go into that.



21            The information with regard to the suppression -- the



22   severance motions that has been made available to the public



23   has provided substantial information and a substantial



24   opportunity for public scrutiny without interfering with the



25   defendants' right to a fair trial.







                                                                 338







 1            And if the information submitted under seal were



 2   disclosed, we feel that it would result in a full-blown trial



 3   in the media and would so prejudice the defendants' right to a



 4   fair trial that the Court might well be having to consider



 5   another motion to change venue.  So we would differ strongly



 6   with the media representatives' position that this information



 7   does not meet the substantial probability test.



 8            Thank you, your Honor.



 9            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Neureiter.



10    DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT RE UNSEALING OF SEVERANCE MOTION



11                              MATERIALS



12            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor, I have very little to add.



13   I only wanted to point out that the reason there may not be



14   many cases on the closing of severance proceedings in



15   comparison with this one is that in this case there has been a



16   tremendous amount of discovery, perhaps unseen before in a case



17   of this magnitude; and so the defendants were able in their



18   submissions to not only suggest what might happen at trial but



19   prove what is likely to happen at trial with respect to the



20   evidence.  And that makes those submissions all the more



21   powerful and allows us to make our arguments better, that much



22   more sensitive with respect to publicity.



23            That is the only statement I would like to add, and we



24   will stand by our submission.



25          RULING RE UNSEALING OF SEVERANCE MOTION MATERIALS







                                                                 339







 1            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, when the objections were



 2   filed, I considered them, and I have kept them in mind as we've



 3   gone along; and certainly Press Enterprises II does give us the



 4   law and the requirements as I've interpreted them in previous



 5   rulings here.



 6            But I think that it is important to recognize that if



 7   the -- if the motions for relief from prejudicial joinder are



 8   granted and if there were to be a trial of the defendants



 9   separately, it is clear that by my previous ruling that the --



10   some of the material and clearly the statements made by



11   Mr. Nichols on April 21 and 22 are not admissible against



12   Mr. McVeigh; therefore, on a separate trial for Mr. McVeigh,



13   those statements would not be a part of the evidence.



14            So that, Mr. Kelley, makes this a matter of concern.



15   As you pointed out, you don't have cases where the court is



16   closing evidence that will be admissible.  It wouldn't be



17   admissible against Mr. McVeigh, that is.



18            The second thing is that the parties have submitted



19   here -- and those portions have been sealed -- their



20   submissions include not only statements with regard to what may



21   be offered in evidence but also statements of appraisals by



22   counsel of their view of the evidence and the effect of the



23   evidence.



24            Now, that's quite a bit different from just revealing



25   what's in discovery.  That's sort of like work product.  In







                                                                 340







 1   fact, it is work product; and in a sense, all counsel in the



 2   case have waived work product to the extent necessary to make



 3   clear to the Court what they anticipate the evidence at trial



 4   to be and what they anticipate the effect of the evidence to



 5   be.  Now, that's certainly not something that should be



 6   disclosed publicly.



 7            My ruling on these motions will be one in writing in



 8   which the result will be explained in considerable detail and



 9   in which this Court's exercise of its discretion will be



10   explained, I'm sure, in ways where those who take the time to



11   read it will understand it.  And the premise of Press 



12   Enterprises II is that the courts must function in public so



13   that the public has an opportunity to see the adjudicative



14   process and to draw their own conclusions with respect to the



15   quality of the process.



16            And my ruling, I believe, will provide just that



17   opportunity and will explain what I rely upon, because some of



18   the material that has been submitted may not be relied upon;



19   and the parties' respective positions on these motions, as --



20   and they have been fully explained in the argument here.  So



21   I'm overruling these objections; and what has been sealed will



22   remain sealed until any further order of the Court.



23            Now, we have as the next item under our scheduling



24   here discovery motions, and there are a number of them.  We do



25   also have as a separate item a motion to quash subpoenas.  It







                                                                 341







 1   may be that it would be prudent to jump to that motion, given



 2   the hour here, so that we might be able to address that and



 3   then take the recess.  I'm sure we won't resolve -- be able to



 4   resolve the discovery issues in 20 minutes, but maybe we can do



 5   this one in 20 minutes.



 6            So is there any objection to sort of jumping ahead to



 7   that, Mr. Jones?



 8            MR. JONES:  No, your Honor.



 9            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe it's the



10   Government's motion to quash.



11            THE COURT:  Yeah, I'm sorry.



12            MR. JONES:  It is.  I wasn't --



13            THE COURT:  It is.



14            MR. JONES:  I wasn't going to make your argument.



15            I was simply going to advise the Court that when we



16   spoke in the informal meeting Tuesday that I had indicated to



17   the Court that I felt, at least on behalf of Mr. McVeigh, that



18   the discovery matters fell basically into three categories; and



19   I was just going to give the docket number and the category as



20   an aid so that when we did present them, you would know which



21   ones we were talking about.  And that's the reason I came to



22   the podium.  However, I can do that after lunch, if you want to



23   hear Ms. Wilkinson's argument.



24            THE COURT:  Well, I -- Ms. Wilkinson, I called on



25   Mr. Jones because I was going out of order and I wanted to see







                                                                 342







 1   if he felt he was prejudiced by that.



 2            And I understand you to be saying you're not.



 3            MR. JONES:  No.  That's fine.



 4            THE COURT:  I don't know.  It might be helpful to



 5   identify those things in the discovery pleadings that are



 6   highlighted so that I could look at them in the recess.



 7            MR. JONES:  Well, it also might help the Government to



 8   know which categorization we put them in.



 9            THE COURT:  All right.



10            MR. JONES:  Basically, I advised the Court that the



11   three broad categories were the motions that I will call



12   generally having to do with CIPA or national intelligence data;



13   and that category would compose Docket Nos. 1898, 1918, 1921,



14   '22, '23, '26, '29, and '31 and 1936, 1938, 1969.



15            The second category was what might be generally called



16   Brady -- well, I'll come back to Brady -- Rule 16 or expert



17   material; and I believe that that would encompass Docket Nos.



18   1939, 1943, 1946, 1956, 1959, 1971.



19            And the third category would be Brady material that



20   does not fall within the national intelligence matters; and



21   that would be 1962, 1963, 1966, 1990, and 2079.



22            In addition, there two other motions that Ms. Merritt



23   is going to order -- I'm sorry -- going to argue -- which is



24   Docket No. 1942 and also Docket No. 1948, which really don't



25   fall into any of those categories.







                                                                 343







 1            I believe the remaining references to discovery



 2   motions are either Mr. Tigar's on behalf of Mr. Nichols, or the



 3   Government's responses or perhaps the Government's own motion.



 4            Sorry.  Just a moment, your Honor.



 5            Mr. Wyatt informs me that 1990, which I described as



 6   Brady, is actually national intelligence.



 7            THE COURT:  All right.



 8            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor --



 9            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Neureiter?



10            MR. NEUREITER:  We really have only one disputed



11   motion; that is, 2063, and that involves divergence of factual



12   recollections between two counsel.  It may require evidentiary



13   testimony and will be hotly disputed, just to bring that to



14   your attention.



15            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, let's turn to the



16   Government's motion to quash subpoenas to Government agencies,



17   and then I think there was a separate one with respect to a



18   particular agency.  Ms. Wilkinson . . .



19            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, while she's going to the



20   podium, may we ask one of our other lawyers to come forward to



21   assist us on this matter?



22            THE COURT:  Yes.  Since you're not limited to four



23   lawyers yet.



24            MR. JONES:  I'll ask Mr. Hankins to join us, your



25   Honor.







                                                                 344







 1            THE COURT:  Thank you.



 2            All right, Ms. Wilkinson.



 3               PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO QUASH



 4            MS. WILKINSON:  May it please the Court, your Honor,



 5   our motion is quite simple.  Over the past few weeks, we had



 6   been given notice by the defense, as is required under the



 7   Court's 17(c) subpoena process, that they intended to subpoena



 8   approximately 63 Government agencies and components for a



 9   variety of types of information.  I have a copy of one of the



10   subpoenas to the director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, which I



11   believe from our review of the subpoenas is identical to the



12   other 62.



13            THE COURT:  You attached that to your motion.



14            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  In the subpoena, your Honor,



15   Mr. McVeigh requests that these agents turn over all types of



16   information that he has previously requested from the



17   Government in a variety of ways.  This redundant request for



18   production violates Rule 17(c), which authorizes these



19   subpoenas and also violates the case law and the discovery



20   process that the -- that this Court has set up.



21            As the Court knows, back in April we argued and



22   Mr. Jones argued about whether the Government should have to do



23   an additional search for intelligence information.  At that



24   time, the Court was provided with an ex parte submission and



25   reviewed it consistent with the Court's explanation to the







                                                                 345







 1   Government that if there was anything in there that did mandate



 2   production, the Government would be contacted.



 3            On April 29, the Court ruled that that ex parte



 4   submission did not justify an additional search by the



 5   Government.  Nevertheless, Mr. Jones, pursuant to his



 6   understanding of your order, wrote to us and asked us for



 7   similar information once again.  And we don't question his



 8   ability to do that.



 9            We did not provide much of that information because we



10   don't believe that it meets the standards under discovery even



11   under our very broad interpretation of our discovery



12   obligations.  Nevertheless, Mr. Jones went forward and filed



13   these subpoenas; but he did that, your Honor, after he had



14   already filed separate motions, which he's just noted for the



15   Court, requesting the same type of intelligence information;



16   that is, the matter was here pending before the Court.



17            The briefs started, I believe, somewhere at the end of



18   August, and there have been several that have trickled in this



19   month where Mr. McVeigh makes his arguments about why he's



20   entitled to national intelligence information and why the



21   Government should have to do these searches.  But instead of



22   leaving it to the Court to decide, he filed these additional



23   subpoenas.



24            We believe, your Honor, that the Supreme Court case



25   law, the Tenth Circuit law and Rule 17(c) prohibit this kind of







                                                                 346







 1   fishing expedition.  The rules require that the defendant must



 2   set forth clearly in these type of subpoenas what type of



 3   information that they request, and they must show that they



 4   cannot receive this information in other ways.



 5            Obviously, because the discovery motions are pending,



 6   this Court was going to undertake this decision and determine



 7   whether this information should be provided.



 8            Rule 17(c) should not be abused to subvert or go



 9   around the discovery process and try to obtain this information



10   from the agencies.  That, we believe, your Honor is for two



11   reasons.  One obviously is because the rule doesn't provide for



12   it and the case law doesn't provide it, but also because it



13   interferes with our production of the material.



14            We were informed last week that a United States



15   marshal was attempting to get into the White House to deliver



16   one of these subpoenas to the national security adviser.  While



17   the subpoena was justified -- we would have no problem with



18   that -- it does affect our inability to interact with the rest



19   of the agencies who discover the material.



20            As I believe we reported to the Court on prior



21   occasions, we have contacted these other agencies, including



22   the national security adviser, to try and obtain any relevant



23   information in this case.



24            So we have undertaken our obligation to try and



25   collect this kind of information, and we don't believe that the







                                                                 347







 1   Rule 17(c) subpoena is the appropriate process to try and



 2   obtain this information.



 3            THE COURT:  Thank you.  Do you want to respond to



 4   that?



 5           DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO QUASH



 6            MR. JONES:  Yes, your Honor.



 7            Of necessity -- well, first, may it please the Court,



 8   of necessity, some of what I'm going to say I would also say --



 9   would have said in respect to the national intelligence and



10   Brady matters.  It seems to me the issue here is a fairly



11   narrow one; but Ms. Wilkinson has gone beyond that, and so I



12   think it's appropriate that I respond generally to that.



13            First of all, I didn't interpret the Court's order the



14   same way that she did.  I interpreted the Court's order of



15   April 29 to say that based upon the record as it then existed,



16   the Court would not enter an order requiring the production of



17   this material but that instead the Court entered an order



18   forcefully reminding the prosecution of its duty under Brady



19   and the other cases and also Rule 16 that they had the duty to



20   learn what the rest of the Government knew, which included the



21   Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency,



22   and that they had a duty to resolve doubtful issues in our



23   favor and that they had the duty to respond on behalf of the



24   Government as a whole.  That was the Court's order on April 29.



25            In response to that duty, nothing has been produced --







                                                                 348







 1   zero -- except for one sheet of paper heavily redacted.  And



 2   instead of following the Classified Information Procedures Act,



 3   the prosecution unilaterally amended it and gave us their own



 4   nonintelligence-type disclosure.



 5            The reason that I sent the subpoenas out is the same



 6   reason that I wrote each of these agencies.  I believe there is



 7   a coverup going on here.  I believe that information is being



 8   deliberately withheld from us and possibly from the



 9   prosecution.  I don't know the internal workings; but we have



10   submitted to the Court detailed specifications of materiality



11   supported by exhibits showing the high probability that certain



12   specific evidence exists which, despite responses and requests



13   back to October, has not been produced.



14            The use of the subpoena, like the use of the letter,



15   was to make it absolutely clear to every government agency that



16   I could in an act of good faith -- that no one when this case



17   was over with was going to be able to say, I didn't know what



18   you wanted, because I suspect that's what the answer will be



19   when something comes out.



20            Contrary to the representation of Ms. Wilkinson, much



21   of what was requested is highly specific.  It is specific by



22   file, it is specific by name, it is specific by event, and in



23   some cases down to a narrow frame of time.



24            Now, I will admit that some of it is broad, but I



25   would respectfully quote from a report on inquiry into CIA







                                                                 349







 1   electronic surveillance activity prepared by the Department of



 2   Justice and previously given the highest standard of



 3   confidentiality but subsequently released under the Freedom of



 4   Information Act containing this statement by the Department of



 5   Justice attorneys with respect to getting information from the



 6   Central Intelligence Agency:  "One typically has to ask the



 7   right question to elicit the right answer or document.  It is



 8   likely, therefore, that we had insufficient information on



 9   occasion to frame the magic question.  One also had to



10   ascertain the specific person or division to whom the right



11   question should be addressed, since compartmentalization of



12   intelligence gathering often results in one hand not knowing



13   what the other one is doing.  The latter was particularly true



14   of the offices of the general counsel with which we dealt.



15   They were not always consulted beforehand concerning the



16   legality of borderline operations.  Indeed, they were not even



17   fully aware until our inquiry of certain questionable



18   operations engaged in by their respective agencies.  In



19   addition, the offices of general counsel evidence a lack of



20   legal expertise in the field of electronic surveillance and



21   general uncertainty and inexperience in the area of federal



22   criminal law."



23            That was what was written 20 years ago.  Last month,



24   the same thing is virtually repeated when the House of



25   Representatives' intelligence community (sic) issued its







                                                                 350







 1   report.  And with respect to Brady and the duty of these



 2   intelligence agencies to search these files, they made this



 3   statement at page 283:  "Limits on searches of intelligence



 4   community files.  In the overall intelligence/law enforcement



 5   relationship, serious problems can arise when, during the



 6   course of a prosecution, the defendant feels there is reason to



 7   believe there may be exculpatory evidence related to him or her



 8   in intelligence community files and requests to search and a



 9   Brady ruling.  Searches like these pose an enormous threat to



10   intelligence sources and methods.  Yet the closer the



11   intelligence agencies work with investigators, the more likely



12   it is that the file searches will be sought."



13            And particularly illuminating to defense counsel and



14   right on point in this case, your Honor, is the following



15   enlightening comment:  "There are several ways to reduce the



16   risk in this area.  One is to limit the use of intelligence for



17   law enforcement purposes.  Another, assuming there is a



18   compelling benefit in doing so, is to employ parallel



19   investigatory efforts that keep intelligence out of the



20   investigatory record.  This is frequently done in custom cases



21   and has been effective in drug trafficking areas."



22            And it goes on to say, "Finally, the Justice



23   Department is attempting" -- is attempting, your Honor, not as



24   established, but is attempting -- "to establish a protocol that



25   governs when intelligence community files may or may not be







                                                                 351







 1   searched.  The department wishes to limit searches to that



 2   intelligence used in developing cases."



 3            Now, I will submit to the Court that issuing the



 4   subpoena while the matter is pending before the Court might



 5   invite some criticism from the Government because the Court has



 6   not yet ruled on the motion as submitted.  But on the other



 7   hand, there is a specific incident under seal with this Court



 8   that occurred on April 19, 1996 -- I'm sorry -- 1995.  We were



 9   first informed of that on February 29 by being given one page.



10   On March 31, we were given another page.  And on July -- I'm



11   sorry -- July 30 or 31, whatever the last day of the month is,



12   we were given the final two pages, which, of course, was the



13   most important.



14            Now, a year and three months to get four sheets of



15   paper broken out over four months involving one incident which



16   is absolutely critical to the McVeigh defense suggests -- and



17   again, I don't wish to cast any aspersions on the prosecution,



18   so I will simply say that someone in the Government is not



19   aware of their responsibilities with respect to producing



20   evidence where we have clearly laid out our theory, described



21   it in open court, had it belittled, and then after the



22   belittlement start giving evidence which supports it strung out



23   over months of time.



24            So for that reason, I wanted these agencies to know



25   that we were serious and that we intended for them to comply







                                                                 352







 1   and it was simply my way to get their attention.



 2                      RULING ON MOTION TO QUASH



 3            THE COURT:  Well, the narrow issue on the motion to



 4   quash is whether the Rule 17(c) procedure is the appropriate



 5   procedure to obtain the information; and with respect to that,



 6   I'm in agreement with the Government's position, and so the



 7   motion to quash is granted on the subpoenas.



 8            Now, we will be discussing some of this subject matter



 9   when we come back and deal with discovery issues; and with



10   reference back to the April 29 ruling that I made on the CIPA



11   motions as they then were, it is, of course, true that it was



12   made with respect to the record as it stood.  All rulings are.



13   And I think that these subpoenas may serve to -- one of the



14   purposes mentioned, which was to give counsel for the



15   Government here notice of what it is that the defense counsel



16   thinks is there and should be looked at and should be evaluated



17   to determine whether it's material to the defense both under



18   the Brady standard and under the Rule 16 standard.  And we'll



19   talking about that, and you can anticipate that I'll be



20   inquiring somewhat of what the counsel for the Government have



21   done since we were last together on these points.  And I'll be



22   asking you about that, and I presume you'll be prepared to



23   respond to that.



24            But I repeat -- and I think it's reemphasized -- that



25   which I said in the April 29 ruling; and that is counsel who







                                                                 353







 1   are here to prosecute this case are representative of the



 2   Government, the whole Government; and it is their burden and



 3   their responsibility to speak for the Government here in



 4   matters that are relevant to this proceeding and to obtain



 5   information from other agencies of the Government as is



 6   necessary to comply with that duty.  So I continue to operate



 7   on that premise, which I believe is well understood by counsel



 8   for the Government.  But when I said that you speak for the



 9   whole Government, that's what I mean; and that's a lot of



10   people to speak for.



11            But it's in that sense -- I mean in that -- consistent



12   with that that I'm denying -- or granting the motion to quash



13   and excusing these subpoenaed agencies from responding to the



14   subpoena.



15            Looking down here at notes, I noticed, Mr. Kelley, you



16   still -- yes, you're still here.  I should make it clear on the



17   record and I appreciate your bringing it to my attention:



18   Exhibit 72 is still sealed; and it's really sealed for the same



19   reasons that I've already articulated with respect to some of



20   the other parts of these motions that are sealed, briefing on



21   the motions.



22            So it's sealed until some further stage of the



23   proceeding, if it arises, when it can be unsealed.



24            All right.  We'll recess till 1:45.  Take a little bit



25   longer today.  1:45.







                                                                 354

<P>In a three-day pretrial hearing, Oklahoma City Bombing defendants Timothy McVeigh

and Terry Nichols argued for separate trials. They also pressed the government to turn

over classified information that they said may prove Iraq was involved in the bombing.

22                             PROCEEDINGS



23       (In open court at 1:48 p.m.)



24            THE COURT:  Please be seated.



25            All right.  We're ready to address these discovery







                                                                 358







 1   issues.  And having identified these categories, Mr. Jones, are



 2   you the first up?



 3            MR. JONES:  I am, your Honor.



 4            THE COURT:  All right.



 5          DEFENDANT VcVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS



 6            MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, I would like to



 7   begin with respect to the motions and documents which have been



 8   filed respecting the defendant's request for the production of



 9   what I have called as either CIPA, Classified Information



10   Procedures Act, material -- that is to say, documents and



11   tangible objects which would be subject to that act even though



12   they are not presently in my possession -- and sometimes



13   referred to as national security or national intelligence data.



14            The reason that I begin with that first is because it



15   goes to the heart of a defense theory hypothesis and



16   investigation which we have been conducting for some period of



17   time and, secondly, because it is the area of discovery in



18   which there has been absolutely no compliance with the Court's



19   suggestions, orders, admonitions, case law or anything else.



20            In the other two categories, Brady material and Rule



21   16, there has at least been some compliance.  But in this case,



22   other than perhaps an occasional reference to some obviously



23   neurotic or not credible claim for responsibility for the



24   bombing, the production with the exception of the incident of



25   April 19 has been nonexistent.







                                                                 359







 1            To begin with, I think it would be helpful to state in



 2   broad terms, bearing in mind that this is a public hearing, and



 3   I will not address the specifics except by number -- and when



 4   we come to that, I'll refer the Court to the document that has



 5   the numbers.  So with the exception of those items which are



 6   already in the public domain by being discussed in the press or



 7   which have been addressed in motions filed publicly, I will not



 8   refer to the others except by number.



 9            In October of last year, we began a series of written



10   requests to the Government, first by letter, which we believe



11   to be the professional thing to do, asking the Government to



12   produce a series or categories of documents and tangible



13   objects.  The items were numbered and there were some 50, as I



14   recall, perhaps more.  That letter has never really been



15   responded to.  And in fact -- and I don't want to get ahead of



16   the argument on the Brady material -- but the greatest



17   objection that we have and indeed the greatest obstacle to this



18   really unnecessary dispute about discovery is that we have made



19   numerous written specific numbered requests; and with rare



20   exceptions, the Government has always avoided a response to a



21   specific number so that there is no document on file except to



22   the extent that it may be reflected by letters which we put as



23   an exhibit to some document, no Government response saying Item



24   1 is not relevant, we refuse to produce, Item 2 is relevant,



25   you have everything we have.







                                                                 360







 1            Now, the case law is clear and it's cited in our



 2   brief -- and I'll have the cases herewith -- the case from the



 3   Northern District of Illinois is the most classic one -- the



 4   Ollison case -- that where the defendant makes a specific



 5   request and identifies it, the Government must respond



 6   specifically to that request.  But in reviewing the briefs that



 7   are filed by the Government in opposition to the motion, rarely



 8   do they address them with specificity.  They may include them



 9   in some broad description or they may reference them in that



10   way, but so long as they have avoided two things and they have



11   avoided them -- first, specific documents filed with the Court



12   by number, by category responding to our requests with certain



13   minor exceptions and, No. 2, there's no discovery order in this



14   court.



15            In a case of this magnitude, we respectfully submit



16   with the greatest of respect and deference to the Court that



17   we're entitled to an order.  We are entitled to an order



18   requiring them to comply to the Rule 16 motion, either granting



19   or denying in whole or part what we have asked for, an order



20   directing them to produce exculpatory evidence in whole or in



21   part based upon what we've asked for; and we're entitled to an



22   order directing them to do the appropriate things to see about



23   this national intelligence data in whole or part.



24            Now, obviously, it is up to the Court to determine --



25   let's just say of those 50 requests, the Court may decide that







                                                                 361







 1   45 of them should be complied with, or alternatively the Court



 2   may decide that only five of them should be complied with.  But



 3   so long as there is no order ever entered by the Court



 4   specifically directing them to address specific requests, they



 5   will continue to do what they have done for the last year and a



 6   half, avoid it.  And it is that evasion and avoidance that is



 7   the slippery slope that if there is conviction in this case



 8   runs the risk of a protracted 2255 hearing on what their duty



 9   was, what we requested and what they understood.



10            Just like today, the Court overruled -- or rather



11   sustained the Government's motion to suppress the subpoena.



12   And I dare say that the way that will be reported is that the



13   Court quashed the subpoena, leaving the inference that you



14   don't have to produce any of that when the Court has quashed



15   the subpoena really on the narrow ground that a 17(c) subpoena



16   is not appropriate at this time.  So in the strong --



17            THE COURT:  So that it's clear, the ruling was and is



18   that 17(c) is not procedurally the correct approach to



19   obtaining the information.  It did not constitute a ruling that



20   the information sought is not obtainable through Rule 16 or



21   Brady.



22            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor, for that



23   clarification.



24            The Court has the motions.  I know that it has been



25   the Court's practice to read every document filed; and the







                                                                 362







 1   Court may not have had time to read, much less digest



 2   everything that has been filed.  And I am sure that before the



 3   day is over, and certainly before the hearing is over, that the



 4   Government's response will be as to how much they have given us



 5   and how much they have complied with and how early they did



 6   this.



 7            And if I might leave the lectern for just a moment?



 8            THE COURT:  Yes.



 9            MR. JONES:  I want to call the Court's attention to



10   these eight boxes, legal-size boxes.  This is what was



11   delivered to us this week.



12            So the amount of material that they are delivering to



13   us, the 25,000 statements and all of that, has never been in



14   dispute.  What is in dispute is the delay, the mistakes, the



15   omissions, the mischaracterizations; and I'll address those in



16   the Brady.  I only address them now because they relate



17   somewhat in a general term to the problems that we have had.



18            But with respect to the specific motion concerning the



19   national intelligence data, we don't have an envelope of



20   material, let alone eight boxes.  We filed on August 27, a



21   document styled Defendant McVeigh's motion to compel the



22   production of material in exculpatory classified information



23   pursuant Rule 16 and Brady with proposed order attached.



24   Attached to that motion and brief is a proposed order, and



25   attached to the proposed order is a document labeled Defendant







                                                                 363







 1   McVeigh's discovery requests for information within the



 2   possession of national security agencies, parentheses,



 3   suggested language for court order.  The Government has a copy



 4   of this and I believe Mr. Tigar has a copy of it.



 5            And this document is 16 pages long, double-spaced, and



 6   has 55 categories.  Now, through today at five minutes to 2:00,



 7   despite the fact that the Government has seen this list in one



 8   form or the other for a year, coming October 7, there's never



 9   been a response to it.  I don't know to this date whether any



10   of this information exists, although I'm confident that it does



11   for reasons that I will address in a moment.  I don't know



12   whether the Government's position is that it's exculpatory or



13   not or whether they have searched and can't find it.  I don't



14   know what their position is.



15            I waited after the Court entered its April 29 order to



16   receive -- the Court suggested that I assist the Government by



17   telling them specifically what I was looking for.  I wrote



18   Mr. Hartzler a letter within a couple weeks after that order



19   came out, and I attached this list.  I then wrote, as the



20   Government has brought to the Court's attention -- and I told



21   them I was doing it.  I wrote each agency that I thought had



22   this information, wrote a letter to the general counsel and to



23   the director of the agency and sent it certified mail, return



24   receipt requested.  So there is no issue that they know what



25   I'm looking for.







                                                                 364







 1            Now, the response, to the extent that there has been a



 2   response, is that it is overbroad and cumbersome.  Well, some



 3   of it may be overbroad.  But as I read to the Court before the



 4   recess, the Department of Justice's own experience dealing with



 5   the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security



 6   Agency shows that if you don't ask the right question, you



 7   don't get the appropriate answer.



 8            And so where I could, I tried to be very specific.



 9   Where I was afraid that my specificity would be used against



10   me, I tried to make it broad.  But instead what has come back



11   is the statement in court since amended qualified that the



12   Government had no information that there was any mastermind



13   other than Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols.  I respectfully submit



14   that we have made a sufficient showing that that statement must



15   be taken with a grain of salt.



16            The defense theory and hypothesis is that the



17   destruction of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City



18   was inspired or financed or directed in whole or part by a



19   foreign terrorist organization or a foreign state hostile to



20   the United States.  Now, I didn't just stop there and say,



21   well, give me everything you've got.  I submitted to the Court



22   four detailed specifications of materiality and relevancy that



23   grew from January to the present date based upon the



24   investigations that we conducted in this country and abroad and



25   I gave to the Court numerous domestic and foreign newspaper







                                                                 365







 1   reports, affidavits, foreign broadcasts, material that had come



 2   over the transom to us, to show that while I didn't know the



 3   exact contours of it, that there was enough suspicious activity



 4   by certain American citizens and certain foreign nationals and



 5   one or two foreign states in particular to suggest that such



 6   evidence did exist.



 7            And of course, it exists.  There's enough published



 8   reports in this country between the date of the bombing and the



 9   arrest of my client to indicate that it exists.



10            Now, I do not know what questions the Court will ask



11   of counsel, if any, for the prosecution as to their due



12   diligence, and I'm sure that their answers will be truthful and



13   forthcoming.  But I simply want to call to the Court's



14   attention three incidents.



15            The first and I believe the most telling one occurred



16   early in this case when the parties agreed to the entry of an



17   order which Judge Alley signed that by a certain date, we would



18   receive the statements made by Mr. McVeigh.  And we received



19   those.  And after we received them, Mr. Ron Woods, counsel for



20   Mr. Nichols, called to their attention something that I had



21   overlooked, despite all these flattering and exaggerated



22   statements about my competence that not in -- some of them even



23   made under oath -- that not included in the material were



24   Mr. Nichols' statements made at the prison.  And I recognized



25   that I'd overlooked that, so I wrote my own letter and the







                                                                 366







 1   Government prosecutors responded -- I believe it was



 2   Mr. Mackey.  And Mr. Mackey has always responded promptly and



 3   fully, and certainly I have no complaint in that respect of



 4   him -- saying that he couldn't get that from the Department



 5   of -- from the Bureau of Prisons without a court order.



 6            Now, that -- that was mind boggling to me.  The



 7   Department of Justice consists of constituent divisions and



 8   offices, one of which is the Bureau of Prisons and another of



 9   which is the FBI and the third is the -- the prosecutory line.



10   And here we are being told with a straight face that in order



11   for one division of the Department of Justice, the Bureau of



12   Prisons, to give to another division, presumably the FBI, for



13   transmittal to a third division, the prosecutors, material that



14   is covered by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure --



15   specifically covered by the Federal Rules of Criminal



16   Procedure, they need a court order.



17            And so the image that comes across of the Department



18   of Justice is kind of like a -- precommunist China in which



19   feudal warlords control various parts of the country and that



20   while there's one nominal president -- re: the attorney



21   general -- that in reality, this isn't so much a department as



22   a series of departments.



23            But the issue is if it takes a court order, which they



24   represented it did, to get Mr. McVeigh's own statements covered



25   by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure from another office







                                                                 367







 1   in the Department of Justice, then I respectfully submit that



 2   no -- no matter how well intended or how zealous Ms. Wilkinson



 3   or Mr. Hartzler or anybody else contacts the Central



 4   Intelligence Agency, they are a foreign government to these



 5   people.



 6            I mean, let's just think about it.  If it takes a



 7   court order to get something from the Bureau of Prisons, what



 8   does it take to get something from an independent agent whose



 9   director, appointed by the President of the United States and



10   in no way subject to the Attorney General, much less



11   Ms. Wilkinson or Mr. Hartzler -- and you can then duplicate



12   that by every other cabinet office.



13            Personally, I question whether they did it with much



14   enthusiasm.  But even if they did -- even if they did, there is



15   simply no enforcing mechanism.  And the reason that I read the



16   document to the Court that I did before the lunch break is



17   because there is an acknowledgment by the Department of Justice



18   that even in conducting inquiries in the CIA activities, its



19   own legal counsel didn't know everything that was going on.



20   The reason I need the order is because I'm not going to get it



21   without the order.  But I'm not sure I'm going to get it



22   anyway.  But at least if there's a conviction in this case and



23   there is an order, then it will be clear what should have been



24   done.  That's the first incident.



25            The second incident relates to the incident of







                                                                 368







 1   April 19, 1995.  The information concerning that incident was



 2   known to the FBI that afternoon.  The indictment in this case



 3   was returned on August 10.  I didn't receive the first, quote,



 4   insert, close quote, until February 29, although by then, it



 5   was clear to the Government the defense theory that we were



 6   pursuing.



 7            On the same day as April 19, as the incident came in,



 8   a certain foreign government's offices were called and a memo



 9   was created of that call, and I got that 30 days later.  And



10   then, several months later, at the end of July, I received two



11   additional 302's which contained information highly relevant to



12   the defense and highly credible.  And since then, I have



13   received a letter from the Government indicating that an



14   informant in this country, who has no contact so far as we know



15   with the initiating source overseas, told the Government the



16   same thing that the original source said that was claimed to be



17   untrustworthy, a characterization which, as the Court knows, in



18   the paper that I submitted I consider to be ridiculous.



19            Now, the Government may say, well, we gave you that.



20   Well, I want the -- that's true, they did.  After repeated



21   requests and asking and motions and letters, I got the four



22   pages.  But they also violated CIPA and this Court's order.



23   This Court's order on April 29 said -- and it's quoted now --



24   United States vs. McVeigh, 923 F.Supp. 1310 at 1314, if in



25   complying with the duty under Rule 16 of Brady, Government







                                                                 369







 1   counsel must provide copies or permit inspection of documents



 2   that are now classified, they have the choices of



 3   declassifying, redacting or seeking protective orders



 4   restricting access in use of the sensitive information under



 5   the Classified Information Procedure Act.  They didn't do that.



 6   What they did was give me a document that said this information



 7   concerns -- or this sheet or serial number, I've forgotten the



 8   exact wording; there's a copy of it submitted -- contains



 9   national security information and will be given to you in some



10   other form.  And I'm paraphrasing.



11            Well, it presumably was given to me in some other



12   form.  But under CIPA, that's not the way it works.  They have



13   to come to the Court and do that pursuant to the Court's order



14   and pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of CIPA or they



15   have to petition the Court for relief therefrom.  Now, if they



16   did that, I'm not aware of it.



17            So my concern -- second concern is that not only are



18   we getting it late, what little we've gotten, but that, in



19   fact, they are just ignoring the Classified Information



20   Procedure Act and just redacting it themselves without



21   following the procedures and then giving it to us.  And I



22   object to that.



23            The third incident involves the representatives of



24   another country who came to the United States and were in



25   Oklahoma City in assistance with an investigative agency and







                                                                 370







 1   prepared a report, and that matter has been the subject of



 2   certain in camera proceedings and documents.  But the truth of



 3   the matter is that I made a request for that in October.  And



 4   it's also clearly scientific evidence, a test and conclusions



 5   and reports, and there's a Court order on that.  And we didn't



 6   get that.  And so far as I know, until it was attached to a



 7   Government document that was filed under seal, we never



 8   received it; and what we did receive, I believe for the reasons



 9   that we discussed in the in camera hearing, we didn't receive



10   the entire document.



11            Now, the Government -- and I see this as the problem,



12   your Honor -- the Government prosecutors believe, I'm sure,



13   professionally and perhaps personally that these defendants are



14   guilty, that the grand jury made the correct decision in



15   indicting them.  But that belief, no matter how well intended



16   and how sincerely and honestly held, is being held by the same



17   people that the Court has charged us -- or charged them to



18   fulfill our Brady request.



19            Now, they can't do that.  And the proof that they



20   cannot do it is reflected in the letter that one of them wrote



21   to me which has been filed of record back earlier this year in



22   which the representation was made that this individual had



23   personally reviewed and read 302's of six witnesses and there



24   was nothing in them that was exculpatory.  Well, to the



25   contrary, those six witnesses and those 302's are at the very







                                                                 371







 1   heart of the defense.  The very heart of the defense.  And



 2   furthermore, what's contained in those 302's, we have in some



 3   degree been able to corroborate.



 4            Now, simply by way of example -- and I can refer to



 5   this one because it is a matter of public record -- if it is



 6   not exculpatory -- I mean, we know that when Mr. McVeigh was



 7   arrested on Saturday, he was weighed and found to weigh



 8   161 pounds and stood 6 feet 2 inches tall and had I believe



 9   brown eyes; and there was a photograph taken, and he didn't



10   have acne.  If there's a witness that gives a statement that



11   says that a certain individual took certain things and that



12   individual was 5' 10", 5' 11" with acne and green eyes and



13   medium build and weighed 180 to 185 pounds, that's not Giglio



14   material, which it doesn't make any difference whether it is or



15   not.  That's Brady material.  That's identifying somebody else.



16            Now, the very people that said that they had



17   personally reviewed that and it wasn't exculpatory are the same



18   people that are reviewing a much more sensitive area here.



19            Now, the argument will be made, and I freely concede



20   it -- and later when we are discussing exculpatory evidence,



21   I'll make it even more clear -- that we have ultimately got



22   that material and we did ultimately get it.  I believe we began



23   to get it in January after the indictment in August.



24   August 10.  So while we got it, the protracted energy and time



25   and delay in getting it -- and I'll address later the manner in







                                                                 372







 1   which we're getting it.  I'm just now talking about getting



 2   it -- does not give me confidence that on this far more



 3   sensitive area where there is a history of unresolved



 4   differences between the NSA and CIA and the FBI and the



 5   Department of Justice and -- and I just have no confidence that



 6   unaided, they can get it to me.



 7            I don't ask the Court to order them to do it in any



 8   punitive way or to suggest bad faith on their part.  The Court



 9   has on several occasions invoked the American Bar Association's



10   standards on criminal justice.  It invoked them with respect to



11   the defense function, and it invoked them with respect to the



12   pretrial publicity order that the Court entered.  Well, those



13   same standards establishes one of the standards that the Court



14   should enter the orders on discovery, and I ask the Court to do



15   that.



16            I -- I think really, your Honor, that after a year and



17   after numerous meetings and certainly some positive results,



18   that it is very risky in this case with this being the



19   defendants' defense, going to the heart of it, based upon what



20   we presently know, that an order should enter -- and I drafted



21   language and it was very simple -- that these items accompany



22   an order to each of the agencies designated and that they file



23   a written response to the Department of Justice and I think may



24   have said also with the Court as to whether they exist and will



25   be produced or whether they don't exist.  And obviously, if







                                                                 373







 1   they don't exist, they won't be produced.  And if there's a



 2   claim of privilege, they should assert it.  But some of this



 3   information clearly exists.  I mean, Item 7 clearly exists.



 4   Well, I better not go into specific instances.  I don't want to



 5   breach some confidentiality here.



 6            We can't even get to the threshold of whether it can



 7   be produced or not because there's never been any



 8   acknowledgment that it exists.  And if the Court will give me



 9   just a moment and let me look at my checklist here and see if



10   there -- Ms. Wilkinson advised the Court on April 9 "I will



11   restate again we have no evidence of foreign involvement."  I



12   have submitted to the Court evidence of foreign involvement



13   that the Government had on that date.  Now, she may have meant



14   we have no credible evidence, but that's not the issue.



15            Ms. Wilkinson, with all of her talents and abilities,



16   is not to make the determination of credibility.  She's not to



17   make the determination of privilege.  What she is required to



18   do is to inform the Court whether it'll be produced or not and



19   whether there's a claim of privilege or not or whether the



20   Government has some other claim, and then the Court makes the



21   decision.  And if we get it, then it comes in to the jury.



22            At the April 9 hearing, Ms. Wilkinson mentioned,



23   quote, an Oliver Stone movie as though that were my approach



24   and how the Government did not have any information concerning



25   Iraqi connections to the Oklahoma City bombing.  Well, the







                                                                 374







 1   information submitted under seal which came to me from the



 2   Government shows that the Court -- that the Government did have



 3   such information after denying it in court.  I'm not saying



 4   Ms. Wilkinson misled the Court.  Ms. Wilkinson herself may have



 5   been misled.



 6            This information -- and I'm just referring to that



 7   incident -- has been considered untrustworthy, but yet the



 8   person that received it, who held a high and sensitive position



 9   in the intelligence organizations of this country immediately



10   after receiving it, called the FBI and the CIA to report to



11   them what he had been told.



12            And what was particularly troubling to me, your Honor,



13   in the way in which this was handled was the June 11 letter



14   from the Government which detailed over several pages obviously



15   frivolous claims of responsibility.  But here, they had



16   information that clearly was not frivolous, coming as it did



17   from a senior official of an allied power.  But I didn't learn



18   about that one.  That one was buried back on page 5 just in a



19   number, serial number such and such.



20            But yet, the Government went to some length to



21   describe some telephone call from some obviously neurotic



22   person from Texas that she had been brainwashed by the FBI and



23   carried to Oklahoma City and done the bombing.  As though, see,



24   that's what we've got.  But they didn't want to tell me -- and



25   I'll measure my words carefully -- a senior military officer







                                                                 375







 1   specifically charged with intelligence in a foreign friendly



 2   power called two sources and related specific involvement of a



 3   third country.  Now, that sure is more credible than some



 4   housewife from Texas claiming the FBI kidnapped her to Oklahoma



 5   City.  That's what I was told.  The second one, the one about



 6   the senior military official, I wasn't told at all.  It was



 7   just buried as a number, and I later found the number.



 8            The other issue that comes up is that the Government



 9   tells the Court or the prosecutors tell the Court they made



10   inquiry of these agencies.  But I don't know what agencies they



11   inquired of.  I don't know when they made the inquiry.  I don't



12   know what the mechanism is to report, nor do I know how the --



13   the question was asked.  Did they send the agencies the 55 list



14   or did they just make a general request for exculpatory



15   information?  Did they tell them what the defense theory was?



16   Did they actually pursue and then did they look at it, as the



17   Court suggested that they should, and have the knowledge



18   themselves or did they rely upon it?



19            In United States vs. Diaz-Monez, M-o-n-e-z, in 632



20   F.2d 1330, 1980, Fifth Circuit case, the court there discussed



21   the fact that the CIA would not allow prosecutors access to the



22   files on the case.  So did the CIA allow the Government access



23   to the files here or the NSA?



24            In United States vs. Gaston at 608 F.2d 607, Fifth



25   Circuit case, this was another case in which defense counsel







                                                                 376







 1   sought pretrial production of specific 302's, the trial court



 2   denied it, conviction was reversed.  Even the court relied upon



 3   the prosecutor's representations that it contained no Brady



 4   material.  The circuit held that an in camera inspection by the



 5   court was required.



 6            In Pennsylvania vs. Ritchie, 1987 U.S. Supreme Court



 7   case at 480 U.S. 39, this case and its progeny concerned the



 8   trial court's failure to conduct an in camera review of



 9   material requested by the defense.  Now, I don't desire to



10   further add to the Court's burden in this case, and I certainly



11   don't desire to add further to my burden.  What I proposed in



12   my moving papers was not that the Court be the monitor but that



13   the Court enter the order and that we would designate two



14   experts which we would submit to national security clearance.



15   And I'm confident both of them will pass it because both of



16   them have in the past.  One of them is the professor at the



17   Georgetown University, who has previous clearance and served as



18   a consultant to both the FBI and the Central Intelligence



19   Agency as well as a consultant to the President's foreign



20   intelligence advisory board, a man who has written extensively



21   in the areas of intelligence.  The other one is an academic



22   figure, who likewise has written extensively in the area of



23   terrorism.  So I'm trying to combine terrorism and



24   intelligence.  And that we would designate two lawyers,



25   Mr. Hankins and Mr. Wyatt.  And the four of them, in whatever







                                                                 377







 1   secure facility is necessary, would examine the materials



 2   submitted, and then they would advise me that there were five



 3   pages or 50 pages or 500 pages or zero pages.  And then we



 4   would go to the Government and say, okay, the material that



 5   these four people have said is material, we want.  The rest of



 6   it, you can send back to central file.  And then presumably at



 7   that point, the Government would say, okay, you can have 1



 8   through 25, but 25 through 50 we're not going to give you and



 9   we're going to argue with the Court about it, and then the



10   Court would make the decision.



11            Now I will admit that that's a modification of CIPA,



12   myself; but with great respect, I'm proposing the modification



13   instead of just doing it unilaterally as a way to take the



14   Court out of it except on the issues where there truly is a



15   conflict.



16            We have also asked for certain specific telephone



17   conversations, and I identified the calling numbers, calls made



18   overseas.  And Ms. Wilkinson advised me that there was no 302.



19   Well, that wasn't what I asked for, and I'll address the



20   question of 302's later.



21            There is an opinion by Judge Bryant in a case that's



22   styled Joan Baez vs. National Security Agency.  It's a 1978



23   case.  So the technology that he's referring to there is 18



24   years old.  In this particular case on page 2 of the opinion --



25   I have a copy of it here.  The issue in the case was that







                                                                 378







 1   Ms. Baez requested disclosure of information concerning the



 2   ability of the National Security Agency to monitor, intercept



 3   and record telephone calls from someone in this country to a



 4   foreign country or vice versa.  And the Government filed



 5   certain affidavits, and then Ms. Baez asked for permission to



 6   have those documents unsealed.  They were unsealed.  I have



 7   copies of them.  So I know what Bobby Inman and others told



 8   Judge Bryant about the capacity of the NSA.  But this is what



 9   Judge Bryant said.  "From news articles and congressional



10   investigations, the American public is aware and consequently



11   any foreign Government knows that NSA can and does collect most



12   messages to or from the United States transmitted by



13   international common carrier facilities, both private and



14   commercial.  This includes messages passed by radio, satellite



15   or other electronic magnet means.  Therefore, NSA's capacity to



16   perform this sort of function is public knowledge."  The same



17   information is contained, although in a generalistic form, on



18   page 227 of Mr. James Bamford's national best seller The Puzzle 



19   Palace in which he analyzes the capacity of the NSA.



20            Now, when Ms. Wilkinson responded to my letter, she



21   didn't say that she had made inquiry of the NSA to determine



22   whether in fact they could retrieve certain specific -- and I



23   think the number was five -- telephone conversations that we



24   are interested in.  Maybe they can't retrieve them, but she



25   didn't say they couldn't retrieve them.  She didn't tell me







                                                                 379







 1   whether she had asked.  She just said there's no 302.  She may



 2   have said they didn't have any record of it, but there wasn't



 3   any 302 on it.  But I didn't ask for 302's.  I'm not just



 4   limiting this to the FBI.  This compartmentalization that we



 5   keep coming up against is defeating what I believe to be the



 6   Court's spirit of understanding what the discovery obligations



 7   of the Government are in this case.



 8            Now, I am prepared -- although I have submitted it to



 9   the Court this week and the Court submitted it -- or received



10   it under seal.  What I did was take each of these 55



11   categories.  I took each of our specifications of materiality



12   and said which ones related to which specification.



13            Now, the Government has said in the past -- and I



14   don't know whether it'll be their position today, but they



15   certainly have never abandoned it -- that they would like to



16   see the specifications and materiality because Mr. Jones might



17   be submitting incorrect information to the Court and they would



18   like to correct it.  Well, with all due respect, that's not



19   what the law says.  The way it's set up is we make the motion



20   and we tell you and you have the discretion and you've



21   exercised that discretion to accept our findings and the basis



22   ex parte, and then you can go down and check whether you think



23   we made a sufficient showing or not.  And if we have, you order



24   its production.  But before we get it, the Government isn't



25   prejudiced by the Court's order.  Before we get it, they may







                                                                 380







 1   make their own ex parte in camera showings and claim a



 2   privilege and then the Court adjusts those differences.



 3            They are no more entitled to see my specification of



 4   materiality than I'm entitled to see their ex parte submission



 5   claiming the privilege.  We have to leave it in the hands of



 6   the Court.  As it is now, it's not coming to your Honor.  We're



 7   just being told it doesn't exist.  And I respectfully submit in



 8   view of the material that we have submitted concerning the two



 9   foreign nationals that were in Oklahoma City two weeks after



10   Mr. -- two weeks after the bombing, which was long after



11   Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols had been arrested -- and so these



12   two Army drifters or these two malcontents, these two loners



13   that the Government has talked about, you would wonder why any



14   country would be interested in what they had done, much less



15   then two apparently important people over here to study.



16            But it really doesn't make any difference what I



17   think.  I come back to the bottom line of what the grand jury



18   thought.  The grand jury charged that these two men, with



19   others unknown, committed this crime.  And the Attorney General



20   of the United States held a national press conference and



21   released drawings of John Doe 2.  Those drawings have never



22   been withdrawn.  There has never been a public announcement



23   that the search for John Doe 2 has ceased.  The grand jury has



24   not returned a new indictment dropping "others unknown."  And



25   the Court knows, I respectfully submit, from what has been







                                                                 381







 1   submitted under seal, that there is credible evidence that John



 2   Doe 2 exists.



 3            Now, that may not exculpate us as to guilt.  That's



 4   for the jury to decide.  But it certainly bears on punishment,



 5   particularly in light of -- I thought the very accurate



 6   representation that Mr. Tigar made this morning about the



 7   people that actually lit the fuse and knew those people were in



 8   the building.  It is no secret because it has been broadcast



 9   that the next-to-last survivor, the woman whose leg was



10   amputated with 100 million people watching on CNN, has made the



11   statement that she saw the Ryder truck, she stood 12 to 15 feet



12   from it, saw the passenger door open, did not see Mr. McVeigh



13   or Mr. Nichols, saw a short man with black curly hair and a cap



14   and a puffy jacket and an olive-complected face exit the



15   passenger side.  She saw no one else.  Walked to the back.



16   Walked to the front.  She went back in the Social Security



17   office, the bomb went off.



18            Now, you can make all kinds of representations as to



19   why that's not credible.  That's for the jury to determine.



20   But it's not for Ms. Wilkinson to determine or the Central



21   Intelligence Agency.  And I cannot think of any case where,



22   under the facts alleged in the indictment and the submissions



23   we have made to the Court, we haven't shown a low threshold of



24   probability or possibility.  I don't think there's ever been a



25   case where national intelligence data was sought that a







                                                                 382







 1   stronger showing was made.



 2            Two weeks ago, I was in a city visiting with one of



 3   the lawyers in the World Trade Center case, and he expressed



 4   surprise that we were having problems getting national



 5   intelligence data because he said, We didn't have any problem



 6   getting it.  I mean, we got bucket loads of it.  We haven't



 7   gotten anything.  And yet, there's no one else that can do this



 8   but the Court, I respectfully submit.



 9            If you read our submissions and the attachments to it,



10   I believe that the Court should take the prudent step of saying



11   to the Government this is what I want you to search for and I



12   want you to report back to Mr. Jones who you asked and how you



13   asked and what they said.  You don't have to tell Mr. Jones



14   what the documents are, just tell him what you -- if you got



15   anything.  And either give it to him or file a motion with the



16   Court and ask to be excused from it and then I'll determine



17   whether it's relevant.



18            But this case is going to have to be tried, but these



19   folks are running the clock on us and keeping us from getting



20   that which we need to establish what appears to us to be a



21   promising defense.  Now, it may turn out to be nothing.  And



22   I'll certainly be the first one to say it.  But that's all I



23   can do.  We have taken hundreds of hours in investigation and



24   trips and interviews.  We've made our submission to the Court.



25   We honored the Court's request in April.  We waited.  It's now







                                                                 383







 1   October, and we have nothing to show for it except five months



 2   passing.  I ask the Court to enter the order.



 3            THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Wilkinson.



 4            MS. WILKINSON:  Good afternoon, your Honor.



 5            THE COURT:  Good afternoon.



 6              PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS



 7            MS. WILKINSON:  Perhaps it would be best to start by



 8   telling you what the Government has done in this case with



 9   regard to classified information so the record is clear.



10            Many months ago back in February of 1996, the



11   Government wrote letters to the intelligence agencies, a three-



12   page letter documenting for them information that we were



13   looking for with regard to these two defendants, their aliases,



14   and with regard to other suspects and any information whether



15   it fell under Brady, Jencks or Rule 16 material.



16            We sent those letters to the agencies and asked them



17   to conduct their searches of their files and get back to us so



18   that we could personally review that information if they found



19   any -- any information that was arguably relevant under those



20   broad topics.



21            Your Honor, we did this after we had already contacted



22   approximately 63 Government agencies, components of Government



23   agencies and state agencies also requesting from them a variety



24   of information in connection with this case.  In fact, those



25   boxes that Mr. Jones has pointed out today contain some of that







                                                                 384







 1   information.  The marshal service, the secret service and other



 2   agencies have continued to produce information to us and,



 3   indeed, we've turned it over to the defense.



 4            Just to make the record clear on those eight boxes



 5   Mr. Jones pointed out to you, four of those boxes contain



 6   medical examiner reports that his team and Mr. Nichols' team



 7   asked that we subpoena.  So while we are producing a lot of



 8   information, some of it is information that they have come and



 9   requested that we produce to them on their behalf.



10            So back in February, we sent the letter.  We asked the



11   agencies to conduct a search.  They did that.  We went and



12   reviewed their files.  We reviewed anything that was deemed



13   arguably relevant under the search, not arguably relevant under



14   this case.  We did not just review the documents, your Honor.



15   We reviewed how they conducted the search of their files.  As



16   you might imagine, an agency like the CIA has expensive files



17   and has to engage in a computerized search to come up with some



18   of this information.  From my former experience, I am familiar



19   with how -- somewhat familiar with how the intelligence agency



20   maintain their files so I personally discussed with them how



21   they did their searches to make sure they erred on the side of



22   being over-inclusive.  We then reviewed the documents that they



23   produced.  We took notes on those documents and we went back to



24   the FBI.  We did that, your Honor, because, as I reported to



25   you, it was our understanding that what the intelligence







                                                                 385







 1   agencies had done was report any information they had to the



 2   FBI during the first few days of the bombing and as I think



 3   your Honor noted on April 9 when we argued this last spring,



 4   you called it an all points bulletin and that's what they did.



 5            So we went back first to check whether this



 6   information had gone to the FBI.  And found that that's exactly



 7   what had happened.  That the information that the intelligence



 8   agencies had which were -- by and large, it was a very, very



 9   small amount of information were post-blast claims of



10   responsibility.  So we went back and checked with the FBI to



11   see if they had that information and then to check whether we



12   had already disseminated it to the defendants and that's what's



13   happened and that's what Mr. Jones is referring to when we



14   reported in our papers that we were disclosing it in an



15   unclassified format.



16            I'd like to give the Court two examples of the



17   information we found when we were doing that.  There was -- and



18   I know Mr. Jones has referred to some of this information as



19   not credible or little interest to him, but this is the



20   information that we found in those files and I reported to him.



21   One was a call -- I believe it was on April 19 -- to a Belgian



22   radio station where a member or person who said he was a member



23   of the Nation of Islam took credit for the bombing.  That



24   information was possessed by an intelligence agency and also by



25   the State Department.  That information was originally







                                                                 386







 1   classified and it included the actual transcript -- excuse me



 2   your Honor -- included the actual transcript of the recorded



 3   conversation with the radio station.



 4            We went back to the FBI and found out that, indeed,



 5   the intelligence agencies and the state department had reported



 6   that information to the FBI.  The FBI had documented that in a



 7   302 which is numbered 12,337, reporting that same information



 8   and reporting that that -- that the tape had been turned over.



 9   We then went back to the State Department and asked that the



10   transcript that they had which was marked confidential -- and



11   I'm not sure why other than I think they classify a lot of



12   their materials that are attached to cables.  We asked them to



13   declassify that transcript and we provided it to the defense



14   recently.



15            The second information that we saw was something I



16   believe that Mr. Jones would be interested in and that is



17   someone that was identified not by name but by background as an



18   unidentified Arabic caller, called in to an embassy, and



19   claimed responsibility for the bombing.  That occurred after



20   the blast.  That, again, was disclosed to the FBI.  They put it



21   in two inserts.  They are numbered 8248 and 8249 and they were



22   disclosed to the defense on May 31 of this year.



23            So it's that type of information, your Honor, that we



24   found.



25            In the letters that Mr. Jones -- referred to are







                                                                 387







 1   letters which we entitled threats and claims of responsibility.



 2   We documented all of this information and any other information



 3   that we had regarding post blast claims of responsibility.



 4            We have documented for him approximately 385



 5   post-blast claims of responsibility or other individuals



 6   involved or threats.  We did that, your Honor, by providing a



 7   list of the serial numbers of the 302's and the inserts which



 8   contained that information; and that's why when Mr. Jones says



 9   we hid this information in the numbers on page 5.  There was no



10   hiding.  What we were doing was listing all of the documents



11   that we had that we believed deal with post-blast claims of



12   responsibility or threats.  So we were -- we put those in the



13   order that they are numbered by 302 and by insert.  For



14   information where there was not an insert or a 302, we then



15   wrote out a summary for the defense.  And that's -- those are



16   some of the summaries that Mr. Jones refers to as not credible



17   or of no interest.



18            Again, some of those summaries are the same



19   information that we found in the intelligence files, your



20   Honor.  Another one deals with the Colombian -- a very infamous



21   Colombian drug dealer and someone claiming that he directed the



22   blast and the bombing.  So after our review of these files and



23   our conversations with the intelligence agencies, we determined



24   that that was the extent of the information that were in their



25   files.







                                                                 388







 1            Now, the defense suggests that for some reason based



 2   on, I guess, his reading of history that these intelligence



 3   agencies and other Government agencies were not cooperative



 4   with us.  That is totally false.  I, of course, cannot vouch



 5   for the fact that someone personally is not withholding a



 6   document.  That is true in every case.  However, everything



 7   that the agencies did, they responded quickly and thoroughly to



 8   our responses.  They allowed us to review all the files.  They



 9   provided the people who did the searches so we could talk to



10   them personally.  There was no indication that they were not



11   willing to disclose that information to us and have it reviewed



12   and if -- if necessary, disclose it ex parte and in camera to



13   the Court for further review.  We have never, as far as I know,



14   received any reluctance by any of these agencies to share the



15   material with us.



16            The issue, I believe, your Honor, comes to whether



17   the -- the other information that Mr. Jones requests is



18   relevant.  It is not that some of the information he requests



19   does not exist.  For example, he asks about terrorist



20   organizations.  He asks about any information about Iraq



21   operating in the Philippines.  I do not know this, but I would



22   assume that some of our intelligence agencies, if it's true,



23   have information about Iraq operating out of the Philippines.



24   The problem with that type of request is how is it relevant to



25   this case?







                                                                 389







 1            THE COURT:  Let me ask you about the procedural



 2   suggestion being made here, which is that we have these 55



 3   items contained in what was identified as a suggested language



 4   for the court order.  You have those, do you?



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, I do, your Honor.



 6            THE COURT:  All right.  Suppose we treated those much



 7   like we would treat interrogatories in a civil case and have



 8   you respond to them with a response, an objection, like



 9   overbroad, or whatever, item by item, and then narrow the focus



10   here in accordance with that response.  Wouldn't that be a way



11   to get to this dispute and resolve it?



12            MS. WILKINSON:  It would, your Honor.  We believe we



13   have done that, all --



14            THE COURT:  Well, not in the form that is being



15   suggested here.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  Well, the difficulty with that, your



17   Honor, is Mr. Jones has done this in several forms.



18            THE COURT:  Well, I realize that.  And that's why I'm



19   talking about this one format.  These 55 items.  I know what



20   your response is going to be on some of them because they are



21   indeed overbroad and not meaningful; but one of the



22   difficulties here I think is that -- and I don't know whether



23   this is a problem -- we do not have -- I have not seen a copy



24   of your letter to an agency.  Your understanding of Brady and



25   Rule 16, you know, I can be confident about, at least at this







                                                                 390







 1   time, since we've discussed it.  But there's no reason for me



 2   to believe or Mr. Jones to believe that the person responding



 3   in an intelligence agency has any notion about what a



 4   prosecutor's obligations are under Brady or Rule 16, so that if



 5   your letter simply referred to those things, that may not be a



 6   meaningful instruction as to what search should be undertaken.



 7            MS. WILKINSON:  It did not refer to those, just to be



 8   clear.  That was a catchall so they did not just produce Brady



 9   information and not give us Jencks statements, for example.



10            THE COURT:  Well, can you share with Mr. Jones the



11   copy of the letter that you sent?



12            MS. WILKINSON:  We would prefer to present it to the



13   Court ex parte and have the Court review it, than Mr. Jones.  I



14   think that would be appropriate, your Honor.



15            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, that's a beginning.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  As I said, we set forth information



17   about the defendants and about other suspects and other issues



18   we thought could relate to the case to help them with their



19   search, not just a one-page letter saying you're aware of



20   Brady, Jencks, and discovery; but the problem is, even with an



21   order that Mr. Jones proposes or your point that they don't



22   understand Brady obligations, that goes back to our point.



23   You're right, they don't, because they don't know the case.



24            THE COURT:  Why would they?



25            MS. WILKINSON:  That's why, of course, we object to







                                                                 391







 1   the sending of letters or subpoenas, because only the



 2   prosecutors know what is Brady in this case.  And we have to



 3   live with our decisions in this case, as you pointed out to us,



 4   now and after the case is completed, so we can't rely on other



 5   people to make those determinations.  All we can do is rely on



 6   other people to collect that information for us and to have us



 7   review it.  And our point is we have done that.  We have done



 8   what the law requires and what the Court is asking.



 9            As to the specific requests Mr. Jones makes, if you



10   want us to go through these 55 responses and say we think they



11   are overbroad, therefore we're not going to respond or we don't



12   have any information, we can do that.



13            THE COURT:  I think that's a good way to proceed.



14            MS. WILKINSON:  That would be fine; and we're going to



15   limit it to these 55 responses -- correct -- because they have



16   changed quite a bit since April 9.



17            THE COURT:  What is before me now and what has been



18   presented in Mr. Jones' argument a few minutes ago is that he



19   wants an order that corresponds to this suggestion.



20            MR. JONES:  Well, I don't want to mislead



21   Ms. Wilkinson.  There is pending before the Court under seal --



22   but they have a copy of it -- an additional six items based on



23   the April 19, 1995 incident which the Court is familiar with,



24   which we did not -- we didn't have those last two reports when



25   we prepared this.  And there are six additional items -- I







                                                                 392







 1   believe three of them relate to, maybe four, to the April 19,



 2   1995, incident.  And I've forgotten what the other two are, but



 3   they are very specific.



 4            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I am familiar with those.



 5   We could deal with those.  I am concerned that Mr. Jones is



 6   referring to this April 19, 1995, incident.  It is not an



 7   incident.  It's a report, an uncorroborated report of



 8   information which we have previously -- discussed previously in



 9   open court, April 9, dealing with Mr. Cannistarro, the



10   information that he reported.  This is all that it is.  The



11   four --



12            THE COURT:  You have submitted in response to that



13   some 302's with a redaction and one without it, I think, to me.



14            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.



15            THE COURT:  And the redactions, as I understand them,



16   are simply source and the dictator of the report.



17            MS. WILKINSON:  That's it, your Honor.  We provided



18   you inserts and reports which are the materials Mr. Jones has



19   already received.  He asks, though, several -- several



20   questions.  One is who is Mr.Cannistarro's.  And we have



21   already told him -- and he's written us in a letter also -- we



22   don't know.  We represent in our brief we don't know the name



23   of his source.



24            Second, he says there's two sources, Mr. Cannistarro



25   and -- we'll call him Source No. 2, who provided us the same







                                                                 393







 1   information.  As we have said to the Court in our brief and to



 2   Mr. Jones, that second source, which is documented in the



 3   insert provided to Mr. Jones or to the 302, says that source



 4   got his information also from Mr. Cannistarro.  So in other



 5   words, Mr. Cannistarro had the information, gave it to the



 6   Government, gave it to Source No. 2; and Source No. 2 came back



 7   and said I've got information, I got it from Mr. Cannistarro,



 8   you shouldn't consider this independent corroboration.  That's



 9   all it is.  So as to those additional questions, those are the



10   answers.



11            He also asks us, I believe, for intercepts of



12   Mr. Nichols overseas, and we've already reported to the Court



13   under Alderman that we have no intercepts other than what we've



14   already disclosed these defendants.  So that's the answer to



15   that question.  But we'll --



16            THE COURT:  Does that get us back to the 55 here,



17   Mr. Jones?



18            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure it's all of them.



19   Mr. Jones -- we can talk about it afterwards to make sure.



20            MR. JONES:  Well -- shall I just wait until she



21   finishes?



22            THE COURT:  Well, I asked you directly, so, you know,



23   you said six items and I have in my mind three being that the



24   302's --



25            MR. JONES:  Yes.







                                                                 394







 1            THE COURT:  -- or the inserts as correctly -- have



 2   been corrected.



 3            MR. JONES:  The requests were based upon what was



 4   contained in the 302's.



 5            THE COURT:  Yes.  And she's now amplified the



 6   response.



 7            MR. JONES:  Except that I find it difficult to believe



 8   that the Government doesn't know who Mr. Cannistarro's source



 9   is by asking him; but even if they don't, the source is



10   sufficiently specific that it can only be one of a very small



11   group of people in that country.  The Court will recall that it



12   identified a certain rank and a certain organization and a



13   certain function.  Now, the Government surely has a list of the



14   four, five, or six people.  I mean, how many generals are there



15   in country Y charged with this specific function?



16            THE COURT:  There are some places where they hand out



17   a lot of brass.



18            MR. JONES:  I understand that.  But I don't believe in



19   the context of this particular agency that would be true.  So



20   if it's three or four names, then I -- because I'd like to



21   interview that person.



22            THE COURT:  Yeah.  I understand the reason.



23            MR. JONES:  And I don't want to --



24            THE COURT:  Well, I think you can discuss that



25   further.







                                                                 395







 1            MR. JONES:  May I respond to the Court also that there



 2   is a letter -- and it was the September 27 letter -- and this



 3   is the document that I was referring to earlier when I said



 4   that there had been some corroboration of this source.  On page



 5   3, there is a reference to a paragraph that begins "Unknown."



 6   That paragraph specifically appears to confirm the information



 7   of the April 19 incident.  But it's a call from a place in this



 8   country, not abroad.  But my concern is the last sentence in



 9   this letter from -- I believe it's Ms. Wilkinson's letter --



10   that's also the letter that transmitted the Belgian telephone



11   conversation which occurred, I believe, approximately a year



12   and a half before.



13            Yes, Ms. Wilkinson's letter.  She says we will provide



14   additional information if appropriate.  I ask that additional



15   information be provided.  I believe that clearly, whatever



16   burden we've had, we've met it with respect to the April 19.



17   And whatever information they have -- and I'll pass the letter



18   so the Court can see -- I think I'm entitled to it.  May I?



19            THE COURT:  Ms. Wilkinson, is that disputed?



20            MS. WILKINSON:  No, your Honor.  It says right in the



21   letter, "Additional information regarding this claim of



22   responsibility has been requested from the field office.  We



23   will provide additional information if appropriate."  So if we



24   get additional information, we've notified him of that.



25            THE COURT:  Well, have you received additional







                                                                 396







 1   information?



 2            MS. WILKINSON:  Not as far as I'm aware.  But we just



 3   sent this letter, your Honor, September 27.



 4            THE COURT:  So you will follow that up?



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, sir.  And I'll reply on that.



 6            MR. JONES:  I'm just concerned about the words "if



 7   appropriate.  "I don't know what she means by "appropriate."



 8   If she said if it exists, I would understand that; but



 9   "appropriate" suggests, again, some kind of screening process.



10            THE COURT:  Well, what did you mean by "if



11   appropriate?"



12            MS. WILKINSON:  I've learned to review the documents,



13   your Honor, before I make any representations about whether it



14   should be disclosed.



15            THE COURT:  All right.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  That's all I meant.



17            THE COURT:  If you take the position that it should



18   not be disclosed, then that, I think, should be the subject of



19   like a protective order.



20            MS. WILKINSON:  We'll Submit it to the Court.



21            THE COURT:  Under 16(d), I think it is.



22            MS. WILKINSON:  Sure.



23            THE COURT:  And we'll follow that procedure.  You



24   know, we -- I shouldn't say "we" -- we get.  There is a



25   confusion about when you're under 16 and when, therefore, you







                                                                 397







 1   should proceed with a protective order motion under -- I think



 2   it's subsection (d).  And then what do you do about CIPA -- or



 3   CIPA?  And those are different procedures.  But I think we can



 4   converge them, really, and say under 16(d)(d), the reason for



 5   16(d)'s protective order is that it's also classified



 6   information and can only be produced in redacted form or



 7   whatever position you're going to take under CIPA.



 8            MS. WILKINSON:  As far as -- you know, your Honor,



 9   this isn't classified information.  The letter Mr. Jones is



10   referring to --



11            THE COURT:  I'm talking about an overall approach.



12   And I think that's consistent with what we're suggesting here,



13   what I'm suggesting now, following up on Mr. Jones' request



14   that there be some kind of discovery order.  And, you know, I



15   think we should have a clarification of the record as to where



16   we are and so I'm going to direct that you respond to these 55



17   items in this suggested language for the Court order.



18            MS. WILKINSON:  And in response, your Honor, for



19   example, turning to number 7, if you could look at that on the



20   proposed order --



21            THE COURT:  I have it.



22            MS. WILKINSON:  -- he asks for any information records



23   or tangible objects specifically concerning an individual's



24   travels from the U.S. to France and/or Germany and/or Great



25   Britain and/or Canada.  We have provided a 302 concerning this







                                                                 398







 1   individual.  But I just want to advise the Court I believe the



 2   Court will have to get involved because we're going to say



 3   that's overbroad without any other information.  It's



 4   conducting his investigation.



 5            THE COURT:  I know.  Yeah.  I'm not sure here, just to



 6   take that as an example, whether we're talking about records in



 7   a passport office, a customs agency office or what.  But once



 8   we get the scope narrowed down, we can deal with the specific



 9   objections, I think.



10            MS. WILKINSON:  And your Honor, we would point the



11   defense back to the case they cited to you, which is United 



12   States vs. Ollison and it says when talking about the



13   production of documents, defendant can't simply identify



14   information that he wishes to have and expect to receive that



15   information without making an attempt to show why it is germane



16   to the defense of his case.



17            THE COURT:  And therein, we get into the most awkward



18   aspect of this -- well, strike most awkward -- an awkward



19   aspect of this, which is that the materiality being suggested



20   by the defense has been submitted ex parte and under seal.



21   Somewhere along the way, we've got to have communication here



22   between the parties.



23            MS. WILKINSON:  That was going to be my next point,



24   your Honor.  That while we have tried to address many of the



25   defense's requests and as he points out, I believe that he has







                                                                 399







 1   written us over 130 letters, we, of course, have counted that



 2   up and we received approximately 132 from the defense, from the



 3   McVeigh team and 23 from the Nichols team and we've responded



 4   with 181 letters which we've averaged out maybe for our own



 5   entertainment, but it's basically, you know, almost one a day,



 6   so we have been trying to respond to many of these requests,



 7   whether they are for classified or unclassified information.



 8            THE COURT:  Well, if we get your responses and then we



 9   get further on this, as I'm sure we will, then it seems to me



10   that one of the Court's responses might be, well, I've looked



11   at what you, Mr. Jones, have submitted to me as to your showing



12   of materiality, I can't determine whether it's material or



13   whether it isn't material and you're going to have to make a



14   choice of disclosing that to the Government so that we can deal



15   with it or we'll just have to say that I can't enter an order



16   on this specific item.



17            MS. WILKINSON:  We understand the Court's procedure



18   and obviously, we accept that.  We would request that we could



19   receive that information which we have done all along only so



20   that we could argue -- or be more informed.  I understand from



21   what Mr. Jones has said that he has traveled around the world



22   to try and collect this information so he's provided that to



23   the Court.  Obviously, we're at a disadvantage because we don't



24   have the details that he possesses.



25            THE COURT:  I'm at a disadvantage because I can't







                                                                 400







 1   determine without more information whether it truly is material



 2   or no and, you know, I haven't read everything that's been



 3   submitted there because I anticipated that as a result of



 4   today's hearing, I would have a better procedural approach to



 5   it than simply wading through all of that and attempting to



 6   determine or make some preliminary determination regarding



 7   materiality.  That's why I think that the next step being your



 8   response to these 55, we will be able to make progress and get



 9   to those particular points that require my intervention.  You



10   know, I'd love to say, well, I'm going to turn all this over to



11   somebody else to referee it.  Nobody else can do it.  It's my



12   job.



13            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, one thing I would just



14   like to clarify.  Mr. Jones also suggested to you a general



15   order to the intelligence agency, which I assume from your



16   decision today or our agreement is that that's not necessary at



17   this point.



18            THE COURT:  Not going to happen today.



19            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  Also, he suggested that he



20   would provide two experts to review classified documents if



21   they are discovered.  Again, I would assume that that's going



22   to be held in abeyance.



23            THE COURT:  That's right.  We'll see whether that's



24   something that is necessary and then if so, is it feasible, are



25   there other solutions.







                                                                 401







 1            MS. WILKINSON:  We would just like to be heard on that



 2   if the Court considers it.



 3            THE COURT:  Sure, but first things first and I think



 4   the first thing is for you to respond to these 55 items.



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  We'll be glad to.



 6            THE COURT:  When?



 7            MS. WILKINSON:  We can do it in a week.  How about by



 8   next Friday?



 9            THE COURT:  That's fine.



10            MS. WILKINSON:  Great.



11            MR. JONES:  May I respond briefly, your Honor?



12            THE COURT:  Yes, but I hope we've made progress here,



13   Mr. Jones.



14            MR. JONES:  I will be frank with the Court, I suspect



15   we have not, but I will await and see if my fears are



16   unjustified.  I would like to ask and I understood the Court to



17   order them to give you the letter and I would -- I have no



18   objection to that.  If the Court feels that there is nothing in



19   that letter that would violate national security, I ask that a



20   copy of the letter be given to us under protective order so



21   that we might file an appropriate memorandum with the Court on



22   whether we think the letter was insufficient.



23            THE COURT:  Well, Ms. Wilkinson, can you supply -- I



24   don't know whether there are different forms of this letter



25   that go to different agencies.  Whatever.  You submit those to







                                                                 402







 1   me ex parte.  I will then determine whether I believe they



 2   should go to the other side.  If I say that they -- if I think



 3   that they do, I will issue an order to show cause on the



 4   Government why you shouldn't send copies under appropriate



 5   protective orders.



 6            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  Obviously, we would



 7   object or we would suggest to you that you not order us to turn



 8   those over because those are internal communications.



 9            THE COURT:  Yeah.  And I wouldn't do that without



10   giving you an opportunity to object to it.  But here again, you



11   know, I'm at the disadvantage of only seeing a little narrow



12   focus on a very broad scene.



13            MR. JONES:  From her description of the letter as I



14   listened to it, it sounded like that it mainly was asking them



15   about Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols and then it was a general



16   description of Brady and Rule 16.



17            THE COURT:  Let's don't guess about what's in the



18   letter.  I'll know what's in the letter and then I'll be able



19   to determine what I think is appropriate.



20            MR. JONES:  With respect to her response on Alderman,



21   again, that's not quite the issue.  Alderman has to do with



22   standing to have access to tape recordings or interceptions,



23   rather, for which you may want to file a motion to suppress.



24   So the tapes could exist of the intercepts, but I don't have



25   motion -- standing to suppress them.







                                                                 403







 1            THE COURT:  Is there an item in here?



 2            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  It will --



 3            THE COURT:  In the 55?



 4            MR. JONES:  I believe that it's generally in 55, but



 5   there's a specific letter to her.



 6            THE COURT:  Let me -- I don't want to deal with the



 7   letters now.  You've asked for an order.  I want to enter an



 8   order.  I have entered an order.  The order is to respond to



 9   the 55 items in the suggested order.  Was this filed under



10   seal?



11            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.



12            THE COURT:  All right.



13            MR. JONES:  May I have leave of Court to add the four



14   telephone numbers?



15            THE COURT:  The four telephone numbers.  Well, give me



16   number 56 in seal and -- and to Ms. Wilkinson and she'll



17   respond to number 56, too.  How's that?



18            MR. JONES:  Your Honor -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.



19            THE COURT:  I think it's your turn.



20            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  Certainly, the argument that



21   could be made and again to go to number 7, although in



22   fairness, this is an individual that was blocked from two of



23   these countries and he has been a suspect -- I believe was a



24   suspect and may have even been the subject of a wiretap order



25   in the investigation concerning the assassination of Judge







                                                                 404







 1   Vance, so this isn't somebody that they don't know who it is.



 2            THE COURT:  I know, but as I pointed out, looking at



 3   the language of 7, it's not clear to me and if I were doing



 4   this -- and of course, I don't know as much about the United



 5   States Government and its agencies as counsel here do, but I



 6   wouldn't know whether I'm supposed to contact the passport, the



 7   customs -- there are a lot of different agencies who would have



 8   information about travel abroad.



 9            MR. JONES:  That's our problem.  We don't know,



10   either.  I mean, conceivably, we identified ten of them.  I



11   could have put the ten in there.  Then of course, there may be



12   an 11th one that I don't know anything about.  One that -- No.



13   20, if your Honor would look at that for a moment.



14            THE COURT:  All right.



15            MR. JONES:  That's one that she has specifically said



16   they have but will not give.  That representation was made



17   earlier and I understand with respect to No. 20 that there are



18   actually two memos from the U.S. Marshal's Service, one



19   relating to threats in the heartland of the country or the



20   Midwest and the other relating to threats on the northeast



21   corridor, so to speak, but it seems to me that a memo sent a



22   month before the bombing of the Murrah Building which is a



23   Federal Building in Oklahoma City which specifically advises of



24   the possibility of a worldwide terrorist event -- and that memo



25   is described in more detail -- is clearly something that would







                                                                 405







 1   be relevant and material to our defense and we've not received



 2   that and that's just one --



 3            THE COURT:  Well, again, I'm not going to take these



 4   items up now one by one.  We'll go according to the procedure



 5   that I've ordered.



 6            MR. JONES:  Very well, thank you.  Your Honor.



 7            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll take a recess.  My



 8   patience is wearing a little thin.  I need to take a deep



 9   breath.  20 minutes.



10       (Recess at 3:04 p.m.)



11       (Reconvened at 3:25 p.m.)



12            THE COURT:  Please be seated.



13            Mr. Jones?



14            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, just before the recess, your



15   Honor said I believe the Latin term -- and Mr. Tigar will



16   correct me if I'm wrong -- soto voto (sic) -- silently,



17   quietly?



18            THE COURT:  Soft voice?



19            MR. JONES:  Soft voice.  That's right; that your



20   Honor's patience was wearing out and you were getting tired,



21   and I just wondered what other case you were talking about.



22            I also wanted --



23            THE COURT:  I'm refreshed now.



24            MR. JONES:  I also wanted to advise the Court that



25   during the recess, I caught what we used to call down in Texas







                                                                 406







 1   "unshirted hell" from various members of the defense team about



 2   my comment concerning housewives from Texas; so perhaps I



 3   should abridge it and say an unidentified female telephoned the



 4   place where the call was made.



 5            And third, after consultation with Mr. Hankins and



 6   Mr. Wyatt, who reminded me that I should never say we haven't



 7   made any progress after the Court has just entered an order



 8   that I asked you to do, which I believe was my response -- so



 9   after having put some cold water in my face by them and sobered



10   up a little bit, I believe that they advanced a good



11   suggestion.



12            And I'd like to ask leave of Court to file a



13   specific -- more specific -- and I'll narrow down the focus of



14   the 56 and I'll say what agencies we think have what records;



15   so, for example, in Item 7 it would be passport office, FAA,



16   whatever, so that they don't have to go to the Coast Guard.



17            And I won't change the list.  I mean I'll change it in



18   the sense it will be more narrow where I can and I'll identify



19   the specific agencies that I think may have that record and



20   that will facilitate their response and narrow the issue.



21            THE COURT:  So we're going to change the timing on



22   this?



23            MR. JONES:  I just want five days to do it and then



24   whatever time they need after that.



25            THE COURT:  All right.  Five days is in, what --







                                                                 407







 1   you're talking about real time or work days or what kind of



 2   five days?



 3            MR. JONES:  CJA-hour time, your Honor.



 4            THE COURT:  That's 24 hours around the clock.



 5            MR. JONES:  Only 24?



 6            THE COURT:  So what are we talking about?



 7            MR. JONES:  Wednesday.



 8            THE COURT:  The 8th or 9th?



 9            MR. JONES:  How about Wednesday.



10            THE COURT:  Okay.  October 9.



11            And, Ms. Wilkinson, the 16th?



12            MS. WILKINSON:  I assume that's a week, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  A week, yeah.  Seven days.



14            MS. WILKINSON:  That's fine, your Honor.



15            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, as a further way to expedite



16   the hearing this afternoon and following through on your



17   Honor's suggestion, we filed a document, which is in the public



18   record, on August 30 styled Defendant McVeigh's motion pursuant



19   to Rule 16 for discovery and inspection with supporting



20   authority.



21            The Government filed a combined response to that



22   motion and the Brady motion.  But this motion also in



23   specifically enumerated paragraphs asks for specific things.



24            The Government did not reply paragraph by paragraph;



25   but as Ms. Wilkinson advised the Court, they have supplemented







                                                                 408







 1   the forensic material given to us by giving and delivering to



 2   us along with a letter what she describes as lab notes.



 3            Now, it's not clear to me from reading her letter --



 4   and I've not reviewed the material and obviously will have to



 5   send it to our experts -- what all is covered by lab notes.  I



 6   suspect it does not cover things like chain of custody and



 7   contamination issues; but I don't know that because I haven't



 8   reviewed it.  But I wouldn't think ordinarily when you say lab



 9   notes that would be included.



10            I would be prepared at this time to forego my argument



11   on the Rule 16 motion filed August 30 if the Court would simply



12   enter an order, which I think is similar to the one you just



13   entered, asking the Government to respond to each of the



14   enumerated paragraphs as whether to produce, will be produced,



15   won't be produced, don't understand, or overbroad, so that we



16   can narrow down what the issues are, rather than my filing a



17   motion asking for specific items by paragraph and getting back



18   a general response that doesn't address it paragraph by



19   paragraph.



20            And if that's agreeable with the Court, then I'll



21   simply move on to the next issue.



22            THE COURT:  I'm looking for the numbers here.



23            MR. JONES:  I believe it's No. 1956.



24            THE COURT:  Yeah.  I have that.  But I'm looking



25   for -- what you're talking about is paragraph numbering.







                                                                 409







 1            MR. JONES:  Well, let me take the clip off here.



 2            What we did was combine the list with legal authority.



 3            THE COURT:  Yes.  I know you did.  And you got items



 4   and then by number and then alphabetical subtopics.



 5            MR. JONES:  In an attempt to -- perhaps I can give an



 6   aid to the prosecution.



 7            Mr. Wyatt was kind enough to prepare for me --



 8            THE COURT:  I think maybe these start at page 21, now



 9   that I'm looking at it.



10            MR. JONES:  All right, sir.  Let me just look back at



11   21.



12            THE COURT:  And there are categories and subitems



13   under the categories.



14            MR. JONES:  Yes, that's correct.  What I was going to



15   say was that there was a redacted 16-page summary of them that



16   makes it a little easier and summarizes what they are, but



17   that's not actually on file.  What's on file is a motion.



18            But if they could respond just as they are with



19   respect to the national intelligence motion in that fashion,



20   then we could considerably, perhaps, narrow what the dispute is



21   and then work it out among ourselves.  And of course one of the



22   reasons that I'm hesitant to argue this motion today is that a



23   lot of it does go to the lab issues, and some of the very



24   material here may be in the boxes that they have delivered.



25            THE COURT:  Well, Ms. Wilkinson, are you -- do you







                                                                 410







 1   have a ready familiarity with these -- this pleading and these



 2   items?



 3            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, I do, your Honor.  I'd like to



 4   respond before you --



 5            THE COURT:  Before I order you?



 6            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.



 7            THE COURT:  You have the due process right to respond.



 8              PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS



 9            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we would object very



10   strongly to having to respond to these demands, and I'll tell



11   the Court why.  If you look at the requests yourself, you can



12   see that many of these involve records that we have already



13   produced which we have described for the Court back on April 9.



14   For example, if you turn to page 24, he asked for copies of all



15   hotel/motel records for the period from September 1, '94, to



16   April 30, 1995, and lists approximately 31 names.



17            For us, your Honor, to go back and review what we've



18   turned over and how we've turned it over and whether we've



19   turned over all of these materials that he's asked would take



20   us months.  I mean we have -- we have responded to a specific



21   request; but what defense has asked us to do is now assure him



22   that all the records in the way he's described them have been



23   produced.  And that's why we've been having some of these



24   disputes.  They have been and we've been responding when they



25   ask for specific information.







                                                                 411







 1            But for us to go back and categorize the



 2   information -- that's what they're asking you to order us to



 3   do, categorize, do their job, categorize the information for



 4   them.  We have provided the indices.  It we have provided the



 5   threats and claims of responsibilities.  We have provided a new



 6   CD-ROM which has been cleaned up pursuant to Mr. Jones' and



 7   Mr. Tigar's request.  We have provided another computer system



 8   called ACCESS which allows them to do data base searches.  I



 9   won't bore the Court because I know how the Court feels about



10   computers, but it enables them to do searches and prepare



11   reports on the datas.  That's on the 302's, the inserts and the



12   1Bs which are the physical descriptions of the evidence we've



13   given them.



14            THE COURT:  So the problem here is you categorize



15   these or classify them in one fashion and the defense in a



16   different fashion, apparently.



17            MS. WILKINSON:  And then in their papers, as you can



18   see, they criticize us for how we categorize them, or they



19   argue that we provided new information, updated indices, or



20   they disagree with the way we've described the information to



21   them and whether it's complete, so we're kind of in a bad



22   position either way.  If we provide more of that detailed



23   information, they'll come back and say to us no, you didn't



24   give us the answer to this or you didn't include all the



25   information or it was not substantial and it wasn't accurately







                                                                 412







 1   described, or the reverse.



 2            You could turn to a lot of these examples, your Honor,



 3   and see how burdensome they would be, or they're beyond the



 4   scope of discovery.  So before you order us to respond to all



 5   of these, your Honor, which we believe are the defense's way of



 6   maintaining for appellate purposes all of their requests in all



 7   kind of detail -- even though they acknowledge in their papers



 8   we provided all of these, we'd have to go back and recategorize



 9   all the discovery we've produced.  And we have found in



10   reviewing the defense's papers that the problem is -- and I'm



11   sure it's because they have a lot of work to do -- they have



12   not reviewed a lot of the information we've given them.



13            For example, in their discovery brief on page 8, or



14   their motion to compel, they claim that the Government has



15   produced hundreds of videotapes and that we have not marked



16   them in any way for them to determine whether there is any



17   relevancy.



18            Your Honor, for the past six months, we have been



19   providing 302's where agents sit down, review the videotape and



20   write up a report.  They write the 1B number so the defense



21   will know which videotape they're talking about.  They describe



22   the contents of the video, the length of the video, and whether



23   the video has any evidentiary value.  Obviously, that's from



24   our perspective; but they have those 302's.  So they're not



25   even looking at the 302's they have which -- where we've done







                                                                 413







 1   this review, this summary of the information we've provided to



 2   them.



 3            THE COURT:  Now, have you provided whatever -- I guess



 4   it's called software -- whatever software you have that



 5   classifies or categorizes the material in your data base of



 6   information?  I mean --



 7            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure I understand.



 8            THE COURT:  No, I don't -- I can understand why you



 9   don't understand me because I don't understand the question;



10   but somewhere along the way, you know, it's been called to my



11   attention that you have -- first of all, the FBI, I guess, had



12   ways to identify things with queue numbers and so forth.



13            MS. WILKINSON:  We've provided all that, what we call



14   the master queuing K list.



15            THE COURT:  And someone has undertaken to inventory a



16   lot of material using some software technique so that you can



17   access it without thumbing through it all.



18            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  For example, we have a list.



19   Very simple, really, a list of all the physical evidence; and



20   that's what we call the 1Bs.  We've provided that list to them



21   in several formats, in hard copy on these two different disks



22   so they can do the searches I'm talking about, so if they



23   wanted to run the name of an explosives component and see where



24   that's listed on the 1B list, they could print out a report



25   giving them all the 1Bs, all the pieces of evidence that are







                                                                 414







 1   described in that fashion.  That's the same thing we do and



 2   that's the same way we search for that information, so we have



 3   provided them with computer software, as you're calling it,



 4   that allows them to do the search.



 5            I think Mr. Nichols' team has used it quite



 6   successfully; and in fact one of our discovery specialists was



 7   over there two weeks ago helping them design these reports,



 8   these searches.  And I think they've said that they find it



 9   quite useful.



10            MR. WOODS:  She's greatly overstating the aspect of



11   how we have utilized it.



12            Now, we've been able to utilize it.  The inserts, as



13   she said, were on CD-ROM.  Those aren't on CD-ROM.  Many of the



14   other things she's representing to the Court are not correct.



15            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I don't want to get into a



16   disagreement, but I believe that Mr. Nichols' paralegal staff



17   will back us up.  I'm not talking about the CD-ROM.  We just



18   put the information on another system called ACCESS, and that's



19   the searches that we have worked with their paralegals on



20   doing.  The point is, they can search the information and come



21   up with the reports just the way we can.



22            When they have specific requests, your Honor, we



23   respond to them.  But this task that Mr. Jones is asking you to



24   order us to undertake is really burdensome and is really asking



25   us to do the job of the defense counsel.  And I'm afraid that







                                                                 415







 1   even if we were to do that, (1) that doesn't relieve the



 2   defense of its burden under effective assistance of counsel to



 3   do it itself, and (2) they don't want to rely on our summaries.



 4   They've told us they don't like our summaries of the telephone



 5   records because we found errors in that.  They question our



 6   categorization of information and Brady information; so if you



 7   order us to do this, they're only going to come back and tell



 8   us that we didn't do an adequate job and therefore they relied



 9   on it and they need extra time and they've been, you know, put



10   at a disadvantage.



11            THE COURT:  This is a bit off of the immediate point,



12   but there was one thing I observed in going through some of



13   this material that was somewhat surprising to me, and that is



14   that there have been some showings here that 302's were



15   dictated apparently months after the interview or the activity



16   for which the report has been made.  That surprises me.



17            MS. WILKINSON:  I can explain that to the Court.  What



18   happened, obviously early on in the investigation, thousands of



19   agents were involved all across the country; and the FBI has a



20   procedure where, while they had an agent in Oklahoma City, if



21   there was a lead to pursue in another jurisdiction, they send



22   out a request.



23            The agent then -- let's say an agent in California is



24   going to interview a Mr. Smith.  He will write a teletype back



25   to the FBI, to Oklahoma City, saying, I'm going to follow up on







                                                                 416







 1   the lead and interview Mr. Smith.



 2            As we were reviewing all of our files to make sure



 3   we've disclosed everything to the defense -- and we've been



 4   doing this for many months -- we found there were teletypes



 5   where someone had reported they had interviewed someone but we



 6   didn't get the 302.  So the FBI went back to those individuals,



 7   which was quite a few 302's, and said we never received your



 8   302, and then either we got it later or the person never did



 9   one; and then they dictated the 302 at that time and sent it in



10   so we could document all of these interviews, which is exactly,



11   I believe, what the defense wants done.



12            So because there are thousands of agents involved,



13   you're right, some of those are being produced to this day.



14   And we're engaged in this process constantly where we find old



15   302's that were either generated early on in the investigation



16   because of the kind of massive nature of the investigation or



17   because people didn't follow up; and we're going back through



18   our files and ensuring that they do follow up.  And that's an



19   ongoing process, your Honor.  I believe we've made a lot of



20   progress on that, but that's something we're responsible to do



21   I think throughout the investigation, throughout the case.



22            THE COURT:  So presumably those people are going back



23   and reconstructing from field notes or whatever.



24            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  I mean there is a variety of



25   examples.  Either they never dictated the 302 from their notes







                                                                 417







 1   or they did and it was never sent in to us or they dictated it



 2   but it was never finalized.



 3            THE COURT:  Well, a lot of them -- strike a lot of



 4   them.  I have noticed some where the date of dictation is



 5   months after the event being recorded.



 6            MS. WILKINSON:  It's my understanding that that's what



 7   that comes from; that we followed up with the teletypes where



 8   they told us they were going to interview people and



 9   sometimes -- a lot of those are ones of little consequence,



10   more the insert type; and we went back and said we need to have



11   the interview document.  And they did that and we provided



12   them; and that's why you would get that late dictation date, in



13   contrast to the date of the interview.



14            THE COURT:  So they just weren't keeping up with the



15   paperwork.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  And as I'm sure the Court can



17   imagine -- I mean at that time, you know, there is over 10,000



18   FBI agents.  A large percentage were working on this case in



19   those weeks after the bombing.



20            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, may I just remind



21   Ms. Wilkinson of one exception that may have come to your



22   attention?



23            THE COURT:  All right.



24            MR. HARTZLER:  Cannistarro, the classified information



25   came in first.  Is that not right?







                                                                 418







 1            MS. WILKINSON:  One of the 302's about the information



 2   from Mr. Cannistarro, not the insert, the agent went out or



 3   received the information, then -- he never dictated it.  A year



 4   later, he went out and recontacted Mr. Cannistarro and then he



 5   dictated the report; so it will show the contact as of



 6   April 19.  Then it shows a contact, I believe, after the Time



 7   magazine article came out, another contact, and then the report



 8   was dictated; and that would be why you have these, I don't



 9   know what it is, 12 or 13 months after the date of the crime.



10            THE COURT:  Some of them, I noted, too, related to one



11   or two of the witnesses that we had at the suppression hearing,



12   and they were dictated shortly before the suppression hearing.



13            MS. WILKINSON:  And that's that same process where



14   they, for whatever reason, did not do their 302, and it wasn't



15   as if -- I mean -- give the agencies some credit, give the



16   FBI -- they were going back to check their paperwork to make



17   sure these weren't getting lost; that these people weren't



18   doing the interviews or did the interviews and hadn't



19   documented the interview.  And we've produced them over the



20   past couple months that way, tried to explain that to the



21   defense and the Court.



22            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I think we're at



23   something of an impasse is this matter of who does the



24   classification or categorization, or whatever is the apt word.



25   And the Government's position is we shouldn't have to do it in







                                                                 419







 1   the manner in which the defense asks it.



 2            Now, I have the heard from counsel for Mr. Nichols on



 3   this point, but I see Mr. Tigar rising.



 4            MR. TIGAR:  I had not expected to want to speak, but



 5   now that we've reached this point, we would like to be heard



 6   very briefly, your Honor.



 7            THE COURT:  All right.



 8            MS. WILKINSON:  Could I finish my argument?



 9            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, of course.  I didn't mean to



10   interrupt.



11            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure Mr. Jones kind of got to



12   finish, either.



13            THE COURT:  We're kind of going around on this because



14   we're in something of a spin, here.



15            MS. WILKINSON:  Why don't I let Mr. Tigar address this



16   point, and then I'll get back up.



17            THE COURT:  All right.



18            MR. JONES:  I would like to be heard at some point on



19   whose obligation it is to submit the index, because I think



20   there is some case law that that speaks to that.



21            THE COURT:  All right.



22          DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS



23            MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, we did weigh in on



24   one aspect of this at Docket No. 1983, which is not on the



25   list.  That was our report with respect to the expert witness







                                                                 420







 1   production.  Now, as to that, I had had a meeting with the



 2   Government and demanded a lot of backup material.  They



 3   refused.  Mr. McVeigh moved, we moved and filed papers; and now



 4   the Government says, Well, we're producing these boxes and we



 5   have a procedure for going after that information and we'll



 6   come back to the Court on that.



 7            But where we're led by this discussion is that we now



 8   see that Mr. -- I think Mr. Jones' proposal is a reasonable



 9   proposal; that is, that the Government respond to this detailed



10   list that he has put forward, and this is the reason:  We have



11   a lot of experience on our team, including Mr. Woods' years of



12   experience as a special agent of the FBI.  And our impression



13   is that in a big case of this kind, it is absolutely unusual



14   and contrary to bureau procedure -- certainly when Mr. Hoover



15   was alive it was -- not to have these 302's delayed in this



16   manner.  That's why we asked Mr. Hartzler, Day 1, let's keep



17   these agent field notes where they are.  We don't know now



18   whether there are agent field notes or whether these agents,



19   months after the fact, are simply dictating these things.



20            With respect to the expert witnesses, we've had to go



21   through this time after time after time, just to figure out if



22   we need to retain our own expert.



23            If the Government is in control of their case -- and



24   certainly they have enough personnel to be in control of their



25   case -- then they are in control of what they have produced and







                                                                 421







 1   haven't produced.



 2            If that's the case, then it doesn't seem terribly much



 3   of a burden for them to respond to a discovery request by



 4   saying we already produced it, it's there, or it hasn't been



 5   produced or it's been produced in another form or whatever,



 6   simply to give an accounting.  And it is the failure of the



 7   Government to respond in a point-by-point way from the



 8   beginning that has led us to where we are right now; and



 9   therefore, I think that what Mr. Jones has as an idea is a



10   reasonable one.



11            I will say that the Government has in informal



12   discussions come a long way.  It is true that they've come over



13   and worked with our paralegals to put programs on our computer



14   and work with us to try to resolve these problems, and we hope



15   that that goes forward and we'll continue to participate in it;



16   but having an accounting in the here and now, 1, 2, 3, 4,



17   that's what we produced or didn't produce, does seem to us to



18   be a necessary and useful exercise.



19            THE COURT:  Well, suppose the Government submits,



20   including to the Court under seal if it has to be, because of



21   the discovery aspect of it, consistent with the April whatever



22   date order about sealed material -- identify what you have



23   produced by your classification instead of just saying we



24   produced everything as we get it.  There has to be, I think,



25   some sense of orderliness about what material has been







                                                                 422







 1   produced, sort of like an inventory.  And if you got an



 2   inventory that differs from their inventory, I don't have any



 3   problem with your producing your inventory -- I'm using words



 4   here that may not be appropriate -- and they can check it



 5   against this; but we need somebody to say what is the universe



 6   of material that got submitted.



 7            MR. TIGAR:  I'm sorry, Ms. Wilkinson.



 8            May I make one more observation before she responds?



 9            THE COURT:  Yes.



10            MR. TIGAR:  And that is we welcome an open file



11   spirit; but open file fails, flunks, unless there is some



12   accountability as to what has and hasn't been produced.  It



13   just creates a mess.  And in fact I wish I could ask D.A. Coats



14   about that, because he tried a case, the Stafford case in



15   Oklahoma, where at the end of the day the Brady thing turned



16   into multiple months of hearings because his office had an open



17   file policy and couldn't tell what they had produced and hadn't



18   produced.



19            THE COURT:  And some of the cases there talk about



20   it's not a response under Brady or Rule 16 to say here's our



21   files, Go fish.



22            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor; but that is our position



23   with respect to --



24            THE COURT:  Okay, Ms. Wilkinson.



25          PLAINTIFF'S FURTHER ARGUMENT ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS







                                                                 423







 1            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we haven't done that.  We



 2   haven't just given our files and said, Go fish.



 3            THE COURT:  I know.



 4            MS. WILKINSON:  If you look in the boxes that



 5   Mr. Jones brought it in, there is an inventory produced each



 6   month, each time we produce a separate inventory, saying here's



 7   what you're receiving.



 8            THE COURT:  Well, you see, I don't have that.



 9            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  But I'm saying if the defense



10   is resaying this is what we're requesting you to do, they have



11   that.  They've been getting the indices by the names of the



12   witnesses and the 302's.



13            THE COURT:  What I'm about to suggest is that you



14   provide for me these inventories and then I can determine



15   whether I think that's an appropriate response to what's at



16   issue here, rather than recategorizing to fit the particular



17   format that the defense wants.  That's -- I think that's where



18   we are, and that seems to me to be the divide here.



19            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we'll be happy to produce



20   the inventories as well as the indices.  Just so you know --



21            THE COURT:  Don't put them in CD-ROM.



22            MS. WILKINSON:  No, no.



23            THE COURT:  Hard copy.



24            MS. WILKINSON:  I realize that's not going to help



25   with your Honor.







                                                                 424







 1            Just so you understand, the one inventory for this



 2   production is approximately 400 pages.  So we'll produce all



 3   the inventories we have since January -- we have receipts for



 4   every piece of evidence that these defendants ever received and



 5   we have the indices; and we'll produce that all to the Court



 6   and bring over our boxes and drive a truck up to the courthouse



 7   and produce it for the Court.



 8            MR. WOODS:  The Court can go fish.



 9            MR. JONES:  May I respond now, your Honor?



10            THE COURT:  I was about to respond to that myself, but



11   I withheld comment.



12            Yes, Mr. Jones.



13      DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S FURTHER ARGUMENT ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS



14            MR. JONES:  I think, your Honor, there are two issues



15   that are being perhaps confused; and I was going to say this in



16   the Brady but I'll say it now.  There is no question in my mind



17   that in some areas, the Government's production has been



18   exemplary; and I say so -- there is an FBI -- she's not an



19   agent; I have forgotten what the title or protocol is -- named



20   Linda Vernon, who has been extremely professional, helpful and



21   courteous.  And certainly it is true that we have written 132



22   letters and they responded to 180.  But the problem that I have



23   so often with Ms. Wilkinson's statements is they don't tell the



24   full story, as I see it, because the full story on the letters



25   is that some of them went a year without being answered.  If







                                                                 425







 1   you just look at the numbers and say, well, we wrote 132 and we



 2   responded with 180, that sounds impressive.  But if you say,



 3   well, you got a letter in October and you responded in March,



 4   that's less impressive.



 5            Just like the statement mentioned just a moment ago --



 6   and in fact, I wrote it down when she was talking about the



 7   302's and the delay:  Most of them were, quote, "of little



 8   consequence."



 9            Now, let's see.  Among the ones that were delayed are



10   Marife Nichols; her father, Edward Torres; Trooper Hanger, who



11   arrested my client, and James Nichols.  I would not consider



12   those 302's to be of little consequence.



13            I am sure that there are some that fit the category



14   that she gave, and I acknowledge that.  But on the other hand,



15   I'd like to have some acknowledgement that we are right about a



16   lot of this.  Their telephone records were screwed up.  She



17   hasn't given us hotel records.  What she's given is summary of



18   hotel records.



19            They're going back and getting the phone records; and



20   it's a little irritating to hear this constant recitation about



21   let's set the trial date now, when the fact of the matter is



22   this discovery is all balled up and it's going to take some



23   time and work to get it fixed.



24            The inventory that she talks about -- and I will be



25   the first one to say that some of the inventory is very







                                                                 426







 1   specific.  Some of the other inventory -- I'll just pick one



 2   here.  7-30-96, 1A00532FD19T for Tampa 1E160C1D583 -- that's



 3   real informative; and there are hundreds of them like that that



 4   are throughout.  Now, there are clearly some --



 5            THE COURT:  I didn't know that they were going to be



 6   encrypted.



 7            MR. JONES:  An example -- and I hate to use this one,



 8   but there has been a recent comment in a newspaper concerning a



 9   particular document.  And the newspaper said that it's very



10   important, apparently something leaked to them; and I kind of



11   scratched my head because I hadn't remembered seeing that one



12   in the index.  So finally we called up the Government and we



13   said, Where is item X; and they said, Oh, well, it's listed



14   under such and such of the inventory; and the way it was



15   described was miscellaneous paper for a particular defendant's



16   trash.



17            Well, I didn't realize that when I said we were



18   literally garbage, that that's literally what we were getting.



19            Later on we will file a motion pursuant to the Turkish



20   case and the Poindexter case about the need for the Government



21   to identify specifically what they rely upon and what their



22   experts and other people have seen to form their opinion.  But



23   that's premature.



24            But I think the Ollison case which, after all, is a



25   case Ms. Wilkinson cites, a Northern District of Illinois







                                                                 427







 1   case -- but it clearly says the Government has the burden to



 2   furnish an appropriate index so that you know what you're



 3   getting.



 4            Now, that's not the issue that I raise.  The issue I



 5   raise which wasn't addressed was the completeness of it.  When



 6   I filed a motion for Rule 16 -- and I will admit that I'm sure



 7   a lot of the items in there, they've given us; and in fact, I



 8   say quite clearly that it appears that there is substantial



 9   compliance with this item.



10            But the case law is clear that when you file a motion



11   and you say give me 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the response should be by



12   the Government, We've given it to you, or we don't intend to



13   give it to you, go fishing, or it's not relevant.



14            We get a lot of material; but what we don't get is the



15   representation that we've gotten all of it.  And I think we're



16   entitled to all lab reports or all of Mr. McVeigh's statements,



17   instead of staying you've been given it.



18            If they'd say you've been given all of it -- and in a



19   few instances, they have; but that's a different deal than just



20   standing up in the court and saying, gosh, we don't understand



21   what the complaint is --



22            THE COURT:  Well, but it's also -- two things I think



23   are apparent from the responses.  One is that the prosecutors



24   don't have all of it yet and are still obtaining it.  That's



25   one aspect of it that you've made clear.







                                                                 428







 1            The other aspect of it is that the Government has in a



 2   number of respects gone beyond the strict requirements of Rule



 3   16 and have not taken the position that this is by the book and



 4   by the book you don't get it.



 5            Now, I don't want to penalize them and neither do you



 6   for having gone beyond the strict obligation that was provided



 7   by Rule 16.  So, you know, we have to try to reach some



 8   accommodation where there is adequate communication here about



 9   what's been produced and what hasn't been produced; and I think



10   maybe we all need to think about that overnight.



11            MR. JONES:  I just ask the Court to consider, not --



12   it doesn't have to do it now.  I know the Court will read the



13   briefs that we filed, and we've given specific examples.  And



14   the Court has shown by its questions today it's familiar with



15   some of those examples.  But I ask the Court to consider asking



16   them to respond just to the list.  And I will say again, yes,



17   they appear to have exceeded their constitutional and rule



18   requirement.  I have acknowledged that.



19            But here's what I'm troubled about:  It would have



20   been so much easier if we had reached this agreement back in



21   January instead of this kind of oral thing back and forth,



22   because there are some problems there.



23            But here's what I'm concerned about:  On those items



24   that are beyond what they are required to give to us, without a



25   representation to us that they've given us all, then the gate







                                                                 429







 1   is left open so that if we later find out something that they



 2   didn't give to us, their argument will be, Well, we weren't



 3   required to give it to you.



 4            So all I want is a little truth in delivery or truth



 5   in discovery.  For those items, are we getting it all?  And



 6   they may not be able to tell us that now.



 7            But at some point, they ought to be able to say, Okay,



 8   you've got every lab conclusion, every CV, every photograph,



 9   etc., if they can.  And if they can't, say they can't.



10            THE COURT:  Well, you know, one of the things we have



11   to do here -- and, of course, in part it's dependent upon the



12   motion that was argued this morning -- the motions.  But this



13   is not different in some respects from a civil case.  You have



14   to have a discovery cutoff.  You have to say, All these things



15   are done; what we're going to do in the laboratory has been



16   done; these are the results.  And we have to have a cutoff



17   point so that I can say this case is ready for trial; and we've



18   got to try to reach that point as soon as we can for a lot of



19   reasons.



20            And I think that these discovery disputes have to be



21   resolved; and if it takes sitting here and going through item



22   by item, that's what we have to do.  We've got to get this case



23   ready for trial, or these cases.



24            Now, there is a motion on the schedule filed by



25   Mr. Nichols' counsel about a disagreement about an agreement







                                                                 430







 1   about discovery.



 2            MR. NEUREITER:  That's correct, your Honor.



 3            THE COURT:  I'm not going to have lawyers



 4   cross-examine lawyers about what they said.  If this



 5   agreement -- and it's referred to as an oral agreement -- is



 6   not clear to both sides, I'm not going to get into a specific



 7   performance contract trial.



 8            MR. NEUREITER:  If I may be heard for a moment on



 9   that, your Honor?



10            THE COURT:  Yes.  But I'm telling you, I'm not going



11   to be a part of the spectacle of lawyers attacking the



12   credibility of other lawyers on the witness stand.



13           DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO COMPEL



14            MR. NEUREITER:  I understand that, your Honor.



15            The difficulty is that in a reliance on our



16   understanding, specifically Mr. Woods' understanding of what



17   occurred, the Nichols team opened up their investigative files,



18   a decision that was not made lightly and a decision that in



19   some ways may have prejudiced Mr. Nichols.



20            The understanding was that in so doing, the Nichols



21   team would be given equal access to the witness statements



22   given to the United States.



23            Well, there has been compliance to a certain degree



24   with respect to the 302's; but as is reflected in the draft



25   agreements, three of which were exchanged, grand jury testimony







                                                                 431







 1   was contemplated to be exchanged as well.



 2            Now, Mr. Woods saw a report filed with the Court on



 3   April 5 that said where the Government represented that grand



 4   jury testimony was explicitly excluded.  He did not respond,



 5   however, because in that same report the United States said,



 6   But our problem isn't with compliance with the Nichols team;



 7   our problem is with compliance with the McVeigh team.  They're



 8   the ones who have breached the agreement.  We've got no problem



 9   over here.



10            So Mr. Woods understandably said, Well, I'm not going



11   to raise this issue with the Court or with the United States



12   because they say here that if we continue to comply, we will



13   get the grand jury testimony.



14            Now the United States says that no, this is an



15   agreement that is contingent on compliance by both parties



16   before we turn over grand jury testimony.



17            Mr. Nichols has complied with every condition that is



18   within his power to comply with.  He has turned over all his



19   documents; and in fact Mr. Woods has a stack that he's ready to



20   turn over of interview memoranda conducted by our



21   investigators; but the United States says that isn't enough,



22   even though we've fulfilled all our conditions because



23   Mr. McVeigh isn't turning it over.



24            And although they've put on three witnesses over the



25   last two days and argued that juries can give individualized







                                                                 432







 1   consideration to two defendants at the capital sentencing



 2   proceeding, they're unwilling to give individualized



 3   consideration at the discovery stage of this proceeding; and so



 4   that is why we filed the motion.



 5            There is a legitimate dispute as to what happened; but



 6   even if the Court finds that there was a misunderstanding and



 7   no meeting of the minds, the Court should find that Mr. Nichols



 8   has fully complied with the intent of the agreement and



 9   therefore is entitled to production of grand jury testimony



10   immediately.  And that is our position.



11            THE COURT:  Well, I'm going to reserve on that one.



12   I'm not going to hear that, and one of the reasons is that one



13   possibility is the result of the motions heard this morning is



14   you'll have quite a bit of discovery.



15            MR. NEUREITER:  That's very true.



16            THE COURT:  All right.  Now, I think that we, as I



17   said -- I think that we need to reflect on this problem about



18   the impasse or the lack of communication here on what's been



19   produced and how it's classified and come back to that after



20   there has been reflection about what might be an accommodation



21   on both sides, three sides.



22            Same is true with Brady, isn't it, Mr. Jones?



23           DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON BRADY MATERIAL



24            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  It's slightly different,



25   because we made some specific lists of Brady material.  There







                                                                 433







 1   again, the Government has not complied, but what they have done



 2   and represent they have done is give us 302's.



 3            So I suspect that a substantial portion of the



 4   specific Brady requests are in the 302, and there is probably



 5   some Brady material that I didn't even know existed.



 6            But what I don't know because they haven't told me is



 7   which of those Brady items they don't consider Brady so



 8   therefore I'm not getting anything.  That's what I'm concerned



 9   about.



10            And so there again on that request -- and I don't ask



11   them at this time to say they've given me everything because I



12   know they haven't given me all of everything and I know their



13   investigation is probably ongoing.  But to just use as an



14   example -- and this is a poor example because it's one where



15   they did say we're not going to give it to you; but that one



16   that's in the Newark Star Ledger.  That's one where



17   Ms. Wilkinson said we don't consider that Brady and we're not



18   giving that to you and so we think that's a legitimate dispute



19   and the Court should resolve it.



20            But there is others that are reasonably specific, and



21   I don't know whether they don't consider them Brady or they do;



22   and I would just like to know --



23            THE COURT:  Well, now, did you make a specific list of



24   those?



25            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  It's in the motion that was







                                                                 434







 1   filed, I believe, in November of last year.



 2            THE COURT:  Well, there has been something produced



 3   since November of last year, I take it.



 4            MR. JONES:  Well, been a lot of 302's; but there has



 5   never been a representation on this list of items that yes,



 6   we'll give you these 302's and no, we don't consider this



 7   exculpatory.



 8            THE COURT:  Well, I confess I'm not readily familiar



 9   with what you filed in November.



10            MR. JONES:  It was a Brady motion, and we listed a



11   large number of categories, and they filed again a generalized



12   brief.



13            When we met here I think in April -- and I was



14   prepared to argue it then -- I stood up and said, well, let me



15   meet with Ms. Wilkinson -- and Mr. Wyatt met with her on



16   several occasions -- and see if we can work it out, and then



17   that kind of deteriorated.



18            THE COURT:  I also expressed the view that has been



19   often expressed by courts that only the Government at the first



20   instance can tell what's Brady; and of course that's part of



21   the problem with Brady:  Something comes up after trial and



22   then there is a dispute about what happened.  And the cases



23   that we see are again just like the cases on severance:



24   They're retrospective, they're after the fact, when there is a



25   full record to evaluate whether it was or wasn't Brady or







                                                                 435







 1   whether the case should or shouldn't have been severed.



 2            We don't have that luxury.  We're prospective in our



 3   perspective.



 4            MR. JONES:  In an attempt to narrow it down, because I



 5   know the Court has got many other things on its mind, not only



 6   this case but other cases -- and if I might just hand this to



 7   Ms. Wilkinson, and if I might approach the clerk, and let me



 8   give a copy here to Mr. Tigar -- what we did was we took the



 9   Brady items from our motion.  This is labeled "Motion to



10   Compel"; and the motion to compel is to compel production of



11   the motion as filed last year; and as the Court can see, we



12   broke them down.  We say there are Items 1; and Item 127 is a



13   dispute as to the timing, and Items 3, 10, 11, 52, 53, 82 and



14   so forth are disputes as to completeness of production.  There



15   are 38 items clearly disputed and 46 items disputed in part.



16   And that -- and while this appears to be a lot of items, I have



17   to say to the Court that what we started off with was much



18   larger and we were able it narrow it down and resolve it and



19   it's out of here.  So we made some progress.



20            But we still have these that are disputed; and maybe



21   the thing to do is not argue it further.  I mean I don't want



22   to take away from Ms. Wilkinson's right to respond or



23   Mr. Tigar's, but simply we've given this and the brief.



24            I might -- if I might suggest, I think the Court is



25   going to have to look at the submission of the parties, look at







                                                                 436







 1   the exhibits, and get some sense as to whether we're being



 2   picayunish, or there is a good faith dispute, or we're both



 3   right.  We just can't resolve it.  I don't know any other way



 4   to do it, Judge.  We've certainly spent dozens of hours talking



 5   to each other.



 6            I was shocked to see the representation in the



 7   Government's brief that the reason we didn't get grand jury



 8   material is because we hadn't agreed to make it secret.  There



 9   is a protective order in effect.  It is secret.  I thought the



10   dispute was we weren't going to get it till 60 days before



11   trial.



12            So I don't know what the problem is.  We write each



13   other, we talk to each other, but sometimes we seem to be



14   talking at each other instead of with each other.



15            But your Honor said that if we couldn't resolve it,



16   bring it to you.



17            THE COURT:  I did.  You have.



18            Ms. Wilkinson, do you have some comment on this?  I



19   don't know if this list is, as you now have it, is meaningful



20   at the moment, or any response you choose to make.



21               PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON BRADY MATERIAL



22            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I'm reluctant to get into



23   any of the specific requests; however, I am familiar with them



24   because Mr. Jones did file them in his brief.



25            What -- I would like to point to just a few examples







                                                                 437







 1   to show why we, I think, are having some very legitimate



 2   disputes and then some problems with the way things are even



 3   characterized; and I think that kind of exacerbates the



 4   disputes.



 5            If you look at -- I don't know whether Mr. --



 6   Mr. Jones, did you give this to the Court?



 7            MR. JONES:  I did.



 8            THE COURT:  Yes, I have it.



 9            MS. WILKINSON:  If you look at the very first page,



10   No. 1, and under that is 127.  And it's here summarized for



11   you.  It's entitled All Claims Filed for the $2 million Reward



12   for Information Leading to the Arrest of those Involved in



13   Oklahoma City Bombing, which is a general request.



14            If you go to Mr. Jones' brief, it says All Leads



15   Resulting from Individuals Who Have Filed or Expressed an



16   Interest in Filing or Accepted the $2 million Offered Reward by



17   the U.S. Government.



18            What we went back and said to him is no, we understand



19   if any witness who takes the stand who requests the reward,



20   that's Giglio material, and we must provide that to you; but to



21   find out who made the request and what leads we got from that,



22   truly I don't think we could do that.



23            THE COURT:  But this now says "claims."  I don't know



24   in what form --



25            MS. WILKINSON:  That's just his summary, your Honor.







                                                                 438







 1   If you go to his actual request, which is what he submitted to



 2   us -- and as he advised you, we have met with defense counsel.



 3   Mr. Wyatt sent me a 55-page letter.  We responded in detail



 4   with our responses to these.



 5            THE COURT:  I understood I was being handed this as



 6   the characterization of the request.



 7            MS. WILKINSON:  It is a summary.



 8            MR. JONES:  It is a summary, your Honor.  That's



 9   correct.  It is a summary.



10            MS. WILKINSON:  And that's my point, your Honor.  When



11   you look at some of this stuff --



12            THE COURT:  Let me ask you, for example, staying with



13   this 127:  I don't know what this $2 million reward refers to,



14   whether there was some agency that was responsible for the



15   handling of these, and what a claim means.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  Those are all good questions, and I'm



17   not sure I know the answer to all those, to Mr. Jones' question



18   and not because he doesn't word it well but because we have



19   different interpretations of those words.



20            If I accept it to mean he wants to know all leads



21   resulting from anyone who filed or expressed an interest in



22   filing --



23            THE COURT:  You know, leads -- that's a --



24            MS. WILKINSON:  That's my point, your Honor.



25            THE COURT:  That's a term of art to some people and to







                                                                 439







 1   other people that just means, you know, does that indicate



 2   something?  But is there -- was there some kind of process



 3   whereby persons could formally make a claim?



 4            MS. WILKINSON:  Some people have written in either on



 5   their own behalf or by lawyers to make a claim.



 6            Our point is if one of those people is a witness,



 7   obviously we would turn over that information.  The names of



 8   all people who have made claims -- I don't see how that is



 9   Brady information or Rule 16 information; but that's not just



10   what they've asked for.  They've asked for who has expressed an



11   interest in filing.  All I'm doing is pointing out for us to



12   respond in the affirmative -- how could we ever say we are sure



13   we have given them the names of anyone who has expressed an



14   interest in filing a request for the money?  That's why it's



15   difficult to sometimes reply totally, completely to the



16   defense's request.



17            THE COURT:  I can rule on that one.



18            MS. WILKINSON:  That's why I think Mr. Jones is



19   suggesting perhaps we go through these, we make our arguments



20   and the Court rules, because we go back and forth over the



21   interpretation.  Like I said, you read the summary, it sounds



22   reasonable; you go to the specific request and it's almost



23   impossible for us to respond to most of these.  And on the



24   other hand, as Mr. Jones acknowledges, and we appreciate it,



25   we've provided all of these reports which deal with most of







                                                                 440







 1   them.



 2            THE COURT:  I think that's what we're going to have to



 3   do.  And the easiest -- sometimes the easiest way to do it is



 4   the hard way, and that's to sit down and do it, not to say that



 5   we're going to do it now.  But in part this depends, too, on



 6   the ruling that I've got to make with respect to what the --



 7   our trials are going to be.



 8            MS. WILKINSON:  Perhaps while we await that ruling,



 9   we'll be providing discovery to Mr. Jones.  We're always



10   available to answer their questions and the Nichols team, and



11   perhaps we can work a few more of these issues out and we'll



12   have narrowed the list.



13            MR. JONES:  We'll approach it in that spirit; and as I



14   say, I'm sure there will be some narrowing and as -- perhaps as



15   we get new discovery in, perhaps it can be withdrawn or some of



16   the items can be withdrawn.



17            THE COURT:  Well, yeah.  I think ultimately it's my



18   responsibility to sit down with counsel and hear these disputes



19   and resolve them.  But I don't think we're in the posture to do



20   that now.  I do believe that so much depends upon the severance



21   issue.



22            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, there is one other point I



23   wanted to make clear, if I could.



24            THE COURT:  Please.



25            MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you.  As we discussed, I think,







                                                                 441







 1   on Tuesday, the Government has decided to produce all of the



 2   laboratory notes; and Mr. Jones raised some question about what



 3   that means.  Obviously, I know he'll review it carefully.  But



 4   just so the Court understands, we have asked all of our expert



 5   witnesses to provide any notes and underline materials that



 6   they include in their notes to us so we could disclose them to



 7   the defense.  For example, we are turning over 200 pages of



 8   notes from Steve Burmeister, who is the chemist at the FBI



 9   laboratory who does the explosive residue analysis.  Included



10   in those 200 papers are not only his notes but all of the



11   different gas chromatography and different tests he ran showing



12   the printouts; and I think if Mr. Tigar and Mr. Jones and their



13   teams review those materials, they'll see we've gone a long way



14   to answering most of their responses.



15            And a lot of the examiners obviously put their notes



16   together in different ways, but for some of those analyses that



17   are more sophisticated like Agent Burmeister's, we've provided



18   quite a bit of data in those disclosures to them.



19            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I told Mr. Wyatt to read that



20   overnight and report.



21            THE COURT:  I'm looking at my schedule.



22            MR. CONNELLY:  Could I just be heard briefly, your



23   Honor, on a housekeeping matter?  And it relates to the



24   severance.  And I think there is agreement and I can be quick.



25            THE COURT:  All right.







                                                                 442







 1            MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, I believe you gave the



 2   defense until the 8th to file a supplement to the record.  I



 3   mentioned today to both Mr. Tigar and Mr. Nigh the Court



 4   questioned me about a possible jury instruction.  I would like



 5   leave of Court, and it's without objection, if we could submit



 6   a proposed jury instruction.



 7            THE COURT:  That's good.  In the same time?



 8            MR. CONNELLY:  By the 8th, close of business by the



 9   8th.



10            THE COURT:  All right.



11            MR. CONNELLY:  Thank you, your Honor.



12            THE COURT:  That will be helpful.



13            MR. JONES:  May we have an opportunity to respond to



14   the jury instruction -- proposed jury instruction?



15            THE COURT:  I'll let you know if I want you to.



16            MR. JONES:  Okay.



17            THE COURT:  I'd rather, you know, keep that moving;



18   and if I want your response, I'll ask for it.



19            I think we should have clearly in mind what we're



20   still going to hear in this time.  And there are some things



21   that need to be heard and on the -- we have this Dr. Whitehurst



22   interview issue.  The Government wants that resolved, I'm sure.



23            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes.



24            THE COURT:  It's an important matter; and perhaps,



25   Mr. Jones, you have at times joined with Mr. Whitehurst's







                                                                 443







 1   lawyer -- Dr. Whitehurst's lawyer -- I can't remember his name,



 2   but --



 3            MR. JONES:  Stephen Kohn, your Honor.



 4            THE COURT:  Can he be here tomorrow?



 5            MR. NIGH:  Your Honor, Mr. Kohn cannot because his



 6   wife is expecting a baby; but his partner, David Calapinto,



 7   will be here and is available to appear for Dr. Whitehurst



 8   tomorrow.



 9            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I think that one



10   certainly should be taken up tomorrow.



11            MR. HARTZLER:  I wonder if I might make a proposal on



12   that one that could possibly avoid the hearing.



13            THE COURT:  Okay.



14            MR. HARTZLER:  I think the problem that we face with



15   the -- what we refer to as the Whitehurst issue is that perhaps



16   it's our failing, perhaps the failing of the parties, that we



17   have not really adequately focused on what exactly will



18   transpire at this 703 proceeding.



19            THE COURT:  Yes.



20            MR. HARTZLER:  You should know that there have been



21   some negotiations about the deposition, the proposed deposition



22   for Dr. Whitehurst; and I'm not confident that we're going to



23   be able to reach agreement on terms of such a deposition.  I



24   also know that Mr. Nigh had notified us that there may be some



25   additional witnesses that they would want to interview after







                                                                 444







 1   Dr. Whitehurst, and it's really not clear to us how long this



 2   process will go on.



 3            I wish to advise the Court that we have provided a



 4   sizable amount of information relating to Dr. Whitehurst.  He



 5   was interviewed extensively by the Inspector General, and the



 6   transcript of those interviews have been provided to the



 7   defense.  He was also interviewed in the O.J. Simpson case.  A



 8   transcript of that interview has been provided to the defense.



 9            He also has written, as you have heard before, scores



10   of letters; and the portions of those letters that refer to the



11   Oklahoma City bombing case have been provided to the defense.



12            The inspector general has interviewed a number of



13   people; and I believe that there may be 19 witnesses or in the



14   range of 20 witnesses that provided information relating to the



15   Oklahoma City bombing case, and the appropriate -- the relevant



16   portions of those memos of interview have been provided to the



17   defense.



18            So all parties have substantial information concerning



19   what might be characterized as the Whitehurst allegations.



20            Mr. Jones has proposed that the deposition be limited



21   to five days, which we think is excessive and would frankly



22   interfere with our trial preparation plans to devote that much



23   time to this interview.  I propose that we set a date for us to



24   try to frame the Rule 703 hearings that have been proposed and



25   to suggest what we view as the appropriate scope of those







                                                                 445







 1   hearings and allow the defendants an opportunity to respond.



 2   And in the interim, until the scope of the hearings is



 3   resolved, we would simply agree that we wouldn't conduct the



 4   interview.  This can remain on the calendar.



 5            But I think that if we had a better definition of the



 6   scope of this hearing, then we would have a better of sense of



 7   the scope of the deposition of Dr. Whitehurst --



 8            THE COURT:  True.



 9            MR. HARTZLER:  -- and whether or not we need to even



10   proceed with the deposition or whether the materials that we



11   have provided give adequate notice to the defense.  A decision



12   can be made whether or not he perhaps should be called to the



13   witness stand at the hearing, or if that can be avoided.  All



14   of those issues I think may be -- they may not be resolved, but



15   at least we'll all have better information if we can define the



16   scope of this proceeding.



17            So I would propose -- I don't think we would need more



18   than two weeks to file some pleading of some sort to try to



19   better define what we view as the appropriate scope of the 703



20   hearing.



21            THE COURT:  I'm having the recollection that at one



22   time, it was suggested that the end of September might be the



23   time when the attorney general's -- I can't the remember the



24   name of the group.



25            MR. HARTZLER:  Inspector general.







                                                                 446







 1            THE COURT:  Yeah, inspector general's group would have



 2   a report.  September has come and gone.



 3            MR. HARTZLER:  I thought we revised that.  We got word



 4   that it would not be by the end of September.  I think the last



 5   we had heard was it won't be before the end of November,



 6   possibly the end of the year.  And I'm not sure that's going to



 7   be a final report; but I thought we had reported to the Court



 8   that the September date was --



 9            THE COURT:  Well, you may have.  I'm trying to



10   remember a lot of things.  But one of the things that I



11   mentioned at the time, I think was we don't need the whole



12   report.  If that part of it that deals specifically with these



13   allegations was at least in draft form before that -- and



14   you're telling me that the interviews and so forth are there --



15   maybe it is something we can work with to define the scope of



16   what you're calling the 703 hearing.



17            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, may I respond?



18            THE COURT:  Sure.



19            MR. JONES:  I know it's late in the day and I don't



20   want to tax the Court's patience; but the last five minutes,



21   there could be no better example of the frustration that



22   Mr. Woods and Mr. Tigar and I have.  We have an agreement to



23   take Dr. Whitehurst's deposition.  Without notice to us,



24   Mr. Hartzler this afternoon is trying to withdraw from that



25   agreement, an agreement that the Court strongly suggested would







                                                                 447







 1   be made or the Court would order it.



 2            That's a perfect example of the problems in this case.



 3   We have an agreement.  We expect the Government to honor the



 4   agreement and produce Dr. Whitehurst.



 5            The five-day suggestion came from Dr. Whitehurst's own



 6   lawyer, who has much experience dealing with the Government on



 7   how long these things take.



 8            Dr. Whitehurst is critical to the defense.  There are



 9   serious allegations here.  His lawyer should be heard, but we



10   oppose any effort to withdraw from the agreement.



11            Now, I do think Mr. Hartzler's recommendation to the



12   Court -- and it's one that he and I have talked about -- of



13   submitting to the Court what the framework is and the



14   perimeters of what we can ask Dr. Whitehurst so we don't have



15   time taking objections on the record and have to come to the



16   Court.  We agree ahead of time this can be asked and this



17   can't, I think that has merit.



18            There may be, though, some things beyond the 703



19   hearing that are appropriate to ask Dr. Whitehurst.



20            THE COURT:  Yeah, I understand that.  But do you have



21   the -- I'm getting lost here.  Do you have these transcripts of



22   the interview?



23            MR. JONES:  I believe we do.  I think the last one was



24   just delivered to us and they had delivered some earlier



25   material, but we shared that with Dr. Whitehurst's lawyer and







                                                                 448







 1   with other persons, and we're not satisfied that we have



 2   everything that we need or that we're entitled to; but we'll



 3   worry about that after completed reviewing it.  I haven't



 4   reviewed the most recent submission.



 5            But under no circumstances are we willing to withdraw



 6   from the agreement previously reached, which the Court was



 7   informed of by letter that an agreement had been reached to



 8   take Dr. Whitehurst's deposition.



 9            Now, the perimeters of it, how long it lasts are fine.



10   But again, the Government sought to impose those on us without



11   negotiations and --



12            THE COURT:  Here's where we are, though, I think.  One



13   is that the need for the restraining order can be obviated by



14   the agreement that you will at this time not proceed with the



15   interview as the employer of the witness which generated that



16   motion and, you know -- and that before the deposition then be



17   taken, we have a determination of what the scope of it is going



18   to be so that it doesn't become one of these instruct not to



19   answer or object to the question and the deposition just gets



20   hung up, as so often happens in civil depositions.



21            So that we would have a hearing about the scope.



22            How that does or doesn't relate to actually a court



23   hearing on 703 is a different thing, I think, and we ought to



24   take this a step at a time; the first step being try to



25   determine whether you can agree upon that deposition scope.







                                                                 449







 1            And Mr. -- I'm taking, Mr. Tigar, you at your word



 2   today that regardless of whether there be separate trials



 3   ordered, you would be participating in these events on behalf



 4   of Mr. Nichols.



 5            MR. TIGAR:  Absolutely.  Your Honor, this is a perfect



 6   example of the way in which consolidation of pretrial



 7   proceedings can expedite separate trials.



 8            THE COURT:  Right.



 9            MR. TIGAR:  We had on a prior hearing Ms. Wilkinson



10   and I and perhaps Mr. Jones -- said some things to the Court



11   about the proper scope of a pretrial hearing out of the sight



12   of hearing of an as-yet unselected jury on expert witness



13   points.



14            We further put forth our ideas on that in docket 193;



15   and I think Mr. Jones's team also did in their docket filed at



16   about the same time when we objected to the expert reports.



17            So in our respectful submission --



18            THE COURT:  193?



19            MR. TIGAR:  1983, your Honor.



20            THE COURT:  That's a long time ago.



21            MR. TIGAR:  1983.



22            THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  I thought I heard you saying



23   193.



24            MR. TIGAR:  Well, I may have, your Honor, but 1983 is



25   what would be correct.







                                                                 450







 1            We respectfully submit it would be ripe for decision



 2   by your Honor as to what issues your Honor thinks should be



 3   resolved at a pretrial hearing out of the sight and hearing of



 4   the jury.



 5            Now, moving on to Mr. Whitehurst, I think that a



 6   deposition of him before such a hearing would materially



 7   contribute to the efficiency of that hearing because we're not



 8   interested globally in Mr. Whitehurst's many, many allegations.



 9   Rather, for Mr. Nichols, as to whom there is a relatively small



10   amount of this residue evidence from his home and none from the



11   sheds but from his home, the issues there are the ones of the



12   ineptitude, incompetence, fakery and laboratory contamination.



13   Those four issues as they specifically relate to those samples



14   collected largely by this Mr. Burmeister is where we would



15   focus.



16            And if we could get that done at a deposition, then,



17   of course, its results are admissible in that pretrial hearing



18   and we'd do some of this time-saving.



19            But I don't have anything more to say about what would



20   be the proper scope of a pretrial hearing than I've said in



21   docket No. 1983, and so I won't -- I wouldn't ask to be heard



22   about that.  I think it's probably ripe for decision.



23            MR. HARTZLER:  May I reply?



24            THE COURT:  Yes.



25            MR. HARTZLER:  You have suggested to me that I was







                                                                 451







 1   putting the cart before the horse, and respectfully, I suggest



 2   that we may now have the horse before the -- the cart -- maybe



 3   the horse is the problem here.



 4            If we are not permitted to interview Dr. Whitehurst --



 5   and we'll agree that we will not do it pending resolution of



 6   the matter, so you need not worry about that -- it's difficult



 7   for us to figure out exactly what the scope should be.



 8            There may be additional information out there.  I'm



 9   assuming that most of what has been written is -- covers the



10   scope of what he can say and all the parties know what that is.



11   So we can probably fashion something.



12            But I think that the first step should be the 703



13   hearing.  It's easier for us to figure out what it is that has



14   to be resolved before trial.  Dr. Whitehurst may very well have



15   information relating to -- I'm making this up now, mind you --



16   chain of custody, information such as that which obviously



17   would be trial testimony, but I don't believe you would want to



18   have a pretrial hearing on whether or not there is a break in



19   the chain of custody or something along those lines.



20            THE COURT:  Well, not -- it depends.  I mean, I don't



21   want to have all of that done with a jury, and I don't want to



22   have a jury sit around while we do it.  If there is a, you



23   know -- in exchange for this, I would anticipate because there



24   are these opportunities asking for a stipulation about chain of



25   custody to avoid the delay of putting on all of that kind of







                                                                 452







 1   foundation, this hand to that hand, before that comes in.  I



 2   think that the defense, given these opportunities, should be



 3   reasonable in its willingness to approach the question of



 4   stipulation on some evidence that's not necessary.



 5            And that, of course, is up to the defendant



 6   ultimately, but these are the kinds of things that can develop



 7   trial efficiencies.



 8            That's a different question, though, from this matter



 9   of what about these allegations that says that this



10   laboratory -- I'm characterizing something here that I don't



11   know whether there is any basis for it; but if the allegations



12   are that nothing coming out of this laboratory at a given time



13   could be admissible in evidence because the laboratory is



14   essentially malfunctioning and not -- either because of the



15   personnel, the equipment or whatever -- you know, that's a very



16   major thing.  That's like a motion to suppress, in a sense.



17   That's saying that this evidence under no circumstances can be



18   received because it doesn't fit the requirements for forensic



19   evidence.



20            Now, I think they've got to know in some detail



21   whether there is any support for that position, because that's



22   the position they would like to take, the defense, if there is



23   support for it.



24            MR. TIGAR:  Yes.  Our view is that Federal Rule of



25   Evidence 104(c) and the advisory committee notes give your







                                                                 453







 1   Honor a great deal of discretion to hear admissibility



 2   questions, preliminary questions such as the one you just



 3   formed out of the presence of the jury.  And the rule therefore



 4   by extension gives your Honor the authority to have those



 5   hearings before any juries are even selected.



 6            I had thought that a deposition of Mr. Whitehurst



 7   preliminary to a 104(c) hearing would be a way to save the



 8   Court from having to get Mr. Whitehurst here and listen to him



 9   in that hearing that was eventually scheduled; and so our



10   thought about the cart and the horse problem is that first some



11   of these depositions -- that would save the court time -- then



12   the hearing.



13            We're perfectly willing from our perspective to have



14   Dr. Whitehurst here at the hearing and take the time and



15   interrogate him under your Honor's supervision.  But it had



16   been 104(c) that had been the starting point of our analysis in



17   trying to figure out how to get this resolved before any juries



18   were selected.



19            THE COURT:  Well, I think we need to know whether to



20   invite Dr. Whitehurst's lawyer to get out here tomorrow.



21            MR. HARTZLER:  Right.



22            THE COURT:  And I think maybe we're saying we don't



23   need to have that -- him out here tomorrow and that we can



24   approach this -- I still think we need the deposition before



25   the hearing.







                                                                 454







 1            MR. HARTZLER:  I wasn't trying to suggest -- no, I was



 2   suggesting that we define the hearing and that will enable us



 3   to better define the scope of the deposition.  That was my



 4   point.



 5            THE COURT:  I see what you're saying.  Oh, okay.



 6            MR. HARTZLER:  I did not mean to suggest that we were



 7   withdrawing our agreement.  I meant to suggest that it's going



 8   to require court intervention for us to proceed with the



 9   deposition because I don't think we're going to agree upon the



10   terms of the scope of the deposition.



11            THE COURT:  No, I'm sure that I'll have to help you



12   with that.



13            Well --



14            MR. HARTZLER:  I'm suggesting that we try to define



15   what pretrial proceedings we would have based on the



16   information that's been provided; and, of course, this may take



17   some time for the defense because they only recently received



18   the agent's notes; but I think they'll find that --



19            THE COURT:  And the lab notes.



20            MR. HARTZLER:  That's what I meant.  The laboratory



21   notes.  Yes.  The laboratory notes which, incidentally, your



22   Honor, will demonstrate that in doing certain of the



23   experiments, they would insert blanks in the machine prior to



24   doing the experimentation; and we've provided those, the



25   readouts when the blanks were submitted and then when the tests







                                                                 455







 1   were actually submitted, indicating that there was no



 2   contamination prior to the experimentation.



 3            I'm not -- I didn't mean to raise this for point of



 4   argument.  But I think that in reviewing the attorneys' notes,



 5   a lot of the speculation and allegations will be resolved.  If



 6   we're given an opportunity to try to better define the pretrial



 7   hearings that strike us as appropriate, I think that will



 8   assist the Court and the parties in defining the scope of any



 9   deposition.



10            Now, if we are going to proceed with the deposition, I



11   would ask that we have the opportunity to interview Agent



12   Whitehurst prior to the deposition.



13            But I think that may be down the road and there is



14   plenty of time between now and then for us to possibly resolve



15   this matter.



16            MR. JONES:  It's my understanding --



17            THE COURT:  Two of you rising at the same table.



18            MR. JONES:  That's all right.  I'll let him go.



19            MR. NIGH:  Your Honor, when I spoke to Mr. Calapinto



20   during the noon recess.  He told me that he would be here this



21   evening; and I took that to mean that he was on his way and



22   probably is on his way now.



23            THE COURT:  Oh.



24            MR. NIGH:  I don't know that that makes any difference



25   overall.  But if we are going to have a hearing about --







                                                                 456







 1            THE COURT:  Well, we're not going to have a hearing on



 2   it; but it might be well for him to be here to discuss this



 3   very point with counsel.



 4            MR. NIGH:  He'll be available, I know.



 5            THE COURT:  Yeah.  So you might have lunch with him



 6   tomorrow.  I think it would be appropriate.



 7            MR. JONES:  There is a motion pending on the



 8   Whitehurst matters respecting unsealing documents and the Court



 9   probably remembers that, but I -- I think most of the other



10   items have to do with this TRO, but that one is probably a



11   separate issue.



12            THE COURT:  Whose motion are you talking about?



13            MR. JONES:  Well, it was Dr. Whitehurst and it's



14   docket No. -- I'm sorry.  It's not on here.



15            THE COURT:  I don't see it, but it may be something we



16   missed.



17            MR. JONES:  Well, there is a motion filed by



18   Dr. Whitehurst which the Court permitted him to file asking for



19   permission to unseal the documents that were filed -- and I'm



20   just characterizing another lawyer's paper work without having



21   seen it; but I believe that the thrust of the motion was that



22   the Government had made certain representations in court



23   concerning Dr. Whitehurst which had been reported in the public



24   media, which Dr. Whitehurst's lawyer said were untrue and that



25   he wanted the documents unsealed so that Dr. Whitehurst's







                                                                 457







 1   version of these matters would be in the public domain.



 2            And I'm probably not doing justice to it, but that's



 3   basically what it was.



 4            THE COURT:  I don't know.  I mean if I'm going to be



 5   asked to correct everything that's wrong in the media, we'll be



 6   here a long time.



 7            MR. JONES:  I think his point was that the



 8   Government's representations were wrong.



 9            THE COURT:  Well, according to some media report of



10   the Government's representation.



11            MR. HARTZLER:  There was one mistake that was made,



12   and I wouldn't mind correcting it.  I don't think it's the



13   total of what Dr. Whitehurst's lawyer is concerned about; but



14   Ms. Wilkinson had reported to the Court that the experts had



15   travelled down -- I believe it was to Atlanta to appear for a



16   2255 hearing in the Moody case.  I wouldn't expect you to have



17   any recollection of this.



18            THE COURT:  No, I don't.



19            MR. HARTZLER:  In fact, they had travelled down, I



20   believe, to prepare affidavits and met with the prosecutors.



21   And it was not a hearing.



22            THE COURT:  Oh, on a motion, yeah.  Okay.  I do



23   remember now.



24            MR. HARTZLER:  To file the papers for the 2255, as



25   opposed to actually having a hearing that day.  And that was







                                                                 458







 1   just information --



 2            THE COURT:  Well, talk to the lawyer for him and see



 3   if that correction satisfies --



 4            MR. HARTZLER:  I wrote the lawyer.



 5            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, the reason it's not on here,



 6   I'm told, is because it's filed with a civil number.  And the



 7   civil matter is 44.



 8            THE COURT:  Oh, it's a collateral matter.



 9            MR. JONES:  Yes; and your Honor has not yet ruled on



10   it.



11            THE COURT:  Well, all I'm saying is if he's going to



12   be here tomorrow and knows about the case, this other lawyer,



13   he can work out a correction.



14            MR. HARTZLER:  I already notified him in writing about



15   that.



16            THE COURT:  Well, nobody did anything about this



17   pending motion, though, apparently.



18            MR. HARTZLER:  No.  We have tried, and I will try



19   again tomorrow.



20            THE COURT:  All right.  Appreciate it.



21            Well, I'm looking at this, then, as to Item 8 on this



22   schedule, we will not expect to hear tomorrow.



23            Now, I think the next item that's ready is Item 4; and



24   although I granted a motion for CBS, ABC and NBC to submit an



25   amicus brief and denied the request for counsel signatory to







                                                                 459







 1   that brief to argue it, it's there and I've seen it; but



 2   Mr. Kelley has requested that he be notified when that is going



 3   to be heard, so at least he could be a listener.



 4            I propose we do that first thing in the morning.



 5            And we have --



 6            MR. JONES:  That's Item 3, your Honor.



 7            THE COURT:  4.



 8            MR. JONES:  My motion of Item 4 says Motion of



 9   Government to -- I'm sorry --



10            THE COURT:  You've got a different number.  I've got



11   McVeigh motion for media access.



12            MR. JONES:  Thank you.



13            THE COURT:  Did we misnumber what we gave you, or --



14            MR. JONES:  I'll file a motion for production, your



15   Honor.



16            THE COURT:  Then we've got the -- I think we can



17   proceed in the order in which they are here, then:  5; I don't



18   think we'll have to do 6, and then 7 will be the order to go.



19            MR. JONES:  May I ask you what 5 is now?



20            THE COURT:  5 is the motion of the Government to



21   reconsider the exclusion of victim witnesses under the rule.



22            MR. JONES:  All right, sir.



23            MR. HARTZLER:  And you propose we proceed with that



24   now?



25            THE COURT:  No, no.  I'm going to propose we recess







                                                                 460







 1   now right quick because I don't know -- I think we've got this



 2   cart and the horse.  I think maybe we're bogged down on what's



 3   in between them.  But we'll do 7 -- well, we'll do them in the



 4   order that they are on the schedule starting at 9:00 in the



 5   morning.



 6            Recess until then.

<P>In a three-day pretrial hearing, Oklahoma City Bombing defendants Timothy McVeigh

and Terry Nichols argued for separate trials. They also pressed the government to turn

over classified information that they said may prove Iraq was involved in the bombing.

18                             PROCEEDINGS



19       (In open court at 9 a.m.)



20            THE COURT:  Please be seated.



21            Good morning.  We're resumed in 96-CR-68 with the same



22   appearances, except Mr. Ryan isn't present.



23            MR. HARTZLER:  Correct.



24            THE COURT:  And I noted the same appearances



25   yesterday, and he wasn't present yesterday.  I hope he's well.







                                                       464







 1            MR. HARTZLER:  I think he's fine.



 2            THE COURT:  We're, according to our schedule, ready to



 3   proceed on the motion filed for Mr. McVeigh identified as the



 4   Motion for Media Access, which has been the subject of briefing



 5   and including and amicus or amici brief.



 6            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, before we take that up just as



 7   a housekeeping matter, there were two discovery motions that



 8   the Court didn't address yesterday, one for early release of



 9   Jencks and the other was for identification evidence.  And I



10   suggest those simply be put over to the next time that the



11   Court addresses the discovery matters.  They have been fully



12   briefed.



13            THE COURT:  Well, I want to come back to discovery



14   before the day is out to do a couple of things.  One is I have



15   reviewed that material, as I suggested that you do; and I think



16   we can talk about a couple of things in there including the



17   grand jury transcripts for the Fortier witnesses, and then what



18   I want to do today is set a date for hearing on the discovery



19   issues that remain after the additional exchange.  I think we



20   should set a definite date for that, be able to plan on it.  So



21   we'll do that before the day is done.



22            Let's go ahead with this motion.



23            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor.



24            THE COURT:  The lectern looks like it's a bit askew



25   there.  I don't know why that is, but it needs to be dress







                                                       465







 1   right dress, I think.



 2            Thank you.



 3       DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION FOR MEDIA ACCESS



 4            MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, pending before



 5   the Court is a motion filed by Mr. McVeigh, which is probably,



 6   to put it charitably, unusual; but this is an unusual case.



 7   The motion pursuant to the rules of the United States marshal's



 8   service and the Bureau of Prisons asks permission of the Court,



 9   which is required, in order to honor a series of requests that



10   have been made by the media and its representatives to



11   interview our client.



12            Specifically -- and I'll address first the mechanics



13   of the motion and what we seek, and then I will address the



14   merits of it.



15            The motion might be said to be divided into eight



16   parts, in that it asks permission first for the BBC documentary



17   division to interview Mr. McVeigh as a part of an extended



18   documentary on this case which will be shown in the United



19   Kingdom before the commencement of the trial but will be



20   protected by copyright and not be released to any American or



21   foreign distributor until after the completion of these



22   proceedings.



23            The BBC counsel and solicitors have also asked me to



24   represent to the Court that they would be prepared to agree not



25   even to show the documentary in the United Kingdom until after







                                                       466







 1   the jury has been empaneled, if that is a condition that the



 2   Court would seek to impose, although they would prefer to be



 3   able to show it before in the United Kingdom; but under strict



 4   admonition and control, they would not be released to anyone



 5   else, particularly to be shown in this country.



 6            THE COURT:  Now -- excuse me -- it's my memory from a



 7   the papers that the BBC does have some affiliation or



 8   connection with an American television outlet of some type.



 9            MR. JONES:  There is a contractual relationship with



10   the Discovery Channel; and from time to time documentaries



11   which are shown on the BBC are sold to the Discovery Channel



12   for broadcast in this country.  And I think that is who they



13   have in mind with respect to this; but their representation is



14   that they will sign whatever guarantees and undertakings that



15   the Court would require that it would not be released to anyone



16   to be shown in this country until after the completion of this



17   trial.



18            Secondly, there is a division that might best be



19   described as national media, in which Mr. McVeigh has received



20   requests from a number of national news and personalities and



21   talent requesting an interview and asked permission of the



22   Court to grant an interview to one of those applicants, being



23   Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Susan



24   Candiotti of CNN and Jack Bowen of Fox.  And what would be



25   contemplated there would be an interview which would be shown







                                                       467







 1   at least 60 to 90 days before the commencement of the trial and



 2   would last no more than 20 to 22 minutes air time.



 3            The third would be what might be called national print



 4   which would include choosing -- Mr. McVeigh would choose one



 5   from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Los 



 6   Angeles Times, Washington Post, USA Today and I believe the



 7   Wall Street Journal (sic).



 8            Third would be national wire services which would be



 9   the Associated Press, UPI, Reuters, and so forth, perhaps Dow



10   Jones; and that would include one representative there -- that



11   would be a print interview.



12            The next category would be the Oklahoma City



13   electronic media, which would include KTOK, Channel 4, 5, 9 and



14   the Oklahoma Educational Authority.  There would be one chosen



15   from that group.



16            The next would be the Oklahoma City print media or



17   southwest print media, which would include the Oklahoma 



18   Gazette, the Tulsa World, Fort Worth Star Telegram and The 



19   Dallas Morning News.



20            The next category would be the Denver media --



21   electronic media, which would be the stations here of 4, 7, and



22   9.  Channel 2 has asked to be excluded.



23            And then finally the Denver print media, which would



24   be the Rocky Mountain News; The Denver Post asking not to be



25   considered because of disagreement with the ground rules that







                                                       468







 1   we had with respect to such consideration.



 2            We do not propose necessarily, even if the Court were



 3   to grant all eight of those, to agree to all eight; but those



 4   are the reasonable categories that we see and they are



 5   presented in the alternative.  In other words, the Court may



 6   exclude any interviews with the Denver print media or the



 7   Denver electronic media but say grant them nationally or the



 8   BBC or Oklahoma City.



 9            I also represented to the Court that we would insist



10   as a condition for any interview that the order of the Court



11   with respect to the protective order on discovery and the order



12   on extrajudicial statements would have to be scrupulously



13   observed; that is to say, that the facts of the case, the



14   theories of the case, the evidence of the case, could not be



15   discussed.



16            The Government has responded, and the response is a



17   nonresponse.  It selectively quotes from passages of our brief



18   but does not say the interview should be granted, which any law



19   enforcement officer would, of course, want a defendant to say



20   anything, even if it's reading from the Denver metropolitan



21   telephone directory vs. the opportunity that couldn't go by to



22   slam the defendant.



23            But essentially, the Government's position is no



24   position.  It just simply says that whatever the Court should



25   do, it should guarantee a fair trial.







                                                       469







 1            Mr. Nichols' position is somewhat different.  As I



 2   understand it, Mr. Nichols' position is that in a joint trial,



 3   the possibility of Mr. McVeigh giving an interview might



 4   prejudice Mr. Nichols and particularly raises the question of



 5   the character that would be presented by Mr. McVeigh and points



 6   out that the Court's order with respect to extrajudicial



 7   statements prohibits or discourages statements relating to



 8   character and that therefore an interview in which one could



 9   judge a personality would be equivalent to judging the



10   character.



11            My understanding of the ABA standards and the



12   commentary is that the prohibition against character references



13   is more a negative one or doing those things that overtly and



14   directly enhance either the credibility of a person such as



15   they might take the stand, or detract from a person such as



16   saying they have a prior felony conviction.



17            But in any event, I believe that the Nichols



18   objection, if I can call it that, is not well taken.  I have as



19   an exhibit here which I will submit to the Court:  This is the



20   current issue of the New Yorker magazine which is on sale in



21   Denver, and the cover has the heading "Blaming McVeigh"; and it



22   purports -- actually, "Blaming Timothy McVeigh."  And it



23   purports to be a profile of Mr. Tigar and purports to quote



24   from him on the subject of Mr. Nichols' character.



25            I certainly don't think there is anything wrong with







                                                       470







 1   that or with Mr. Tigar's comments.  To me they are not in



 2   violation of any court order; but it does seem to me that it



 3   represents a contribution, if I can use that term, to the



 4   general publicity of the case that places us at a disadvantage.



 5            There is also on sale at every book store in Denver



 6   this book:  All-American Monster.  It's prominently displayed.



 7   There have been signing parties by the author; and in fact, for



 8   the last several days and perhaps this morning, the author is



 9   even in the courtroom.  And immediately before the commencement



10   of the proceedings in this case, the author's publishing house



11   issued a media alert and distributed it to the media covering



12   this hearing which says, "McVeigh's biographer to attend



13   hearing in Denver," and describes who he is.  And then there is



14   some lengthy quotation about me ascribed to the author.



15            And then it goes on to say that "Stickney, a native of



16   McVeigh's hometown, will be available for interviews which may



17   be scheduled NOW --" and now is in caps -- "by calling



18   Christine Kramer," and giving an 800 number.  And then goes on



19   to say, "Stickney is currently on a book author tour and has



20   appeared on A&E Biography, Late Late Night With Tom Snyder, The



21   Mike Walker Westwood One radio show, CBS Overnight, The Peter



22   Boyles Radio Show in Denver, and CBS."



23            In addition to that, I believe on Tuesday,



24   Mr. Stickney appeared for an hour and a half on a Denver radio



25   station.  At the last hearing -- and these hearings seem to







                                                       471







 1   attract authors -- Mr. Morris Dees was in town with the



 2   prominent headline that he would be giving a talk to the Denver



 3   Press Club and at least an autograph party was scheduled at the



 4   largest book store in town, certainly one of its more famous



 5   ones, the Tattered Cover.



 6            Now, we have a situation which the Court is powerless



 7   to control, and obviously we are powerless to control, where



 8   the facts of this case as perceived and certainly the crime



 9   that is alleged attracted worldwide attention.  There is simply



10   no way to deny that, nor is there any way to paraphrase H.R.



11   Haldeman, once you squeeze the toothpaste out of the tube, it's



12   hard to put it back in.  We cannot turn back the clock.



13            But nevertheless, the only surrogate that Mr. McVeigh



14   has is his lawyer.  We don't have victims speaking up for us,



15   we don't have the press speaking up for us, we don't have



16   former prosecutors speaking up for us; and there is very little



17   sympathy, if I can use that term, not in its traditional



18   meaning but in the sense of support, for either the defense,



19   the defense effort or the defendant.  There is a prejudgment



20   here.



21            But I think that what is most troubling is that this



22   is not a judge trial, it's a jury trial; and the jury will be



23   drawn either from the Denver jury wheel or from the state at



24   large.



25            We have tracked very carefully, your Honor, the polls







                                                       472







 1   that have been taken and the surveys with respect to this case.



 2   Naturally, one can always greet with skepticism what the polls



 3   mean.  But there is a common trend to them and when the polls



 4   were started, what they reflected was an overwhelming sense of



 5   belief in Mr. McVeigh's guilt, knowledge of Mr. McVeigh and who



 6   he was and the circumstances of his arrest.



 7            Conversely, though, with Mr. Nichols, the first poll,



 8   the Gallup poll, showed that most people did not know who he



 9   was.  I think it was 2 to 1 McVeigh over Nichols; and the



10   number of people that had no opinion as to his guilt was



11   somewhere in the neighborhood of 75 to 80 percent.



12            Now, what has happened during the last year and a half



13   that is Mr. McVeigh's -- if I could use a political term in



14   pollings -- negatives have leveled off.  And today, in this



15   state, according to the polls, 50 percent of the people have no



16   opinion as to his guilt or innocence.  But now, Mr. Nichols has



17   climbed to where the people that presume him to be guilty is



18   almost as high as Mr. McVeigh.  And while there may be various



19   explanations for that, I believe that one of the explanations



20   is that we have tried publicly not to convey Mr. McVeigh's



21   guilt or innocence but to convey a simple theme that no matter



22   how thin you make your pancakes, there are always two sides.



23            Your Honor said one day in response to an argument



24   made by the prosecution concerning comments that I had made



25   that I was trying to influence the jury pool; and I remember







                                                       473







 1   your Honor's comment was, Well, perhaps not.  Maybe what he's



 2   really trying to do is simply to confuse it.



 3            I hadn't thought about it in that term, but I thought



 4   about it after that.  I think about everything your Honor says



 5   and some things you don't say.  And I decided that was true.  I



 6   mean the ideal is to have a jury that knows nothing; and then



 7   the next ideal is to have a jury that, well, they may know but



 8   they want to be open-minded; and if you can't get that, then



 9   you at least want them confused so that they really don't know.



10   I mean they've heard all this, but they honest to God don't



11   know and they're willing to come in the courtroom and say, Yes,



12   I've heard about that, I've read about that, I've seen this,



13   I've heard that, but I'm willing to base it on the evidence



14   here.  But I don't think you get that in a vacuum.



15            Last week, there was an article that was sent to me



16   which appeared in the Miami Daily Business Review, and it was



17   about the motion that we filed.  And I just want to read a



18   short excerpt from it because it says it better than I can say



19   it in fewer words than I can say it.  It talks about the



20   Court's order and the Gentile case and the other cases and



21   influencing the jury pool; but then it says, "And in McVeigh's



22   case, media interviews depicting him as a human being, rather



23   than a monster, at least in outward appearance, would further,



24   rather than detract from, the goal of a fair trial before



25   jurors not strongly predisposed to either side.







                                                       474







 1            "The ideal, of course, is in the words of Chief



 2   Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Gentile, a trial," quote, "'by



 3   impartial jurors who know as little as possible of the case,'"



 4   close quote, "in advance.  But that ideal is unobtainable in a



 5   case like McVeigh's.  He has been hit with an avalanche of



 6   adverse publicity, not all of it accurate, depicting him as a



 7   mass murderer motivated by right-wing lunacy and has been shown



 8   repeatedly on television shackled and under heavy guard.  Such



 9   publicity and dire images may predispose potential jurors to



10   convict.  In this context, any success that the defense may



11   have in orchestrating a bit of humanizing publicity would be at



12   best a modest and salutary counterweight to the massive



13   publicity depicting him as a monster.  This is especially true



14   because McVeigh seeks here not to publicize evidence that would



15   be inadmissible in court or arguments about the facts of the



16   case, which he refuses to discuss, but to present an image of



17   himself smiling, chatting informally and coming across as a



18   regular guy so as to, quote, 'stop the rush to judgment of



19   guilt and soften the less than human sculpture that the



20   Government has chiseled into the consciousness of the nation,'"



21   close quote, "in the words of his attorney, Stephen Jones."



22            I cannot say it better than that.



23            The last point that I want to bring before the Court



24   is that repeatedly television stations, which is where most



25   people get their news today and their opinions are formed, show







                                                       475







 1   two things, both of them orchestrated by the Department of



 2   Justice.  The first is the walk out of the courthouse at Perry.



 3   I've seen it five times on Denver stations just while I've been



 4   here just in a casual turning on the news.  But the next thing



 5   they show is the picture at the Oklahoma County Courthouse



 6   where Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh are handcuffed with those



 7   bulletproof vests on and being taken out.



 8            Now, that television was arranged by the United States



 9   Marshal, who is an officer of the Department of Justice, which



10   is the branch prosecuting our client.



11            Now, I don't care what you want to say in a brief



12   about Stephen Jones or Tim McVeigh, but it's fundamentally



13   unfair -- in fact, it's egregiously unfair -- to permit an arm



14   of the prosecution to arrange a photo opportunity of our client



15   shackled and manacled and then stand up in court and say, Oh,



16   well, it would be improper for Mr. McVeigh to be interviewed



17   and to be seen in a more natural setting.  After all, we



18   control his access.  So no, you can see him in the prison; but



19   now you come around to the back here where we're loading him up



20   and we'll be glad to let you photograph him because we know



21   that you're going to show that.



22            And that's my last point.  The New York Times for



23   September 15, 1996, had an article about the photograph of



24   Susan McDougal.  And everything said here relates with profound



25   impact upon my client.  It's entitled "The Prep" (sic) "Walk,"







                                                       476







 1   and no truer words were ever spoken or written:  "The prep walk



 2   got a new look in Arkansas last week, when a mini-skirted Susan



 3   McDougal was led from the United States Courthouse and Post



 4   Office Building in Little Rock in chains and leg irons for



 5   vowing to maintain her silence about her former partnership in



 6   the Whitewater venture, Bill Clinton.  It was an odd twist on



 7   the customary prep walk, a decades-long tradition designed to



 8   satisfy hungry press corps, permits cops to gloat over their



 9   latest catch, help prosecutors mold public opinion and



10   humiliate suspects who find themselves in the government's



11   cross-hairs.  The opprobrium of the typical walk of the



12   perpetrator before reporters and photographers has compelled



13   many a prisoner to struggle to conceal a face or a manacled



14   pair of wrists under a coat, hat, or anything else at hand.



15   The walk done right is also supposed to make the prisoner look



16   dangerous like someone who would mail package bombs for two



17   decades, blow up a building in Oklahoma City, or attempt to



18   assassinate a president.



19            Still, the constant public relations struggle between



20   prosecutors and defendants, the prep walk is almost . . .



21   worked to the prosecutor's favor" -- I'm sorry -- "has almost



22   always worked to the prosecutor's favor, leaving the image of a



23   suspect as a true villain.  In courtrooms, judges rarely permit



24   the authorities to chain defendants in the presence of jurors



25   for fear of such a prejudicial sight, but what they can't get







                                                       477







 1   across in court the authorities can convey by permitting



 2   television cameras to capture a defendant moving in and out of



 3   the courthouse.  Indeed, the public perceptions of Theodore



 4   Kaczynski, accused of being the unabomber, Timothy McVeigh,



 5   accused of bombing the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and



 6   Aldrich Ames, the mast CIA mole for Moscow, have been shaped by



 7   the images of them paraded in chains."



 8            I do not think it is unprofessional, inappropriate or



 9   unwise for Mr. McVeigh's counsel to ask the Court in limited



10   circumstances with an understanding that he would not talk



11   about the facts of the case or the evidence or his theories to



12   present Mr. McVeigh to a selected group of journalists whom we



13   have interviewed and who would obey the Court's order and whose



14   reputation for integrity speaks for itself.



15            I think it's an unusual circumstance, but it's one



16   that's freely been granted in the past.  There is no security



17   threat here.  The Bureau of Prisons has had no objection in the



18   past; and certainly Mr. Brokaw, when he came in before, and



19   CBS, when they came in, conducted themselves in an exemplary



20   fashion.  I have no reason to believe that any of the others on



21   the list would not.



22            But we have received over 500 interviews (sic) from



23   around the world, both in the English-speaking world and other



24   languages; and so we have judicially reduced them to what we



25   consider to be about 1 percent of that total and ask the Court







                                                       478







 1   under the limited circumstances to permit it.



 2            THE COURT:  What do you expect the program content to



 3   be?  Take one of these national television interviewers where



 4   you say not more than 22 minutes.  What goes on in that 22



 5   minutes?



 6            MR. JONES:  They talk to Mr. McVeigh and film it.



 7            THE COURT:  And what do they talk about?



 8            MR. JONES:  I suppose -- I mean, obviously, they don't



 9   give their questions to me in advance.



10            THE COURT:  No, they wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't



11   expect them to.



12            MR. JONES:  But I've sat in on all of the off-the-



13   record meetings that he's had, and I would expect they would --



14   and some of them have kind of told him the type of questions



15   they would ask.  I think they have asked in the past:  How do



16   you feel?  How are you being treated?  Do you have any



17   complaints?  Which his answer has been:  I feel fine.  No, I



18   have no complaints, and I'm treated very well here.



19            How do you get along with your lawyers?  Have you seen



20   any mention of your family?  Where did you grow up?  Where did



21   you go to high school?  What was your favorite subject?  Things



22   of that nature.  I think some of them have asked questions



23   about military, you know:  Were you enlisted?  Where did you



24   go?  How long were you in the Gulf?  What did you do?  Those



25   types of questions.







                                                       479







 1            THE COURT:  And then of course one would anticipate



 2   comment after the interview or before the interview from the --



 3   you mentioned these persons.  Some of them, I recognize the



 4   names of; and I believe in those programs, they comment freely



 5   and with respect to their opinions about the subject of the



 6   interview.  And I would expect the print press to do the same



 7   thing.  That's the nature of the work they do.



 8            Now, the question that bothers me the most is that



 9   isn't that program content -- first of all, just what comes



10   from McVeigh -- the equivalent of character evidence, just as



11   character evidence would be introduced at trial, perhaps, both



12   with respect to the 404(a), and of course one would expect it



13   in mitigation if there were to be a penalty trial.  So isn't



14   this really putting on character evidence sort of in the -- not



15   to a jury but to the public as a whole and the expectation that



16   it might ultimately influence a jury?



17            MR. JONES:  Well, I thought your Honor might ask me



18   that question, and I've given it a lot of thought.  And I don't



19   think it's character evidence, but I would concede that it's



20   demeanor evidence.  To me, character -- impressions of one's



21   character is not formed by their saying where they went to



22   school or how the prison officials are treating them.  It's



23   formed by other things.  I mean traditionally, as the Court



24   knows, it was based upon reputation, being a law-abiding



25   citizen.







                                                       480







 1            But I do think that it reflects demeanor and to the



 2   extent that someone has a favorable impression of demeanor,



 3   that it might -- and I say might -- have that effect.



 4            THE COURT:  Part of that is what some called the



 5   persona, the presence.  You say "demeanor."  It's the



 6   appearance of the person:  Does this person seem to be -- I



 7   mean that's one of the things you allude to, the political



 8   reality, and that seems to be an important part of modern



 9   political process, to present one's self as being, you know, a



10   person you can trust.



11            MR. JONES:  I recognize the Court is struggling with



12   it, and so have we.  I mean there are obvious risks to the



13   defendant in doing it, and we have tried to be careful because



14   we recognize the possibilities for journalistic or commercial



15   exploitation.  I think the people that we have considered and



16   put before the Court do not fall into that category.



17            THE COURT:  Obviously, there is commercial



18   exploitation here, and commercialization in some of the things



19   you've mentioned.



20            But I'm not looking at it as that so much as really



21   one of your purposes here -- and you've already candidly



22   said -- is to try to downplay the negatives, improve the



23   positives in those terms again; and that does, it seems to me,



24   come within this prohibition in the order.  And, you know, the



25   amicus brief does mention that the order does not -- the







                                                       481







 1   June 13 order does not explicitly include defendants, but I'm



 2   certainly prepared to amend that oversight, if it be one.



 3            MR. JONES:  I assumed it was understood.



 4            THE COURT:  It says, "associated with counsel"; and I



 5   don't know anybody more associated with counsel than an accused



 6   represented by counsel.



 7            I think that character and Item C1 in the order refers



 8   to prior criminal record or the character or reputation of the



 9   defendant.



10            MR. JONES:  If that's the Court's view of what would



11   happen, then I would ask that the Court simply consider our



12   motion to be an amendment, request that the Court amend that to



13   permit this.



14            But I want to be -- and I always am -- fair and



15   straight with the Court on this matter.  I don't want to dodge



16   the bullet that the Court is aiming.  Of course, what I'm



17   trying to do is to offset to a modest, appropriate,



18   professional degree a year and a half of people who have



19   constantly gone on national television and talked about killing



20   my client, clawing out his eyes, he's a monster, he's an



21   introvert, he's a lunatic, he's a right-wing nut, he's a



22   racist.  There is only so many barrels of oil that you can put



23   on the wagon before it breaks; and while you can talk about



24   Steve Jones' curb-side press conferences to Tim McVeigh's one



25   interview with Time and one interview with Newsweek, the truth







                                                       482







 1   of the matter is that 99 percent of this has been against us.



 2   And it is certainly influencing the jury pool, or we wouldn't



 3   be in Denver.



 4            Now, the question becomes what do you do about it?



 5   Well, as the Court has candidly admitted, accurately, there is



 6   limits to what the Court can control and what it cannot



 7   control.



 8            So in our case, you do have a couple of places where



 9   interviews were granted last year and then the one very brief



10   meeting with CBS and NBC in which, at least from our side, we



11   have a track record that, with one exception, which I noted in



12   the papers, I think we've stayed inside the Court's order,



13   which wasn't even in effect for two of those at the time they



14   were done.



15            THE COURT:  I entered -- I don't know if I entered an



16   order, but I permitted some of this at the time of the



17   anniversary --



18            MR. JONES:  You did.



19            THE COURT:  -- because of the special circumstances



20   taking place at that time, the ceremonies and the like.  That



21   was before the June order when we came to grips with this



22   matter of publicity; so now it's a different time.



23            MR. JONES:  Well, I simply --



24            THE COURT:  I mean I'm -- I don't think we have a



25   problem of inconsistency here.  We're addressing this in a much







                                                       483







 1   more formal way than was done last April.



 2            MR. JONES:  Well, if there was some way that we had



 3   denotice in this country or the rules in Great Britain, that



 4   would be different.  But to have a circumstance in which



 5   everyone that is against us can say whatever they like, that's



 6   the First Amendment.  And we are gagged to some extent and



 7   cannot say anything; and then to expect that the jury comes in



 8   and will give us a fair trial is difficult.



 9            Now, there clearly are safeguards, and the Court has



10   done some of that.  The trial has been delayed and there will



11   be voir dire; and so in recognition of what the Court has done,



12   we have renewed our requests to these minimal few.



13            I will be frank with the Court.  I'm not wise enough



14   to make this decision.  That's why we passed it to you.  You



15   have the authority.  We have 500 requests --



16            THE COURT:  I have the authority but maybe not the



17   wisdom.



18            MR. JONES:  I wouldn't be presumptuous to say I have



19   the wisdom and you have the authority, but I think it is -- I



20   think it is a problem that is unique to this case.  But in my



21   soul, I know that if I had kept quiet for the last year and a



22   half, 99 percent of the people would think my client is guilty



23   instead of only 47 percent.



24            So I'll pass it to you.  As you said, that's what



25   you're here for.







                                                       484







 1            THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.



 2            Government wish to be heard on this beyond what's in



 3   the briefing?



 4            MR. HARTZLER:  If I'm not trying your patience, I



 5   have --



 6            THE COURT:  Well, you certainly you have a right to be



 7   heard, and I'd be interested in what you have to say.



 8           PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION FOR MEDIA ACCESS



 9            MR. HARTZLER:  First of all, I thank the Court the



10   Court and Mr. Jones as well as Mr. Kelley no not trying to



11   transform into some high minded First Amendment issue.



12            I think it should be clear to all of us that there is



13   not a question of First Amendment abridgement.  Saxbe sets the



14   standard, I think.



15            Also, you should be aware that the prison will allow



16   Mr. McVeigh to freely correspond with any reporter and that he



17   is free to include on his telephone list reporters; and I



18   believe that there are presently only four on his telephone,



19   but he can communicate with reporters presently within the



20   confines of the protective order, of course.



21            THE COURT:  Yes.



22            MR. HARTZLER:  And of course, this is not a situation



23   where Mr. Jones is asking that Mr. McVeigh hold a press



24   conference.  It's quite a different animal than that.  He's



25   asking for what we refer to as a beauty contest, to bring in







                                                       485







 1   reporters from various networks so that he in effect can



 2   interview them and determine which of them will present the



 3   most favorable image of Mr. McVeigh, the ones who will not ask



 4   the hard questions, the ones who will not portray him refusing



 5   to answer questions, the ones that will not depict him



 6   unfavorably wearing handcuffs or otherwise.



 7            I don't mean to be facetious here, but it appears that



 8   Mr. Jones is not genuinely asking for media access; he really



 9   seems to be asking for the Court to authorize him to allow some



10   news organizations to produce and broadcast an infomercial



11   about Timothy McVeigh.



12            And so you've hit the nail on the head when you said,



13   Isn't it going to be about character?  I think virtually



14   anything he talks about, whether he talks about prison food or



15   the Buffalo Bills or his religious beliefs or whatever that



16   is -- the purpose of the presentation, obviously, is going to



17   be to try to influence the jury pool in a manner that they will



18   view Mr. McVeigh in a more favorable light.



19            You also, I'm sure, appreciate that this is not coming



20   up at this time for no good reason.  Mr. Kelley's brief



21   indicates that he expects the trial not to start until sometime



22   next year.  I, of course, have a different hope, and I haven't



23   heard in the courtroom when the trial will start; but



24   nonetheless, I think even Mr. Jones concedes that we're coming



25   close to a trial; that he is asking for this presentation or







                                                       486







 1   this opportunity now because we are closing in on jury



 2   selection.  I don't mean closing in a matter of days, mind you.



 3            But there is a reflection of some distrust in the



 4   process of selecting a jury.  As we all know, voir dire is



 5   going to take care of a lot of the concerns that are expressed



 6   and a lot of what Mr. Jones perceives as a need for this



 7   positive public portrayal of his client.



 8            But he wants to in advance of that process -- to



 9   somehow, what he says, "confuse," but I think it really is to



10   influence the jury pool.  And we have no indication that there



11   is a need for that and if there is a need for that we all know



12   what the remedy is, and the remedy is provided by the rules of



13   criminal procedure, and is not to allow cameras into the



14   prison.  It's to file for a change of venue.



15            Clearly, Mr. Jones and Mr. McVeigh do not wish to do



16   that, apparently.  They apparently don't believe that the jury



17   pool in this venue is prejudiced against him such that he has



18   to make the same sort of presentation that he did to you in



19   Oklahoma City.



20            So we know that if there is a problem, it's obviously



21   a very limited problem.



22            I suggest we can address it in voir dire.  And there



23   is another means that will address it in part, which is the



24   trial, itself.  I mean, this infomercial portrayal of



25   Mr. McVeigh will be seen in the courtroom by the people that







                                                       487







 1   really matter, the jurors.  It won't be publicized, but the



 2   public is not going to evaluate or judge the guilt or innocence



 3   of Mr. McVeigh, anyway.



 4            So our recommendation, of course, is let's let the



 5   standard usual procedures apply and let's move toward a trial.



 6   And at bottom, your Honor, we want to try this case in the



 7   courtroom.



 8            You've also noted that in any portrayal of



 9   Mr. McVeigh, the reporters will provide their commentary.  He



10   presumes that all of them will report the conditions of the



11   interview; but in addition, they'll want to provide some



12   balance, as you suggest.  The reporters will obtain information



13   from McVeigh.  They'll want commentary from, presumably,



14   Mr. Tigar, myself, or others.  But in addition to that, the



15   concern that I have is that this may not spin out of control,



16   but there is going to be additional commentary because, as you



17   know, the media market is a highly competitive market.  I don't



18   think that if ABC wins the contest and gets the opportunity to



19   come into the prison that CBS, Fox, CNN, all the other networks



20   and news organizations are going to sit on their hands and



21   simply watch the ABC portrayal.



22            They're going to want to provide something that is as



23   newsworthy, potentially, possibly as sensational; and I can



24   think of a lot of examples.  It wouldn't surprise me at all



25   that the same sort of thing will go on that goes on sometimes







                                                       488







 1   in the presidential debates, when a group of citizens are



 2   broadcast viewing the debates and their reaction to the debates



 3   is broadcast.  You can very well imagine that one of the



 4   networks will collect a group of victims and they will sit in



 5   their homes or elsewhere with a reporter present, watching the



 6   broadcast of the interview with Mr. McVeigh and we'll have that



 7   kind of immediate reaction.  In addition, you can be sure that



 8   there is going to be a request for the same kind of



 9   noncharacter, if you will, comments from members of the



10   prosecution team and others.



11            What I'm suggesting is that it's not -- we can't



12   really just view this opportunity in isolation as though it's



13   going to be a 22-minute portrayal.  It's going to become a news



14   event in itself.



15            You and the parties have taken great pains, I believe,



16   to try to prevent this case from being tried by means of



17   publicity.  We respect that.  I hope we've honored that.  We



18   will continue to do so.



19            We believe that the way to try the case is to present



20   the evidence in the courtroom.



21            Thank you.



22            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.



23            Mr. Tigar, you wish to be heard on this?



24       DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON MOTION FOR MEDIA ACCESS



25            MR. TIGAR:  One factual observation and one legal:







                                                       489







 1             With respect to the New Yorker article that's been



 2   mentioned, authored by a self-aggrandizing megalomanic



 3   gentleman named Jeffrey Toobin, I did meet with Mr. Toobin at



 4   dinner, at which dinner he was rude to my mother, my wife, and



 5   my daughter.  My mother and my wife are here in the court today



 6   and can speak to the evidence.



 7            And I did speak to him once on the telephone.  I



 8   refused to talk to him about the facts of the case and when the



 9   New Yorker fact checker called me, I said, Well, what are you



10   going to do; and she said we are going to get into the facts.



11   I said well, where did you get them?  He said, Well, he just



12   copied that out of The New York Times and so we're not going to



13   review that with you.



14            I don't think the article has any potential



15   prejudicial impact.  It's confined to attitudes and people east



16   of the Hudson and the -- and I don't think we did anything



17   improper by having dinner with Mr. Toobin.



18            But I wanted to set the record straight that we take



19   your Honor's orders seriously.



20            The only case I talked about with Mr. Toobin the on



21   facts was one that had been concluded with a not guilty verdict



22   that I tried in August.



23            The legal point:  It is true that your Honor's earlier



24   order might be construed to extend to defendants, but -- and



25   Mr. Nichols has no plans whatever to have any interviews with







                                                       490







 1   media folks.  And we won't reevaluate that question until there



 2   is a ruling on severance.  We stand by our position.



 3            But if your Honor is going to extend the order to



 4   nonlawyers, I would suggest that you -- it's going to have to



 5   be a higher standard than the "substantially likelihood" one of



 6   the Gentile case.  Bridges vs. California, the Ford case in the



 7   Sixth Circuit, seem to say that it's got to be a "clear and



 8   present danger standard" and that the lower Gentile standard by



 9   five members of the court will only apply to lawyers.  And so



10   we wanted respectfully to suggest that if your Honor were going



11   to extend the gag order, it might have to be recrafted to take



12   account of that additional case law.  And I hope I'm not amiss



13   in making that suggestion.



14            THE COURT:  In what fashion?  What I'm proposing is



15   simply to include Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh in the -- with



16   respect to Item C.



17            MR. TIGAR:  The focus in the oral argument in Gentile,



18   your Honor, was on whether the established standard that a gag



19   order could not be entered unless there was a clear and present



20   danger of harm to the judicial process -- whether that standard



21   would be lowered in the case of lawyers.  And that was what



22   five members of the Court decided would have to -- was all



23   right.



24            So that rather than the "substantial likelihood of



25   prejudice" standard applied in Gentile, there was the higher







                                                       491







 1   standard of clear and present danger.  The court did not



 2   reeunciate and reapply that "clear and present danger" standard



 3   but in our respectful submission had been clear from such prior



 4   cases as Bridges, which did involve a party, Harry Bridges, and



 5   the Ford case in the Sixth Circuit.  That did involve a



 6   Congressperson running for office, so maybe you had other First



 7   Amendment considerations.  And it's contrary to the old Tenth



 8   Circuit case, which I didn't bring with me; but the Tijerina



 9   case, which your Honor may recall generated a lot of



10   controversy and I think there was a gag order in that case that



11   the Tenth Circuit upheld.  That's T-I-J-E-R-I-N-A.



12            Again, we're not addressing this to the Court as



13   adversaries.  I'm just pointing out to the Court that there are



14   these legal issues in which the cases do separate lawyer speech



15   from party speech.



16            THE COURT:  Well, are you objecting to extending the



17   order to Mr. Nichols?



18            MR. TIGAR:  No, I do not object to extending the



19   orders to Mr. Nichols, your Honor.  We accept whatever the



20   Court decides is right and fair.



21            I simply want to forestall having to go up to the



22   Tenth Circuit and talk to them about this, which I think is



23   what the media folks have in mind.



24            THE COURT:  All right.



25            MR. JONES:  May I respond?







                                                       492







 1            THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, yes, it's your motion.



 2        DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON MEDIA ACCESS



 3            MR. JONES:  If the Court please, I won't take up the



 4   Court's time now; but at the recess, may I have these two



 5   exhibits that I referred to marked and simply put in the



 6   record?



 7            THE COURT:  Yes.  You're not asking that I read them,



 8   now, are you?



 9            MR. JONES:  Well, I don't know.  I found some of the



10   things about Mr. Tigar to be illuminating.  In fact, I was



11   going for ask him to autograph it.



12            THE COURT:  In view of what he said about the



13   author --



14            MR. JONES:  I will say I thought the author was candid



15   and truthful.  The Mike Tigar he described is the man that I've



16   known and loved all these years.



17            MR. TIGAR:  My mother will talk to Mr. Jones.



18            MR. JONES:  Seriously, but were it true, I can see --



19   I looked carefully at my friend, Mr. Hartzler, to see if he was



20   speaking with tongue in cheek.  He wasn't.  I'm sure he was



21   speaking sincerely:  "We only want to try the case in the



22   courtroom.  We believe the way to try the case is in the



23   courtroom."



24            Were it true.  But it isn't true.  It hasn't been true



25   since the bomb.  It certainly hasn't been true since







                                                       493







 1   Mr. McVeigh was led out.



 2            We've already submitted -- and I'm not going to



 3   reargue the submissions to the Court about where the leaks are



 4   coming from.  If the Court denies this motion, the champagne



 5   bottles will break out in the prosecutor's office figuratively



 6   and in the victims association, and they'll start working the



 7   network of telephones and the press and they will continue.



 8            Mr. Hartzler says, well, if Mr. McVeigh gives an



 9   interview, there will be a panel show with the victims.  Well,



10   there is going to be a panel show of the victims anyway.



11   You're not going to be able to stop the publicity in this case.



12   This is a worldwide media event.  Everyone is going to have a



13   say-so but us.



14            That's why we have carefully, I hope, tried to pick



15   just a few areas where we could say something that would simply



16   hold up a hand to the press and to the public and say don't



17   make a judgment yet.  And that's all we're trying to do.



18            I wish it were possible for the Court to enter an



19   order that since the victims now have a Victims Right Act that



20   the Court extend the order on extrajudicial statements to



21   everyone covered by that Act.  It's not too late to do that;



22   but the Court doesn't want to do that because there would be



23   constitutional challenges, and we can't have a trial within a



24   trial and take care of all that.  And I understand that.



25            But what credit is a verdict going to have if it's for







                                                       494







 1   guilt and the death if the world perceives that this is the



 2   reverse of the O.J. Simpson case, where there, no one believed



 3   him guilty or wanted to believe him guilty when it was started,



 4   and here everyone wanted to believe Mr. McVeigh was guilty.



 5            And the whole process boiled down to an Oxbow



 6   Incident, not what happened in the courtroom; but your Honor



 7   has gone to the greatest imaginable correct lengths possible to



 8   prevent that; but out here on some days, the victims



 9   association lobby for a single trial, they lobby Congress, and



10   they are lobbying for a death penalty.  And the facts -- they



11   don't want to be bothered with the facts.  They have already



12   formed their opinion.



13            Now, the reason they formed their opinion, I



14   understand.  From my soul, I understand what they've been



15   through.  But let us not kid ourselves:  There is an organized



16   public effort to use every vehicle in the media to convict my



17   client before the first jury member has been empaneled, and



18   that will continue throughout the trial.



19                  RULING ON MOTION FOR MEDIA ACCESS



20            THE COURT:  Well, I'm ruling on the motion.  And I've



21   considered the briefing and also the arguments, of course.  And



22   the bit of levity here, I think, sort of underscores the



23   seriousness of the issue.  It's not uncommon in addressing very



24   serious issues to seek a moment of levity as something of a



25   relaxation.  We shouldn't be misunderstood by people that this







                                                       495







 1   is not being taken very seriously.



 2            I think it is important to reflect for a moment on



 3   what is the subject of the trial process.  It is not really the



 4   question of whether these defendants are guilty or innocent.



 5   The purpose of the trial process is to test the evidence



 6   against them; and the ultimate question to be asked of a jury



 7   of 12 fair and impartial persons sworn to consider only the



 8   evidence presented and received at trial and under the law is



 9   whether the Government has proved by its evidence that the



10   defendants are guilty of the charges that have been brought



11   against them by the indictment.  So it's not an abstract



12   matter, and it isn't even a matter of moral guilt or innocence;



13   it's a question of what is the evidence.  And of course, that's



14   what we'll attempt to impress on the persons going through the



15   voir dire process and ultimately on the jury.



16            There is no -- you know, I don't exist in a vacuum,



17   either.  I understand the publicity and the commercialization



18   of not only the case but the incident upon which the case is



19   based and a lot of things surrounding it; and when Mr. Jones



20   refers to who is there for the defendants, of course, in a



21   sense, I'm there.  I'm here, not for the defendants but for the



22   process and the integrity of it.



23            And while it is becoming increasingly difficult,



24   unquestionably, for the courts to function as they are designed



25   to function in an informational world as we have it,







                                                       496







 1   nonetheless, it's the plain duty of those responsible for the



 2   judicial process to ensure its fairness.



 3            As has been mentioned in the argument, there are a lot



 4   of things beyond my control.  And I recognize that.  But there



 5   are some things that I think are within the Court's ability to



 6   attempt to protect the process.  And I believe that the denial



 7   of this motion is consistent with the jurisdiction and, indeed,



 8   the responsibility that I have to ensure the fairness of the



 9   process.



10            It does seem to me that what is being asked here is an



11   opportunity to present Mr. McVeigh as a person, his character,



12   and to some extent it would affect his reputation and,



13   certainly, the public perception of him.  And that, of course,



14   as I've already pointed out, might be a matter of evidence at



15   trial; so in a very technical sense, I think that this is a



16   wide circulation of evidence, or at least potential evidence.



17            Now, in my view, it is consistent with my authority to



18   extend this June 13 order to include Mr. McVeigh and



19   Mr. Nichols; and I do so.  And therefore, on strictly legal



20   grounds under this paragraph C1 on page 10, I restrict



21   extrajudicial statements which a reasonable person would expect



22   to be disseminated by any means of public communication on



23   character or reputation of the defendants; and that applies to



24   the defendants, themselves, as it does, indeed, to the



25   Government and to the lawyers and those associated with them.







                                                       497







 1            I am reassured that Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols are



 2   not being held incommunicado; that they do have access or there



 3   is access to them for what is, I think, the most legitimate



 4   purpose and that is that they're not being mistreated or held



 5   in conditions of confinement that violate their



 6   constitutionally protected rights or that they are in some



 7   fashion abused.  And you know, if the contrary were true, that



 8   would be news; and not only would it be news, it would be



 9   something upon which this court would act.



10            So my ruling is based on my view of this as being an



11   inappropriate pretrial dissemination of evidence.



12            I would say also that I'm uncomfortable in being



13   presented with a motion that says particular media agencies can



14   have access to him and others not.  I don't think it's an equal



15   protection issue; but, you know, certainly, I want to avoid any



16   inference that there is some court participation in selection



17   of one television program or network as against another.



18            And with respect to the conditions, as for example,



19   has been suggested with respect to the British Broadcasting



20   Corporation and others -- and I don't mean this



21   disrespectfully, but it's not my general practice to accept



22   promises where I can't enforce them.  And I can't enforce any



23   agreements that would constitute a restriction on the freedom



24   of expression that belongs to the press under the First



25   Amendment.  I'm constrained by the First Amendment, as I view







                                                       498







 1   it, as is the legislature.



 2            So for these reasons, the motion is denied.



 3            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, you asked Mr. Nichols --



 4   pardon me.



 5            MR. KELLEY:  I wanted to thank the Court for



 6   accommodating me and ask to be excused.



 7            THE COURT:  Yes, you may.



 8            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.



 9            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor --



10            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Hartzler.



11            MR. HARTZLER:  You had asked Mr. Nichols' counsel if



12   they had any objection to the extension of the order to their



13   client.  I wanted to know whether Mr. McVeigh had any



14   objection.



15            THE COURT:  I understood Mr. Jones to have read the



16   order to include Mr. McVeigh already.



17            MR. JONES:  I did.  I assumed if it wasn't explicit,



18   it was certainly implicit.  And that's my position.



19            I asked the Court to consider my motion, when the



20   Court made it clear that it considered that it might apply to



21   McVeigh, to be a request to modify it for purposes of the



22   interview.  And I understand that implicit in the Court's



23   ruling is that motion has been overruled.  So I don't know that



24   my consent is important.  The Court's ruled.



25            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, it wasn't based on







                                                       499







 1   consent, but you have a right to object.  And I proceeded.  And



 2   I have not considered that it's consent by Mr. Tigar on behalf



 3   of Mr. Nichols, either; but there was an opportunity to object



 4   which was not made -- I mean, no objection was made.



 5            MR. TIGAR:  For the record, your Honor, Mr. Nichols



 6   personally consents, as well as his counsel.



 7            I see that Mr. Kelley has left the room, so he won't



 8   hear this:  Does your Honor intend to enter more detailed



 9   findings than is in the -- were contained in the comments than



10   you just made?



11            THE COURT:  No.



12            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  Now, we have the Government's motion to



14   reconsider the exclusion of witnesses, with invocation of the



15   sequestration of witnesses under Rule 615 of the Federal Rules



16   of Evidence, to amend that, to reverse it, to permit, as I



17   understand it, persons who may appear as witnesses only in the



18   penalty phase, if there be one and who would be what I guess is



19   referred to under Payne vs. Tennessee as victim impact



20   witnesses.



21            There has been, with respect to that motion, response



22   briefing; and also, I have received a motion from Marsha and



23   Tom Kight and others including the National Organization for



24   Victim Assistance asserting standing to raise rights under the



25   Victim's Bill Of Rights Act and also seeking leave to file a







                                                       500







 1   brief as amici curiae with respect to the standing.  I'm



 2   denying that.  The statute itself provides that there is no



 3   implied right of action or cause of action; and as I review



 4   that, it seems to me that while again it's not explicit, it's



 5   certainly implicit in the intent of Congress as expressed in



 6   the act that it does not include the right to appear in the



 7   proceedings through counsel.



 8            I have -- I have granted the motion to submit the



 9   brief and I've read it, the memorandum brief.



10            The respective positions of the Government and each of



11   the accused have been addressed in the briefing, but I'll hear



12   if there is a need for any extension of that through oral



13   argument.  It is the motion of the Government.  Mr. Hartzler,



14   do you wish to address it?



15            MR. HARTZLER:  Ms. Behenna is prepared to address it.



16            THE COURT:  All right.



17            MS. BEHENNA:  Just briefly if I could.



18            THE COURT:  Very well.



19            PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER



20            MS. BEHENNA:  I find myself in the unenviable position



21   of having the Court reconsider an order that it's entered not



22   once but twice denying victims; so some indulgence from the



23   Court, I would appreciate.



24            I wanted to begin, your Honor, with discussing your



25   concerns that victim impact evidence be true impact as a result







                                                       501







 1   of the crime, as opposed to what the victims hear in court.



 2   And I think there are some points that I would like the Court



 3   to consider in reconsidering this.



 4            THE COURT:  Yes.  And let me say, just to help you



 5   focus here, that I just reread the Payne vs. Tennessee this



 6   morning to refresh myself about its language; and of course, to



 7   reread it is to read multiple opinions, as in most of these



 8   matters --



 9            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.



10            THE COURT:  -- affecting the death penalty.  And also,



11   its overruling of Booth vs. Maryland and others; and one of the



12   things that's troubling here, I think, is that the Supreme



13   Court justices who have expressed their views on this have not



14   been very clear about exactly what victim impact evidence



15   means.  We know what it means in connection with the facts of



16   that case.



17            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.



18            THE COURT:  But, you know, there is nothing out there



19   that approaches what we're dealing with in this case.



20            And I do have that language -- I mean, that language



21   that it must be the impact of the criminal conduct.  I believe



22   that's consistent with what each of the justices expressed in



23   the written opinions.



24            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.  And to carry on that theme, your



25   Honor, those are the issues that I want to raise with you this







                                                       502







 1   morning.



 2            There are some victims, survivors of the Oklahoma City



 3   bombing, who may provide what I'm calling occurrence testimony;



 4   that is, what they saw just before the bomb exploded as well as



 5   being survivors and having their own stories of victim impact.



 6            To the extent those witnesses will testify in the case



 7   in chief during the guilt phase, I would concede with the Court



 8   that those people should be excluded.  I think the whole



 9   purpose of 615, obviously, was to prevent people from tailoring



10   their testimony to what they've heard that comes before them as



11   well as to prevent fabrication; so to that extent, I would



12   agree with the Court that those people should be excluded from



13   hearing the trial testimony.



14            Where I differ with the Court's opinion and where I



15   think there is a lack of authority with regard to true victim



16   impact testimony, I would submit this to the Court:  The



17   victims of the Oklahoma City bombing live with the impact of



18   this crime upon their lives daily.  There is nothing that they



19   could hear during the course of this trial that would change



20   that impact that it's had on their lives.



21            I would agree with the Court that the victim impact



22   evidence that the Government is going to present is going to



23   have to be limited to true victim impact.  And I think that's



24   what we're suggesting.  We understand that this -- that it's



25   our responsibility with regard to the penalty phase, and we're







                                                       503







 1   not going to try and present some other evidence, prejudicial



 2   and influential, other than true victim impact.



 3            My point being, your Honor, that the daily realization



 4   of their lives and how they have changed should not fit them



 5   within the category of witnesses to be excluded under 615.



 6            THE COURT:  Well, here let's get directly to the



 7   point; and it's raised in the briefing in opposition.  And that



 8   is the trauma of the trial process itself, not what they hear



 9   from the witness stand and other witnesses.



10            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.



11            THE COURT:  It is to the presence of the defendants,



12   their reaction to being in the same room with these two men.



13   It is to the arguments that have been raised by counsel.



14   Indeed, it is to the conduct of the court in connection with



15   the case and rulings made.



16            Now, you know, I don't think that it's news to anybody



17   who has participated in a trial that there are traumas to



18   trial.



19            MS. BEHENNA:  No doubt.



20            THE COURT:  Counsel, judges -- we all have some need



21   to control emotions and we are human beings -- judges, too; and



22   certainly, the concern here is that it is when we're dealing in



23   emotion and feelings and that's what victim impact testimony is



24   about; and I have carefully reviewed the declarations and



25   affidavits of the people who have come from those disciplines







                                                       504







 1   who talk about the emotional impact.  But what is -- what is



 2   very strong in my mind at this time is some of the quotations



 3   that have been included in briefing about what victims have



 4   said even to the press as a result of their being here in these



 5   very preliminary proceedings.



 6            MS. BEHENNA:  I understand; and that is of concern to



 7   us as well.  And I'm not trying to suggest that we minimize and



 8   say that that's not important; that we can't control the



 9   victims.  The Victim Witness Unit at the U.S. Attorney's



10   office, myself and Pat Ryan -- and this might not be



11   satisfactory to the Court -- will accept the responsibility of



12   trying to make sure the victims understand the etiquette in the



13   courtroom.  It is difficult to control victims' First Amendment



14   rights.



15            THE COURT:  I'm not suggesting anything inappropriate



16   by their comments.  That's within their freedom; and I think



17   it's also a matter that, you know, without being a



18   psychologist, I think that probably helps --



19            MS. BEHENNA:  I think it does --



20            THE COURT:  -- to express their views, including



21   negative opinions of the court's rulings and all of those



22   things.  Sure, that's part of it.



23            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.



24            THE COURT:  But I don't see any way in which you can



25   cabin that kind of emotion and feeling and reaction to what







                                                       505







 1   they see and hear and say, well, that has had no effect or



 2   could have no effect on their testimony, if it ever gets



 3   received, as to what has happened to their lives as a result of



 4   these alleged crimes.



 5            MS. BEHENNA:  Well -- and if the Court has reviewed



 6   the responses of the Government, in particular the declaration



 7   of Dean Kilpatrick, who deals with crime victims all the time,



 8   that has been his life's work.  In his declaration, he says



 9   it's actually therapeutic.  I mean, it's going to be stressful,



10   your Honor --



11            THE COURT:  Well, but, you see, he's addressing it



12   from the standpoint of those persons.  It may be therapeutic to



13   them, but doesn't it influence how -- the fact that it's



14   therapeutic to them, in and of itself, affects their testimony,



15   doesn't it?



16            MS. BEHENNA:  No, your Honor, I don't see that jump,



17   because, as I was mentioning earlier, what we're talking about



18   is a daily impact.  Whatever feelings they have about these



19   defendants, they have about them now, they've had about them --



20   they had the feelings about the defendants on April 19.  After



21   an adjudication of guilt, your Honor, their feelings are not



22   going to change.



23            If we agree to keep the testimony truly impact -- and



24   I understand they're going to be emotional and I understand



25   it's going to be difficult, your Honor; but I think that those







                                                       506







 1   victims have the right -- those that choose to want to be in



 2   the courtroom have the right to do that, understanding that



 3   emotion and trauma might be very much a part of what they're



 4   going to hear.



 5            Your Honor, we have had four hearings, maybe five,



 6   since your Honor has taken over this case.  And in every one of



 7   those hearings, victims have been present to hear what is going



 8   on, in particular during the venue hearings.  They saw



 9   videotapes of the building and the carnage and the blood.



10   There was no emotional outburst after that.



11            And I know emotional outburst is not all you're



12   concerned about, but that's certainly a part of it.



13            Since January of this year, members of the prosecution



14   team and Lynn Anderson with the victim witness unit and myself



15   have conducted interviews of the survivors and the family



16   members.  Those summaries of their victim impact -- and that



17   was the sole purpose of those interviews -- is going to be



18   preserved and provided to the defense.  To the extent that



19   their testimony changes and becomes more traumatic or includes



20   more facts or more emotion than what is in that summary, the



21   defendant is going to have the opportunity to cross them on



22   that.



23            We have tried to preserve the true victim impact to



24   the extent that we can, understanding that additional surgeries



25   and additional scar revisions on a face won't be a part of that







                                                       507







 1   victim impact statement or that summary we're going to provide



 2   to the defense.  But we're trying to at least give a baseline



 3   for not only ourselves, your Honor, but for the defense, so



 4   that if there is deviation from that, they can certainly be



 5   cross-examined on that.



 6            I think it is real important -- and I know it's not



 7   the Court's position to consider the therapeutic event -- or



 8   effect this might have on some victims; but there is a real



 9   need for some of the family members that I've met with to hear



10   how this crime came about.  And again, your Honor, maybe having



11   heard that evidence will somehow cause them to be less



12   emotional about it.  I'm not suggesting that it's not going to



13   be traumatic.



14            And I understand the Court's concern to protect the



15   defendants' rights and make sure that the victim impact



16   evidence they're going to get is not exacerbated by emotion.



17   My suggestion to the Court is that's going to happen anyway



18   because it's going to come after an adjudication of guilt.



19   What we can do is preserve their testimony, provide it to the



20   defense, and allow them to cross on it.



21            I think when we're talking about the law in this



22   case -- and that is 615 and exclusion of witnesses to prevent



23   tailoring -- we don't have that same concern, tailoring of



24   testimony, making facts look like they mesh with regard to



25   victim impact.







                                                       508







 1            If the Court wants the assurance of the Victims



 2   Witness Unit, myself and Pat Ryan, to insure that we talk to



 3   these victims and to make sure they understand it's going to be



 4   emotional and to make sure they understand that they are --



 5   there are limitations with regard to the evidence that they're



 6   going to give during the victim impact -- during the penalty



 7   phase, we will gladly accept that responsibility.



 8            Your Honor, Congress has given these victims the right



 9   to be present during the trial.  And I don't believe that that



10   right is inconsistent with the defendants' rights of a fair



11   trial.  And I don't believe the law requires their exclusion



12   during the trial proceedings.



13            It is for those reasons, your Honor, I ask the Court



14   reconsider its rulings and allow the victims the opportunity to



15   choose for themselves whether they will be present and hear the



16   trial testimony during the guilt phase of this case.



17            THE COURT:  Thank you.



18            All right, Mr. Burr, you wish to be heard on this?



19            MR. BURR:  Yes, your Honor.



20        DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER



21            MR. BURR:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, it is



22   difficult for all of us, I think, to address this question.  I



23   think there is profound empathy and sympathy and compassion



24   from all corners of this courtroom for the suffering that



25   people have endured and must endure.  That makes it doubly







                                                       509







 1   difficult, I think, to strike the balance that we submit the



 2   Constitution requires.



 3            We certainly respect and appreciate the offer that



 4   Ms. Behenna has made and accept it in good faith to try to work



 5   with witnesses to help them stay on track and keep their



 6   testimony accurate and accurately recounting the effects of the



 7   bombing on them.



 8            No matter how hard they try, however, and no matter



 9   how hard the victim impact witnesses try, we think that it is



10   beyond human capacity to give assurances to the Court that



11   there will be no effect on the testimony from having sat



12   through the trial.  There is one thing, I think, that all of



13   the experts who have submitted declarations agree on, and that



14   is that going through the trial process will be retraumatizing



15   on the victim witnesses who are here and, indeed, to the



16   victims who are here who are not witnesses.  It will be very



17   difficult day in and day out for folks.



18            There is also something that I think is not disputed



19   in the declarations which is not really addressed by the



20   Government's experts but is clearly addressed by our own, and



21   that is what happens with traumatic memory and the effects on



22   it.  Everybody agrees, I think, that the gist of the events



23   that people have experienced is likely to be accurately



24   remembered.



25            However, as Dr. Brown and Professor Scheflin have







                                                       510







 1   pointed out, particularly in their appendix to their



 2   declaration with which all the experts agreed, when you talk --



 3   when we're looking at memory for the peripheral details of



 4   events; that is, things that are not quite at the core of them,



 5   memory is subject to distortion, particularly memories that are



 6   a result of trauma.  And that distorting process can happen



 7   quite readily when there is retraumitization.



 8            Just so the Court understands what we mean by that,



 9   core and peripheral details, the core details are ones that the



10   Government's experts have focused on:  The death of a loved



11   one, the injury to oneself, the financial hardships that were



12   occasioned by those injuries, and the acute psychological grief



13   and heartache that accompanied the death and the injuries.



14            But the impact of this crime or of this event is --



15   has many more ramifications than that.  And that's what we



16   think are the peripheral details that people will be entitled



17   to testify about but that are far from the core and are subject



18   to distortion by retraumatization.  These include such things



19   as the close and intimate relationships with others that may



20   have been affected; the way in which one cares for and relates



21   to one's children or other family members may have been



22   affected; one's job performance and job satisfaction may have



23   been affected; one's very motivation to take on new challenges,



24   new responsibilities, and new tasks to be affected; one's sense



25   of self-esteem, indeed one's sense of meaning and purpose in







                                                       511







 1   life.  All of these things are more peripheral than the core



 2   impact of the event.  And they're certainly matters that people



 3   can testify about.  And those are the matters that -- the



 4   texture and stuff of people's lives which we submit the expert



 5   testimony -- or expert declarations say where the risk is.



 6   There is risk of distortion in a retraumatization process.



 7            It may well be that having taken statements from folks



 8   before trial would give us some ability to cross-examine people



 9   if there is a change in what they say.  But I don't think that



10   we as counsel are likely to cross-examine about that.  The pain



11   and suffering that people express is going to be what they



12   express.  It is also, I think, very unlikely that people can



13   disentangle feelings that they have from the witness stand that



14   they feel like they are honestly expressing, from feelings that



15   they expressed in a lawyer's office some months before.



16            For that reason, we feel that there is a risk, a



17   genuine and substantial risk, that the process of sitting



18   through trial proceedings could distort and make inaccurate



19   some of the testimony provided by some of the victim impact



20   witnesses.



21            It is -- there is certainly no way to predict



22   accurately or with certainty what will happen; both what may



23   happen in the courtroom, in the gallery, or from what may



24   happen from the witness stand.  It is a matter of weighing



25   risks; and at least the Eighth Amendment has been concerned







                                                       512







 1   since Furman vs. Georgia about weighing and trying to eliminate



 2   risks to the unfairness of the sentencing process.



 3            One of the clear areas of unfairness that preexisted



 4   Furman was that the concern, the due process concern, that



 5   sentencing decisions be based on accurate information.



 6            The Court -- the Supreme Court began with a case



 7   called Burke vs. Townsend in 1948 to express that concern, and



 8   it is that concern and that right that we think is at stake



 9   here and that has to be preserved in the balance of empathy and



10   compassion for victims.



11            There is, your Honor, I think an elegant statement of



12   what this Court can and should do provided in a book that was



13   written in 1992 by Tim Sullivan called Unequal Verdicts.  It is



14   an account of the trial of the persons accused of attacking the



15   young woman jogger in Central Park in New York.  I'd like to



16   close by simply reading a paragraph from his afterward in the



17   book:



18            "In the current conservative political climate, it has



19   become fashionable to attack the courts for a supposed failure



20   to avenge the victims of violent crime; but it is fairness, not



21   vengeance, that gives the American criminal justice system its



22   strength.  The U.S. Constitution and all of the criminal



23   procedure laws that derive from it cannot restore any victim to



24   the status she enjoyed before she became a target of criminals.



25   Perhaps the best those laws can do is make it difficult for the







                                                       513







 1   state with its enormous discretionary powers of prosecution to



 2   punish the wrong person."



 3            We ask that the Court maintain its order and strike



 4   the balance in favor of preserving the rights of the



 5   defendants.  Thank you.



 6            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Burr.



 7            Mr. Neureiter.



 8         DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER



 9            MR. NEUREITER:  May it please the Court, the Supreme



10   Court held in Booth vs. Maryland when it ruled victim impact



11   testimony unconstitutional that one of the reasons is that it



12   tends to emphasize the emotional trauma suffered by the family.



13   Of course, now, Booth was overruled two years later; but the



14   fact remains that emotional trauma will be a major aspect of



15   any victim impact testimony.



16            The test before the Court is whether the victims'



17   testimony may be materially affected by something that they may



18   see at trial.



19            As the Court pointed out in one of its earlier rulings



20   on this issue, the Court sits looking forward and has to give a



21   prospective view, not looking backward.  It's not retrospective



22   with hindsight.  The Court has to decide what may happen, what



23   may likely happen.



24            The Court has before it expert affidavits from five



25   experts, four of whom agree that distortions may well occur.







                                                       514







 1   I'd like to read two sentences from the letter submitted by the



 2   Government, Dr. Mary P. Coss, Ph.D.



 3            "It is inevitable that witnesses called to testify



 4   about the bombing will experience a heightened level of



 5   emotionality.  However, individuals differ in the extent to



 6   which their effect will be increased and how much emotionality



 7   they reveal.  Thus, I am --" and I skipped a bit there.  "I am



 8   in general agreement with Brown and Scheflins point that there



 9   is no way to predict reactions among victim impact witnesses.



10   The suggestion that emotionality will affect how memory is



11   retold is true but only within limits."



12            So there, even the Government's expert acknowledges



13   that the distortions that Mr. Burr talked about are likely to



14   occur.



15            The main thrust of the Government's expert affidavits



16   is that it would be beneficial and therapeutic for the victims



17   to attend the trial and testify at the penalty phase.



18            We do not dispute that, and I hope the Court



19   understands that the last thing we would want to do was to



20   hinder the healing process of the people and the victims who



21   have suffered so much.



22            What we are asking, however, is that they make a



23   choice, a choice between going through the healing process



24   while sitting as -- in the pews behind me, watching the trial,



25   or deciding to testify at the penalty phase.  That is a choice







                                                       515







 1   that we believe the law and the Constitution require.



 2            The final point I'd like to make is that the



 3   Government suggests that the policies underlying Rule 615 do



 4   not apply to the sentencing phase.  Well, the primary



 5   underlying policy of Rule 615 is the insurance of accuracy in



 6   testimony.



 7            The only reason that victims would be taking the stand



 8   at a penalty phase would be to insure the death of Mr. Terry



 9   Nichols and Mr. Tim McVeigh.  And at that time, perhaps above



10   all other, accuracy should be a paramount concern.



11            THE COURT:  Ms. Behenna, do you have some joinder?  I



12   think I understand the position.



13            MS. BEHENNA:  With that, your Honor, we have no other



14   comment.



15                RULING ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION



16            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I'm -- I feel it



17   important to rule on this motion now as well, in part because



18   I'm looking at some of the people on whose behalf the motion



19   was filed.  I don't mean to suggest that there are people



20   present in the courtroom who have been identified as witnesses



21   and that there be some violation of the Court's previous order.



22   I don't mean that at all.  But I assume that among those people



23   present here are persons who have suffered greatly as a result



24   of the explosion in Oklahoma City; and I think that one aspect



25   of some justice is that you don't just read about or hear about







                                                       516







 1   indirectly the basis upon which I make a ruling that so much



 2   affects the lives of the people who have been -- who have had



 3   their lives shattered by this.



 4            The original ruling was made in a way that could, I



 5   suppose, be perceived as kind of an offhand ruling, because it



 6   was made early on.  And a part of the issue that's presented



 7   here is indeed whether pretrial hearings should be considered



 8   at all and whether Rule 615 is applicable to pretrial hearings



 9   as compared with the trial itself and the testimony of



10   witnesses there.  But it wasn't an offhand ruling, and I have



11   reconsidered it before and carefully reconsider it now in view



12   of the additional papers that have been filed and have



13   reflected on it.



14            As has been mentioned here, the Supreme Court not so



15   long ago ruled that in state court proceedings in capital



16   cases, the introduction of victim impact testimony was a



17   violation of the Constitution and the Eighth Amendment.  That



18   ruling has been changed.  But as I mentioned in discussing this



19   matter with Government's counsel, it's not at all clear as to



20   how it has been changed.



21            Now, rules of evidence generally deal with historical



22   fact, and the exclusionary rules of evidence are designed to



23   attempt to assure that the persons testifying about historical



24   facts are doing so on the basis of their own perception, their



25   own -- the use of their percipient faculties to tell us in







                                                       517







 1   court under oath what it is that they saw and heard and felt



 2   sometimes in a sensory way, not in an emotional way; and that,



 3   of course, is the raw material of trial.



 4            When we get to this area of testimony, we are



 5   necessarily dealing with something that is not traditional



 6   under the rules; and it is very difficult to, I think,



 7   articulate the limits of the testimony.  That's one of the



 8   things that lies ahead of us here, if there is a penalty phase



 9   for either of the accused.  There will have to be some



10   definition of what constitutes admissible impact evidence.



11   It's not clear, I think, to any of us now what that will be.



12            But certainly, I think what is intended is that the



13   experience of loss from the conduct in question is the



14   testimony.  Now, what happens if those persons also go through



15   the experience of trial, being present in the courtroom, and as



16   I've already alluded to, observing the accused, observing



17   counsel, observing all of the things that happen at trial,



18   rulings of the court.  It is impossible for me to believe that



19   that extension of experience, which I think is not a part of



20   the admissible evidence, can be separated out from the



21   experience that otherwise has followed from the loss and the



22   grief and the other emotions.  We're talking about emotions.



23   And there are, as I've already indicated in colloquy with



24   counsel -- there are emotions from being in the courtroom, from



25   everybody who is in the courtroom.  So in my mind, there is







                                                       518







 1   simply no way to separate it.



 2            I noted in the memorandum submitted here that I



 3   received as amici great reference or great reliance on the



 4   Congress and its legislative purpose and language of the act.



 5   And the reference is made here that Congress did not pass a



 6   defendant's Bill of Rights.



 7            Of course, it's not necessary for the Congress to pass



 8   a defendant's Bill of Rights.  That's what the Constitution



 9   does in the Bill of Rights amendments in the Constitution.



10            But, you know, I think it is often misunderstood when



11   they talk about "defendants' rights."  We're not talking about



12   defendants' rights as such.  We're talking about the protection



13   of the integrity of the process by which defendants are judged



14   and the evidence is judged.



15            And that's the responsibility of a judge, and that's



16   the responsibility I'm attempting to meet by what seems as a



17   very hard-hearted rule; and that is to say those persons who



18   are going to testify or expected to testify in the case may not



19   be spectators to any of the trial proceedings, including



20   pretrial proceedings.  And the argument is made as a legalistic



21   argument -- the Government didn't make it; but, again, I want



22   to address it because it's in this brief that has been filed on



23   behalf of The National Organization for Victim Witnesses.  And



24   you know, it is that this Congressional enactment was



25   subsequent to Rule 615 and, therefore, the Court should







                                                       519







 1   interpret Rule 615 as having been in some fashion amended by



 2   this statute.



 3            Well, you know, Rule 615, the enactment of the Federal



 4   Rules of Evidence, is not the first time that courts have



 5   excluded witnesses under a sequestration order.  That clearly



 6   predated the Federal Rules of Evidence, and I think has been a



 7   part of the common law of evidence since there has been a



 8   common law of evidence.  And it goes back through history



 9   beyond the history of this republic.  It has been an integral



10   part of the fairness of trial proceedings for centuries and



11   continues to be so and will be applied in this case.



12            And I adhere to my ruling previously made and deny the



13   motion for reconsideration.



14            Now, I'm prepared to take a recess.  I believe that



15   the item next scheduled on the order to go, as it were, being



16   some motions filed on behalf of Mr. Nichols, are not going to



17   be required to be heard; that it's anticipated that there may



18   be some resolution of the issues prepared -- or presented



19   there.  Is that right, Mr. Tigar?



20            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  We -- the Government and



21   counsel for Mr. Nichols have reached agreement on a



22   stipulation.  We will be presenting an agreed order to your



23   Honor this afternoon.



24            THE COURT:  All right.  So the next one is --



25            MR. HARTZLER:  I'm sorry.







                                                       520







 1            THE COURT:  Excuse me, Mr. Hartzler.



 2            MR. HARTZLER:  I was anticipating that the defense



 3   would prepare an order and submit it to you.  We have proffered



 4   to Mr. Tigar a proposed stipulation, the purpose of which is to



 5   simply obviate the need for any evidence.



 6            There is a matter which could be characterized as



 7   "disputed," which I think will need court action.  I didn't



 8   mean to suggest that there would be an agreement as to the



 9   order, but we certainly accept the fact that --



10            THE COURT:  Well, that's why I said an "anticipated



11   resolution."



12            MR. TIGAR:  I should have the used the term



13   "anticipated resolution."  I'm aware of the terminological



14   problem I've created for my adversary, and I amend.



15            THE COURT:  All right.  At any rate, there does not



16   appear to be any need for hearing the motion.



17            MR. HARTZLER:  Correct.



18            THE COURT:  We do have a motion to suppress or motions



19   to suppress.  The other matter on there was the matter of the



20   temporary restraining order that I issued earlier with respect



21   to Dr. Whitehurst being interviewed; and we're anticipating



22   that it's not necessary -- I'm anticipating it's not necessary



23   to hear that at -- on this day.



24            MR. HARTZLER:  I've met his counsel this morning, and



25   I hope to speak with him this afternoon.







                                                       521







 1            THE COURT:  All right.  So I do want to come back to



 2   some of the discovery items before we adjourn; but at any rate,



 3   let's take our recess, and the next item is the motions to



 4   suppress.



 5            20 minutes.



 6       (Recess at 10:46 a.m.)



 7       (Reconvened at 10:55 a.m.)



 8            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.



 9            We have the motions filed by defendants to suppress



10   evidence and derivative evidence based upon some tests.



11            Mr. Nigh, are you going to address this?



12            MR. NIGH:  Yes, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  All right.



14     DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE



15            MR. NIGH:  Your Honor, if I may, I believe that there



16   are really only three issues that are posed by the motion based



17   upon the Government's response, and first is whether these



18   tests fall under the terms of the agreement.  That, I think,



19   can be resolved by reference to the exhibits that were attached



20   to the brief that I filed.  I would ask the Court to consider



21   those exhibits as substantive evidence.



22            I've spoken to Ms. Wilkinson, and the Government



23   doesn't oppose that.



24            THE COURT:  Is that right, Ms. Wilkinson?



25            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, as long as they remain under







                                                       522







 1   seal, your Honor.



 2            THE COURT:  Yes.  All right.



 3            MR. NIGH:  The second issue is whether we were



 4   permitted to observe the tests in the manner contemplated by



 5   the agreement.  That issue requires witness testimony.  And for



 6   that issue, I propose to call one witness.



 7            THE COURT:  All right.



 8            MR. NIGH:  The third and the final issue is the remedy



 9   in the event the Court finds that the agreement was breached;



10   and that, I think, is just the subject of argument.  So with



11   that --



12            THE COURT:  What is the -- what is to be included in



13   the testimony?  I'm not clear about that.  The Government's



14   response outlined the -- well, it included the statement of



15   facts.  Is there a disagreement with the statement of facts?



16            MR. NIGH:  Not with the statement of facts, your



17   Honor.  What the testimony would demonstrate would be the



18   differences between our ability to observe and the



19   representatives of the FBI and their ability to observe.



20            THE COURT:  Isn't that included in the statement of



21   the facts with respect to the distance and the bunker and all



22   that?



23            MR. NIGH:  The distance in the bunker, yes, your



24   Honor.  I think there's more to it than that that I could



25   demonstrate through the testimony of Mr. Killam.  I could







                                                       523







 1   perhaps read a laundry list of things that we weren't able to



 2   see that we thought the agreement contemplated we would be able



 3   to see, and the Government may not disagree with that, and that



 4   may be the best way to dispense with the problem.



 5            THE COURT:  Well, isn't that all based on the location



 6   of the observation point as compared with the -- I think it's



 7   called the bunker here where the other participants were?



 8            MR. NIGH:  It's based --



 9            THE COURT:  Or the participants were.



10            MR. NIGH:  Yes, your Honor.  It's based upon that



11   difference and also the difference on the access to the pad



12   itself, both before the detonation of each test-improvised



13   explosive device to see the configuration of the device, what



14   it looked like, how it was set up, the physical arrangements



15   between the components and the targets on the test pad, the



16   distances to the targets and our ability to actually observe



17   those things from where we were, more accurately, and also to



18   observe the test pad after each detonation of an improvised



19   explosive device and the differences between where we were on



20   the very corner of the test pad and what we were able to



21   observe from that vantage point versus what the FBI



22   participants were able to observe from walking the test pad,



23   being actually in the craters after each test, physically



24   examining the targets, collecting evidence from the targets,



25   inspection of each of the automobiles that had been placed on







                                                       524







 1   the pad and things of that nature.



 2            THE COURT:  Well, let me ask this question:  Have your



 3   people, your experts had -- have they had access to the data



 4   generated?



 5            MR. NIGH:  No, your Honor.  Not from these tests.



 6            THE COURT:  Ms. Wilkinson.



 7         PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE



 8            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, that's not correct.  As we



 9   put in our letter -- and I think it's in one of the exhibits



10   that Mr. Nigh has attached to his brief -- we provided him all



11   of the data from the 1994, 1995, and the 1996 tests that have



12   been collected so far.  The only thing he has not received is



13   the report analyzing that data.  And as Dr. Marshall said in



14   his affidavit, as soon as that's completed, we'll provide it to



15   the defense, and we've informed that -- them of that since the



16   day the tests occurred.



17            THE COURT:  So is this like seismic data and that sort



18   of thing?



19            MS. WILKINSON:  It's actually analysis of the residue



20   collected and,yes, of the velocity of detonation of the



21   improvised explosive device and blast pressure and other



22   scientific data that he wants to consider the effects of the



23   large improvised device.



24            THE COURT:  The significance of all of this



25   controversy is, of course, rooted in what you intend to do with







                                                       525







 1   it and whether that's going to be either some basis for opinion



 2   testimony or whether any of that physically is going to be in



 3   evidence.  Do you know yet?



 4            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe it's our intention at this



 5   point, your Honor, not to introduce the physical evidence that



 6   was collected but to allow or permit our experts to rely on



 7   that data to support the conclusions that they have previously



 8   come to long before the 1996 tests were conducted.  In other



 9   words --



10            THE COURT:  There are -- as I understand it, there



11   are, what, three tests?



12            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, sir.



13            THE COURT:  The 1996 was done, of course -- you say



14   that the whole thing was under a protocol that was not within



15   the control of the United States Government?



16            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct.  We say that and



17   Dr. Marshall says that in his affidavit.



18            THE COURT:  Yeah.  And that the testing 1994,



19   obviously, was done with a different objective than anything



20   related to this case as such.  And then there was a 1995?



21            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct.  In October and



22   November, the British Government conducted the test in Socorro



23   without the FBI participation.



24            THE COURT:  And then in 1996, since this was going to



25   be done anyway, there was some, I assume from this, FBI input







                                                       526







 1   as to the protocol, the test design and so forth that would



 2   make it of value here.



 3            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, would you mind if I took



 4   the podium while you ask me questions?



 5            THE COURT:  I think you should.



 6            I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Nigh.  It's important to



 7   get to what's the issue instead of just calling witnesses and



 8   proceeding and see where we are on the issue.



 9            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, it's my understanding --



10   and I believe Dr. Maurice Marshall's affidavit supports these



11   facts or sets forth the facts -- that the general protocol was



12   established in 1994 of the testing.  That was how they would



13   actually devise these improvised explosive devices, the



14   containers they would use, how they would detonate these



15   devices, what type of witness material would be placed on the



16   test pad and what type of measurements they would take.  And



17   they used that same protocol in '95 and in 1996.



18            THE COURT:  What does "witness material" mean?  That's



19   not a phrase that I recognize.



20            MS. WILKINSON:  That means the evidence that they are



21   going to try and study after the blast occurs.  In other words,



22   they are going to put -- they put vehicles out there, they put



23   U.S. street signs and British street signs and other materials



24   so they can see what the impact of the blast has and whether



25   they can collect residues off those materials.







                                                       527







 1            THE COURT:  All right.



 2            MS. WILKINSON:  So those general protocols were



 3   established.  For example, each improvised device was placed in



 4   a steel container, depending on the size of the device, was



 5   detonated by a C4, and so they would replicate those procedures



 6   each time, so the study really goes to what was contained in



 7   the main charge; that is, whether it was ammonium nitrite and



 8   fuel oil or ammonium nitrate and some other substance.



 9   Therefore, they would have baseline data.



10            It was not to replicate the Oklahoma City bombing or



11   even bombings that even occurred in the United Kingdom.  It was



12   to study the different size of the blasts and the different



13   types of the devices to determine if they could then use that



14   information when they go out to crime scenes or for other



15   purposes.  So in 1996, the only thing that was different was



16   the size and types of devices they were testing.



17            THE COURT:  And was the change, the difference, the



18   result of a request by the FBI or some U.S. Government agency



19   to --



20            MS. WILKINSON:  Not to my understanding, your Honor.



21   I believe the data that we provided to the defense shows that



22   in 1994, they used ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, and that was



23   before the Oklahoma City bombing.  They used it again during



24   the 1996 tests as well as ammonium nitrate and another



25   substance which the British often see used by terrorist







                                                       528







 1   organizations.



 2            THE COURT:  So is it the intention then that some



 3   expert witness or multiple witnesses at trial would give



 4   opinions about -- that are relevant to this case and utilize



 5   this data as some support for those opinions, sort of like



 6   other tests or learned treatise information?



 7            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe what we intend to do, your



 8   Honor, is they would make clear that they made their



 9   conclusions prior to the testing, if the Court permits this



10   type of testimony.  They came to their conclusions about the



11   Oklahoma City bombing and the cause of the explosion prior to



12   the 1996 tests.  They would use the data or the analysis from



13   1996 to support their conclusions, especially if asked on



14   cross-examination whether they were familiar with the ammonium



15   nitrate and fuel oil bombs and the effects and the scientific



16   study of those type of devices.  So it would be a way to



17   support or bolster their testimony that there is some



18   scientific data underlying the conclusions that they reached



19   prior to the 1996 testing.



20            THE COURT:  Now, the position you've taken here, as I



21   understand it, is that if there's a -- if this -- it's to be



22   considered that there was a failure to perform some agreement,



23   it is because the control was with the British Government?



24            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct, your Honor.  And I



25   believe the documents that Mr. Nigh himself submits show that







                                                       529







 1   from the first document that exists where Mr. Hartzler wrote a



 2   letter to counsel advising them of the tests.  He sets forth, I



 3   believe in the second paragraph saying the tests will be



 4   conducted -- perhaps it's the first -- under the direction and



 5   control of Dr. Maurice Marshall from the Defense Forensic



 6   Explosives Laboratory in the United Kingdom and that if they



 7   want to participate, they have to agree to accept all of his



 8   safety rules, his safety briefing.  And his name is mentioned



 9   again.  And throughout our correspondence with them, we note



10   that Dr. Maurice (sic) had direction and control of these



11   tests, and he states that in his affidavit that we provided to



12   the Court.



13            THE COURT:  And he says in there that he did limit the



14   access of people from the defense here to the pad, or whatever



15   it's called, to the scene, beforehand, and also afterwards.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  He did, your Honor.  What he



17   prohibited them from doing was entering the bunker during the



18   test.  And the bunker is a small --



19            THE COURT:  No.  I'm taking about the test site



20   itself --



21            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.



22            THE COURT:  -- where the explosive device was.



23            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  And they were limited to the



24   corner of the test pad to observe.  They weren't allowed to



25   walk around.  He stated in his affidavit that's because he was







                                                       530







 1   afraid of either a hazard coming to them or them --



 2            THE COURT:  Well, whatever the reason is, I think we



 3   were talking about offering testimony about what these



 4   restrictions were and all that and --



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  There's no dispute, your Honor, that



 6   the FBI participants -- and, obviously, we distinguish between



 7   participants and observer -- the FBI participants were



 8   permitted to walk around because they were helping Dr. Marshall



 9   conduct the experiment versus the observers who were not



10   allowed free access to the pad.  We have no dispute with that.



11            THE COURT:  All right.



12            MS. WILKINSON:  As to the bunker, your Honor, I



13   believe in the defendants' papers, they represented that in the



14   bunker, there was a videotape, there were measuring devices and



15   a viewing area.  It's my understanding that is not correct, and



16   we all -- I went to the scene myself when they objected to the



17   conditions and tried to convince Dr. Marshall to change his



18   mind.  And that's -- perhaps indicative of either my lack of



19   persuasive ability or to show, indeed, that he was in charge of



20   the test, he didn't change his mind, and he refused to allow



21   them access to the bunker during the test.  However, he did



22   allow us to go into the bunker after the tests were completed



23   where we could see that there were measuring devices and a TV,



24   video area where they were watching the blast.  But there was



25   no viewing area.  There was no window, and I think common sense







                                                       531







 1   tells you why there wouldn't be a window.  You could be harmed



 2   by the 5,000-pound blast.



 3            THE COURT:  Well, who has control now of the test data



 4   and the physical -- the witness material that he said --



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  The British Government under --



 6   through Dr. Marshall and the forensic lab.  He has all of the



 7   data.  He is conducting the analysis and he is providing the



 8   reports, and I believe Mr. Nigh can tell you the information we



 9   presented to him, the photographs -- we've presented nine



10   albums of photographs and videotapes.  And the reports all are



11   printed on his -- with his letterhead and --



12            THE COURT:  And is there -- whatever agreement there



13   was between governments, does it provide that the United States



14   Government -- you and the Department of Justice in



15   particular -- will have access to that?



16            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  And what Dr. Marshall does is



17   send those reports when they are completed to the FBI and to



18   me, and I've disclosed them as I receive them to the defense.



19   We are not receiving anything, as far as I'm aware of,



20   different than what we're producing to the defense.



21            THE COURT:  Under a timetable established by



22   Dr. Marshall?



23            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  And he has told me that that



24   report should be finished sometime by the end of November.



25            THE COURT:  Of this year.







                                                       532







 1            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.



 2            THE COURT:  And --



 3            MS. WILKINSON:  Which, by the way, your Honor, they do



 4   also have that videotape.  When we're talking about being in



 5   the bunker, the participants were watching the television set



 6   and it was being videotaped at the same time.  We provided that



 7   videotape to the defense.  So truly, they have seen everything



 8   the participants saw in the bunker, not on the test pad but



 9   as --



10            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think what's



11   established here is that the defense people were outside



12   observers.



13            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  But I believe that -- to go



14   back to Mr. Nigh's three points -- we've really established the



15   first point, which is that this was not a part of the agreement



16   because it wasn't under the direction and control of the United



17   States.  And that is a part of the agreement that we signed



18   with the defense.  So we don't even get to the second point



19   that Mr. Nigh makes, which is did they get to properly observe,



20   although our point is they observed and received all the data,



21   they weren't harmed.



22            THE COURT:  They observed in a different fashion --



23            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.



24            THE COURT:  -- from the Government people, and perhaps



25   that's what's important for purposes of the motion.  All I'm







                                                       533







 1   saying is I don't know if we need the detail of the witness --



 2   that could be provided by the witness.



 3            MR. NIGH:  I think that that's probably correct, your



 4   Honor.  I can state in argument why.



 5            THE COURT:  All right.



 6            MR. NIGH:  The observation was --



 7            THE COURT:  And if a further hearing be necessary,



 8   this is another one of those things where -- and it's one of



 9   the things we need to talk about today, is this whole area of



10   what kind of hearings we're going to need under 703.  And



11   that's why I was asking about how you intend to use this at



12   trial.



13            Okay.  Mr. Nigh, I don't think we need the witness.



14     DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE



15            MR. NIGH:  Thank you, your Honor.



16            There is a -- I would submit a whole lot more going on



17   here than just a test conducted by the British Government in



18   which the FBI subsequently agreed to participate.  Back in



19   August of 1995 when we were negotiating with the Government



20   concerning tests of improvised explosive devices, they knew



21   that these tests were going on, they knew who was directing



22   them and they knew it was Dr. Marshall.  We knew none of that,



23   your Honor.



24            And they knew our interest in obtaining an agreement



25   to observe the tests was so that we could see particularly and







                                                       534







 1   specifically how the tests were conducted and how they might



 2   relate to evidence that gets presented in this case, whether



 3   directly, tangentially or precisely how it was done and so that



 4   our experts could begin at the same time to see the data, to



 5   see how it was done, to watch carefully the protocols being



 6   utilized.  And that's what we were negotiating for and



 7   that's -- and the Government knew it.



 8            They elected not to participate in 1995 because these



 9   negotiations were going on at the time and they feared that the



10   agreement at that time and their participation into it would



11   allow our experts to observe the 1995 tests.  That was their



12   decision.



13            Now, in 1996, clearly, the Government contemplated --



14   and let me go back to that for a minute, your Honor.  If they



15   didn't think that these tests were going to be covered by the



16   agreement, they were playing games with us about directing the



17   tests versus participating in the tests as to the FBI.  And I



18   submit that that's an after-the-fact rationalization to keep



19   these tests from falling within the agreement.



20            But when this came up again in June of 1996, or at



21   least so far as we knew it in June of 1996, they sent us a



22   letter indicating that pursuant to the agreement that we have



23   reached back in August of 1995, we are inviting you to observe



24   these tests.  Clearly, at the time they wrote that letter, your



25   Honor, they contemplated that these tests fell within the scope







                                                       535







 1   of the agreement whether they were being directed by



 2   Dr. Marshall or being directed by the Department of Justice or



 3   being directed jointly.  They were not using the directing



 4   clause to eliminate these tests from the provisions of the



 5   agreement.  And that's what the letter says, and it's an



 6   exhibit to the brief.  And that was how we got the invitation.



 7            The Government at the time -- or the FBI at the time



 8   that it decided to participate in these tests and observe them



 9   in 1996 knew full well about the agreement that they had



10   reached with us back in August of 1995.  And if there were



11   going to be restrictions imposed by Dr. Marshall or anyone else



12   which violated the terms of that agreement, then the Government



13   has to live with the result as a result of the agreement.  And



14   that's exclusion of the evidence that's based upon the tests.



15   If they could not get Dr. Marshall to change his mind, as they



16   say, that was the risk that they undertook in light of the



17   agreement when they decided to participate in 1996.



18            And the other thing that's very important about the



19   1996 tests, your Honor, is the amounts that were involved.  And



20   the tests of the amounts that were involved came extremely



21   close to the amounts alleged by the Government to be involved



22   in the explosion at the Murrah Building in April of 1995.  And



23   that, I submit, your Honor, is not mere coincidence and it is



24   not something that was exclusively within the province of the



25   British Government.







                                                       536







 1            What we bargained for and what the Government knew



 2   that we bargained for was the opportunity to observe the tests



 3   at the same time that the Government was observing them.  We



 4   didn't bargain to receive photographs of the tests afterwards.



 5   We did not bargain to see videotapes of the tests afterwards.



 6   We did not bargain to get the data afterwards or the reports at



 7   some distant time in the future, all of which I would submit we



 8   are entitled to get under Rule 16 anyway.  What we bargained



 9   for was the right to have our experts present at the time that



10   they were conducted and have a meaningful opportunity to



11   observe, not an opportunity to observe from what literally,



12   your Honor, was a rock pile a mile and three-quarters away from



13   the test site, which you could not see anything that may -- the



14   best way for me to tell you, your Honor, is to say that we



15   wasted our time entirely.  And we did not bargain for a



16   meaningless right, and the Government knew it, contrary to the



17   Government's assertion that --



18            THE COURT:  Well, you know, what I've heard here is



19   that the Government doesn't intend to use it as evidence.  Now,



20   with respect to using it under 703 as corroborative of the



21   opinions that may be expressed, we have a different issue.  Of



22   course, the rule doesn't require admissible evidence, doesn't



23   require that whatever the expert relies on be admissible



24   evidence.  But much depends, I think, upon exactly the manner



25   in which it is used by the experts.  If the experts who testify







                                                       537







 1   are going to use it in terms of their personal objection at the



 2   time, that's a different issue from using it as the written



 3   report.  The conclusions and opinions in the written report may



 4   be because, you know, that's the kind of thing that experts



 5   often rely on, even if they are not published reports with peer



 6   review and all those other things that have been mentioned once



 7   here.



 8            So I think given that the Government has no intention



 9   of using this material directly as physical evidence or data,



10   we have a different question.  And I don't know that that was



11   reached in your letter agreement.  The letter agreement refers



12   to that it wouldn't be used as evidence.  So -- you know, I



13   don't want to get into whether that's an artful dodge, but it's



14   not expressly in the agreement.  Is that true?



15            MR. NIGH:  I think that it is in the agreement, your



16   Honor, because I think the agreement indicates that the basis



17   of opinion is included within the scope of the agreement.



18   The -- an expert offered by the Government will not base their



19   opinion upon tests conducted in violation of the agreement.



20            THE COURT:  I don't remember the exact language, I



21   confess.



22            MR. NIGH:  It is Exhibit B to the brief, your Honor.



23   And it's at paragraph 3, "The parties will not seek to



24   introduce as part of their cases in chief results of, testimony



25   regarding, or opinions based upon any ammonium nitrate







                                                       538







 1   explosives tests."  And I -- I think that that's far broader



 2   than mere physical evidence or observation testimony.



 3            THE COURT:  All right.  So we get to the legal



 4   position it is by agreement the rights in paragraph 1 were the



 5   rights to an opportunity for counsel and an expert to observe



 6   the tests, which you're saying is denied.  And in paragraph 3,



 7   "will not seek to introduce as part of their cases in chief



 8   results of, testimony regarding or opinions based upon."  Okay.



 9   I understand your position.



10            MR. NIGH:  That's -- that's the thrust of it, your



11   Honor.  And the -- one factual matter that I need to correct --



12   and this, I would call a witness to correct if I needed to --



13   there was a viewing area -- we got about a one-minute look at



14   the explosives observation bunker that was 1,000 feet from



15   ground zero.  There was an observation port.  It goes through a



16   telescope.  I mean, you're not looking directly at the place.



17   You're looking at it through a telescope -- like a telescope.



18   And that -- the Government's experts were.  Our experts were



19   not.  That's the one factual correction that I would make.



20            I think that that frames the issue.  I think that



21   having made this agreement, the Government has to live by it.



22   And I submit that what is precisely going on is an attempt to



23   dodge it.



24            THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, we do have the motion by



25   co-defendant, too.  Mr. Woods.







                                                       539







 1     DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE



 2            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  We join that motion.  I



 3   would point out to the Court that the Government's explosive



 4   experts, James Thurman, Steve Burmeister and Dave Williams,



 5   that will be testifying in this trial were the ones that were



 6   present there on the site, walking around, observing, setting



 7   up, doing everything present at the site.  This ruse that this



 8   explosion was controlled by a British citizen is somewhat



 9   questionable.  The British affidavit is that he chose New



10   Mexico because of its isolation.  The commonwealth of the



11   British Empire with Australia and Canada offers many isolated



12   places for him to have explosive tests, yet he picks New



13   Mexico --



14            THE COURT:  I don't think those countries would



15   consider themselves within the British Empire anymore.



16            MR. WOODS:  Well, certainly in the commonwealth,



17   you're right.  Let me correct that.  The commonwealth.  But



18   when they come to the United States, the United States is not



19   going to give up control of -- of explosive devices and



20   explosive tests.  The FBI never participates in anything where



21   they don't have control.  And it was the observation of our



22   witness that they were in the middle of and participating on an



23   equal basis with anybody there on the ramp conducting this



24   test.



25            And we wanted to be able to be present before the test







                                                       540







 1   to see if they were having this explosion in plastic barrels or



 2   anything simulated to be consistent with the Government's



 3   theory in this case.  We were denied that access.  We were



 4   placed so far away that it took eight seconds for the sound to



 5   get to the observation after the blast.  That is not meaningful



 6   observation.  The Government's position is similar to saying



 7   that they don't know what Rosa Parks' complaint was.  She got



 8   to ride on the bus.  It just happened to be in the back of the



 9   bus.  Well, we weren't allowed meaningful observation and we



10   object to the testimony of Dave Williams, Steve Burmeister and



11   James Thurman when they testify about their opinions of blast



12   evidence.



13            THE COURT:  Well, that's a little broader than the



14   agreement.  The agreement as interpreted by Mr. Nigh is that



15   they cannot use this data or those results in forming their



16   opinions or testifying about them.



17            MR. WOODS:  Right.  And that's part --



18            THE COURT:  That's different from excluding their



19   testimony.



20            MR. WOODS:  I misspoke.  I want to confine my



21   objection to anything they observed at this testing procedure.



22            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Okay.  I think the issue is clearly



23   drawn.



24         PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE



25            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, just to set the record







                                                       541







 1   straight, although we've done this with counsel previously,



 2   Agent Thurman will not be a witness.  We've set forth that fact



 3   to defense counsel.  We put it in our expert witness filing.



 4   So it's only Agents Williams and Burmeister that we're talking



 5   about.  I believe that the facts belie the assertions by



 6   counsel that this is some kind of sham, and I go back to --



 7            THE COURT:  Well, I don't need to decide that it's a



 8   sham or that there was lack of faith or good faith or good



 9   efforts.



10            MS. WILKINSON:  No.  I meant about whether the British



11   were actually in control.



12            THE COURT:  No.  I don't think that makes any



13   difference, either.  The -- the issue here is was paragraph 1



14   violated and is paragraph 3 the --



15            MS. WILKINSON:  If we're going to the agreement, your



16   Honor, about whether the defendants were permitted to observe,



17   our position is that they were.  And if you turn to the Defense



18   Exhibit C, which is the letter from Mr. Hartzler, on page 2 of



19   that letter, the one, two -- fourth full paragraph, middle of



20   the paragraph, it says, "Dr. Marshall will brief all



21   participants on the range safety procedures, and only those



22   personnel who have previously been involved with the testing



23   will actually participate."



24            We in our minds, I believe, distinguished and



25   Dr. Marshall distinguished between observers and participants.







                                                       542







 1   We are not disputing that they observed from this limited



 2   portion of the test pad.  However, they were able to see the



 3   test.  And I think if we go back to common sense about what



 4   they were able to observe and what kind of prejudice they



 5   suffer, we'll see that there was none.



 6            They talk about being a mile and three-quarters away



 7   from the blast.  This was a 5,000-pound ammonium nitrate and



 8   fuel oil bomb.  There are only two safe places to be when a



 9   bomb like that goes off:  That is in a protective bunker or far



10   enough away so none of the debris or none of the blast pressure



11   can affect you.  So those observers -- and I was one of them



12   when I came with -- to meet with the defense counsel -- were at



13   a safe distance away.



14            The other thing is when you're observing a blast like



15   that where the velocity of detonation is somewhere between



16   11,000 and 15,000 feet per second, you're not going to see much



17   with the human eye.  It is over in a few milliseconds.  So



18   whether you're in the bunker or whether you're a mile and



19   three-quarters away, what you're going to see is a huge blast



20   of dirt and debris.  That's it.  And in fact, we provided the



21   videotape, as I've explained to counsel, so that the -- and the



22   videotape, they slow down the blast so that you can see if



23   there's any specific observable characteristics.  So in terms



24   of what could you see and how were they harmed, your Honor, I



25   don't see how the defense counsel were harmed in their







                                                       543







 1   observations.



 2            I believe their true contention is they didn't get to



 3   go up and look at all the data and collect it and participate



 4   where the FBI did, and that is true.  There's no doubt about



 5   that.  That is true.  However, we are providing all of that



 6   data to the defense.  I believe that Mr. Woods pointed out he



 7   was concerned about whether the devices would be contained in



 8   plastic barrels.  Again, in the letter from Mr. Hartzler, we



 9   set forth that this was following a regularly established



10   protocol.  And on page 2 again, we put that the device would be



11   in an open-top, mild steel container to check the instrument



12   and camera settings and we said how it would be detonated and



13   we gave them the components of the device.  So we made it clear



14   that this was not a replication of the Oklahoma City bombing.



15   And this is the same protocol as we said that was followed



16   previously.



17            So under the terms of the agreement, your Honor, the



18   defendants were allowed to observe the tests.  They were also



19   provided with the data, not only for the 1996 tests, but I



20   believe as part of our policy on discovery, we provided them



21   with the 1994 and the 1995 tests, which I don't think anyone



22   would argue they were actually entitled to under -- under



23   discovery, but we provided that so they would have all the data



24   that our experts have.



25            In terms of how the Government will use this evidence,







                                                       544







 1   your Honor, I believe there will be two ways.  One, when we go



 2   through the experts' qualifications, first at the 703 hearing



 3   and then at trial, I believe it would be beneficial and



 4   informative to the jury to learn that these experts have not



 5   only studied data, but they have been to actual testings and



 6   they have been to actual crime scenes.  The jury will want to



 7   hear why this person is an expert.  And all of what this expert



 8   does in terms of collecting information, participating in the



 9   investigation, goes towards that.



10            So in terms of saying how many bombing crime scenes



11   have you been to, how many scientific tests have you



12   participated in, I would anticipate that they would at least



13   discuss that generally; not specifically the results, but that



14   they participated in scientific testing, beginning with the



15   1994 testing and the 1995 testing -- excuse me.  Not the 1995,



16   because they weren't there.  The 1994 testing.



17            Then also, I would anticipate, depending on the



18   cross-examination of the experts, which I'm sure counsel will



19   engage in, about their ability to give these opinions, they



20   will want to know what the bases are and what other data



21   supports their conclusions.  And that is where I think this



22   type of information is essential for the expert.



23            If for some reason, the Court prohibits the use of



24   this information, we would be in the awkward position of having



25   experts who weren't participating in the tests.  And we have







                                                       545







 1   those other explosive experts who would be entitled to study



 2   the data, talk to the people who were there under Rule 703 as



 3   the Court points out, review the photos and the videotapes and



 4   discuss the data.  Now that's perfectly adequate for an expert



 5   to do.



 6            We heard it yesterday about experts who talk and



 7   review other people's research and data and use that to bolster



 8   their conclusions.  So we'd set up a situation where the people



 9   who weren't there to observe were in a better position who can



10   testify about it than the people who were, which seems like a



11   rather --



12            THE COURT:  Well, actually, they could only do that if



13   it's published, I think, and peer reviewed, scientifically



14   published, not raw data.



15            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure about that, your Honor.



16            THE COURT:  Well, I don't care about it.  I'm going to



17   enforce this agreement.  I'm going to enforce the agreement and



18   grant the motion to suppress.  The -- it has been violated.



19   And I read paragraph 1 to mean equal opportunity to observe



20   with the Government's expert, and that hasn't happened.  And I



21   read paragraph 3 to mean that it can't be used which the -- the



22   way in which I read it is it didn't happen for purposes of this



23   case, the 1996 test.  So the motion is granted.



24            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, just to be clear, they can



25   rely on the 1994 and 1995 data?







                                                       546







 1            THE COURT:  Well, yes, those aren't at issue.  All I'm



 2   doing is enforcing this agreement as I read it.  And the



 3   agreement only dealt with the tests in 1996.  What happens from



 4   here on out is something that we'll learn later.  I mean,



 5   obviously, there may be agreements among counsel to use



 6   portions of this data.  I don't know.  But that has to be the



 7   subject of a new agreement.



 8            All right.  Now, I think that completes our scheduled



 9   list of hearings.  I did mention to you earlier this morning



10   that I wanted to come back to discovery and set a time here for



11   us to get together for another hearing on discovery issues that



12   remain after this next exchange.  But I -- I have reviewed one



13   item and I think it ought to be something that I rule on so



14   that that much can get done.



15            I think that the testimony of Michael and Lori Fortier



16   at grand jury should be given to -- copies to defense counsel



17   now in the entirety of the testimony.  I don't mean to suggest



18   that I'm accusing the Government of misinterpreting Brady.  But



19   given what I know from the context of other submissions here



20   about those people and what they have to say or did have to say



21   about what they did, I just don't think that you can piece out



22   what's exculpatory and might not be and what should be



23   provided.  So I think with a protective order, of course, as



24   would be true of all grand jury transcripts, the transcripts of



25   the testimony of those two witnesses before the grand jury







                                                       547







 1   should be provided.  So I'm ordering that.



 2            Now, I suppose the discovery --



 3            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor --



 4            THE COURT:  Yes, Ms. Wilkinson.



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  You did ask us, I believe, last night



 6   to think about some alternatives for how we could resolve this.



 7            THE COURT:  Yes.  But I was afraid to ask if you did.



 8            MS. WILKINSON:  Well, Mr. Jones and I didn't discuss



 9   it, but I -- we did think of some alternatives and some



10   examples.  I don't know if the Court would rather just --



11            THE COURT:  Well, I --



12            MS. WILKINSON:  -- go forward.



13            THE COURT:  Is it something that's going to help in



14   getting rid -- there are going to be things that we have to



15   hear.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  Of course.  What I suggest, your



17   Honor, is perhaps we follow the procedure we did yesterday.



18   Mr. Jones had agreed to take back the national security



19   requests and refine them.  I think I have some examples which I



20   could share but I doubt are necessary.  Mr. Jones maybe would



21   agree to go back to his exculpatory requests, refine them, and



22   then we would be responding directly to the Court on those.



23   Therefore, Mr. Jones would get what he wants, which is a direct



24   response, and we would get what we want, which is a more narrow



25   and focused request, because I believe he acknowledged







                                                       548







 1   yesterday, he's received a lot of information from us, and he



 2   may have some of it.



 3            MR. JONES:  I don't have any problem with that.  I



 4   think it's a good idea.



 5            THE COURT:  Sure.  And I think what we should do is



 6   set a date to hear the issues that are formulated by counsel



 7   after you've had an opportunity for some additional



 8   interchange.



 9            MR. JONES:  However, with respect to the Rule 16



10   motion, it seems to me that's pretty specific.  I don't know



11   that I can refine that, and that was one of the issues left



12   unresolved yesterday.  But we'll do whatever the Court tells



13   us, of course.  And I think the Court should probably set a



14   time by which we should refine the exculpatory motion.  We



15   probably want just a little bit longer than the other because



16   we'll be working on that first and then we'll take the



17   exculpatory second.



18            THE COURT:  Well, how about some date early in



19   November, mid-November?



20            MR. JONES:  That would be fine.



21            THE COURT:  And then --



22            MR. JONES:  November 15?



23            THE COURT:  Well, that's a Friday, which I don't know



24   if we'll get it done in one day.



25            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  You're talking about the







                                                       549







 1   hearing date.



 2            THE COURT:  I'm talking about the hearing date, yes.



 3            MR. JONES:  I thought you were talking about the date



 4   for --



 5            THE COURT:  No.  I want you to do it before then.



 6            MR. JONES:  Okay.  Sure.



 7            THE COURT:  What do we think here is a reasonable



 8   time?



 9            MR. JONES:  I would think at least two days, your



10   Honor.



11            THE COURT:  Yeah.  So what about November 13?  That's



12   a Wednesday.  That gives us Wednesday, Thursday and Friday



13   again if need be.



14            All right.  Mr. Tigar.



15            MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor, please, I am scheduled to



16   be out of the country on that date.  With Mr. Nichols' consent,



17   other counsel would represent Mr. Nichols at that hearing.  I



18   think it primarily concerns the dispute between Mr. McVeigh's



19   camp and the Government.



20            THE COURT:  Mr. Nichols, is that agreeable to you to



21   excuse Mr. Tigar from the hearing and rely on other counsel?



22            DEFENDANT NICHOLS:  Yes, sir, it is.



23            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.



24            November 13.



25            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe my suggestion,







                                                       550







 1   including that the defense tailor their request, which



 2   Mr. Jones has agreed to do, and then we respond, do you want to



 3   set dates for that, too?



 4            THE COURT:  Yes.  But I think it might be well for you



 5   to discuss those dates and come back to me with them.



 6            MR. JONES:  Just give us ten days from today.  That



 7   should be enough.



 8            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I'm trying to think of



 9   what I gave you yesterday.  We had --



10            MR. JONES:  You gave us until Wednesday.  I believe



11   Wednesday, 5 p.m.



12            THE COURT:  October 9 -- next Wednesday.



13            MR. JONES:  Yes.  And I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to



14   continue sitting.



15            THE COURT:  No.  That's fine.  Well, I just -- what I



16   want to make sure is that I have a few days to look at this



17   material and to calm down after I first look at it before



18   having a hearing on it.  So, you know, I'm agreeable to having



19   you submit whatever you're going to submit to me ten days



20   before the hearing.  But you need to go back and forth a bit on



21   that beforehand.



22            Now, you know, I don't want you to get in a



23   disagreement about dates.  So if you want to set them right



24   now, that's fine.  We've got the dates already established.



25            Now, to expand with respect to the Brady time, what do







                                                       551







 1   you suggest, Ms. Wilkinson?



 2            MS. WILKINSON:  I suggest we give Mr. Jones some more



 3   time.  I think it just will enable us to focus those requests



 4   even more because it's going to take him a while to review some



 5   of the information he had.  So perhaps October 15, he could



 6   have his response or is that -- that may not be enough days.



 7   How about October 20?



 8            MR. JONES:  That would be fine.  The 20th is a Sunday.



 9   How about the 21st?



10            MS. WILKINSON:  Okay.



11            THE COURT:  All right.  And then --



12            MS. WILKINSON:  Give us ten days, your Honor, only



13   because we need to review our files to see what we have



14   produced.



15            THE COURT:  November 1.



16            MS. WILKINSON:  That would be great.



17            THE COURT:  Okay.  The invitation is open for



18   Mr. Nichols' counsel, too, of course.



19            MR. WOODS:  We understand, your Honor.



20            THE COURT:  Yes.  I didn't mean to have the record at



21   all suggesting that you couldn't file.  We expect you to.



22            Now, what else occurs to -- Mr. Hartzler?



23            MR. HARTZLER:  You had indicated during our closed



24   meeting the other day that you wanted to make a public record



25   of your selection of an Oklahoma City courtroom for the







                                                       552







 1   closed-circuit --



 2            THE COURT:  Not mine.  It was in a letter --



 3            MR. JONES:  Before we leave the discovery, if it's all



 4   right with Ms. Wilkinson, I'll withdraw my request they respond



 5   to the Rule 16 motion, and I'll just include that in the



 6   October 21 filing.  And that way, they will all be on the same



 7   track instead of different tracks.



 8            THE COURT:  Is that agreed?



 9            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  That would be helpful.



10            THE COURT:  I'm trying to determine if I have Chief



11   Judge Russell's letter here in front of me.



12            MR. HARTZLER:  I think the file was purple, as I



13   recall, if that helps.



14            THE COURT:  Pardon me?



15            MR. HARTZLER:  I think the file was purple.



16            THE COURT:  I've got a strange color coding here that



17   I don't understand.  Well, the -- I addressed the request for



18   space in Oklahoma City for the purpose of complying with the



19   statute requiring closed-circuit television transmission of



20   trial proceedings there.  And regrettably, I don't have it



21   right here in front of me, but I'll file it of record -- the



22   response I received from Chief Judge Russell, the Western



23   District of Oklahoma, is that after consulting with the members



24   of that court, the room designated is -- I believe it was



25   called the old court of appeals courtroom or maybe just the







                                                       553







 1   court of appeals courtroom.



 2            MR. JONES:  On the 5th floor.



 3            THE COURT:  Yes, on the 5th floor of the United States



 4   Courthouse in Oklahoma City.  And in accordance with -- you



 5   know, obviously, since what happens here is -- has some effect



 6   on the operations of that court, I believe it appropriate that



 7   the judges of that court, speaking through the chief judge,



 8   designate the place.  And it's been designated, and that's the



 9   place we'll use.



10            And of course, we'll proceed, as I have already done,



11   to advise counsel of some preliminary arrangements with respect



12   to how that is to be done.  Counsel have an opportunity to --



13   to participate in making the final decisions there.



14            And of course, another matter that has yet to be heard



15   and resolved here is how to determine the eligibility of the



16   persons who will be admitted to that room for viewing by



17   television trial proceedings.



18            MR. HARTZLER:  Could we schedule that?



19            THE COURT:  Yes.  Maybe we can do that in this same



20   time of this three days that we just picked.



21            MR. HARTZLER:  Very well.



22            THE COURT:  Obviously, it's important to get that done



23   so that whatever arrangements have to be made and



24   reconfiguration and all that can get done.



25            MR. HARTZLER:  The first day of our hearing, Mr. Jones







                                                       554







 1   stood up and talked about the possible briefing for jury



 2   selection procedures.  I wonder if we could also schedule that.



 3            THE COURT:  We'll schedule that -- I will talk about



 4   that in an order after the ruling on severance.



 5            MR. HARTZLER:  Very well.



 6            THE COURT:  It makes a difference.



 7            MR. HARTZLER:  Okay.  I have two other very minor



 8   matters.



 9            THE COURT:  Sure.



10            MR. HARTZLER:  One of them is not minor to us, but --



11            THE COURT:  I don't know that there's anything minor



12   here.



13            MR. HARTZLER:  It won't take long.  I understood your



14   order that we turn over the grand jury transcripts to be based



15   on your conclusion from reading from the pleadings that there



16   was Brady material that we could not extract from those



17   transcripts but the transcripts en toto would constitute Brady



18   information, as I understood what you were saying.  And I would



19   invite the Court, if you would, to consider this:  To review



20   the transcripts before you finalize that order.  Obviously, we



21   are at an advantage here that we have the transcripts.  We did



22   review them.  We provided the portions that we view as Brady



23   and we --



24            THE COURT:  Well, I'll tell you what a part of that



25   basis for that ruling is:  This -- these are witnesses who







                                                       555







 1   entered into an agreement with the Government; correct?



 2            MR. HARTZLER:  Correct.  One of them was immunized.



 3            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, that's still an agreement.



 4   And the other entered into a plea agreement.



 5            MR. HARTZLER:  I mean, the one was ordered to testify



 6   pursuant to immunity.



 7            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, you know, the Government did



 8   something there that's under review with respect to witnesses



 9   generally before the grand jury.  And accordingly, in my view,



10   the entire testimony of those witnesses would have to be given



11   to counsel, because I just don't think I can determine what's



12   exculpatory or not, and I'm not sure you can, either.  I mean,



13   in good faith.  I'm not suggesting --



14            MR. HARTZLER:  I appreciate that.



15            THE COURT:  -- anything here other than good faith.



16   But I believe witnesses in that position, the grand jury --



17   these particular witnesses and what is represented in part that



18   they said, their whole testimony should be provided.  So I'm



19   not going to revisit that.



20            MR. HARTZLER:  The final item I had was a pleading



21   that I was handed this morning by Dr. Whitehurst's counsel, and



22   I don't know if it's been filed or not, but I saw there were



23   some attachments to it that I did not have an opportunity to



24   review since we've been here in court this morning and, of



25   course, the parties are all under the protective order.  I







                                                       556







 1   don't know whether outsiders are subject to the same --



 2            THE COURT:  I have been handed and not read a document



 3   bearing today's date that says Dr. Frederic Whitehurst's



 4   supplemental citation.  Is that it?



 5            MR. HARTZLER:  That's it.  Yes.



 6            THE COURT:  And there is -- there are two attachments,



 7   I guess.



 8            MR. HARTZLER:  I thought there were three letters.



 9            THE COURT:  Three.  Yeah.  You haven't read them.



10            MR. HARTZLER:  No, I haven't read them.  Of course,



11   I'm familiar with the first one because it's my letter to



12   Dr. Whitehurst and his counsel.



13            THE COURT:  Are you suggesting that a portion of this



14   should be sealed?  Is that the point?



15            MR. HARTZLER:  Right.  Yes.



16            MR. JONES:  May we be heard, your Honor?



17            THE COURT:  Yes.  Are you familiar with this --



18            MR. JONES:  I am.



19            THE COURT:  -- filing?  I'm not.



20            MR. JONES:  We oppose the sealing because of the three



21   exhibits -- two of them relate to a case long since concluded



22   and over with which resulted in a verdict of not guilty, and I



23   can't see how that could possibly impact here.  And the other



24   one is simply a letter from Mr. Hartzler with respect to



25   negotiations concerning the interview.  And while I know







                                                       557







 1   generally we don't put in letters certainly in civil cases



 2   negotiating matters, but it seems to me there is some outer



 3   limit of just sealing everything because a party asks for it



 4   under the Court's criteria.



 5            THE COURT:  Well, I don't believe that we've done



 6   that.



 7            MR. JONES:  No.



 8            THE COURT:  I'll read them right now.  That would be



 9   the easiest way to deal with this.  We'll just take time to



10   read it now.



11            Well, this first letter, I think we've seen before,



12   haven't we, Mr. Hartzler?  Already in the public file, I think.



13            MR. HARTZLER:  I don't think this one is.  I don't



14   believe so.



15            THE COURT:  The letter from you?



16            MR. HARTZLER:  I don't believe that's in the public



17   file.



18            MR. COLAPINTO:  Your Honor, I'm --



19            THE COURT:  Just let me read the letters, please.



20            MR. COLAPINTO:  I'm sorry, your Honor.



21            THE COURT:  All right.  Are you the author of this



22   pleading?



23            MR. COLAPINTO:  I'm one of the authors, your Honor.



24   I'm an attorney representing Dr. Whitehurst.  My name is David



25   Colapinto.  The two letters -- not the letter from Mr. Hartzler







                                                       558







 1   but the two letters which are Bureau documents, we contacted



 2   the FBI prior to filing this pleading, and we obtained approval



 3   from the FBI to use them.  These documents have already been



 4   through preclearance review by the Bureau, and yesterday, they



 5   gave permission for us to attach them.  And I offer that to



 6   assist you in making whatever ruling you need to make.



 7            THE COURT:  All right.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.



 8            Mr. Hartzler, have you now read them?



 9            MR. HARTZLER:  I've reviewed them.  Clearance by the



10   FBI, of course, doesn't --



11            THE COURT:  No.  I understand.



12            MR. HARTZLER:  -- doesn't decide the issue.



13            THE COURT:  That could be one impediment to their



14   being filed, however, and that was removed.



15            MR. HARTZLER:  But it still appears to me to be



16   perhaps not classic discovery material but the same kind of



17   discovery material or discovery information that we have not



18   been putting in the public record.  My letter certainly



19   discloses negotiations that we're having with this witness.



20   And while I appreciate that part of that is public, I don't



21   know that the negotiations have been made public.  I don't see



22   from the -- from reading the pleading, which is referred to as



23   supplemental citation to authorities, the necessity to attach



24   any of the -- any of the documents.  If indeed, the pleading is



25   simply a supplemental citation of authorities, which we would







                                                       559







 1   of course accept, then so be it; but of course, it's not.  It's



 2   an opportunity to try to get these items into the public



 3   record, and that's why I object.



 4            THE COURT:  Well, Mr. Colapinto, is there some reason



 5   that these should be public?  I -- there is an ongoing



 6   controversy here, as I understand it, independently of this



 7   lawsuit here, this criminal proceeding, between your client and



 8   his employer.



 9            MR. COLAPINTO:  We don't see any need to seal them,



10   your Honor.  In terms of -- they deal with a controversy



11   involving Dr. Whitehurst and the Bureau.  It relates to his



12   allegations of retaliation in response to his whistle-blowing



13   concerns.  They are a basis of an -- the Court needs to



14   understand some of that history in order to make a ruling if a



15   ruling becomes necessary.



16            THE COURT:  Well, what this really amounts to, though,



17   is what might be evidence; correct?



18            MR. COLAPINTO:  It could potentially be evidence, yes,



19   your Honor.



20            THE COURT:  Yeah.  And that concerns me because we're



21   attempting here to accommodate Press Enterprises II and we're



22   also attempting to avoid putting evidence relating to this



23   proceeding into the public eye at this time and to await trial



24   for that.  So I'm going to seal it over your objection,



25   Mr. Jones, which is recorded.







                                                       560







 1            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, there is the other --



 2            THE COURT:  When I say "sealed," I'm only talking



 3   about the attachments.



 4            MR. JONES:  The other day -- I think I've now been



 5   informed I can correctly inform the Court -- I made a



 6   representation that there was a Whitehurst matter in the



 7   criminal case that wasn't on the docket for you and I thought



 8   you were trying to take care of all Whitehurst matters, and



 9   there is.  It's 96-CR-68-M which is in the criminal case.  It's



10   the motion that we filed back about June 11, which the Court



11   has not ruled on, labeled Motion to Unseal Documents Relating



12   to Dr. Whitehurst and Request for Oral Argument.



13   Dr. Whitehurst then filed his own motion which apparently got



14   filed in Case No. 96-X-114.



15            THE COURT:  Well, I didn't in -- yes.  I didn't intend



16   to call that up ahead of the opportunity now that counsel for



17   Dr. Whitehurst is here and suggested previously that he on



18   behalf of his client discuss with counsel for the parties in



19   this criminal case what kind of hearing might be necessary in



20   connection with the laboratory, the forensics and in this other



21   matter that is collateral, dealing with requests for



22   interviews, the deposition and so forth.  So consistent with



23   that approach, I'm not going to hear it now.



24            That is the motion to unseal.



25            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.







                                                       561







 1            THE COURT:  Anything else you wish to call to my



 2   attention?  Mr. Hartzler?



 3            MR. HARTZLER:  Ms. Wilkinson has one item.  Your



 4   Honor, I beg your indulgence on this, but could we have a few



 5   days to evaluate our options with respect to your order that we



 6   turn over the grand jury transcripts?  I appreciate -- I hope



 7   you appreciate that it wasn't a matter that was briefed.



 8            THE COURT:  Yes.



 9            MR. HARTZLER:  I don't mean any disrespect.  I -- I



10   hope that it can be resolved, but we -- could you stay your



11   order so we have a few days to evaluate our options?



12            THE COURT:  All right.  Wednesday.



13            MR. HARTZLER:  Very well.  Thank you.



14            THE COURT:  Next Wednesday.



15            MR. HARTZLER:  Thank you.



16            THE COURT:  I'll stay it until then.



17            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, yesterday, you mentioned that



18   you would like to see the inventory and indices that we



19   produced to the defense.  I brought one box, and I don't know



20   whether you want to review those or you want to wait until we



21   try and resolve these issues --



22            THE COURT:  What is in the box?  Is that an inventory



23   of to date or --



24            MS. WILKINSON:  That's just the inventory we turned



25   over last month, but it includes an inventory to date of the







                                                       562







 1   1Bs, which are the physical items, and of the 302's and the --



 2   and the -- it's the appendix to the inserts --



 3            THE COURT:  You submit it and then I'll get some



 4   better appreciation for what the problem is, I think.



 5            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I just might suggest,



 6   since you mentioned yesterday troubles you might have



 7   interpreting the data, that if you have any questions, we're



 8   available to answer what the, like, 1B or the Q number --



 9            THE COURT:  Do you have, like, a glossary or a --



10            MS. WILKINSON:  We don't, really, your Honor.



11            THE COURT:  -- code?



12            MS. WILKINSON:  Even counsel are familiar now with the



13   1B and the Q number.



14            THE COURT:  I think that's in the papers.



15            MS. WILKINSON:  It is, it is.  We also wanted to hand



16   up the letters that you asked us to submit under seal and



17   ex parte.



18            THE COURT:  Yes.



19            MR. JONES:  May I inquire of Ms. Wilkinson to this



20   box?



21            THE COURT:  You may.



22            MR. JONES:  This box contains a copy of all of the



23   indices with respect to 1B and Q and A and Z and so forth?



24            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, perhaps it would be best



25   if I just read them off so we would have it in the record of







                                                       563







 1   what I'm submitting to you so Mr. Jones would know, because I



 2   don't want there to be any disagreement.



 3            MR. JONES:  I don't want to take up the Court's time.



 4   Why don't you just type it up and send it to the Court.



 5            THE COURT:  Why don't you do that and send copies to



 6   counsel, just a statement of what's being filed.  And of



 7   course, it'll be received as sealed.



 8            MS. WILKINSON:  That will be fine.



 9            MR. JONES:  May we inspect the box, too, your Honor?



10            THE COURT:  Sure.



11            MS. WILKINSON:  There's two copies there, your Honor,



12   because I anticipated we would review the materials together.



13   So obviously, I'll only submit one copy.



14            THE COURT:  Okay.



15            MR. HARTZLER:  Nothing further.



16            THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar, do you have anything further?



17            MR. TIGAR:  No, your Honor.



18            THE COURT:  Mr. Nigh, do you have anything further?



19            MR. NIGH:  I do not, your Honor.  Mr. Jones may have.



20            MR. JONES:  No, your Honor.



21            THE COURT:  All right.  Then we'll recess this hearing



22   and resume again on whatever date I said.



23            MR. HARTZLER:  We expect to submit the stipulation



24   this afternoon.



25            THE COURT:  All right.  Court's in recess.

<P>Chief Judge Richard Matsch, presiding over the Oklahoma City
bombing trial,

cleared the way for the United States to seek the death penalty
against defendants

Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. The court denied defense motions
requesting that

prosecutors be enjoined from asking for the death penalty because the
Department of

Justice did not follow proper protocol for deciding to seek death, and
because of other

procedurual problems. This is the September 25, 1996 ruling.</P>

Notice Re: Supplemental Brief in Support of Motion to Strike Notice of
Intention to Seek

the Death Penalty as to Defendant Timothy James McVeigh (Nichols)



On October 20,1995, the government filed a Notice of Intention to Seek
the Death

Penalty as to defendant Timothy James McVeigh, and an identical notice
as to defendant

Terry Lynn Nichols. These notices, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(a),
invoke the provisions

of the Federal Death Penalty Act, ("Act") 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3591 -3596.



Before the notices were filed, defendant Timothy McVeigh moved to
disqualify the

Attorney General and all other officers and employees of the
Department of Justice from

any participation in the process of deciding whether to seek the death
penalty in this case.

That motion, filed July 25,1995, was fully briefed but not decided
before the

reassignment of this case and the change of venue. The defendant Terry
Nichols joined in

the motion. The particular relief sought in the motion to disqualify
is now moot because

the notices have been filed. The contentions made must be considered,
however, because

they also affect the validity of these notices as challenged by the
defendants' motions to

strike.



Mr. Nichols filed a separate civil action in the Western District of
Oklahoma, Terry Lynn

Nichols v. Janet Reno, Civil Action No. 96-M-606, (formerly
CIV-95-1824W), which

was transferred to this court. The complaint in that case, brought
under the

Administrative Procedures Act, made some of the same contentions
contained in Mr.

McVeigh's motion to disqualify. This court granted the defendants'
motion to dismiss the

civil action in a memorandum opinion and order entered on May 29,
1996. Nichols v.

Reno, 931 F. Supp. 748 (D. Colo.1996). Although the dismissal resulted
from the

conclusion that the complaint did not state a claim for relief within
the court's

jurisdiction, the reasoning is applicable here on the merits of Mr.
McVeigh's motion to

disqualify.



The premise of the motion is that the Attorney General made the
decision to seek the

death penalty before any suspect was even identified. On April
19,1995, shortly after the

explosion in Oklahoma City giving rise to the charges in this case,
General Reno publicly

announced that the death penalty would be sought in any prosecution
for bombing the

Murrah Building. The President repeated that public pledge two days
later, shortly after

Timothy McVeigh was identified as a suspect. Later on that day, April
21, when Mr.

McVeigh appeared before Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Howland in Oklahoma
City, an

Assistant United States Attorney advised the court that the maximum
penalty on the

charge of violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(f) was death.



In the memorandum opinion and order deciding the civil case, the court
reviewed the

"Death Penalty Protocol" published in the United States Attorneys'
Manual, prescribing a

procedure for prosecutors to follow to obtain authority to seek the
death penalty in any

criminal case. Patrick Ryan, United States Attorney for the Western
District of

Oklahoma, wrote a letter to Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones,
inviting his

participation in the Protocol process. Mr. Jones refused any
participation, claiming that it

would be futile because these public statements showed that the
decision had already

been made. Despite the refusal, the Department of Justice procedure
was followed and the

formal notices of intention to seek the death penalty were approved
according to the

Protocol. Counsel for Terry Nichols did submit statements pursuant to
the Protocol, as

described in the civil case opinion. Counsel for both defendants have
asked for discovery

of the Department of Justice internal documents relevant to the
notices to support their

motions. That request is denied. Such documents are not pertinent to
the McVeigh motion

to disqualify or to the defendants' motions to strike the death
penalty notices because the

administrative decision to file them is not judicially reviewable.



As this court ruled in the civil action, the decision to seek the
death penalty under the Act

is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. The Protocol did not create
any individual right or

entitlement subject to the due process protections applicable to an
adjudicative or quasi-

adjudicative governmental action. The Act expressly provides that the
attorney for the

government shall file and serve the death penalty notice if he
believes that the

"circumstances of the offense" are such that a sentence of death is
justified. Sec. 3593(a).

There is no requirement that the prosecutor consider any other
matters, including any

mitigating factors concerning the offense or the character and
circumstances of a

particular defendant. The decision of a jury whether to recommend a
sentence of death is

made only after a full hearing and consideration of aggravating and
mitigating factors

provided by information submitted pursuant to the adversary process.
Sec. 3593(b)-(e).

The constitutional protections of the life and liberty of a defendant
are provided by the

sentencing hearing following trial of the charges in the indictment.
The issuance of these

notices is essentially a prosecutor's charging decision. The McVeigh
motion to disqualify

the Attorney General and Department of Justice officials is denied on
the merits.



In their motions to strike the death penalty notices the defendants
assert that the notices

filed on October 20, 1995, violate the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.
The defendants

claim that the prosecution has exposed them to the possibility of
capital punishment as a

result of arbitrary and irrational decisions. Nothing has been
submitted to show or suggest

that the notices were filed because of any discriminatory motive,
invidious classification

or improper motivation as to either defendant. Those are the only
grounds warranting

judicial interdiction of such action by an officer of the executive
branch of government.

Accordingly, there is no merit to this contention.



Additionally, the defendants suggest that Fed. R. Crim. P. 7 is
applicable to these notices

and that they fail to include adequate statements of the essential
facts relied on as

required by subsection (c) of the rule. Assuming that the rule fairly
states the requirement

of adequate notice for procedural due process and is, therefore,
applicable to the notices,

there is no violation when the notices are read in conjunction with
the allegations of the

indictment. The indictment contains such detailed statements of what
the prosecution

intends to prove that these defendants previously challenged its
language as being

inflammatory and containing prejudicial surplusage. Taken together,
the indictment and

notices give the defendants adequate information as to what the
government will rely on

at trial and sentencing. Additional notice has been given in the
extensive discovery

provided by the prosecutors.



The defense motions claim that the Act is facially unconstitutional in
several aspects. The

broadest argument is that under all circumstances the death penalty is
cruel and unusual

punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. That argument is
foreclosed by the

decisions of the Supreme Court. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279,
300-303 (1987).



The defendants claim that the government's notice violates the Fifth
Amendment grand

jury requirement. This position was rejected in the Memorandum Opinion
and Order filed

on September 9, 1996. United States v. McVeigh and Nichols, 1996 WL
523063, at *8-

10 (D. Colo.1996).



The defendants argue that the Act does not permit meaningful appellate
review because

Congress provided in Sec. 3595 that a sentence of death will be
reviewed upon appeal

only if the defendant files a notice of appeal within the time
specified for filing any other

notice of appeal. There is no automatic appellate review as in some of
the state statutes

which have been validated by the Supreme Court since Furman v.
Georgia, 408 U.S. 238

(1972). The defendants say that conditioning sentence review upon a
request by the

defendant is an invalid limitation, suggesting that a defendant may be
unable to decide to

appeal because of depression or other mental or emotional infirmity
after the sentencing.

That contention is highly speculative. While the decision to appeal a
conviction and

sentence must be made by a defendant, the court has the duty to
provide the assistance of

counsel who must also be given the authority and means to employ such
consultants and

advisors, including psychiatrists, upon an appropriate ex parse
showing of need under 21

U.S.C. Sec. 848(q). Conjecture about a particular defendant's ability
to make an informed

and rational decision to appeal a sentence is not a basis for
invalidating the Act. Adequate

resources are ensured to protect against the possibility of the loss
of an appeal resulting

from such circumstances. Moreover, Sec. 3595 of the Act provides for
consolidation of

the appeal of the sentence with an appeal of the judgment of
conviction and directs that

the case be given priority over all other cases in the appellate
court. The full record of

pretrial, trial and sentencing proceedings may be presented to the
court of appeals.



The defendants also assert that the Act improperly imposes a
legislative limitation on the

scope of review of a death sentence in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3595(c). That
subsection directs the

court of appeals to address all substantive and procedural issues
raised on the sentence

appeal and to consider whether the death sentence "was imposed under
the influence of

passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor and whether the
evidence supports the

special finding of the existence of an aggravating factor required to
be considered under

Sec. 3592." It further provides that upon such a determination or upon
a conclusion that

the proceedings involved any other legal error requiring reversal that
was adequately

preserved for appeal under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
the case shall be

remanded for reconsideration under Sec. 3593 or imposition of a
sentence other than

death. Section 3595(c)(2)(C) adds the following direction:



The court of appeals shall not reverse or vacate a sentence of death
on account of any

error which can be harmless, including any erroneous special finding
of an aggravating

factor, where the Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt
that the error was

harmless.



It is presumed that such a showing by the government would be based on
the record for

review under Sec. 3595(b).



The defendants claim that because of these restrictions, those who are
sentenced to death

under this Act are denied equal protection of the law as compared with
persons sentenced

under other statutes.



The general jurisdiction of the court of appeals is granted in 28
U.S.C. Sec. 1291,

providing for appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.
Review of sentences

other than for the death penalty is under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(a),
providing that a

defendant may file a notice of appeal for review of a sentence imposed
in violation of

law, resulting from an incorrect application of the sentencing
guidelines, a sentence

greater than provided under the applicable guideline range, or, when
imposed for an

offense for which there is no sentencing guideline, "is plainly
unreasonable." Thus, the

review provided for a death sentence is actually broader in scope than
that for any other

sentence.



The harmless error restriction on reversal of any decision is well
established. United

States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d 861, 899-901 (4th Cir. 1996). As already
noted, a consolidated

appeal of conviction and sentence is contemplated by the statute so
the court of appeals

will have before it any issues which are asserted as error in the
trial resulting in the

conviction. Additionally, this court is unwilling to speculate as to
the approach that the

Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals may take with respect to the possible
application of the

"plain error" doctrine and the scope of appellate review under the
Constitution, in spite of

any purported limitations in the statute. Reading this statute as an
interference with the

authority of the court of appeals to correct a fundamental error in a
particular type of case

would construe it in contradiction of the constitutional doctrine of
separation of powers.

Cf. United States v. Bradley, 880 F. Supp. 271, 283 (M.D.Pa.1994)
(construing the Act to

avoid constitutional infirmity by reading its provision for appellate
review of "arbitrary

finding[s]" to allow reversal of a sentence if reversible errors
occurred at trial).



Defense counsel argue that the death penalty notices are invalid
because they include

aggravating factors not listed in the statute. The defendants note an
inconsistency in the

Act in that Sec. 3592(c) lists specific aggravating factors which may
be included in the

government's notice for homicide crimes under Sec. 3591(a)(2) and then
provides that the

jury may consider "whether any other aggravating factor for which
notice has been given

exists." Yet, in Sec. 3591, Congress provided for a sentence of death
if "after

consideration of the factors set forth in Sec. 3592..." it is
determined that imposition of a

sentence of death is justified. Thus, Sec. 3591 appears to limit the
jury to consideration of

such of the 15 specific statutory aggravating factors in Sec. 3592(c)
as may be listed in

the government's notice. Additionally, under Sec. 3593(e), to
recommend death, all jurors

must determine that at least one aggravating factor required to be
considered under Sec.

3592(c) has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and then consider
whether all the

aggravating factors so proved suffficiently outweigh all the
mitigating factors found to

exist by a preponderance of the evidence to justify a sentence of
death. There is no

specific mention of non-statutory aggravating factors in that section.
Noteworthy,

however, in Sec. 3593(a), the factors for which notice is provided
"may include the effect

of the offense on the victim and the victim's family," a factor not
among those specified

in Sec. 3592(c).



Other courts have read the other death penalty statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec.
848(e), to permit

inclusion of non-statutory aggravating factors. United States v.
McCullah, 76 F.3d

1087,1106-07 (10th Cir. 1996). In a recent case, the District Court of
Kansas reached the

same result under this Act. United States v. Nguyen, 928 F. Supp.1525,
1536-37 (D.

Kan.1996). The reasoning of these cases is persuasive on this issue.



The defendants assert that if the Act is interpreted to permit
non-statutory aggravating

factors, it is unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative
authority to officers of the

executive branch without any guiding policy limiting what the
prosecutors may choose to

include in their notice. There is some merit to the argument as an
abstraction. Both sides

cite Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), in support of
their respective

positions concerning this delegation argument. As noted in an earlier
opinion, United

States v. McVeigh and Nichols, 1996 WL 523063, at *7 (D. Colo. 1996),
the court should

not address abstract constitutional questions. There is no merit to
the defendants'

arguments in the context of a sentencing hearing under Sec. 3593.



While it is true that Congress did not impose policy limitations or
give clear guidance to

prosecuting attorneys as to what may be included as non-statutory
aggravating factors,

the sentencing hearing is governed by the court within the adversary
process.

Accordingly, the validity of particular non-statutory aggravating
factors may be litigated

and adjudicated before the court, just as is being done in the present
motions. It is then

the judicial authority of the court within the factual context of
particular cases that

controls the scope of the sentencing hearing. The guiding principles
for judicial

determination of the validity of particular non-statutory aggravators
is the death penalty

jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court. Thus, the aggravating
factors must serve

the purpose of selection of the defendant for the special penalty with
individual

consideration to his character and particular conduct in the offense.
See McCullah, 76

F.3d at 1106 (noting that non-statutory aggravating factors are guided
by the principle of

individualized sentencing).



Mr. McVeigh also asserts that the addition of non-statutory
aggravating factors is barred

by the Ex Post Facto clause in Art. 1, Sec. 9, of the Constitution.
The answer to that

argument is that the enactment of this statute was a change in
sentencing procedure, not a

change in the definition of a crime or an increase in the punishment.
Dobbert v. Florida,

432 U.S. 282, 293-94 (1977); Hatch v. Oklahoma, 58 F.3d 1447, 1463-65
(10th Cir.

1995).



The Act does not require an appellate review of the proportionality of
a death sentence

compared with others convicted of the same crime. Recognizing that the
Supreme Court

held that a proportionality review is not required by the Eighth
Amendment in Pulley v.

Hams, 465 U.S. 37, 43-44 (1984), the defendants attempt to distinguish
that ruling on the

ground that the California statute involved in that case did not
permit the use of non-

statutory aggravating factors. Thus, a proportionality review is urged
to be an

indispensable requirement to check against the arbitrary imposition of
the death penalty if

non-statutory aggravating factors are included. This attempted
distinction is not

persuasive. As discussed later in this opinion, the function of
aggravating factors, whether

or not statutorily required, is to provide assurance that the jury
arrives at a rational

decision, after following an assessment process adequately designed to
measure the

variables involved in the crime and the circumstances of the
perpetrator, to select him as

deserving the maximum punishment.



Another general challenge to the constitutionality of the Act made by
the defendants is

directed to Sec. 3593(c) providing for proof of mitigating and
aggravating factors by

"information" regardless of admissibility under the Federal Rules of
Evidence, "except

that information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed
by the danger of

creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the
jury." Thus, the only

explicit standard for exclusion is an adaptation from Fed. R. Evid.
403. The court's

discretion is broader in the penalty hearing, however, because under
Rule 403 the court

may exclude relevant evidence only if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by

such dangers whereas the statute has no such quantitative limitation.
Read literally, the

substitution of information for evidence in Sec. 3593(c) raises the
specter of violations of

the Confrontation Clause and other fundamental protections contained
in the Fifth and

Sixth Amendments. What saves the statute is the fact that the hearing
is governed by the

trial judge who has considerable discretion in controlling the
presentation of the

"information" to the jury in both content and form. Congress has no
authority to prevent

the court from protecting the life and liberty of a defendant by the
exercise of its Article

III authority to conduct all hearings before it.



The defendants have made the general objection to most of the
statutory and non-

statutory aggravating factors in the notices that they are vague and
overbroad. Analysis of

the merits of this challenge requires some reflection on the purpose
and function of

aggravating factors in the sentencing scheme established by the Act.
That, in turn,

requires some restatement of the Court-dictated imperatives for a
constitutionally valid

sentence to death.



The Court was unable to form a plurality to support a single opinion
stating why the

imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in Georgia and Texas
before 1972

constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth
and Fourteenth

Amendments in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). Four separate
opinions were

filed in support of the judgment in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.153
(1976), that a sentence

to death for murder under a new sentencing scheme adopted by the
Georgia legislature

was not an unconstitutional punishment. Individual justices have
continued to struggle

with attempts to articulate their views about the imperatives of a
valid procedure in the

many subsequent decisions approving and disapproving variations in
state laws

governing the extreme punishment of death. They have been more clear
in stating what is

prohibited than what is required. Thus, the penalty of death may not
be ordered

automatically, arbitrarily, irregularly, randomly, capriciously,
wantonly, freakishly,

disproportionately or under any procedure that permits discrimination
by race, religion,

wealth, social position or economic class.



To be valid, the procedure must protect against a decision motivated
by passion and

prejudice. It must guide the jurors to individualized consideration of
each defendant. The

aggravating factors considered must be objectively provable and
rationally related to the

criminal conduct in the offenses proven at trial. There can be no
limitation on the ability

of individual jurors to consider mitigating factors. The jurors must
be unanimous if their

finding is that death is justified, and the jury must articulate the
reasons in a manner

enabling meaningful appellate review. What must be clear in the end is
that the jury has

performed its task of acting as the conscience of the community in
making a moral

judgment about the worth of a specific life balanced against the
societal value of a

deserved punishment for a particular crime. See Arave v. Creech, 507
U.S. 463, 470-71

(1993); McClesky v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 302-03 (1986); Godfrey v.
Georgia, 446 U.S.

420, 428 (1980).



Congress has attempted to meet these requirements in two death penalty
statutes. The

first, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, now codified at 21 U.S.C. Sec.
848(e)- (g),

provides for the possibility of the death penalty for killings
committed while the

perpetrators are engaged in certain drug crimes. The second is the
Death Penalty Act,

applicable to all other offenses for which death has been
legislatively prescribed as a

possible punishment. Secs. 3591-3596. Both statutes require a separate
penalty phase

hearing to consider aggravating factors identified in a pretrial
notice and such mitigating

factors as the defendant may introduce at the hearing.



If there are convictions in this case requiring a penalty phase
hearing, the jury will

proceed in a sequential manner, first determining whether the
government proved one of

the four intentions described in Sec. 3591 (a)(2)(A) through (D). If
the jurors are not

unanimous in finding that one of these intentions existed, their task
is complete and the

court will sentence according to the Sentencing Guidelines. If such an
intention is found,

the jury will then consider whether they are unanimously agreed that
at least one of the

statutory aggravating factors identified in the government's notice
has been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt. If such a factor is found, the jury may
then consider any other

aggravating factors submitted to them, if also proved beyond a
reasonable doubt, and

each juror will then weigh those factors so proven against such
mitigating factors as each

individual juror may find to exist by a preponderance of the
information presented at the

hearing. Sec. 3593(d) & (e). Unanimous specific findings must be made
as to aggravating

factors and the jury may not return a recommendation that a defendant
be sentenced to

death unless the jurors are unanimously agreed that such aggravating
factor or factors

sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factors found to exist to
justify a sentence of

death. Id.



In effect, a sentence of death may not be imposed for anything other
than an intentional

killing as defined in Sec. 3591(a)(2), and then only after careful
consideration of

aggravating and mitigating factors particularized as to each
defendant.



The aggravating factors function to focus the jury's attention on the
particular facts and

circumstances pertinent to each defendant found guilty of an offense
punishable by death

in the context of mitigating factors unique to him as an individual
human being. They

serve to assist the jury in distinguishing "those who deserve capital
punishment from

those who do not ...." Arave v. Creech, 507 U.S. 463, 474 (1993). The
notice filed by the

government gives the defendants the opportunity to prepare for the
hearing and provides

the court with some frame of reference for ruling on objections to the
information offered

at the hearing. It describes how the prosecution intends to "channel
the sentencer's

discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide specific
and detailed guidance

and make rationally reviewable the death sentencing process." Id. at
471, quoting from

Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 774 (1990).



The Supreme Court has held that aggravating factors must be in
sufficiently clear

language to be understandable by the jury. Tuilaepa v. California, 114
S.Ct. 2630, 2635-

36 (1994). In considering this issue at this time, it must be
recognized that the notices will

be given to a jury with additional instructions to assist in further
narrowing and defining

the terms used and the concepts communicated.



With these general principles in mind, the particular aggravating
factors identified in the

notices must be considered. The government has given notice of five
factors listed as

statutory factors under Sec. 3592(c)(1). Each must be examined.





1. That the deaths or injuries resulting in death occurred during the
commission of an

offense under 18 U.S.C. 33 (destruction of a motor vehicle or a motor
vehicle facility), 18

U.S.C. 844(d) (transportation of explosives in interstate commerce for
certain purposes),

18 U.S.C. 844(f) (destruction of government property by explosives),
18 U.S.C. 844(i)

(destruction of property affecting interstate commerce by explosives),
and 18 U.S.C.

2332a (use of a weapon of mass destruction). See Section 3592(c)(1)



Of the five crimes listed, three have not been charged in the
indictment. Two--Sec. 844(f)

and Sec. 2332a-- are charged in the indictment, although the reference
to Sec. 2332a is

indefinite in that there are subsections to that section and two of
those subsections are

charges in counts one and two of the indictment. The defendants
correctly observe that

Sec. 2332a is not one of the crimes listed in Sec. 3592(c)(1). As the
government notes, it

is obvious that the reference to Sec. 2339 in the statute with the
parenthetical identifier

"(use of weapons of mass destruction)" shows a typographical error.
The court accepts

that position.



The defendants object to this factor because the introduction of
multiple predicate

offenses to support it could confuse the jury and lead it to consider
each of the

enumerated predicate offenses as being separate aggravating factors,
thereby unfairly

weighting this factor and the calculus. There are appropriate
procedural answers to that

objection. First, the jury instructions can clearly advise that these
offenses are simply

multiple means for determining that this single aggravating factor, a
killing in the course

of another offense, is shown to exist. Second, the jury can be
required by a special

interrogatory to show unanimity in finding which of the underlying
offenses they rely on

if an affirmative finding is made with respect to this first
aggravating factor.



Additionally, the defendants object to this factor because two of the
offenses referred to

entirely duplicate counts of the indictment, while others duplicate
various elements of the

charged crimes. The government counters that the commission of these
enumerated

felony offenses narrows the class of death-eligible defendants and
fulfills the principle of

selectivity. The government correctly asserts that the Supreme Court's
opinion in

Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988), prevents this factor from
being stricken on

the ground that it fails to narrow the class of defendants that are
eligible for the death

penalty. The Tenth Circuit applied Lowenfield in United States v.
McCullah, 76 F.3d

1087 (10th Cir.1996), to uphold the use of an aggravating factor that
duplicated charges

in the indictment against a narrowing challenge. The court ruled that
because the federal

death penalty statute in that case, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 848(e), had already
narrowed the field of

death-eligible defendants, the aggravating factor was not invalid
because it failed to

further narrow that category. Id. at 1107-08. Similarly, the intent
requirement of the Act

operates in this case to narrow the category of death eligibility for
the charged crimes,

and thus, this first aggravating factor does not fall under this
challenge.



However, with respect to those offenses that entirely repeat a charge
in the indictment,

there is a problem of duplication that was not raised in either
Lowenfield or McCullah.

This problem must be viewed in the context of the weighing procedure
required by the

Act. In Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222 (1992), the Supreme Court
discussed the severe

effect that inappropriate aggravating factors have in a weighing
scheme:





[T]he difference between a weighing State and a non-weighing State is
not one of

"semantics" . . . but of critical importance. In a nonweighing State,
so long as the

sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact
that it also finds an

invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of
deciding whether death is

an appropriate penalty.... But when the sentencing body is told to
weigh an invalid factor

in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made
no difference if the

thumb had been removed from death's side of the scale.





503 U.S. at 231-32 (citation omitted).



Because the Court has held that the weighing process is highly
sensitive to the influence

of aggravating factors that might unfairly tip the scales in favor of
death, the government

may not introduce those offenses as aggravating factors that duplicate
the crimes charged

in the indictment. To allow the jury to weigh as an aggravating factor
a crime already

proved in a guilty verdict would unfairly skew the weighing process in
favor of death.

Accordingly, the offenses under Sec. 844(f) and Sec. 2332a are
stricken. As to any

charged offense for which a verdict of not guilty is returned, that
offense must then be

stricken from the notice because permitting the jury to find it as an
aggravating factor in a

penalty hearing would result in an inconsistent verdict. Those
offenses that merely have

overlapping elements with the crimes charged in the indictment may be
introduced

because the penalty jury will not have predetermined the defendant's
guilt with respect to

all elements of those crimes.



The defendants also challenge the inclusion of those offenses under
Sec. 3592(c)(1) that

are not charged in the indictment. This challenge presents the same
issue that is raised in

the defendants' objections to the third non-statutory aggravating
factor--the commission

of the crimes of burglary, robbery and theft to finance and facilitate
the underlying crimes

charged. The defendants' argument is that due process requires
consideration of these

other crimes only upon conviction of them. The court agrees and the
problem is solved by

instructing the jury that they must find each of the essential
elements of those uncharged

offenses as a part of their finding of the existence of this
aggravating factor beyond a

reasonable doubt. Adequate instructions will also answer the
defendants' objection that

this statutory factor violates the Fifth Amendment because it is too
vague.





2. That the defendant, in the commission of the offense(s), knowingly
created a grave risk

of death to one or more persons in addition to the victim(s) of the
offense(s). See Section

3592(c)(5).



The defendants in their vagueness objection to this factor point out
that no details are

alleged and that there is uncertainty with respect to whether an
intent to place others at

grave risk must be shown. Read in the context of the factual
allegations of the indictment,

there is no problem here. The government intends to prove that the
truck bomb was of

such force as to create a risk to persons who were not physically
affected by the

explosion. The issue is one of scope and a clarifying instruction may
validate this factor.





3. That the defendant committed the offense(s) after substantial
planning and

premeditation to cause the death of one or more persons and to commit
an act of

terrorism. See Section 3592(c)(9).



The defendants criticize the word "substantial" as having no definite
meaning. In this

court's view, substantial is one of those everyday words having a
common sense core

meaning that jurors will be able to understand. Tuilaepa, 114 S. Ct.
at 2636.





4. That various victims were particularly vulnerable due to old age,
youth, and infirmity.

See Section 3592(c)(11).



There is considerable uncertainty with respect to this factor. In the
government's response

to these motions, the prosecutors have not identified which of the
categories will be relied

on to support the allegation. Obviously, from the ages given for the
victims listed in

count one of the indictment, the children killed in this explosion
might be considered

vulnerable because of their youth. To rule out this aggravator for
vagueness at this time

would be a premature determination of its validity. The court must
await the evidence, at

least at the trial of the counts of the indictment, before determining
whether and to what

extent a penalty phase jury will be allowed to consider this factor.





5. That the defendant committed the offense(s) against one or more
federal public

servants who were law enforcement officers, (a) while such victim(s)
were engaged in the

performance of official duties, (b) because of such victim(s)'
performance of official

duties, and (c) because of such victim(s)' status as public servants.
See Section

3592(c)(14)(D).



Although the defendants again challenge this as vague and overbroad
with overlapping

categories, the court's principal concern here is with duplication of
the crimes charged in

the eight murder counts. As noted in the court's previous memorandum
opinion and order

relating to the facial validity of the indictment, United States v.
McVeigh and Nichols,

1996 WL 523063 (D. Colo. 1996), the government has made clear that for
conviction on

these counts it will rely on the fact that the victims named in them
were law enforcement

officers who were killed while engaged in the performance of official
duties. To that

extent, there is an unwarranted duplication. The notice, however,
includes the assertion

that these and perhaps other persons were killed because of the
performance of their

official duties and because of their status as public servants.
Because this factor differs

from the crime in the indictment, it is not duplicative. Whether there
will be adequate

"information" to support this contention will be a matter to be
addressed after a penalty

phase hearing.



The government has included four non-statutory aggravating factors in
the notices.





1. That the offense(s) committed by the defendant resulted in multiple
deaths of 169

persons.



The defendants object that this duplicates counts one and two in the
indictment. While

that is true with respect to the allegations that deaths resulted, the
government will not be

required to prove the specific number of persons whose deaths resulted
from criminal acts

to obtain convictions. Thus, this non-statutory factor does not
duplicate the proof at trial,

but simply permits the jury to consider the number of persons killed
and weigh that fact

in determining the penalty.





2. That, in committing the offense(s) charged in the indictment, the
defendant caused

serious physical and emotional injury, including maiming,
disfigurement, and permanent

disability, to numerous individuals.



This is objected to as duplication but the same analysis made in
approving the previous

aggravating factor is appropriate. It is not only that some persons
were maimed,

disfigured and injured. The number of such persons warrants
consideration by the jury in

the selection process.





3. That the defendant committed, caused, and aided and abetted acts of
burglary, robbery,

and theft to finance and otherwise facilitate the commission of the
capital offense(s)

charged in the indictment.



Again, the defendants assert that there must be convictions of such
crimes to warrant their

consideration. As previously noted, the court will require, by its
instructions, that the jury

find beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the essential elements of
these crimes have

been proved and that the motivation for them was to finance and
facilitate the crimes of

conviction.



4. Victim impact evidence concerning the effect of the defendant's
offense(s) on the

victims and the victims' families, as evidenced by oral testimony and
victim impact

statements that identify the victims of the offense(s) and the extent
and scope of injury

and loss suffered by the victims and the victims' families.



This is the most problematical of all of the aggravating factors and
may present the

greatest difficulty in determining the nature and scope of the
"information" to be

considered. Congress expressly provided for victim impact
consideration in the Death

Penalty Statute but it did not put any limits on what can be
considered. Sec. 3593(a). That

is a matter for the court's discretion and must be determined with
consideration for the

constitutional limitation that the jury must not be influenced by
passion or prejudice.

Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991). However, because victim
impact evidence

is relevant only to demonstrate the specific harm caused by a
particular crime, id., it

seems clear that the victims' testimony must reflect the harm caused
by the criminal

conduct, rather than the impact of the trial proceedings. This point
supports the court's

ruling that Rule 615 applies to exclude from the trial proceedings
those persons who may

testify as victims giving evidence to support this factor at the
penalty hearing.



Upon the foregoing, it is



ORDERED that with the exception of the deletions necessary to avoid
invalid duplication

in the aggravating factors, the defendants' motions are denied.

McVeigh and Terry Nichols' motions for separate trials. In this brief filed September 25, 
1996, portions which are blacked out per the court's order not to disclose evidence, the 
prosecution argues that a joint trial will cause less disruption for the victims' families and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTRODUCTION

STATEMENT

[TEXT REDACTED]

ARGUMENT

I.  THE SEVERANCE MOTIONS SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE DEFENDANTS 
HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY PREJUDICE OUTWEIGHING THE BENEFITS OF A 
JOINT TRIAL 

A. The Normal Preference For Joint Trials Is Especially Strong Given The Circumstances 
Of This Case 

1. McVeigh And Nichols Are Alleged Coconspirators And Aiders/Abettors Who Should 
Be Tried Together 

2. The Interests In Administrative Efficiency Promoted By Joint Trials Are Especially 
Compelling Here 

3. The Interests Of Victims And Witnesses Favoring A Joint Trial Have Never Been 
Stronger Than Here 

4. A Joint Trial Is The Fairest Means Of Achieving A Correct Resolution Of The 
Criminal Charges 

B. McVeigh And Nichols Have Not Identified Any Cognizable Prejudice, Much Less 
Any Prejudice That Outweighs The Substantial Interests Favoring A Joint Trial 

1. McVeigh's Right To A Fair Trial Will Be Fully Protected By A Limiting Instruction 

a. Bruton Applies Only To "Facially Incriminating Confessions" That Are "Devastating" 
To The Codefendant 

b. Nichols' FBI Statements Were Not A "Facially Incriminating  Confession" That Would 
Be "Devastating" To McVeigh. 

c. Nichols' FBI Statements Are Important To The Case Against Him But Are Not "Vitally 
Important" To The Case Against McVeigh 

i. Nichols' Statements Add Little To The Powerful Case Against McVeigh 

[TEXT REDACTED]

2. Defendants' Claims Of Mutual Antagonism Are Legally And Factually Insufficient To 
Warrant Severance 

3. Nichols' Claim Of "Spillover" Prejudice From Evidence Admissible Only Against 
McVeigh Is Legally And Factually Insufficient To Warrant Severance a. A Limiting 
Instruction Would Protect Against Any "Spillover" Prejudice b. The "Spillover" Evidence 
About Which Nichols Complains Is Also Admissible Against Him i. Evidence Of 
McVeigh's Bombing Motive Is Equally Admissible Against Nichols Because An Aiding-
And-Abetting Theory Requires That The Prosecution Prove McVeigh's Guilt To Convict 
Nichols 

ii. McVeigh's Statements In Furtherance Of The Conspiracy Are Equally Admissible 
Against Nichols Because Nichols Never Withdrew From The Conspiracy 

4. Nichols' Claim That There Is More Evidence Against McVeigh Is Legally And 
Factually Insufficient To Warrant Severance 

C. Nichols' Alternative Proposal Of Two Simultaneous Juries Is Unnecessary But Is 
Preferable To Two Trials 

II. DEFENDANTS' SEVERANCE ARGUMENTS BASED ON THE CAPITAL 
NATURE OF THIS PROCEEDING SHOULD LIKEWISE BE REJECTED 

A. The Considerations Favoring Joint Trials Of Noncapital Cases Apply Equally In The 
Capital Setting 

1. Rule 14 Means The Same Thing In Capital As In Noncapital Cases a. The Eighth 
Amendment Does Not Disallow Generally Applicable Trial Procedures And Rules In 
Capital Cases 

b. Joint Capital Trials Serve The Interests Of Justice In The Same Ways As Joint Trials In 
Noncapital Cases 

B. A Joint Sentencing Proceeding Likewise Would Be The Fairest And Best Means Of 
Determining Punishment

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY
LYNN NICHOLS, Defendants.


BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION TO SEVERANCE 

Defendants seek separate trials by claiming they will suffer from "spillover prejudice" 
and "mutually antagonistic defenses." They also claim, inconsistent with Buchanan v. 
Kentucky, 483 U.S. 402 (1987) and recent federal practice, that joint capital trials are 
presumptively unfair. The strong presumption, however, in capital and noncapital cases 
alike, is that joint trials are the best and fairest way of trying alleged coconspirators. In 
contrast, defendants rely on a premise the Supreme Court and federal courts repeatedly 
have rejected: that juries cannot be trusted to follow instructions that each defendant be 
considered individually. This premise is especially faulty here because almost all the 
evidence is admissible against both defendants. 

The only colorable legal argument for requiring severance -- McVeigh's Bruton challenge 
to Nichols' statement -- also fails. Jurors can be trusted to follow limiting instructions 
except where a codefendant's confession is "devastating" on its face to the defendant. 
McVeigh previously has argued, and this Court has ruled, that Nichols' statements are 
facially innocent. Accordingly, Bruton does not compel severance. 


STATEMENT

The United States offers this summary outline of expected trial proof to help the Court 
exercise its discretion in weighing the need for and benefits of a joint trial against 
defendants' claims of unfair prejudice. While familiarity with details of the government's 
evidence may be unnecessary to resolving many pretrial issues, defendants' severance 
motions wrongly suggest there are vast differences in the proof against McVeigh and 
Nichols. To the contrary, as we demonstrate below, a severance would result in two 
virtually identical trials. This overlap of proof greatly reduces any risk of "spillover" 
prejudice and suggests that defendants, respective litigation strategies are unlikely to be 
as antagonistic as they would have the Court believe. Moreover, an understanding of the 
proof will reveal that McVeigh's Bruton claim not only fails as a matter of law (because 
Nichols' statements are not facially incriminating) but also that McVeigh's legally 
insufficient claim of inferential incrimination is particularly weak in light of the [TEXT

Significantly, whether the proof is of joint action or steps taken individually, all 
significant evidence (with the exception of Nichols's post-bombing statement to the FBI) 
would be admissible against both defendants in either a consolidated or severed trial.

ARGUMENT

I. THE SEVERANCE MOTIONS SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE DEFENDANTS 
HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY PREJUDICE OUTWEIGHING THE BENEFITS OF A 
JOINT TRIAL. 

Defendants were properly joined together as "they are alleged to have participated ... in 
the same series of acts or transactions constituting [the] offense[s]." Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b); 
see generally United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986). The leading Supreme Court 
decision holds that "when defendants properly have been joined under Rule 8(b), a 
district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a 
joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the 
jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence." Zafiro v. United States, 
506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993). Defendants seeking severance bear a "heavy burden" as they 
must demonstrate that continued joinder would cause "actual prejudice" to their fair trial 
rights and "not merely a negative spill-over effect." United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 
1453, 1468 (10th Cir. 1995) (internal quotations omitted); see also United States v. 
Youngpeter, 986 F.2d 349, 353 (10th Cir. 1993) ("This burden is heavy for the defendant 
to bear as he must show more than a better chance of acquittal or a hypothesis of 
prejudice, he must, in fact, show real prejudice"). 

While prejudice is necessary, it is not sufficient: "Rule 14 does not require severance 
even if prejudice is shown; rather, it leaves the tailoring of the relief to be granted, if any, 
to the district court's sound discretion." Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 538-539. The Tenth Circuit 
has explained that "[b]efore exercising its discretion to grant a motion to sever, ... the trial 
court must weigh prejudice to the defendant caused by joinder against the 'obviously 
important considerations of economy and expedition in judicial administration.'" United 
States v. Dirden, 38 F.3d 1131, 1140 (10th Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Petersen, 
611 F.2d 1313, 1331 (10th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 905 (1980)). 

Defendants McVeigh and Nichols have not demonstrated that trying them together would 
prejudice their rights to a fair trial. Moreover, the benefits of a joint trial far outweigh 
defendants' interests in being tried separately. 


A. The Normal Preference For Joint Trials Is Especially Strong Given The Circumstances 
Of This Case. 

There is always a "preference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants who are 
indicted together," as "[j]oint trials 'play a vital role in the criminal justice system.'" 
Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537 (quoting Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 209 (1987)). The 
various interests the Supreme Court, Tenth Circuit and other federal courts have 
identified as favoring joint trials are especially compelling in the circumstances of this 
case: 


1. McVeigh And Nichols Are Alleged Coconspirators And Aiders/Abettors Who Should 
Be Tried Together. 

The Tenth Circuit repeatedly has stressed that "persons charged together with conspiracy 
[should] be tried together." United States v. Hardwell, 80 F.3d 1471, 1486 (1996) (citing 
United States v. Scott, 37 F.3d 1564, 1579 (10th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1324 
(1995)); see also United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 434 (10th Cir. 1995) ("'[I]n a 
conspiracy trial it is preferred that persons charged together be tried together'") (quoting 
Scott) cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 2497 (1996); United States v. Jackson, 850 F. Supp. 1481, 
1491 (D. Kan. 1994) (the "interests [favoring joint trials in genera]] are most apparent 
when co-defendants are jointly indicted and face common conspiracy charges"; citing 
United States v. Jenkins, 904 F.2d 549, 557 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 962 
(1990)). Accordingly, "denial of severance is entirely proper when it is alleged that the 
defendants are all members of the same conspiracy 'and, as such, the acts of one ... [are] 
attributable to the others.'" Jackson, 850 F. Supp. at 1492 (quoting Petersen, 611 F.2d at 
1332). 

Here, McVeigh and Nichols are charged jointly not only in the conspiracy count but also 
in each of the remaining ten substantive counts, which expressly cite the aiding and 
abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2. While McVeigh actually delivered the bomb to the 
Murrah Building and personally caused the eight charged murders, Nichols is charged 
both as a principal and as an aider and abetter of McVeigh. To convict Nichols on the 
aiding and abetting theory, the prosecution will prove (among other things) that McVeigh 
committed the actual bombing. See generally DE 1268 at 36 (prosecution's proposed jury 
instructions on aiding and abetting). It follows that evidence tending to show that 
McVeigh committed the bombing is equally relevant (although not alone sufficient) to 
establishing Nichols' guilt. This evidentiary convergence is an additional reason favoring 
a joint trial. See United States v. Freeman, 6 F.3d 586, 598 (9th Cir. 1993) ( "As Freeman 
was charged both with conspiracy and aiding and abetting, it was necessary for the jury to 
consider evidence of and understand the conduct for which Netters was charged"), cert. 
denied, 114 S.Ct. 1661 (1994). 


2. The Interests In Administrative Efficiency Promoted BY Joint Trials Are Especially 
Compelling Here. 

Even in routine criminal cases, joint trials "promote efficiency" (Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537) 
by "conserv[ing] state funds, diminish[ing] inconvenience to witnesses and public 
authorities, and avoid[ing] delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial." United 
States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449 (1986) (internal quotations omitted). These normal 
benefits are heightened in this extraordinary case. This Court knows better than anyone 
the tremendous financial and administrative costs that even a single trial -- much less two 
-- will entail. And, of course, conducting two trials rather than one would delay 
substantially the final resolution of these defendants' guilt or innocence. 

While there are many additional examples of the administrative burdens that two trials 
would engender, one worth noting is that of selecting and "death-qualifying" two 
impartial juries capable of deciding the case based on the courtroom evidence rather than 
upon their out-of-court knowledge and biases. To end up with 12 jurors and 6 alternates, 
this Court will have to qualify 64 venirepersons. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 24 (b) and (c) ("If 
the offense charged is punishable by death, each side is entitled to 20 peremptory 
challenges" and Each side is entitled to ... 3 [additional] peremptory challenges if 5 or 6 
alternate jurors are to be impanelled"). Obviously, holding two trials would require 
qualification of 128 (rather than 64) prospective jurors. 

Granting severance would also make more difficult this Court's task of preserving the 
integrity of a jury pool. A large amount of judicial and attorney effort has been focused in 
this case on avoiding prejudicial pretrial publicity, by regulating matters such as sealed 
filings and extrajudicial statements. Most, if not all, these extraordinary efforts will be 
wiped out by the time of the second case, however, as the most significant evidence (and 
the first jury's reaction) already would have played out in public. 

There is no merit to Nichols' claim that "efficiency concerns are [] minimal" because 
"separate trials of [these defendants] would in reality be two very different trials, 
technically covering the same conspiracy but focussing on entirely distinct acts and 
evidence" (DE 2004 at 46). Nichols grossly understates the matter by suggesting that "the 
case against [him] is limited to proving a few specific acts during the period of the 
alleged conspiracy" (id.). No less than 15 of the indictment's 27 overt acts involve 
Nichols acting either alone or with McVeigh. Qualitatively, Nichols is alleged to have 
been involved in virtually every key step of the conspiracy: acquiring the ammonium 
nitrate and other bomb components, burglarizing an explosives quarry, planning a 
robbery and receiving stolen property to help finance the bombing, and helping to 
construct the bomb. See Indictment at 3-6. While McVeigh alone is alleged to have 
rented and delivered the Ryder truck to Oklahoma City, his acts in doing so are an 
essential part of the case against Nichols whether this case is one trial or two. In short, a 
second trial would repeat almost the same evidence, through almost all the same 
witnesses, heard in the first trial. 

Because Nichols' guilt under an aiding-and-abetting theory cannot be established without 
proving McVeigh's guilt as well (see United States v. Verners, 53 F.3d 291, 295 n.2 (10th 
Cir. 1995)), this Court should not put stock in Nichols' claim that he "has little or no 
interest in countering the government's presentation on [such] issues [as] ... the forensic 
evidence linking [McVeigh] to the bombing" (DE 2004 at 45). Nichols' claim, moreover, 
is difficult to square with a brief he filed just two days before his severance brief. In that 
earlier brief, Nichols expressly "join[ed] the motion of Mr. McVeigh for discovery of 
additional expert material" (DE 1983 at 1), "further move[d] for production of the 
material listed in Mr. McVeigh's motion" (id.), "further move[d] that the Court hold a 
pretrial hearing before jury selection" (id. at 2), and argued among other things that "[t]he 
qualifications of experts tendered by the government cannot be tested until the 
Whitehurst-related inquiry now underway is completed" (id. at 5). Nichols' wide-ranging 
challenges to expert and forensic evidence, including his adoption of many McVeigh 
arguments, belie his severance claim. 


3. The Interests Of Victims And Witnesses Favoring A Joint Trial Have Never Been 
Stronger Than Here. 

Another factor cited by the Supreme Court in favor of joint trials is the interest in sparing 
"victims and witnesses [from] repeat[ing] the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of 
testifying." Richardson, 481 U.S. at 210. The recognized concern in sparing victims from 
repeated trials -- and the "trauma" of repeatedly reliving a crime and its aftermath -- is 
present here to an unprecedented degree. There are a hundred times more victims here 
than in a typical case, and the uncertainty and trauma that would be prolonged by two 
trials will be exacerbated by watching those trials played out in the media. Many victims, 
particularly those who will testify in any sentencing proceeding, will themselves face 
intrusive scrutiny by media unable to obtain footage of courtroom testimony. 

This Court in the past appropriately has considered victims' interests in making a 
discretionary procedural ruling. See, e.g., United States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 
1470 (W.D. Okl. 1996) ("the court has considered Tulsa as the presumptive transferee 
district because of the language of Article III, Sec. 2, cl. 3, and the expressed wishes of 
many of the victims"); Id. at 1474 ("In reaching this ruling, the court is acutely aware of 
the wishes of the victims of the Oklahoma City explosion to attend this trial"). There is 
even more reason to do so here since, in contrast to venue (where there was no statutory 
or case law expressly requiring consideration of victims, interests), the Supreme Court 
has cited victims' interests as a relevant consideration. 


4. A Joint Trial Is The Fairest Means Of Achieving A Correct Resolution Of The 
Criminal Charges. 

All the interests strongly favoring a joint trial -- the legal presumption that alleged 
coconspirators and aiders/abettors should be tried together, the administrative efficiency, 
and the concern for victims and witnesses -- must give way if "a joint trial would 
compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from 
making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence." Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. But, far 
from undercutting fairness and reliability, a joint trial typically allows "the jury [to] 
obtain[] a more complete view of all the acts underlying the charges than would be 
possible in separate trials." Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U.S. 402, 418 (1987). This 
broader "perspective," which allows the jury "to arrive more reliably at its conclusions 
regarding the guilt or innocence of a particular defendant," is "particularly significant 
where, as here, all the crimes charged against the joined defendants arise out of one chain 
of events...." Id. Accord United States v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507, 1527-1528 (8th Cir. 
1995) ("justice is best served by trying" coconspirators together "because a joint trial 
'gives the jury the best perspective on all of the evidence and therefore increases the 
likelihood of a correct outcome'"; quoting United States v. Buljubasic, 808 F.2d 1260, 
1263 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 815 (1987)), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 1449 (1996); 
Jackson, 850 F. Supp. at 1491 ("Joint trials 'reduce the chance that each defendant will try 
to create a reasonable doubt by blaming an absent colleague' and provide 'the jury the best 
perspective on all of the evidence'"; quoting Buljubasic). 

A joint trial is fairest not because it offers defendants their best chance for acquittal -- a 
consideration entitled to no weight under Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 540 -- but rather because it 
offers the best prospect for a just resolution. The Supreme Court has stressed that joint 
trials "'serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent 
verdicts.'" Id. at 537 (quoting Richardson, 481 U.S. at 210). Nichols, in arguing that 
"separate trials [would] pose no danger whatsoever of inconsistent verdicts," offers the 
one-sided view that it would be "fully consistent" for a jury to convict McVeigh but 
acquit Nichols (DE 2004 at 46). Nichols surely would not agree with the converse, 
however, and there would be no legal recourse for any party if one jury irrationally 
absolved McVeigh of any responsibility for the bombing while another convicted Nichols 
of aiding and abetting McVeigh. See Standefer v. United States, 447 U.S. 10 (1980) 
(upholding conviction of second defendant for aiding and abetting first defendant in 
crime for which first defendant previously was acquitted). Not only would separate trials 
risk inconsistent verdicts, they also would "randomly favor[] the last-tried defendant[] 
who [would] have the advantage of knowing the prosecution's case beforehand." 
Richardson, 481 U.S. at 210. 


B. McVeigh And Nichols Have Not Identified Any Cognizable Prejudice. Much Less 
Any Prejudice That Outweighs The Substantial Interests Favoring A Joint Trial. 

1. McVeigh's Right To A Fair Trial Will Be Fully Protected By A Limiting Instruction. 

The "almost invariable assumption of the law [is] that jurors follow their instructions," 
including limiting instructions that evidence may only be considered against another 
defendant. Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206-207; United States v. Lane, 883 F.2d 1484, 1498-
1499 (10th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1059 (1990). This is a "pragmatic [rule], 
rooted less in the absolute certitude that the presumption is true than in the belief that it 
represents a reasonable practical accommodation of the interests of the state and the 
defendant in the criminal justice process." Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, quoted in Lane, 
883 F.2d at 1498. Severance is required only where out-of-court statements so powerfully 
incriminate a codefendant that they come within the rule announced in Bruton v. United 
States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). 


a. Bruton Applies Only To "Facially Incriminating Confessions" That Are "Devastating" 
To The Codefendant. 

Bruton carved out a "narrow exception" to "the almost invariable assumption" that 
limiting instructions can be trusted. Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206-207. Bruton held that "a 
defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when the facially 
incriminating confession of a nontestifying codefendant is introduced at their joint trial, 
even if the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant." 
Richardson, 481 U.S. at 207. The codefendant's out-of-court statements in Bruton had 
such a "powerful" and "devastating" effect because they directly and unequivocally 
linked the defendant to the crime: "A postal inspector testified that [codefendant] Evans 
orally confessed to him that Evans and [defendant Bruton] committed the armed 
robbery." Id. at 124. Although full-blown confessions of this type were too "powerful" 
and "devastating" for limiting instructions, the Bruton Court carefully limited the scope 
of its holding: "Not every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other evidence can be 
considered to be reversible error unavoidable through limiting instructions." Id. at 135. 

Richardson's reasoning governs statements naming a codefendant but not amounting to a 
facially devastating confession. In United States v. Clark, 456 F.2d 1375, 1376-1378 
(10th Cir. 1972), the court rejected Bruton challenges to an FBI agent's testimony in a 
check- kiting prosecution regarding codefendant McHenry's admission that he and 
codefendant Clark created false bank balances by depositing checks backed by 
insufficient funds. Bruton was "readily distinguishable" because "McHenry's statement 
didn't incriminate, as such, either himself or Clark"; it "was not in any sense a confession, 
but was essentially a recitation of the financial dealings between the two defendants." Id. 
at 1376 (alternative holding). McVeigh and Nichols downplay the importance of Clark 
because the court added: "And in any event, both Clark and McHenry testified upon trial 
and each was cross-examined by counsel for the other defendant." Id. (emphasis added). 
See DE 1999 at 26; DE 2004 at 50 n.24. Perhaps the Tenth Circuit will someday say the 
same thing here (if Nichols ends up testifying), but the trial judge in Clark allowed the 
testimony before knowing whether McHenry would testify and the Tenth Circuit saw no 
error in that decision. Defendants correctly note (as we have always conceded, see DE 
1003 at 11) that Clark's holding is an alternative one, but they offer no principled basis 
for ignoring it. 

Other federal courts of appeals likewise have limited Bruton to codefendant confessions 
that are facially devastating to the defendant. A good recent example is United States v. 
Jobe, 77 F.3d 1461, 1477-1479 (5th Cir. 1996), a check kiting prosecution in which 
defendant Novoa (a bank cashier) raised a Bruton objection to statements by codefendant 
Taylor (the bank president) to a bank examiner. Codefendant Taylor told the examiner 
that "Novoa [had] presented the check for him to sign" and that Taylor had not verified 
whether there were sufficient funds in the account because he "had faith" in Novoa. Id. at 
1477-1478. Taylor added that "[w]hen he was told [later] that the transaction was illegal, 
he asked cashier Fernando ... Novoa what happened, what was the reason for this, and he 
did not get an answer." Id. at 1478. Although Taylor's hearsay statements to the examiner 
were a blatant attempt to shift blame to Novoa, the Fifth Circuit found no Bruton 
violation because "[t]he statements did not directly incriminate Novoa without reference 
to other admissible evidence." Id. Accordingly, the "limiting instruction [was] adequate to 
protect Novoa from any potential prejudice" and the "district court acted well within its 
discretion in denying the motion to sever trials." Id. at 1479 (quotations omitted). 

Similarly, in United States v. James, 40 F.3d 850 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 
948 (1995), the court rejected defendant Williams' Bruton challenge where an ATF agent 
testified that codefendant James had stated that "Williams was a member of 'the same 
Crip set, of the 118th Street East Coast Crips.'" Id. at 877. The ATF agent added "in 
response to questions concerning drug dealing, [that codefendant] James had 'stated that 
the 118th Street East Coast Crips is not a drug organization, that individual members are 
merely involved in drug dealing for their individual profit.'" 

Id. James was a drug trafficking prosecution in which the codefendant's hearsay 
statements directly linked defendant Williams by name to a "Crips" gang whose members 
trafficked in drugs. The court nonetheless held that "[t]he facts of Williams' case present 
at best a weak analogy to Bruton" because the "challenged statement in Williams' case is 
neither a confession nor otherwise powerfully incriminating." Id. (quotations omitted). 
The court explained that "[i]f the statement was incriminating at all, it was so only as 
circumstantial evidence, requiring the jury to infer that anyone who is claimed to be 
affiliated with the Crips gang is more likely to be a coconspirator in the charged 
conspiracy and to possess heroin and firearms." Id. at 877-878. The Seventh Circuit 
concluded that "[t]he district court was therefore correct in ruling that the admission of 
James' statement did not violate Williams' rights under Bruton and thus did not warrant a 
severance on that basis." Id. at 878. 

Another illustrative case is United States v. Olano, 62 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 1995), a bank 
fraud prosecution of several defendants for having made several insider loans to each 
other's financial institutions. The court there rejected Bruton challenges to various pretrial 
statements (including grand jury and deposition transcripts), admissible only against 
certain codefendants, describing the deals. See Id. at 1195-1196. Among the statements at 
issue was one by a codefendant, who was chairman of a separate financial institution, that 
he had 'two loans for Guy Olano to make.'" Id. at 1196. Even though this statement (and 
others) could be powerfully incriminating when considered with other trial evidence 
suggesting a pattern of insider loans among legally distinct financial institutions, the 
court held that a limiting instruction fully protected Olano's rights because "[n]one of the 
codefendants' statements incriminated Olano on their face." Id. at 1195. In particular, the 
court deemed the statements "[u]nlike the full-blown confession that was the subject of 
Bruton," because they "plainly did not have a sufficiently 'devastating' or 'powerful' 
inculpatory impact to be incriminatory on [their] face." Id. (emphasis added). 

Many other cases reject Bruton challenges to the admission in a joint trial of a 
codefendant's out-of-court statements regarding dealings with the defendant. The unifying 
theme of these cases is that Bruton does not apply where the codefendant's statements are 
not a confession incriminating the defendant on their face. See, e.g., United States v. 
Adams, 74 F.3d 1093, 1099 (11th Cir. 1996) (codefendant's statement that defendant had 
account at bank in question did not violate Bruton so as to require severance as statement 
"was not facially incriminating because the reference to the bank account required linkage 
to other evidence"); United States v. Escobar, 50 F.3d 1414, 1422 (8th Cir. 1995) 
(codefendant "Keeper's statement was used only to show that he was acquainted with 
[defendants] Escobar and Duarte and he lied about this fact; this statement by itself does 
not implicate Escobar or Duarte in any wrongdoing"); United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 
1223, 1229 (1st Cir.) ("Admittedly, [codefendant] Cohen's statement might tend to 
incriminate [defendants] Smith and Devaney by showing that the coconspirators met to 
discuss damage control" but "[i]n this sense, however, the statement falls far outside the 
pale of 'powerfully incriminating' evidence that produces Bruton errors"), cert. denied, 
116 S. Ct. 176 (1995). 

The line drawn by all these courts is consistent not only with Richardson but also with the 
Supreme Court's reasoning in Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991). Fulminante, 
which held that the admission of a coerced confession could be harmless error, carefully 
distinguished full confessions from other less devastating statements. The Court 
explained that "confession[s] [are] like no other evidence" in that they have such a 
"'profound impact on the jury ... that we may justifiably doubt its ability to put them out 
of mind even if told to do so.'" Id. at 296 (quoting Justice White's Bruton dissent). The 
Court continued: "While some statements by a defendant may concern isolated aspects of 
the crime or may be incriminating only when linked to other evidence, a full confession 
in which the defendant discloses the motive for and means of the crime may tempt the 
jury to rely upon that evidence alone in reaching its decision." Id. (emphasis added). 


b. Nichols' FBI Statements Were Not A "Facially Incriminating Confession" That Would 
Be "Devastating" To McVeigh. 

Once it is accepted as a matter of law that Bruton applies only to facially incriminating 
confessions, its inapplicability here is clear: McVeigh already has argued and this Court 
already has found that Nichols' statements are not facially incriminatory. McVeigh's 
counsel previously have described Nichols' admitted actions with and on behalf of 
McVeigh -- including the crucial Oklahoma City trip as "[f]acially innocent." DE 1710 at 
19-34. Likewise, this Court has found that "[n]one of the [Nichols'] statements directly 
implicates Timothy McVeigh." 8/14/96 Mem. Op. at 59; see also id. at 62 ("Taking the 
reported statements of Terry Nichols as true in their entirety, they are consistent with 
[the] possibilit[y] ... that neither of these two defendants had any involvement in the 
bombing...."). 

Nichols' most significant statement is his admission that he drove to Oklahoma City on 
April 16, 1995, went by the Murrah Building a couple of times, and drove McVeigh back 
to Kansas -- all for ostensibly innocent reasons. Clearly, as McVeigh concedes (DE 1710 
at 22-26), there is nothing facially incriminating in being with Nichols or in Oklahoma 
City days before the bombing: virtually all the thousands of people in Oklahoma City on 
April 16, 17, 18 and 19, 1995 were there for innocent reasons. McVeigh argues the 
statements are "devastating to [him] in light of other circumstances" (DE 1999 at 19; 
emphasis added), but that is not the Bruton test. McVeigh is in the same position as 
defendant Marsh in Richardson, whose codefendant's confession became incriminating 
"when linked with evidence introduced later at trial." 481 U.S. at 208; see also id. n.3 
("very premise of our discussion is that [Marsh] would have been harmed by 
[codefendant] Williams' confession if the jury had disobeyed its instructions"). 

McVeigh, noting that the FBI report includes Nichols' statement that he stopped on the 
way back to buy diesel fuel, speculates that the prosecution "will [also] utilize" Nichols' 
statement to support a theory that this same diesel fuel was used in the truck bomb 
constructed two days later. DE 1999 at 11. The United States has not sought to introduce 
during its direct case in a joint trial Nichols' statement about purchasing diesel fuel. In 
any event, the diesel fuel purchase is facially innocent -- Nichols at the time was driving a 
diesel-powered truck -- and could take on a sinister purpose only through linkage with 
other trial evidence. 

McVeigh next complains that testimony regarding Nichols' [TEXT REDACTED] DE 
1999 at 11-12. This is precisely the "inferential incrimination" not covered by Bruton. 
See United States v. Chatman, 994 F.2d 1510, 1513 (10th Cir.) cert. denied, 510 U.S. 883 
(1993). McVeigh likewise objects that Nichols' hearsay statement should not be allowed 
to [TEXT REDACTED] (DE 1999 at 19). The prosecution has not sought in its direct 
case to introduce Nichols' explanation for his marital lie, and Nichols' own right to offer 
his hearsay excuse is not clear. Cf. United States v. Sherlin, 67 F.3d 1208, 1217 (6th Cir. 
1995) (codefendant Teague not entitled to elicit from agent who testified that he admitted 
acting as a "lookout" the fact that he claimed to have done so at defendant Sherlin's 
direction) cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 795 (1996). Assuming the statement is admissible to 
provide context, however, McVeigh's Bruton rights are "not implicated" because the 
prosecution's theory is that it was a false exculpatory statement. See id. at 1216 
("[a]lthough the [codefendant's] statement did refer to [defendant] Sherlin, it was the 
government's position that this statement was false"; citing Anderson v. United States, 
417 U.S. 211, 220-221 (1974)). Finally, Nichols' explanation does not facially implicate 
McVeigh in any crime. [TEXT REDACTED] See FBI-302, Para. 11. 

Turning to the second category of Nichols' core statements; (those pertaining to April 18, 
1995), McVeigh argues that they are incriminating because they "place [him] with Terry 
Nichols' pick up truck the day before the bombing, thus suggesting an opportunity for 
[him] to put together the truck bomb in Terry Nichols' absence" (DE 1999 at 19). There is 
nothing facially incriminating about McVeigh being linked to Nichols' pick-up truck, 
however, and Nichols' claimed absence from McVeigh for several hours on April 18th 
may tend to exculpate Nichols but it does not facially incriminate McVeigh. [TEXT 
REDACTED] This is precisely the type of extrinsic evidentiary submission that has no 
place in a trial court's Bruton analysis. See Richardson, 481 U.S. at 209. 

The last category of Nichols' three core admissions about his conduct with and on behalf 
of McVeigh involves his statement that he removed McVeigh's sleeping bag, rucksack 
and rifle from a Herington storage locker on April 20, 1995. See FBI-302 Para. 31. The 
items Nichols took from the locker, and the fact he took them, are facially innocent. The 
significance of Nichols' statements lies in the fact that he picked them up because 
McVeigh purportedly told him on April 18 that "there were belongings in a storage shed 
in Herington, saying 'if I don't pick them up, pick them up for me.'" Id. Para. 30. The 
noteworthy fact is that Nichols chose to pick up the items on April 20 (the day after the 
bombing and McVeigh's then-unpublicized arrest), when he purportedly had not heard 
from McVeigh and would not have been in any position to know whether the items in 
fact had been picked up by McVeigh. complains that Nichols' statements "place 
McVeigh's possessions in a storage shed that the Government alleges was used in 
preparation for the bombing" (DE 1999 at 19), but there is nothing facially incriminating 
about McVeigh's possessions (a sleeping bag, rifle and rucksack) nor about their storage 
in a locker. 

McVeigh's only specific additional objection, beyond the three core admissions addressed 
above, is to Nichols' statement that [TEXT REDACTED] McVeigh now claims this 
statement impermissibly would link him to gun dealer Roger "Bob" Moore, the robbery 
victim who McVeigh mistakenly refers to as "Bob Miller." DE 1999 at 10-11. Nichols' 
reference to "Bob" is obscure, and McVeigh's acquaintance with Moore is indisputable. 
Even if the prosecution sought to introduce this statement, there would be no Bruton 
problem as it is not facially incriminating. 

The prosecution finally will seek to introduce specific statements in which Nichols 
falsely (as other trial evidence will show) denied contacts with McVeigh between January 
1995 and April 18, 1995 [TEXT REDACTED] Any Confrontation Clause challenge to 
these (false) denials of association fails as a matter of law. See Tennessee v. Street, 471 
U.S. 409, 414 (1985) (hearsay confession introduced for purpose other than its truth 
"raises no Confrontation Clause concerns"); Sherlin, 67 F.3d at 1216 (discussed above); 
United States v. Hackett, 638 F.2d 1179, 1186-1187 (9th Cir. 1980) (codefendant's 
statements falsely denying having visited defendant's house raised no Bruton problem, 
and in fact were admissible against both defendants, because they were offered not for 
their truth but rather to show "consciousness of guilt") cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1001 
(1981). The Supreme Court held in Anderson that where "the prosecution was not 
contending that anything [two defendants] said at the election contest was true, the other 
defendants had no interest in cross-examining them so as to put their credibility in issue." 
417 U.S. at 220; accord United States v. Krohn, 573 F.2d 1382, 1386 (10th Cir.) (no 
"actual hearsay problem" and no "confrontation issue" where statements "were not 
offered to prove the truth of the matters stated, and indeed the Government says the 
statements were essentially untrue"), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 949 (1978). 


c. Nichols' FBI Statements Are Important To The Case Against Him But Are Not "Vitally 
Important" To The Case Against McVeigh. 

In addition to requiring that the codefendant's statements be facially incriminating to the 
defendant, the Tenth Circuit "limit[s] Bruton applications to 'clearly inculpatory' 
comments that are 'vitally important to the government's case.'" United States v. Hill, 901 
F.2d 880, 884 (10th Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Espinosa, 771 F.2d 1382, 1399 
(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1023 (1985)). Cf. Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 
432 (1972) ("we conclude that the minds of an average jury would not have found the 
State's case [against Schneble] significantly less persuasive had the testimony as to Snell's 
admission been excluded" so "[t]he admission into evidence of these statements, 
therefore, was at most harmless error"; quotations omitted). As is true of the facial 
incrimination requirement, the inquiry whether statements are "vitally important to the 
government's case" logically must be made from the viewpoint of the only defendant with 
standing to raise a Bruton challenge: in this case, McVeigh. 

Nichols' statements are, without question, important to the case against him. The 
prosecution cannot forego, even upon pain of severance, Nichols' admissions regarding: 
1) his April 16 Oklahoma City trip; and 2) his purported truck loan to McVeigh on April 
18. The former statements are important both for their truth (showing Nichols' 
involvement in what other evidence will prove was the conspiracy to bomb a federal 
building) and for their falsity (showing that Nichols lied about various matters, such as 
his prior contact with McVeigh and the reason for his trip). The latter statement is 
important primarily for its falsity, because other evidence will show that Nichols could 
not have loaned McVeigh his truck at the times and under the circumstances he claimed. 
There is, under these circumstances, no viable option of redaction, and again the 
prosecution would urge some form of severance rather than redaction. 


i. Nichols' Statements Add Little To The Powerful Case Against McVeigh. 

In contrast to their importance against Nichols, the statements are far less important to the 
case against McVeigh. By no means are Nichols' statements significant enough as to 
McVeigh that their admission in a joint trial legitimately could be held to prejudice 
McVeigh's right to a fair trial. 

Not only are Nichols' statements regarding his April 16 actions facially non-
incriminating, they are also not vitally important to the overall case against McVeigh. 
[TEXT REDACTED] 

Nichols' statements do not hurt McVeigh's supposed defense theory. On the contrary, 
McVeigh himself argues that Nichols' [TEXT REDACTED] 

Nichols claims severance is necessary [TEXT REDACTED] ("when asked questions 
about his opinion as to whether Timothy McVeigh was involved, Terry Nichols gave 
varying responses"). Nichols, of course, could take the witness stand and detail 
McVeigh's actions, [TEXT REDACTED] There is no basis, however, for [TEXT 
REDACTED] 

Nichols first claims he can introduce his own hearsay, without taking the stand and 
regardless of what the prosecution offers, because [TEXT REDACTED] DE 2004 at 29 
(citing Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973)). Nichols' reading of Chambers, 
which would obliterate the hearsay rules for criminal defendants, is grossly overbroad. 
Chambers simply held that a defendant was constitutionally entitled to offer evidence that 
a third person had confessed to the murder with which he was charged, because the third 
party's repeated confessions were declarations against penal interest made "under 
circumstances that provided considerable assurance of their reliability." 410 U.S. at 300. 
"Chambers was an exercise in highly case-specific error correction" (Montana v. 
Egelhoff, 116 S. Ct. 2013, 2022 (1996) ), which provides no basis for Nichols to offer his 
own self-serving and unreliable hearsay. 

Nichols' second claim is somewhat better grounded, but ultimately suffers from similar 
overbreadth in application. A defendant whose statement is introduced against him is 
entitled to introduce omitted parts of his statement that are "relevant and 'necessary to 
qualify, explain, or place into context the portion already introduced.'" United States v. 
Branch, 91 F.3d 699, 728 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting and citing cases). Some circuits have 
applied this fairness requirement to oral statements under Fed. R. Evid. 106 (which by its 
terms applies only to "a writing or recorded statement"), while others have applied Fed. 
R. Evid. 611 (a) (which allows the trial court to require evidentiary "presentation 
effective for the ascertainment of the truth"), but the analysis is similar in either event. 
,See Branch, 91 F.3d at 727-728 (collecting cases). A defendant seeking to compel 
introduction of omitted portions must "demonstrate with particularity the unfairness in 
the selective admission of his post-arrest statement." Id. at 729. The Tenth Circuit has 
explained that "[u]nder the doctrine of completeness embodied in Fed. R. Evid. 106, it is 
not required that portions of a writing which are neither explanatory of the previously 
introduced portions nor relevant to the introduced portions [be] admitted." United States 
v. Wright, 826 F.2d 938, 946 (10th Cir. 1987) (citing United States v. Marin, 669 F.2d 73 
(2d Cir. 1982)). 

The United States has recognized evidentiary fairness rules by agreeing that Nichols may 
introduce those related parts of his oral statement necessary to place the admitted parts in 
context. Nichols goes further by claiming his rights would "be violated unless [TEXT 
REDACTED] An opinion of Judge Kane (sitting by designation) for the Tenth Circuit, 
however, deemed "it puerile to suggest that if any part of a statement is [to] be admitted 
the entire statement must be admitted." Wright, 826 F.2d at 946. Likewise, Judge 
Higginbotham recently explained in affirming convictions of Waco/Branch Davidian 
defendants that "[n]either the Constitution nor Rule 106 ... requires the admission of the 
entire statement once any portion is admitted in a criminal prosecution." Branch, 91 F.3d 
at 729. Unless necessary to place the admitted portion in context, "the exculpatory nature 
of the excluded statement ... does not require its admission under Rule 106." Id. at 728 
(citing United States v. Smith, 794 F.2d 1333, 1335 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 938 
(1986)). 

Nichols thus is entitled to introduce, and in fact the United States itself will bring out in 
the FBI agents' direct testimony, everything necessary to place his admissions in context. 
Nichols' admitted journey to Oklahoma City to meet McVeigh, for example, will include 
[TEXT REDACTED] The United States does not seek to hide from the jury Nichols' 
claimed explanations for each of his actions with or on behalf of McVeigh. 

The jury thus will hear everything necessary to place in context Nichols' admissions and 
indeed everything Nichols said that might tend to exculpate him of the crime. There is no 
support, however, for Nichols' claim that he should also be able to introduce his [TEXT 
REDACTED] Nichols' reliance on Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683 (1986), is 
particularly misplaced. Crane simply holds that a defendant seeking to disavow his 
confession on the ground that it was involuntary may "introduce testimony about the 
environment in which the police secured his confession." Id. at 691. Nichols, although he 
purports to stand by his "admitted facts" (DE 2004 at 28), could under Crane "introduc[e] 
evidence of the physical circumstances that yielded" his statement to the FBI. See 476 
U.S. at 691 [TEXT REDACTED] 

Even if the hearsay and relevancy barriers could be overcome, however, there would be 
no basis for admitting [TEXT REDACTED] See Fed. R. Evid. 701 ("If the witness is not 
testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is 
limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of 
the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness, testimony or the 
determination of a fact in issue"). [TEXT REDACTED] Moreover, because it is not 
helpful, Nichols' proposed opinion testimony invades the jury's province in a way not 
authorized by Rule 704(a). See, e.g., United States v. Simpson, 7 F.3d 186, 188 (10th Cir. 
1993) (expert opinion as to ultimate guilt or innocence must set forth sufficient bases to 
allow independent assessment by jury); United States v. Pino, 606 F.2d 908, 918 n.11 
(10th Cir. 1979) (despite Rule 704(a), expert could not testify that defendant in vehicular 
manslaughter case would not or did not drive recklessly). 


2. Defendants' Claims Of Mutual Antagonism Are Legally And Factually Insufficient To 
Warrant Severance. 

Defendants devote the largest parts of their motions to seeking severance based on 
mutually antagonistic defenses. See DE 1999 at 27-46, 75-87 and DE 2038 at 1-48 
(McVeigh); DE 2004 at 20-32, 104-120 and Proposed Ex Parte Appendix 1 (Nichols). 
The law is well established, however, that a defendant has no right to be tried separately 
from an "antagonistic" codefendant who may engage in "finger-pointing" or act as a 
"second prosecutor." Zafiro holds that "[m]utually antagonistic defenses are not 
prejudicial per se" and in any event that "Rule 14 does not require severance even if 
prejudice is shown; rather, it leaves the tailoring of the relief to be granted, if any, to the 
district court's sound discretion." 506 U.S. at 538-539. The Tenth Circuit, in post-Zafiro 
decisions, uniformly has rejected mutually antagonistic defense claims, holding that 
denial of severance in such cases abridged no "specific trial rights" and that severance is 
not warranted where "the mutual antagonism complained of by defendants amounts to no 
more than fingerpointing." United States v. Williams, 45 F.3d 1481, 1483-1484 (10th Cir. 
1995); United States v. Linn, 31 F.3d 987, 992 (10th Cir. 1994). 

The only cases requiring severance because mutually antagonistic defendants engaged in 
finger-pointing or acted as "second prosecutors" predate Zafiro and are of questionable 
continuing validity. See United States v. Balter, 91 F.3d 427, 434 (3d Cir. 1996) ("There 
are pre-Zafiro cases that advanced the 'second prosecutor' theory as a ground for requiring 
severance," but defendant "cites no post-Zafiro cases reversing a trial judge's denial of a 
severance on the basis of this theory, and we are not aware of any such cases"). In United 
States v. Holland, 10 F.3d 696, 698 (10th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1064 (1994), 
the court first held that the defenses were not "mutually antagonistic as the jury could 
have easily attributed the drugs solely to Mr. Holland and the gun solely to Mr. Kelly." 
The court did not end its discussion there, however, but added: "Second, and more 
importantly, the Supreme Court recently held [in Zafiro] that defendants must show more 
than mutually antagonistic defenses to warrant a severance." Id. 

Even if this ground remained a viable basis for severance, defendants at least must show 
their "defenses are 'so antagonistic that they are mutually exclusive.'" Dirden, 38 F.3d at 
1141 (emphasis added; quoting United States v. Esch, 832 F.2d 531, 538 (10th Cir. 
1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 908 (1988)). The Tenth Circuit has not been casual in 
applying this requirement: "The defenses truly must be mutually exclusive, such that the 
jury could not believe the core of one defense without discounting entirely the core of the 
other." Id. (quoting United States v. Linn, 31 F.3d 987, 992 (10th Cir. 1994); and United 
States v. Swingler, 758 F.2d 477, 493-494 (10th Cir. 1985)). Severance is not justified 
where "the mutual antagonism complained of by defendants amounts to no more than 
finger pointing." Linn, 31 F.3d at 992. 

Nichols' severance argument fails because this is not, as he claims, a case in which 
[TEXT REDACTED] (DE 2004 at 22; emphasis added). In such rare "mutually 
exclusive" defense cases, as explained in the pre-Zafiro Ninth Circuit decision quoted by 
Nichols, defendants will "want to do everything possible to convict their codefendants" 
because "[a]ll evidence having the effect of exonerating one defendant implicitly indicts 
the other." United States v. Tootick, 952 F.2d 1078, 1082-1083 (9th Cir. 1991). Here, in 
contrast, it indisputably is in Nichols, interest for McVeigh to be "exonerated" because 
Nichols cannot rationally be convicted of aiding and abetting someone who did not 
commit the bombing. 

[TEXT REDACTED]

Defenses are not "mutually exclusive," however, simply because an alleged aider and 
abettor decides strategically not to contest the evidence against the alleged principal, and 
to argue instead his own lack of intent. The test for mutual exclusivity does not turn on 
the strength of the evidence against a codefendant -- a determination this Court is ill- 
suited to make in a pretrial severance motion (see 8/14/96 Mem. Op. at 60; Richardson, 
481 U.S. at 209) -- but rather upon whether a "jury could logically accept [one 
defendant's] defense without concluding that [the codefendant] was guilty, and vice 
versa." United States v. Flanagan, 34 F.3d 949, 952 (10th Cir. 1994) (emphasis added). 

Nichols wrongly suggests (DE 2004 at 30) that he and McVeigh are "like the defendants 
in" United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d 844, 857 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 943 
(1989) -- the only (pre-Zafiro) case in this Circuit to require severance based on mutually 
exclusive defenses. In Peveto, "Hines' defense ;that he was in the process of becoming an 
informant and was setting up drug dealers when the Bryan county house was searched) 
necessitated a showing that Rodgers was a drug dealer and the evidence which he put on 
tended to show just that." Id. at 857. Here, in contrast, [TEXT REDACTED] DE 2004 at 
28 (emphasis added). Nichols therefore does not have to establish McVeigh's guilt in 
order to maintain his own innocence. 

McVeigh's antagonistic defenses claim -- based on a supplemental brief [TEXT 
REDACTED] -- also fails. Perhaps McVeigh really will follow through with this defense 
or perhaps he will blame it all on Iraqui terrorists, on German neo-Nazi skinheads or on 
some other "real bomber" to be developed between now and trial. Assuming McVeigh 
jettisons his other culprits-du-jour, [TEXT REDACTED] there still would be no basis for 
severance. Such a [TEXT REDACTED] defense is no different than those rejected by the 
Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit and other courts as requiring severance. See, e.g., 
Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 536 (where there was double finger- pointing: defendants Garcia and 
Soto were caught bringing box of drugs to defendant Zafiro's apartment and blamed each 
other; Zafiro blamed her boyfriend Martinez who blamed her in return); Linn, 31 F.3d at 
992 ("Sturlin [defendants] maintained they had nothing to do with the fire at all and that 
Mr. Linn and others committed the scheme as part of a scheme to coerce Guy Sturlin to 
invest money" while defendant "Linn contended that he had nothing to do with the fire 
and that the Sturlins and [a plea-bargaining witness] committed the arson"); United States 
v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1095 (3d Cir. 1996) (codefendants argued "they were pawns in a 
scheme created and perpetrated by" defendant); United States v. Smith, 44 F.3d 1259, 
1266-1267 (4th Cir.) (codefendants claimed defendant ran whole scheme and they were 
victims of his influence), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1970 (1995). 

Defendants' "antagonism" claims are thus legally insufficient even assuming they really 
would follow through with their hypothesized defenses. The claims are also premature, as 
there is no way of knowing whether defendants would actually defend the case along the 
lines of their severance pleadings. This Court should not grant severance based on 
predicted defense strategies but instead should rely on its "'continuing duty at all stages of 
the trial to grant a severance if prejudice does appear.'" Peveto, 881 F.2d at 857 (quoting 
Schaffer v. United States, 362 U.S. 511, 516 (1960)). In each of those rare (pre-Zafiro) 
cases requiring severance, there has been "an examination of the [trial] record for an 
actual showing of prejudice stemming from the allegedly irreconcilable defenses." United 
States v. Swingler, 758 F.2d 477, 495 (10th Cir. 1985) (affirming this Court's denial of 
severance); see also Peveto, 881 F.2d at 856-858 & n.18 (where defendant renewed 
severance motion based on actual trial evidence). 


3. Nichols' Claim Of "Spillover" Prejudice From Evidence Admissible Only Against 
McVeigh Is Legally And Factually Insufficient To Warrant Severance. 

Nichols argues that "[s]everance should be granted because highly prejudicial evidence 
that is inadmissible against [him] is likely to be admitted against Mr. McVeigh" (DE 
2004 at 32). In support of this claim, Nichols details two categories of evidence allegedly 
admissible only against McVeigh: 1) "[e]xtremely prejudicial statements by Mr. 
McVeigh [TEXT REDACTED] id. at 33-38); and 2) McVeigh's post-December 1994 
statements in furtherance of the conspiracy that Nichols claims are inadmissible against 
him because he allegedly had "withdrawn [from the conspiracy] prior to the time these 
statements were made" (id. at 42-45). 

Nichols' "spillover" claim is in tension, if not outright conflict, with prior claim that he 
"must prove that Mr. McVeigh is guilty to make his own defense" (DE 2004 at 27). If 
Nichols really fears "guilt by mere association" and if "the clear guilt of one defendant" 
really would "obliterate" his defense (id. at 38-39), then it cannot also be that "Mr. 
Nichols must and fully intends to be a 'second prosecutor' of Mr. McVeigh" (id. at 30) . 

In any event, Nichols' "spillover" argument fails even on its own terms because: a) it is 
well-established that a limiting instruction protects against prejudice from evidence 
admissible only against a codefendant; and b) the evidence about which Nichols 
principally complains would be admissible against him anyway. We discuss these points 
in turn. 


a. A Limiting Instruction Would Protect Against Any "Spillover" Prejudice. 

The "preference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants who are indicted 
together" (Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537) remains even though "[i]n most joint trials, ... some 
evidence is admitted against some codefendants that is not admissible against others." 
Lane, 883 F.2d at 1498. The well-established Tenth Circuit rule is that "a complaint of 
the 'spillover' effect from the evidence that was overwhelming or more damaging against 
the co-defendant than the movant is insufficient to warrant severance." United States v. 
Rogers, 925 F.2d 1285, 1288 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 839 (1990); accord 
United States v. Cardall, 885 F.2d 656, 668 (10th Cir. 1989) ("Under our precedent, 
severance is clearly not warranted on th[e] basis" of alleged spillover); United States v. 
McClure, 734 F.2d 484, 492 (10th Cir. 1984) ("Evidence of prior criminal offenses 
relating only to one defendant does not generate prejudice arising to the level requiring 
severance"). While "Zafiro recognized that evidence admissible only against some co-
defendants can create the risk of an unfair trial for the other co-defendants, ... the Court 
also stated that limiting instructions are ordinarily sufficient to cure potential prejudice." 
United States v. Hardwell, 80 F.3d 1471, 1486-1487 (10th Cir. 1996) (citing 506 U.S. at 
539-541). Dozens of Tenth Circuit cases, including two affirming joint trials conducted 
by this Court, have rejected spillover arguments as a basis for severance. See, e.g., Lane, 
883 F.2d at 1497-1501; Swingler, 758 F.2d at 493-494. 

Nichols nonetheless cites the extremely "prejudicial" nature of [TEXT REDACTED] (DE 
2004 at 37). [TEXT REDACTED] which the United States will seek to introduce, but the 
United States has no plans to introduce evidence of [TEXT REDACTED] mainly, those 
the indictment alleges helped further the bombing conspiracy. Regardless, severance 
would not be required if prejudicial evidence of other [TEXT REDACTED] were 
admitted. See, e.g., Hardwell, 80 F.3d at 1487-1488 (limiting instructions cured any 
prejudice from "prior crimes evidence," including at least nine drug-related crimes, 
admissible only against codefendants); Jenkins, 904 F.2d at 555-557 (despite evidence of 
"violent acts" and other crimes not admissible against defendant, "severance [is] not 
required based on allegation of spillover effect"). 

Nichols seeks to strengthen his spillover argument by claiming "the jury is likely" to 
[TEXT REDACTED] to him "simply by virtue of [the pair's] prior associations" (DE 
2004 at 36). The Tenth Circuit rejected a much stronger "guilt by association" claim in 
United States v. Sanders, 929 F.2d 1466 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 846 (1991), 
where a husband and wife were charged with drug crimes, and certain drug paraphernalia 
seized later from the couple's home was admissible only against the husband to rebut his 
testimony. See id. at 1468-1470 & n.1. The Tenth Circuit held that severance was not 
required, and that the wife's rights were fully protected by the trial court's limiting 
instructions, notwithstanding even closer ties (both marital and residential) between than 
two defendants than exist between McVeigh and Nichols here. 


b. The "Spillover" Evidence About Which Nichols Complains Is Also Admissible 
Against Him. 

Nichols' spillover claim thus fails as a matter of law even assuming the correctness of its 
premise that the cited evidence would be admissible only against McVeigh. The claim is 
doubly flawed, however, because its premise is incorrect: the two categories of evidence 
about which Nichols principally complains are admissible not just against McVeigh but 
also against Nichols. 

i. Evidence Of McVeigh's Bombing Motive Is Equally Admissible Against Nichols 
Because An Aiding-And-Abetting Theory Requires That The Prosecution Prove 
McVeigh's Guilt To Convict Nichols. 

Nichols argues that [TEXT REDACTED] -- cannot be admitted as coconspirator 
statements because they were not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. DE 2004 at 33-
36 (discussing Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E)). McVeigh's statements nonetheless are 
admissible over Nichols' hearsay objection because they will not be "offered in evidence 
to prove the truth of the matter asserted" (Fed. R. Evid. Para.  801(c)) and alternatively fit 
comfortably within the Fed. R. Evid. 803(3) hearsay exception as statements of 
McVeigh's "then existing state of mind" and "motive." See generally 4 Jack B. Weinstein, 
et al., Weinstein's Evidence Para. 801(c)[01] at 801-103 to 801-104 (1995) ("A statement 
offered to show the state of mind of the declarant is analytically not hearsay if the 
declarant does not directly assert the state of mind that is in issue" while a direct 
statement to that effect is "admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule as a statement of 
a then existing mental or emotional condition"). 

For example, Nichols describes [TEXT REDACTED] (DE 2004 at 33).  The United 
States will not offer this [TEXT REDACTED] for the truth of the matters McVeigh 
asserted -- [TEXT REDACTED] -- but rather solely as it bears on McVeigh's state of 
mind and motive for the bombing. 

McVeigh's nonhearsay statements reflecting his state of mind therefore are admissible as 
long as McVeigh's mental state is relevant to the case against Nichols. Nichols concedes 
the statements are "probative of [McVeigh's] motive in the bombing" (DE 2004 at 36), 
but argues "they are entirely irrelevant to Mr. Nichols' case" (id. at 33). This relevancy 
objection disregards the indictment charging Nichols with aiding and abetting McVeigh 
in the bombing, and Nichols' own proposed jury instruction that "before Mr. Nichols may 
be found guilty as an aider or an abettor to the crime, the government must also prove, 
beyond a reasonable doubt, that someone committed each of the essential elements of the 
offense charged." DE 1269 at 18; see generally Verners, 53 F.3d at 295 n.2; DE 1268 at 
36 (prosecution's proposed jury instructions on aiding and abetting). In light of the 
indictment, the case law, and the parties, proposed instructions, evidence tending to show 
that McVeigh committed the bombing is equally relevant to the case against Nichols. See 
Freeman, 6 F.3d at 598 ("As Freeman was charged both with conspiracy and aiding and 
abetting, it was necessary for the jury to consider evidence of and understand the conduct 
for which Netters was charged"). 


ii. McVeigh's Statements In Furtherance Of The Conspiracy Are Equally Admissible 
Against Nichols Because Nichols Never Withdrew From The Conspiracy. 

Nichols second spillover claim is based on his argument that many of McVeigh's 
statements in furtherance of the conspiracy will not be admissible against him because 
there "is very powerful evidence that he had withdrawn from [the conspiracy] no later 
than November 22, 1994" (DE 2004 at 42). A similar claim was raised in support of an 
unsuccessful severance motion in Cardall. See 885 F.2d at 667 (defendant "contends that 
the joint trial allowed the to hear evidence of co-conspirator misconduct [and evidence] 
which occurred after he had allegedly withdrawn from the conspiracy"). The Tenth 
Circuit, in rejecting the claim, held that the defendant "had not effectively withdrawn 
from the conspiracy" nor was there "actual prejudice mandating severance on the basis of 
'irreconcilable' defenses." Id. at 668. The same is true here. 

Nichols' withdrawal claim [TEXT REDACTED] It is well established that "the 
prosecution is not a 'party' [to the conspiracy] against whom [coconspirator] testimony 
may be tendered." United States v. Abbas, 74 F.3d 506, 511 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 
S. Ct. 1868 (1996); accord United States v. Karp, 781 F.2d 1008, 1014 (3d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 475 U.S. 1024 (1986). 

Even assuming Nichols could introduce this hearsay statement, he will not be able to 
show -- as it is his burden to do under Tenth Circuit law (see Cardall, 885 F.2d at 668 
n.22) -- that he effectively withdrew from the conspiracy in November 1994 upon leaving 
for the Philippines. On the contrary, the evidence will strongly show that Nichols never 
withdrew. [TEXT REDACTED] Equally inconsistent with withdrawal are [TEXT 
REDACTED] 


4. Nichols' Claim That There Is More Evidence Against McVeigh Is Legally And 
Factually Insufficient To Warrant Severance. 

Nichols' claim that the evidence -- particularly the motive evidence -- is stronger against 
McVeigh fails as a matter of law. For severance purposes, "[i]t makes no difference that 
the government's case against [one defendant] may perhaps have been stronger than 
against" the other. United States v. Emmons, 24 F.3d 1210, 1218 (1994) (emphasis 
added); accord United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453, 1468 (10th Cir. 1995) ("Nor is it 
sufficient to show that one defendant is less culpable than the remaining codefendants"); 
United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 947 12d Cir. 1993) (rejecting same claim by 
Nichols' counsel in support of John Gotti's codefendant), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1645 
(1994). Indeed, "[i]t would be normal and usual to assume one or two or more 
codefendants would be more or less culpable than the others." United States v. 
Youngpeter, 986 F.2d 349, 353 (10th Cir. 1993). 

Nichols acknowledges Tenth Circuit case law rejecting lesser culpability as a basis for 
severance, but argues that "the Supreme Court has recognized that disparate levels of 
culpability may nevertheless be an appropriate basis for the district court to exercise its 
discretion in favor of severance." DE 2004 at 39 (citing Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539). Nichols' 
citation to Zafiro ignores the full context of the Supreme Court's comment: "When many 
defendants are tried together in a complex case and they have markedly different degrees 
of culpability, the risk of prejudice is heightened.'" 506 U.S. at 539 (emphasis added; 
citing Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 774-775 (1946)). Similarly, the only 
stated exception (which has never been found) to the Tenth Circuit rule that alleged 
spillover does not require severance is if "the evidence is so complex or confusing that 
the jury would be unable to make individual determinations about the guilt or innocence 
of each defendant." McClure, 734 F.2d at 492. Even in cases involving far more 
defendants and potential confusion than here, the Tenth Circuit consistently has found 
that "the facts of th[e] case were not so intricate as to render the jury unable to segregate 
the evidence associated with each defendant's individual actions." Edwards, 69 F.3d at 
434. There is no basis for a different result here. 

Nichols is also wrong factually in arguing [TEXT REDACTED] be proved at trial not 
only through testimonial evidence but also through [TEXT REDACTED] 


C. Nichols' Alternative Proposal Of Two Simultaneous Juries Is Unnecessary But Is 
Preferable To Two Trials. 

Nichols asks, as an alternative to severance, that this Court "empanel dual juries to hear 
the two defendants' cases simultaneously, except when evidence admissible against only 
one of the two defendants is being introduced." DE 2004 at 100 (citing appellate cases 
sustaining dual jury procedure). As far as we can tell, the only time dual juries have been 
employed in this Circuit is in the recently-completed case of United States v. Benally and 
Hatatley, 2:95CR-252S (D. Utah). The United States Attorney's Office in Utah reports the 
dual-jury trial there worked well. 

There is no need here for dual juries. The limited admissibility of Nichols' statements, 
which only McVeigh has standing to challenge, can be addressed through instructions. 
Nichols has not complained about the only evidence admissible against McVeigh but not 
Nichols -- McVeigh's post-arrest statements to state officials -- and those statements 
cause Nichols no real prejudice. Nichols' challenges to the motive evidence and 
McVeigh's conspiratorial statements are unfounded because that evidence will be 
admissible against Nichols as well. In any event, this Court has been upheld in its 
decision to empanel a single jury even where there were more defendants and more 
limiting instructions than there will be here. Lane, 883 F.2d at 1497-1502. 

Dual juries raise many of the administrative problems inherent in separate trials, and they 
also create new ones. For example, it is unclear there would be enough courtroom space 
for 18 additional jurors. Assuming there is, the dual jury procedure would require, just as 
two separate trials would, that the Court and parties screen and death-qualify 128 (rather 
than 64) prospective jurors. Dual juries also would pose a risk of inconsistent verdicts. 

Dual juries nonetheless would be preferable to separate trials. A dual-jury trial would 
better accommodate the interests of victims and witnesses, and would obviate the 
difficulty of empaneling a second jury after the evidence and results of the first trial are 
publicized. If the Court rejects trial before a single jury, a dual-jury trial would be a better 
alternative than two trials. 


II. DEFENDANTS' SEVERANCE ARGUMENTS BASED ON THE CAPITAL 
NATURE OF THIS PROCEEDING SHOULD LIKEWISE BE REJECTED. 

A. The Considerations Favoring Joint Trials Of Noncapital Cases Apply Equally In The 
Capital Setting. 

Nichols argues that, because this is a capital case, the Court should not follow the 
Supreme Court's interpretation of Rule 14 and the "preference in the federal system for 
joint trials of defendants who are indicted together'" (Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537). See DE 
2004 at 59-100. Nichols essentially offers two arguments for this unprecedented result: 1) 
a "statutory" argument that "Congress itself has long recognized the need for special 
procedural protections in capital cases" (id. at 62); and 2) a constitutional argument that 
the Eighth Amendment dictates differential treatment of capital cases. We address these 
in turn. 


1. Rule 14 Means The Same Thing In Capital As In Noncapital Cases. 

The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure must be applied as written. See Carlisle v. 
United States, 116 S. Ct. 1460 (1996). Nichols' argument that the unitary language of 
Rule 14 can be applied one way in noncapital cases a different way in capital cases 
contravenes the "normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in 
different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning." Commissioner v. 
Lundy, 116 S. Ct. 647, 655 (1996). Nichols correctly points out that Congress in other 
contexts has established special procedures for capital cases. See, e.g., Fed. R. Crim. P. 
24(b) (capital defendants allowed 20 peremptory challenges rather than only 10); 18 
U.S.C. Sec. 3432 (capital defendants entitled to witness list three days before trial). This 
cuts against rather than in favor of his claim, however, by showing Congress is perfectly 
capable of creating special capital procedures in the criminal code and rules where it 
deems them warranted. Cf. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 208 (1993) 
(different wording in "nearby sections of title 28 ... only underscores our duty to refrain 
from reading a phrase into the statute when Congress left it out" because "it is generally 
presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or 
exclusion"; quotations omitted). 

The only recent reported federal decisions have rejected severance claims by capital 
codefendants.  United States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d 861, 892-893 (4th Cir. 1996); United 
States v. Villarreal, 963 F.2d 725, 731-732 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 927 (1992); 
see also United States v. McCullah, 76 F.3d 1087 (10th Cir. 1996) (three capital 
codefendants). Nichols' citation of a century-and-a- half old district court case severing 
capital defendants "in favorem vitae" (United States v. Matthews, 26 F. Cas. 1205, 1206 
(1843)) is unpersuasive in light of this modern case law. Equally unpersuasive is Nichols' 
reliance on historical distinctions: for example, that capital defendants had appointed 
counsel some 100 years before that right was extended to noncapital defendants (DE 
2004 at 62-63). All this shows is that crucial procedural rights now apply in both 
noncapital and capital cases; there is no basis for Nichols' assumption that capital 
defendants must continue to receive favored treatment once noncapital defendants begin 
receiving equivalent rights. 

Nichols' reliance on differing state statutory and case law according severance rights to 
capital defendants (DE 2004 at 89-93) is even more unpersuasive; if Nichols thinks 
various state severance rules are better than the balance struck by the Supreme Court 
under Rule 14, he should address those arguments to Congress rather than this Court. We 
note, moreover, that while Nichols concedes that "states [do not] speak with one voice on 
this issue's (DE 93 at n.41, citing joint capital trials in Pennsylvania, Indiana and 
Missouri), his brief wrongly identifies Texas as a "state[] in which as a matter of common 
practice capital cases are simply not tried jointly." Id. at 92. Nichols bases this claim upon 
information from another Texas defense attorney who purportedly in turn got his 
information from a local Texas District Attorney. A no doubt underinclusive computer 
search of reported Texas cases, however, reveals at least five joint capital cases tried there 
in the past 20 years. Barrientes v. State, 752 S.W.2d 524, 525 (Text Cr. App. 1987), cert. 
denied, 487 U.S. 1241 (1988); Ex Parte McCormick, 645 S.W.2d 801, 802 (Text Cr. App. 
1983); Broussard v. State, 642 S.W.2d 171, 172 (Text Cr. App. 1982); Sanne v. State, 
609 S.W.2d 762, 766, 775-776 (Text Cr. App. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 931 (1981); 
McMahon v. State, 582 S.W.2d 786, 788 (Text Cr. App. 1978), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 
919 (1979). 

McVeigh offers a chart prepared by the defense attorney who unsuccessfully sought 
severance in Buchanan v. Kentucky ("the McNally chart," DE 2000, Exhibit LLL), to 
argue that trial courts liberally grant severance in capital cases. The McNally chart is 
misleading because six of the 17 cases it includes (Nos. 2, 4, 5, 8 10, 17) are inapposite as 
they involve only a single capital defendant. A seventh case (No. 1) severed the 
defendants, with the prosecution's consent, after a last-minute Brady issue requiring 
further investigation arose with respect to one of the defendants. An eighth case (No. 9) -- 
involving six capital codefendants (some severed, some not) -- bears little resemblance to 
this one, and indeed supports our position as the court there kept together capital 
defendants charged in the same killings. 

The McNally list thus includes nine relevant cases involving capital codefendants whom 
the prosecution sought to have tried together: United States v. Villarreal and Villarreal, 
No. 9:91-CR4 (E.D. Tex.), aff'd, 963 F.2d 725 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 927 
(1992) (McNally No. 3); United States v. Tipton, Roane and Johnson, 3:92-CR68 (E.D. 
Va.), aff'd, 90 F.3d 861, 892-893 (4th Cir. 1996) (McNally No. 6); United States v. 
Hutchins, Molina and McCullah, CR-32-S (E.D. Okl.), aff'd, 75 F.3d 1453; aff'd, 75 F.3d 
600; and aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 76 F.3d 1087 (10th Cir. 1996) (McNally No. 7); 
United States v. Oscar, Oscar and Henry, CR 2:93-131 (E.D. Va.), aff'd mem., 67 F.3d 
297 (4th Cir. 1995) (McNally No. 11); United States v. Mack, Rozier and Crummie, CR-
93-252 (S.D. Fla.) (McNally No. 12); United States v. Webster and Hall, 4-94-121-Y 
(N.D. Tex.) (McNally No. 13); United States v. Walker and Diaz, 94- CR-328 
(N.D.N.Y.) (McNally No. 14); United States v. Davis and Hardy, CR 94-381 (E.D. La.) 
(McNally No. 16); and United States v. Williams and Damon, 3:95-CR-45 (E.D. Va.) 
(McNally No. 16). Defendants were severed in only one of these cases -- Webster and 
Hall, which incidentally resulted in double death penalties after separate trials. The 
McNally chart wrongly counts two severance denials as grants: Tipton (McNally No. 6, 
which he describes as "one cap. def. severed" while ignoring that the only severed 
defendant was one as to whom a death notice was belatedly issued and then withdrawn); 
and Hutching-Molina-McCullah (McNally No. 7, which he counts as a severance because 
"separate penalty hearings [were held before] same jury"). 

A review of apposite federal cases thus reveals, contrary to the misleading impression 
fostered by the McNally affidavit, that capital codefendants have been kept together in 
eight of the nine cases in which they were indicted for the same crimes and the 
prosecution sought to have them tried together. In only one case cited in the McNally 
affidavit did the court, over prosecution objection, sever capital codefendants charged 
with the same crimes. The relevant statistics thus fail to support defendants' premise of 
differing severance standards in federal capital cases. 


2. The Eighth Amendment Does Not Require Severance. 

Nichols' Eighth Amendment claim for guilt-phase severance fares no better. That claim 
rests on two premises: a) the guilt phase of a capital trial requires "heightened reliability 
of fact finding" and thus special rules beyond those applicable to noncapital trials (DE 
2004 at 64-69); and b) joint trials are not sufficiently reliable to satisfy a heightened 
standard (id. at 77-89). The first premise is dubious, the second is clearly wrong. 


a. The Eighth Amendment Does Not Disallow Generally Applicable Trial Procedures 
And Rules In Capital Cases. 

The Supreme Court has never held that criminal trial rules that are fair in a noncapital 
setting cannot likewise be employed to determine the guilt or innocence of a capital 
defendant. The Court has commented that "death is different" (e.g., Harmelin v. 
Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 994 (1991) ) and that capital "factfinding procedures [must] 
aspire to a heightened standard of reliability." Ford v. Wainwright 477 U.S. 399, 411 
(1986) (citing Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 456 (1984) ) . As Nichols 
acknowledges, however, "[m]ost of the cases discussing the individualized consideration 
and heightened reliability requirements have dealt with challenges to penalty phase 
procedures" (DE 2004 at 66). In fact, as two anti-death penalty scholars have lamented, 
while "[t]he Court [has] echoed the 'death is different' principle in a number of... cases, ... 
close examination of the Court's decisions over the past twenty years reveals that the 
procedural safeguards are not as different as one might suspect." Carol S. Steiker & 
Jordan M. Steiker, Sober Second Thoughts: Reflections on Two Decades of 
Constitutional Regulation of Capital Punishment, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 355, 397 (1995); see 
also id. (while Court has created some special protections, it has "left untouched a 
substantial body of doctrine that relegates capital defendants to the same level of 
protection as non-capital defendants"). 

Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980), the case most heavily relied upon by Nichols 
(e.g., DE 2004 at 65, 66-67, 69), does not exempt capital defendants from generally 
applicable procedural rules. The Beck Court did state, in rejecting a rule disallowing 
lesser included offense instructions in capital cases, that the Eighth Amendment prohibits 
"rules that diminish the reliability of the guilt determination" and "enhance[] the risk of 
an unwarranted conviction." 447 U.S. at 638. The invalid Alabama rule, however, not 
only was "unique in American criminal law" (id. at 635) but also was more restrictive 
than the rule Alabama applied in noncapital cases. Id. at 630 & n.5. Thus, while leaving 
open "whether the Due Process Clause would require the giving of [lesser offense] 
instructions in a noncapital case" (id. at 638 n.14), the Court's holding simply equalized 
Alabama's treatment of capital and noncapital defendants. Here, in contrast, Nichols seeks 
to be treated differently with respect to severance than would a noncapital defendant. 
Beck does not support that result. 

Nichols' claim at bottom is that some generally applicable rules of federal criminal 
procedure may not be unfair enough to preclude their use in noncapital trials yet not be 
fair enough to allow their use in capital trials. It "would be a rather strange 
jurisprudence," however, to "h[o]ld that under our Constitution [a defendant] could not be 
executed" based on a guilty verdict from a joint trial "but that he could spend the rest of 
his life in prison" based on that same verdict. Cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 405 
(1993). This Court should reject Nichols' plea for an exemption from, or relaxation of, his 
Rule 14 burdens. 


b. Joint Capital Trials Serve The Interests Of Justice In The Same Ways As Joint Trials In 
Noncapital Cases. 

Even assuming the Eighth Amendment precludes procedural rules that "might be 
tolerable in a noncapital case but cannot be tolerated where the stakes are deaths' (DE 
2004 at 77), there would be no basis to preclude or restrict joint capital trials. Nichols is 
wrong in suggesting that joint trials are simply "tolerated" (and barely so at that) in a 
noncapital setting. Far from ever describing joint trials as a "necessary evil" (DE 2004 at 
94), the Supreme Court has endorsed the notion that a joint trial typically allows "the jury 
[to] obtain[] a more complete view of all the acts underlying the charges than would be 
possible in separate trials" and thus "to arrive more reliably at its conclusions regarding 
the guilt or innocence of a particular defendant." Buchanan, 483 U.S. at 418 (emphasis 
added). Buchanan, which Nichols overlooks in a 124-page brief citing more than 150 
cases, involved a noncapital defendant tried jointly with a capital codefendant and thus 
refutes any notion that severance considerations are different in capital cases. See also 
United States v. Sanchez, 75 F.3d 603, 604-605 (10th Cir.) (citing Buchanan in rejecting 
severance claims by noncapital defendant tried with three capital codefendants), cert. 
denied, 116 S. Ct. 1838 (1996). 

Nichols also errs as a matter of law in his repeated arguments that limiting instructions 
cannot be trusted in capital trials. The Supreme Court, in a variety of settings, has found 
"no reason to depart from 'the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow 
their instructions.'" Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573, 114 S. Ct. 2419, 2427 (1994) 
(quoting Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206). This "almost invariable assumption" applies 
equally in capital cases. See, e.g., Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 438 & n.6 
(1983). The capital defendant in Lonberger, who ultimately was sentenced to die, 
challenged his conviction on the ground that the jury could not have been expected to 
follow instructions limiting its consideration of a prior attempted murder conviction 
relevant only as a sentencing "specification." In rejecting this argument, the Court 
followed a prior decision which "upheld a conviction despite the introduction at the guilt-
determination stage of trial of a defendant's prior conviction for purposes of sentence 
enhancement." Id. n.6. The Court explained: 


[T]he crucial assumption underlying the system of trial by jury is that juries will follow 
the instructions given them by the trial judge. Were this not so, it would be pointless for a 
trial court to instruct a jury, and even more pointless for an appellate court to reverse a 
criminal conviction because a jury was improperly instructed. 


Id. (quotations omitted). Lonberger thus refutes Nichols' claim that limiting instructions 
cannot be trusted in capital cases, as well as his claim that limiting instructions would 
disable an appellate court from performing the capital review mandated by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 
3595. Cf. 9/25/96 Mem. Op. 8-9 (presuming that appellate court can conduct harmless 
error review of trial record pursuant to Sec. 3595(b); citing Tipton). Lonberger teaches 
that, even in a capital case, trial and appellate courts must discharge their responsibilities 
in light of the "crucial assumption" that juries follow instructions. 


B. A Joint Sentencing Proceeding Likewise Would Be The Fairest And Best Means Of 
Determining Punishment. 

Defendants finally argue that a joint sentencing proceeding, in the event both are 
convicted of capital offenses, should be severed. DE 1999 at 46-90 (as supplemented by 
DE 2038 at 16-46); DE 2004 at 101-123. As with their guilt-phase severance arguments, 
defendants do not demonstrate any specific right that would be compromised by a joint 
sentencing proceeding, but rather assert that such a proceeding would be "inherent[ly]" or 
at least "potentially" unfair. E.g., DE 2004 at 104. These arguments, which essentially 
would preclude any joint capital sentencing proceeding, should be rejected. 

Buchanan v. Kentucky, a Supreme Court decision both defendants overlook, refutes their 
core premise that joint capital sentencing proceedings are inherently unfair. The Court 
explained that joint proceedings provide a broader "perspective" allowing a jury not only 
"to arrive more reliably at its conclusions regarding the guilt or innocence of a particular 
defendant [but also] to assign fairly the respective responsibilities of each defendant in 
the sentencing." 483 U.S. at 418 (emphasis added). The Kentucky proceeding in 
Buchanan involved same-jury sentencing of both a capital and a noncapital defendant, but 
the Court's remarks are just as applicable to multiple capital defendants. Cf. Tipton, 90 
F.3d at 892 ("The same considerations of efficiency and fairness to the Government (and 
possibly the accused as well) that militate in favor of joint trials of jointly-tried 
defendants in the guilt phase, must remain generally in play at the penalty phase"). 

Defendants repeatedly, and correctly, point out that they are entitled to individualized 
consideration in the penalty phase. This argument gets them nowhere, however, for they 
are entitled to that same individualized consideration at the guilt phase. See, e.g., Eighth 
Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction Sec. 3.07 (1996) ("Keep in mind that you must 
give separate consideration to the evidence about each individual defendant. Each 
defendant is entitled to be treated separately, and you must return a separate verdict for 
each defendant") (citing Devitt & Blackmar). As the Court recognized just today, it is the 
Court's office -- and, necessarily, its ability -to "guide the jurors to individualized 
consideration of each defendant." 9/25/96 Mem. Op. at 14. A capital jury is presumed, at 
the penalty phase no less than the guilt phase, to understand and follow its guiding 
instructions. Tipton, 90 F.3d at 893 (citing Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206). 

Defendants' severance arguments are undercut by the Fourth Circuit's recent decision in 
Tipton, 90 F.3d at 892-893, which upheld a joint sentencing proceeding involving three 
capital codefendants. Nichols acknowledges Tipton but argues it "does not control here! 
given the fact-specific nature of the decision and the far different circumstances presented 
in this case" (DE 2004 at 103 n.45). Any factual distinctions between the two cases, 
however, militate even more strongly in favor of a joint trial here, as the Tipton 
defendants had better arguments in favor of severance than do McVeigh and Nichols. Not 
only were there three capital defendants in Tipton (as opposed to two here), but those 
three defendants faced an overlapping array of potentially confusing charges. See 90 F.3d 
at 893 (defendant Tipton originally charged with eight capital murders, convicted on six 
capital counts, and sentenced to death on three counts; defendant Johnson charged, 
convicted and sentenced to death on seven capital counts; defendant Roane charged, 
convicted and sentenced to death on three capital counts). 

Rather than identify any specific prejudice unique to this case, defendants seek severance 
based on arguments applicable to virtually every capital case. For example, McVeigh and 
Nichols both argue that a jury would be incapable of crediting one defendant's mitigating 
evidence without simultaneously penalizing the other defendant for failing to present that 
same mitigation. Each defendant specifically cites a potential "conflict" -- which Nichols 
contends "may not [be] predict[ed] before trial" -- between one defendant's Eighth 
Amendment right to testify in his own defense (or to offer evidence of cooperation with 
the government) and the other's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. See DE 1999 at 
87-88; DE 2004 at 117-120. In any joint trial, however, be it a guilt or penalty phase, 
there will be differences between the defendants. Under established Tenth Circuit law, a 
defendant may argue the positive significance of his own decision to testify but may not 
ask the jury to draw a correspondingly negative inference against his codefendant. United 
States v. McClure, 734 F.2d 484, 489-491 (10th Cir. 1984); accord United States v. 
Mayes, 917 F.2d 457, 461 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1125 (1991). Such a 
positive argument fully protects, even in a capital sentencing, a defendant's right to offer 
mitigating evidence. 

Defendants similarly argue that a single jury will not be able to give them the 
individualized consideration the Constitution requires while also considering the statutory 
mitigating factors of whether the defendant was a "relatively minor" participant "in the 
offense" (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3592(a)(3)) or whether "[a]nother defendant or defendants, 
equally culpable in the crime, will not be punished by death's (id. (a)(4)). These statutory 
requirements, as Nichols concedes, seek "intra-sentencing consistency" (DE 2004 at 112). 
That is not an evil, however, nor does it violate the Eighth Amendment individuality 
requirement, because a capital jury should be able to "assign fairly the respective 
responsibilities of each defendant in the sentencing." Buchanan, 483 U.S. at 418. 

In the end, defendants ask this Court to sever the penalty phases -- before their guilt-
phase trials and before a single juror to death on all of the capital murder counts on which 
he was convicted" while "Tipton was sentenced to death on three of the six counts on 
which he was convicted; [and] Roane on one of three"). All told, since 1990, of the 15 
federal defendants who have gone to a joint capital sentencing proceeding, only six (40 
percent) have been sentenced to death. In contrast, of the eight federal defendants who 
have proceeded to an individual penalty proceeding, five (62.5 percent) have been 
sentenced to die. 


CONCLUSION

Defendants have not overcome the strong presumption that alleged coconspirators should 
be tried together. Their severance motions should be denied.

<P>Oklahoma bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh is seeking a separate trial from 
codefendant, Terry Nichols. In this brief filed September 4, 1996, some of which is blacked out per the court's order not to reveal discovery material, McVeigh contends that nine hours of statements Nichols made to to the FBI before he was arrested will be improperly considered by a jury against McVeigh. (Judge Matsch ruled earlier this year that the statements are only admissible against Nichols.) McVeigh also claims that he and Nichols will have antagonistic defenses, and that their Eighth Amendment right to individual sentencing, would be violated by a joint proceeding.</P>

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS, 

Defendants.


DEFENDANT NcVEIGH'S MOTION FOR SEVERANCE OF DEFENDANTS AND 
BRIEF IN SUPPORT (REDACTED FOR PUBLIC FILING) 

The defendant, Timothy McVeigh, by and through undersigned Counsel, moves for a 
severance of defendants pursuant to Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
In support of the motion, Counsel shows the Court the following: 


I. INTRODUCTION TO ARGUMENTS THAT MR. MCVEIGH IS ENTITLED TO A 
SEVERANCE FOR TRIAL 


. . . I saw a lizard come darting forward on six great taloned feet and fasten itself to a 
[fellow soul] . . . . They fused like hot wax, and their colors ran together until neither 
wretch nor monster appeared what he had been when he began. . . . 


Dante, The Inferno, Canto XXV, Circle 8, Bolgia 7, lines 46-48, 58- 60 (J. Ciardi, 
transl.), cited in United States v. Romanello, 726 F.2d 173, 174 (5th Cir. 1984). 

The Government envisions a trial in which the actions and statements of Terry Nichols 
become indistinguishable from the actions of Timothy McVeigh. The rules of law 
applicable to conspiracy and to criminal agency lend themselves to such a result. 
Fortunately for all, the Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination and the Fifth 
Amendment right to due process of law provide a bulwark against the encroachment of 
unreliable evidence in a criminal trial. In order for any verdict against Timothy McVeigh 
to have integrity it will have to be reached at a trial separate and apart from Terry Nichols 
for two compelling reasons: 

First, while Terry Nichols' statements may represent a quantitatively small part of the 
evidence the Government hopes to introduce, qualitatively these statements are 
devastating. That the Government perceives the statements to be pivotal to its case is 
demonstrated by the Government's painstaking analysis of the statements in its letter to 
Counsel and the Court dated March 15, 1996 (attached as Exhibit A) and the Motion in 
Limine concerning the statements filed February 2, 1996 (D.E. 1003). If the statements 
are spread before the jury in a joint trial, either upon direct examination by the 
Government or cross-examination by Counsel for Nichols, the jury will simply be unable 
to avoid consideration of the statements as evidence against Timothy McVeigh: 


The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury, 
cf. Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 559, 68 S.Ct. 248, 257, all practicing 
lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction. See Skidmore v. Baltimore and Ohio R. 
Company, 2 Cir., 167 F.2d 54. 


Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 453 (1949) (Justice Jackson concurring) 
(emphasis added). 

While Counsel for McVeigh is convinced that other aspects of the Government's case can 
be impeached, the uncross-examined statements of Terry Nichols pose a unique danger 
which cannot be overcome at a joint trial. 

Second, to the extent the Government's evidence reveals activity which can be taken as 
"incriminating," each defendant has a powerful incentive to attribute such activity to his 
codefendant. Terry Nichols has already demonstrated an amazing propensity to place the 
blame for every action allegedly undertaken squarely onto the shoulders of Timothy 
McVeigh. 

Antagonistic defenses destroy the defendants' ability to receive a fair trial: 


Conspiracy trials, with their world girdling potential, are given more extensive thrust by 
the admission of hearsay testimony, the use of conspiratorial acts to prove substantive 
offenses, and the joint trial of defendants. These pressures alone threaten to undermine 
the fair consideration of individual conspiracy defendants. However, the dangers inherent 
in joint trials become intolerable when the co-defendants become gladiators, ripping each 
other's defenses apart. In their antagonism, each lawyer becomes the government's 
champion against the co-defendant, and the resulting struggle leaves both defendants 
vulnerable to the insinuation that a conspiracy explains the conflict. 


United States v. Romanello, 726 F.2d 173, 182 (5th Cir. 1984). As will be detailed in 
Section IV, the danger of antagonistic defenses in the instant case is tangible and real. 


II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND RELEVANT TO TERRY 
NICHOLS' STATEMENTS 

By indictment filed August 10, 1995, the Government charged Timothy James McVeigh 
and Terry Lynn Nichols jointly with eleven (11) separate felony counts related to the 
explosion at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on 
April 19, 1995. Count 1 charges McVeigh and Nichols with conspiring together and with 
"others unknown to the Grand Jury" to use a weapon of mass destruction in violation of 
18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332a. Count 2 charges use of a weapon of mass destruction; Count 3 
charges destruction by explosive; and Counts 4 through 11 charge first degree murder of 
federal law enforcement officials engaged in the performance of their official duties. By 
notice filed October 21, 1995, the Government stated its intention of seeking the death 
penalty against Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. 

On February 22, 1996, the Government filed its Motion in Limine regarding statements 
of Terry Nichols. (D.E. 1003.) In that motion, the Government argued that certain 
statements made by Terry Nichols to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on 
April 21 and 22, 1995, should be admissible against both defendants. After exhaustive 
briefing, an evidentiary hearing and oral argument, the Court ruled that the statements 
were admissible against Terry Nichols, but not against Timothy McVeigh. (D.E. 1850.) 

In anticipation of that ruling, the Government stated its intention to offer the statements 
against Terry Nichols only, and to ask the Court for a limiting instruction directing the 
jury not to consider Nichols' statements as evidence against Timothy McVeigh. Reply 
Brief of the United States Regarding Admissibility of Nichols' Statements, filed June 10, 
1996. (D.E. 1563.) 

This brief is written to dispel the fiction that a limiting instruction would suffice to 
prevent prejudice to Timothy McVeigh, and to obtain for Mr. McVeigh the separate trial 
which due process demands. 


III. IF THE GOVERNMENT USES TERRY NICHOLS' STATEMENTS, THE SIXTH 
AMENDMENT DEMANDS SEPARATE TRIALS. 

A. The statements the Government intends to introduce 

By letter dated March 15, 1996, the Government detailed for Counsel and the Court the 
Government's intentions concerning statements alleged to have been made by Terry 
Nichols. In that letter, the Government argued that certain of Nichols' statements were 
admissible against both defendants, while other statements would only be offered against 
Terry Nichols. The Government has not retreated from its position, advanced in the June 
10, 1996, Reply Brief, that Timothy McVeigh's rights can be protected by a limiting 
instruction. 

Thus, in light of the Court's Memorandum, Opinion and Order of August 14, 1995, the 
Government intends to introduce against Nichols specific evidence concerning the 
statements that he allegedly made. While the Government may choose not to introduce 
every aspect of these statements, the Government has indicated it will not object to 
Counsel for Nichols placing the statements in context. See Exhibit A (Government's letter 
of March 5, 1996 at p. 5). The Government suggests that the statements can be utilized by 
the jury to find that Nichols was with McVeigh, but cannot be utilized against McVeigh 
to establish that he was with Nichols. Such mental gymnastics lie within the province of 
computers, not human beings. See Exhibit B (FBI 302 detailing Nichols' statements). 

The Government proposes that a single jury, seated in the same courtroom as McVeigh 
and Nichols, hear and consider against Nichols -- but not consider against McVeigh -- 
testimony from an FBI agent that Nichols stated: 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


It is of course feasible that the Government may not attempt to introduce each of these 
statements, and may focus instead upon what the Government has described as the "core 
admissions" that Nichols was with McVeigh in Oklahoma City on April 16, 1995; that 
Nichols lent McVeigh his pick up truck on April 18, 1995; and that Nichols cleaned out a 
storage shed at McVeigh's direction on April 20, 1995. Nevertheless, the Government 
cannot and will not prevent Counsel for Nichols from emphasizing that Nichols' 
statements place blame for every conceivable inculpatory act upon the shoulders of 
Timothy McVeigh. The Government has acknowledged that it cannot prevent Counsel for 
Nichols from placing the statements in context. See Exhibit A (Government's letter of 
March 15, 1996, at p. 5, indicating that the Government would not object to Nichols' 
introduction of information described within 13 separate paragraphs of FBI 302's). 

B. The relationship between the Nichols' statements and the government's theory 


(THIS SECTION REDACTED)


C. The impossibility of "not considering the evidence" 

The Government's proposal concerning a limiting instruction becomes even more 
untenable in light of the instructions that the jury must receive in reference to Count 1. 
The jury must be instructed that acts of Terry Nichols should be considered in 
determining whether Timothy McVeigh is guilty of the conspiracy charge. It can 
reasonably be anticipated that the jury will be instructed along the following lines: 


Evidence has been received in this case that Terry Nichols, who is alleged in Count 1 of 
the Indictment to be a co-conspirator of the defendant Timothy McVeigh, has done or 
said things during the existence or life of the alleged conspiracy in order to further or 
advance its goals. 

Such acts and statements of Terry Nichols may be considered by you in determining 
whether or not the Government has proven the charges in Count 1 of the Indictment 
against defendant Timothy McVeigh. . . . 


Devitt, Blackmar and O'Malley, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, 4th Ed., West 
Publishing Company, 1990, Section 28.06. 

The problem becomes even more complex in light of the fact that the Government in 
Counts 2-11 has charged each of the defendants with aiding and betting under the 
provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a) and (b). It can reasonably be anticipated that the 
Government will request an agency instruction. Such an instruction to the jury might read 
as follows: 


When two or more persons knowingly associate themselves together to carry out a 
common plan or arrangement and intend either to accomplish some unlawful purpose or 
to accomplish some lawful purpose by unlawful means, there arises from that association 
a kind of partnership in which each member becomes the agent of every other member. 

So if you find that the evidence in the case shows such a common plan or arrangement, 
then an act knowingly done or a statement knowingly made by one such member, while 
the common plan or arrangement is continuing and in furtherance of some object or 
purpose thereof, is admissible against all of the members. . . . 


Devitt, Blackmar, Wolff and O'Malley, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, 4th Ed., 
West Publishing Company, 1992, Section 18.02. 

In Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the United States Supreme Court 
reversed Bruton's conviction because introduction of his co-defendant's confession in a 
form not subject to cross-examination added substantial weight to the Government's case. 
The Court held that the violation of Bruton's Sixth Amendment right could not be 
avoided by a jury instruction to disregard the confession as to Bruton. 

Bruton and a co-defendant named Evans were tried in federal court on charges of armed 
postal robbery. A postal inspector testified that Evans had confessed that Evans and 
Bruton committed the armed robbery. The trial judge instructed the jury that although 
Evans' confession was competent evidence against Evans, it was inadmissible hearsay 
against Bruton and had to be disregarded in determining Bruton's guilt or innocence. 
Bruton, 391 U.S. at 124-25. 

The United States Supreme Court stated:


We hold that, because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the 
contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner's 
guilt, admission of Evans' confession in this joint trial violated petitioner's right of cross-
examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. 


Id. at 126.

The Supreme Court described the impossible task faced by the jury in attempting to 
consider the evidence against one defendant but not the other: 


Here Evans' oral confessions were in fact testified to, and were therefore actually in 
evidence. That testimony was legitimate evidence against Evans and to that extent was 
properly before the jury during its deliberations. Even greater, then, was the likelihood 
that the jury would believe Evans made the statements and that they were true -- not just 
the self-incriminating portions but those implicating petitioner as well. Plainly, the 
introduction of Evans' confession added substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the 
Government's case in a form not subject to cross- examination, since Evans did not take 
the stand. Petitioner thus was denied his constitutional right of confrontation. 


Id. at 127-28.

In reversing Bruton's conviction, the United States Supreme Court relied upon a number 
of factors and identified certain risks, each of which are present in this case. Specifically, 
the Court drew upon Justice Frankfurter's dissent in Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 
232 (1957). Justice Frankfurter's dissent in Delli Paoli recognized the absolute futility of 
limiting instructions that direct jurors to give full consideration to a co-defendant's 
confession for purposes of establishing the codefendant's culpability, but to then wholly 
ignore the confession when assessing the defendant's culpability: 


The fact of the matter is that too often such admonition against misuse is intrinsically 
ineffective in that the effect of such a non-admissible declaration cannot be wiped from 
the brains of the jurors. The admonition, therefore, becomes a futile collocation of words 
and fails of its purpose as a legal protection to defendants against whom such a 
declaration should not tell. 


Bruton, 391 U.S. at 129 (quoting Justice Frankfurter's dissent in Delli Paoli, 352 U.S. at 
247).1/ 

In the Oklahoma City bombing case, a limiting instruction will be precisely the type of 
"futile collocation of words" rejected by the Bruton Court as insufficient to protect Sixth 
Amendment rights. This is particularly true in light of the fact that the jury will be 
instructed that McVeigh can be held responsible for the words and actions of Nichols 
under the Government's conspiracy and aiding and abetting theories. The problem will 
become even more acute if the Government succeeds in persuading the Court that some 
of Nichols' statements can be taken for the truth of the matter asserted and others can not. 

An additional problem of joint trials, identified in Bruton, --is that the Government 
receives an incredible windfall by virtue of the admission of the inadmissible statements. 
To believe that admission of Nichols' statements would not advance the Government's 
case against McVeigh is to believe that it is not important to the Government to attempt 
to prove: 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


Counsel for McVeigh does not anticipate that the Government will argue that it would 
not be benefitted by such evidence. Instead the Government likely will advance the 
unmitigated fiction that limiting instructions will protect Timothy McVeigh's rights. The 
Supreme Court in Bruton dealt with that argument as well: 


In joint trials, however, when the admissible confession of one defendant inculpates 
another defendant, the confession is never deleted from the case and the jury is expected 
to perform the overwhelming task of considering it in determining the guilt or innocence 
of the declarant and then of ignoring it in determining the guilt or innocence of any co-
defendants of the declarant. A jury cannot "segregate evidence into separate intellectual 
boxes." It cannot determine that a confession is true insofar as it admits that "A" has 
committed criminal acts with "B" and at the same time effectively ignore the inevitable 
conclusion that "B" has committed those same criminal acts with "A." 


Bruton, 392 U.S. at 131 (quoting Justice Traynor in People v. Aranda, 63 Cal.2d 518, 
528-29, 407 P.2d 267, 271-72 (1965)). 

In the instant case, it will be impossible for the jury to determine that Terry Nichols' 
statements are true insofar as they state that Nichols was with McVeigh in Oklahoma 
City in the vicinity of the Murrah Building three days before the bombing and, at the 
same time, effectively ignore the inevitable conclusion that - McVeigh was with Nichols 
in the vicinity of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City three days before the bombing. 

In Bruton the Court specifically repudiated the basic premise that limiting instructions 
suffice in such circumstances. "Rule 14 authorizes a severance where it appears that a 
defendant might be prejudiced by a joint trial." 392 U.S. at 131 (emphasis added). The 
Court recognized that an essential element of a fair trial is that a jury consider only 
relevant and competent evidence bearing upon the issue of guilt. Id. at fn. 6 citing 
Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539 (1947). 

In concluding that limiting instructions were insufficient, the Supreme Court analyzed the 
Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and examined the dangers inherent in 
custodial statements of a co-defendant: 


The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged 
accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. It was 
against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed. . . . Despite 
the concededly clear instructions to the jury to disregard Evans' inadmissible hearsay 
evidence inculpating petitioner, in the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting 
instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner's constitutional right of cross-
examination. The effect is the same as if there had been no instruction at all. 


Bruton, 139 U.S. at 136-37 (emphasis added). 

The effect of admitting Terry Nichols' statements will be doubly devastating to Timothy 
McVeigh. It is quite probable that the Government will attempt to introduce those aspects 
of the statements which are consistent with the Government's theory in an effort to prove 
the truth of the matter asserted. The Government has stated it will not object when 
Counsel for Nichols places the statements in context (as indeed it cannot). The effect will 
be that evidence is before the jury in the form of Terry Nichols' bold, out-of-court 
statements designed to implicate Timothy McVeigh and to put Nichols in the position of 
a witness for the Government who, by virtue of his statements, would: 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


If the Government is successful in proving that some of Terry Nichols' self-serving 
protestations were lies, then Nichols has managed not only to seal his own fate, but also 
the fate of Timothy McVeigh as well. Nichols' unreliable statements are simply 
devastating to Timothy McVeigh in light of other circumstances. 

Based upon the Motion in Limine, it is safe to predict that the Government, in an effort to 
distinguish Bruton, will argue that Terry Nichols' statements were not facially 
incriminating and that a limiting instruction will be sufficient to protect Timothy 
McVeigh's due process rights. The Government will likely rely upon Richardson v. 
Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987). In Richardson, defendant Marsh was charged together with 
Benjamin Williams and Kareem Martin with assaulting Cynthia Knighton and murdering 
her four-year old son Koran and Knighton's aunt, Ollie Scott. Marsh and Williams were 
tried jointly. At trial, the state introduced a confession Williams gave to the police shortly 
after his arrest, but the confession was redacted to omit all references to Marsh and all 
indications that anyone other than Martin and Williams participated in the crime. 
Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. at 202. 

As presented to the jury, Williams' redacted confession stated that there had been a 
conversation in the car on the way to Knighton's house between Williams and Martin in 
which Martin said that the victims of the robbery would be killed. The confession made 
absolutely no reference to Marsh's existence or presence in the car. 

Marsh testified in her own defense, admitted being present in the car, but said that she 
could not hear any of the conversation. Richardson, 481 U.S. at 204. The jury was 
specifically instructed not to consider Williams' confession as evidence against Marsh. Id. 
at 205. The Court rejected Marsh's confrontation clause argument and ruled that in the 
circumstances of that case the jury could be expected to follow the Court's instructions: 


On the precise facts of Bruton, involving a facially incriminating confession, we found 
that accommodation inadequate. As our discussion above shows, the calculus changes 
when confessions that do not name the defendant are at issue. While we continue to apply 
Bruton where we have found that its rationale validly applies, see Cruz v. New York, 481 
U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162, we decline to extend it further. We hold that 
the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a non-testifying co-
defendant's confession with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is 
redacted to eliminate not only the defendant's name. but any reference to his or her 
existence. 


Richardson, 428 U.S. at 211 (emphasis added). 

The Court's holding in Richardson was contingent upon a circumstance which is not 
possible regarding Terry Nichols' statements: redaction to eliminate all references to the 
co-defendant's existence.2/ In those portions of Nichols' statements that the Government 
argues are admissible at a joint trial, Nichols invoked McVeigh's name no fewer than 63 
times. An examination of the key phrases that Nichols used should make clear that 
redaction of the statements is not possible: 

These are just examples of some of the phrases in which Nichols specifically invoked 
McVeigh's name. 

The calculus in the instant case is precisely the same as the calculus in Bruton. The jurors 
cannot reasonably be expected to erase this evidence from their minds in consideration of 
the case against Timothy McVeigh. 

It can be anticipated that the Government's position concerning application of Bruton to 
this case remains unchanged from the position the Government took in its Motion in 
Limine (filed February 22, 1996): 


Consistent with the facts and rationale of Bruton, the Tenth Circuit has been careful to 
"limit" Bruton applications to further "clearly inculpatory" comments that are "vitally 
important to the Government's case." (United States v. Hill, 901 F.2d 880, 884 (10th Cir. 
1990) (citing United States v. Espinosa, 771 F.2d 1382, 1399 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
474 U.S. 1023 (1985)). 


See Motion of the United States in Limine Regarding Statements of Terry Nichols' at p. 9 
(D.E. 1003). 

The problem for the Government is that the cases cited do not remove Terry Nichols' 
statements from the compelling logic of Bruton. In United States v. Hill, 901 F.2d 880 
(10th Cir. 1990), the Tenth Circuit reversed the defendant's conviction and remanded the 
case for a new trial because the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had been violated. In 
doing so the court underscored the importance of cross-examination to the defendant: 


We cannot hold Hill responsible for Lux's actions. Indeed, Bruton and its progeny rest in 
part on the premise that collusive behavior cannot be assumed to exist between 
defendants and co-defendants: "Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant 
and to exonerate himself, a co-defendant's statements about what the defendant said or 
did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence." 


Hill, 901 F.2d at 884 (quoting Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530, 541 (1986)). 

United States v. Espinosa, 771 F.2d 1382 (10th Cir. 1985), was decided on the basis that 
the statement at issue was given by a pro se co-defendant during an opening statement. 
The Court ruled that the statement was not evidence, and thus the jury had not been 
instructed to consider the statement as evidence for one purpose, but not for another. In 
addition, the statement was not specific in any way to the declarant's co-defendants: 


In addition, this is not a case where "powerfully incriminating" statements inculpating co-
defendants were introduced into evidence; Foreman's generalized and brief references to a 
"convoy" and "all these people . . . speaking . . . Spanish" do not amount to such 
statements of vital importance to the prosecution's case. 

In the context of this trial, we conclude that the jury was able to limit its consideration to 
only the evidence introduced at trial and to remain uninfluenced by the "incidental 
statements (made in opening argument) during this long trial." Thus no reversible error is 
shown on this point. 


Id. at 1399-1400 (emphasis added).

The Government may also rely upon United States v. Chatman, 994 F.2d 1510 (10th Cir. 
1993). Chatman is distinguishable in that the statement at issue there could be 
successfully redacted: 


We find no Bruton violation because, as Mr. Chatman concedes, Miller's redacted 
statement removed any reference to Chatman or his existence. Chatman argues that 
severance should have been granted nonetheless because he was linked to Miller's 
statement by other evidence admitted at trial. This inferential incrimination argument is 
unavailing where, as here, the jury was properly instructed that Miller's confession was 
not to be considered against any of the other defendants. We find that the requirements of 
Richardson have been met and affirm the District Court's denial of severance. 


Id. at 1513. In the Oklahoma City bombing case, the requirements of Richardson cannot 
be met, because Nichols' statements cannot be redacted to delete all references to 
Timothy McVeigh or his existence. No statement would remain. 

In United States v. Clark, 456 F.2d 1375 (10th Cir. 1972) (relied upon heavily by the 
Government in its Motion in Limine at p. 11), the Court distinguished Bruton because 
both defendants testified and both were subject to cross-examination: 


The facts of the instant case are readily distinguishable from Bruton v. United States, 392 
U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), where neither of two defendants testified 
and the statement made by one defendant to the authorities and introduced as part of the 
Government's case implicated both defendants. Here, McHenry's statement didn't 
incriminate, as such, either himself or Clark. And in any event. both Clark and McHenry 
testified upon trial and each was cross-examined by counsel for the other defendant. 
Accordingly, the rational of Bruton does not entitle Clark and McHenry to separate trials. 


Id. at 1376 (emphasis added).

The common thread that runs through each of these decisions upholding denial of 
severance is that none of them involved a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment 
right to cross-examine the witnesses against him.3/ In each of these cases, that all-
important constitutional right was protected, because the statement was redacted in such a 
way that there was no reference to the defendant's existence, (and thus furnished no 
evidence against the defendant) or the declarant took the stand as a witness on his own 
behalf and was subject to cross-examination by the defendant's counsel. 

While this case may not be precisely like Bruton, nor is it precisely like Richardson. 
Determining which doctrine should apply turns upon an examination of the rights and 
interests at stake. In the circumstances of this case, and given the content of Terry 
Nichols' statements, they simply cannot be admitted at a joint trial in a manner consistent 
with Timothy McVeigh's constitutional right to cross-examination and his right to due 
process. If the statements are admitted at a joint trial, and Timothy McVeigh is convicted, 
the conviction will be based upon a myth: that the jurors were able to compartmentalize 
their thinking and consider evidence against Terry Nichols, but not against Timothy 
McVeigh. 


IV. ANTAGONISTIC DEFENSES REQUIRE SEVERANCE 

A. The legal standard

In Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534 (1993), the United States Supreme Court held 
that Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure leaves the determination of risk 
of prejudice and any remedy that may be necessary to the sound discretion of the district 
courts. Id. at 539. Although the Court declined to adopt a bright line rule mandating 
severance whenever co-defendants have conflicting defenses, the Court clearly 
recognized that there are cases in which severance is mandated. The Court stated: 


We believe that, when defendants properly have been joined under Rule 8(b), a district 
court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial 
would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from 
making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence. Such a risk might occur when 
evidence that the jury should not consider against a defendant and that would not be 
admissible if a defendant were tried alone is admitted against a co-defendant. 


Id. at 539. This case fits squarely within the circumstances outlined in Zafiro. The jury 
will be prevented from making a reliable judgment about Timothy McVeigh's guilt 
because of mutually exclusive defenses. Equally compelling, evidence in the form of 
Terry Nichols' statements will not be admissible if McVeigh is tried alone. See 
Proposition Three, supra pp. 5 - 28. 

Other factors which favor severance include the risk that evidence of Nichols' wrong-
doing erroneously could lead a jury to conclude that Timothy McVeigh is guilty. In a 
complex case such as this, with markedly different degrees of alleged culpability, the risk 
of prejudice is heightened. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. In Zafiro, the Supreme Court stated: 


The risk of prejudice will vary with the facts in each case, and district courts may find 
prejudice in situations not discussed here. When the risk of prejudice is high, a district 
court is more likely to determine that separate trials are necessary, but, as we indicated in 
Richardson v. Marsh, less drastic measures, such as limiting instructions, often will 
suffice to cure any risk of prejudice. See 481 U.S. at 212, 95 L.Ed.2d 176, 107 S.Ct. 
1702. 


Id. In our case, the risk of prejudice through a joint trial is extreme and the futility of less 
drastic measures has been clearly demonstrated. 

Moreover, Zafiro's list of examples of cases warranting severance does not purport to be 
exhaustive. As the Court noted: "The risk of prejudice will vary with the facts of each 
case, and district courts may find prejudice in situations not discussed here." Id. at 539. 

In United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1989), the Tenth Circuit set forth in 
detail the factors that must be established in order to obtain a severance on the grounds of 
antagonistic defenses: 


In determining the merits of a motion to sever, the trial court must "weigh the prejudice 
to a particular defendant caused by joinder against the obviously important considerations 
of economy and expedition and judicial administration." Peterson, 611 F.2d at 1331. It is 
not enough for Rodgers to show that severance would have increased his chances of 
acquittal. Hays, 861 F.2d at 1231-1232. He must make a "strong showing of prejudice." 
United States v. Esch, 832 F.2d 531, 537 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 107 S.Ct. 1299, 
99 L.Ed.2d 509 (1988). He must show that failure to sever resulted in the denial of his 
right to a fair trial. Peterson, 611 F.2d at 1331 (citing United States v. Butler, 494 F.2d 
1246, 1256 (10th Cir. 1974)). 

Severance may be necessary when defenses are "so antagonistic that they are mutually 
exclusive." Esch, 832 F.2d at 538 (citing United States v. Burrell, 720 F.2d 1488, 1492 
(10th Cir. 1983)). A mere conflict of theories or one defendant's attempt to cast blame on 
another does not require severance. United States v. McClure, 734 F.2d 484, 488 (10th 
Cir. 1984). Rather, the conflict between co-defendants "must be so intense that there is a 
danger that the jury will unjustifiably infer from the conflict alone that both defendants 
are guilty." Esch, 832 F.2d 538 (citing United States v. Swingler, 758 F.2d 477, 495 (10th 
Cir. 1985)). The defendant must demonstrate that the acceptance of one party's defense 
would tend to preclude the acquittal of the other, or that the guilt of one defendant tends 
to establish the innocence of the other. United States v. Smith, 788 F.2d 663, 668 (10th 
Cir. 1986). 


881 F.2d at 857 (emphasis added).

In Peveto, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed defendant 
Rodgers' conviction because he had been prejudiced by denial of his motion for a separate 
trial. His co-defendant Hines' defense was that he was in the process of becoming an 
informant and was setting up drug dealers. Hines' defense necessitated a showing that the 
defendant Rodgers was a drug dealer. Thus, in order to acquit Hines the jury necessarily 
would have to convict Rodgers. The Court held: 


As we have noted, when antagonistic defenses are presented, there is a chance that the 
jury will find from conflict the guilt of both parties. Walton, 552 F.2d at 1361. We are 
persuaded that Rodgers made a "strong showing of prejudice," see Esch, 832 F.2d at 537, 
and demonstrated as he must, that he was denied a fair trial. Peterson, 611 F.2d at 1331. 
This is a paradigm case of prejudice. Denial of severance to afford a fair trial was 
prejudicial error. 


Id. 881 F.2d at 858. See also United States v. Dirden, 38 F.3d 1131, 1141 (10th Cir. 
1994) (upholding the principle that severance may be necessary if the defenses are "so 
antagonistic that they are mutually exclusive"). 

In United States v. Tootick, 952 F.2d 1078 (9th Cir. 1991), the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit catalogued the prejudicial effects created by antagonistic 
defenses: 


1. Defendants who accuse each other bring the effect of a second prosecutor into the case 
with respect to their co-defendant; 

2. Cross-examination of the Government's witnesses becomes an opportunity to 
emphasize the exclusive guilt of the other defendant; 

3. Joinder can provide the individual defendants with the "perverse" incentive not simply 
to demonstrate their own innocence, but to do everything possible to convict their co-
defendants; 

4. Joinder in these cases can make a complex case seem simple to the jury: convict them 
both; and 

5. While each defendant's claims contradict each other, each claim individually acts to 
reinforce the Government's case. 

In granting relief, the Court concluded: 

After carefully reviewing the transcript, we find that the joint trial of Frank and Tootick 
resulted in reversible prejudice with respect to each defendant. The jury could not have 
been able to assess the guilt or innocence of the defendants on an individual and 
independent basis. 


Tootick, 952 F.2d at 1082-83. The defenses in the Oklahoma City bombing case are 
almost certain to be mutually and virulently antagonistic, and acceptance of one will 
require rejection of the other. 


B. Factual demonstration of antagonistic defenses 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


V. INTRODUCTION TO ARGUMENTS THAT MR. MCVEIGH IS ENTITLED TO A 
SEVERANCE DUE TO THE POTENTIAL CAPITAL SENTENCING PROCEEDING 

In the remainder of this motion, Mr. McVeigh will present the reasons why he and Mr. 
Nichols must be severed in this case because there is the potential for a capital sentencing 
proceeding. In making these arguments, we urge the Court not to read anything "between 
the lines" of what we are doing. We concede nothing about guilt, and we do not believe 
there will be a capital sentencing proceeding involving Mr. McVeigh. 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


Nothwithstanding[sic] our assessment of the evidence, we are also mindful, that in light 
of the magnitude of the offense and the pervasive pretrial publicity that has saturated the 
public with a demonized and presumptively guilty image of Mr. McVeigh, he may be 
convicted. To acknowledge this is not to acknowledge guilt, but to acknowledge reality. 
Accordingly, we have a professional obligation to plan for, prepare for, and advocate Mr. 
McVeigh's rights with respect to, any eventual penalty proceeding. 

All of the arguments that follow are based on these premises. As unlikely as we think a 
conviction may be, we must address the possibility of a sentencing proceeding and the 
reasons why a severance must be granted with respect to sentencing. In this context, we 
turn now to an examination of the law concerning mitigating circumstances and why a 
severance is necessary to ensure that the jury gives the kind of consideration to this 
evidence that the Constitution requires. 


VI. SEVERANCE IS REQUIRED TO PROTECT MR. MCVEIGH'S EIGHTH 
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION OF HIS 
SENTENCE 

A. The contours of the right that will be vitiated by a joint trial 

One of the Eighth Amendment pillars on which modern death penalty jurisprudence rests 
is that the sentencing decision in a capital case must be individualized, based upon the 
character and record of the offender and the circumstances of the particular offense. As 
Justice Stewart wrote for a plurality in Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976): 


A process that accords no significance to relevant facets of the character and record of the 
individual offender . . . treats all persons convicted of a designated offense not as 
uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to 
be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death. . . . 


Id. at 304. Two years later, the Court reiterated this principle in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 
586, 605 (1978), the foundational case concerning the constitutional requirements for the 
consideration of mitigating circumstances: 


Given that the imposition of death by public authority is so profoundly different from all 
other penalties, we cannot avoid the conclusion that an individualized decision is 
essential in capital cases. The need for treating each defendant in capital cases with that 
degree of respect due the uniqueness of the individual is far more important than in 
noncapital cases. . . . 


See also, Tuilaepa v. California, U.S. , 129 L.Ed.2d 750, 759-760, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 2635 
(1994) (tracing the requirement that the capital sentencing decision be individualized). 

The process of individualized sentencing requires more than simply finding the facts 
concerning the character and record of the accused and the circumstances of the offense. 
In addition, "the sentence imposed at the penalty stage should reflect a reasoned moral 
response to the defendant's background, character, and crime. . . ." California v. Brown, 
479 U.S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). As Justice 
Stevens explained in Sawyer v. Whitley, U.S. _ , 120 L.Ed.2d 269, 300, 112 S.Ct. 2584 
(1992) (dissenting on another ground), "[T]he choice between life imprisonment and 
capital punishment is both a question of underlying fact and a matter of reasoned moral 
judgment." 

The "reasoned moral judgment" that must be made requires an assessment of the 
individual culpability of a capital defendant. "Underlying Lockett . . . is the principle that 
punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal 
defendant." Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (incorporating the concurring 
opinion of Justice O'Connor in California v. Brown, supra). Thus, "the individualized 
assessment of the appropriateness of the death penalty is a moral inquiry into the 
culpability of the defendant." California v. Brown, 479 U.S. at 545. 

The requirement that capital sentencing be individualized means that in a case involving 
more than one offender, each offender's culpability must be determined individually. 
Thus, in explaining the right of a getaway car driver to individualized sentencing in a 
capital prosecution in which his two codefendants actually committed the robbery and 
murder, the Court said, 


The focus must be on his culpability, not on that of those who committed the robbery and 
shot the victims, for we insist on "individualized consideration as a constitutional 
requirement in imposing the death sentence," Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605, which 
means that we must focus on "relevant facets of the character and record of the individual 
offender." 


Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 798 (1982) (emphasis in original). 

Finally, the right to individualized sentencing involves the right of the defendant to 
present and have fully considered any aspect of his character and record and the 
circumstances of the offense upon which any juror might base a sentence less than death. 
Unlike the guilt phase of a capital trial where the "'central issue'" is "'whether the State 
has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty 
of a capital crime,'" California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 1008 (1988), the penalty phase of 
a capital trial calls for a far-reaching evaluation of a broad array of facts and the making 
of a moral judgment about the "life-or-death-worthiness" of an individual on the basis of 
that evaluation. As the Court explained in Ramos, 


In fixing a penalty, . . . there is no similar "central issue." . . . Once the jury finds that the 
defendant falls within the legislatively defined category of persons eligible for the death 
penalty, as did respondent's jury in determining the truth of the alleged special 
circumstance, the jury then is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether 
death is the appropriate punishment. In this sense, the jury's choice between life and death 
must be individualized. . . . 


Id.     See also, Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 902 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring) 
("[capital] sentencing decisions rest on a far-reaching inquiry into countless facts and 
circumstances and not on the type of proof of particular elements that returning a 
conviction does"). 

While this "far-reaching inquiry" plays an important role in assuring that the sentencing 
decision is individualized, it also opens the door to the problems inherent in a joint 
sentencing proceeding. As we show in the next section of our argument, these problems 
present a serious risk of destroying the right to an individualized sentencing 
determination and, for that reason, call for a severance. 


B. There are two ways in which a joint sentencing Proceeding will compromise Mr. 
McVeigh's right to an individualized sentencing determination 

1. The tendency of a jury to blend and compare the moral culpability of codefendants 
instead of assessing individual culpability 

Mr. McVeigh's right to have "[t]he focus . . . be on his culpability, not on that of [his 
codefendant]," Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. at 798, cannot be assured if the same jury 
examines Mr. Nichols' moral culpability. When the same jury examines the moral 
culpability of two or more people in the same trial, there is an inherent and grave risk that 
the jury's examination of each person's culpability will influence its assessment of the 
others' culpability. This can happen in one of two ways. 

Like Dante's lizard and fellow soul, capital codefendants being sentenced by the same 
jury "fuse[] like hot wax, and their colors r[u]n together until neither . . . appeared what 
he had been when he began. . . ." The Inferno, supra. In their blending together, and each 
taking on some of the qualities of the other, there is a risk that the negative aspects of one 
defendant's character may cause the jury to see similar qualities in the other defendant, 
even though those qualities are not there or are far less important in assessing the moral 
culpability of the other defendant. This process of distortion would not arise but for the 
blending that occurs when two different people are examined together. 

The other way in which the examination of the moral culpability of two defendants in the 
same trial impairs the jury's ability to make individualized sentencing determinations is 
that such a process of examination invariably leads to a comparison between the two 
defendants. Because of this, there is a tendency in a joint sentencing proceeding for the 
jury to determine the moral culpability of each defendant on the basis of such a 
comparison, rather than on the basis of "a far-reaching inquiry into [the] countless facts 
and circumstances," Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. at 902, of the life of each codefendant 
independent of the other. 

The risk that the jury will determine Mr. McVeigh's sentence on the basis of both 
blending and comparing him with Mr. Nichols is greater here for two reasons. 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


There is also an added reason for the jury to engage in comparative, rather than 
individualized, sentencing should there be a joint sentencing proceeding in this case. One 
aspect of the mitigation that the jury will consider will require a comparison of the two 
codefendants in one respect. The federal death penalty statute requires that "relatively 
minor" participation in an "offense . . . committed by another," be considered as a 
mitigating factor. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3592 (a)(3).[4/] Under the Eighth Amendment, see 
Enmund v. Florida, supra; Lockett v. Ohio, supra, and under the catch-all mitigation 
provision of the federal death penalty statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3592(a)(8), however, any 
showing that one offender's role in the crime is less blameworthy than another's must be 
considered in mitigation. 

If the jury convicts both Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols, they are thus likely to be called 
upon to determine whether one played a more blameworthy role in the crime than the 
other. This is the only comparative analysis permitted under the principles of 
individualized sentencing, but if it comes into play, it will exacerbate the pre-existing 
tendency to make an overall comparative judgment about each defendant's individual 
moral culpability. 


2. The emergence of mutually antagonistic penalty phase defenses that tend to divert the 
jury from any individualized assessment of moral culpability 

The analysis that must be made of Mr. McVeigh's and Mr. Nichols' relative degrees of 
blameworthiness for their perceived participation in the crime also gives rise to the 
second major way in which a joint sentencing proceeding jeopardizes the right to an 
individualized sentencing determination. Since the blameworthiness analysis calls for 
each codefendant to show, if he can, that the other played a more blameworthy role in the 
crime, it can readily become the basis for the assertion of "mutually antagonistic 
defenses." 

As we noted in part IV of this motion, in Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534 (1993), 
the Court recognized that the assertion of mutually antagonistic defenses may, in some 
cases, require severance. One such case is where "there is a serious risk that a joint trial 
would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants . . . ." Id. at 539. Mr. 
McVeigh's and Mr. Nichols' competing efforts to persuade the jury to find that the other 
played the more blameworthy role in the offense will compromise their Eighth 
Amendment right to an individualized sentencing hearing. 

The Tenth Circuit has set out in United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d at 857, the factors that 
must be present to require severance on the grounds of mutually antagonistic defenses: 


Severance may be necessary when defenses are "so antagonistic that they are mutually 
exclusive." Esch, 832 F.2d at 538 (citing United States v. Burrell, 720 F.2d 1488, 1492 
(10th Cir. 1983)). A mere conflict of theories or one defendant's attempt to cast blame on 
another does not require severance. United States v. McClure, 734 F.2d 484, 488 (10th 
Cir. 1984). Rather, the conflict between co-defendants "must be so intense that there is a 
danger that the jury will unjustifiably infer from the conflict alone that both defendants 
are guilty." Esch, 832 F.2d 538 (citing United States v. Swingler, 758 F.2d 477, 495 (10th 
Cir. 1985)). The defendant must demonstrate that the acceptance of one party's defense 
would tend to preclude the acquittal of the other, or that the guilt of one defendant tends 
to establish the innocence of the other. United States v. Smith, 788 F.2d 663, 668 (10th 
Cir. 1986). 


Applying these factors in the context of a capital sentencing, it is readily apparent that 
one of the factors -- "one defendant's attempt to cast blame on another does not require 
severance," Id. (citing United States v. McClure, 734 F.2d at 488) -- cannot govern the 
severance analysis for purposes of a capital sentencing proceeding. In a noncapital trial or 
in the guilt-innocence phase of a capital trial, relative degrees of blameworthiness for 
participation in the crime do not provide defenses. Thus, in such a proceeding the attempt 
to shift blame to a codefendant cannot produce mutually antagonistic "defenses." 
However, as we have already noted, in a capital sentencing proceeding relative degrees of 
blameworthiness do provide defenses. In a codefendant case, which codefendant is more 
blameworthy is a central part of the inquiry into culpability. Thus, in a capital sentencing 
proceeding, "one defendant's attempt to cast blame on another," Peveto, may be the entire 
defense against the death penalty. 

If each codefendant tries to shift the blame to the other, there are, by definition, mutually 
antagonistic defenses. Modifying the Tenth Circuit's definition of such defenses to fit a 
capital sentencing proceeding, "the acceptance of one party's defense would tend to 
preclude . . . [a life sentence for] the other, or . . . the [greater culpability] of one 
defendant tends to establish the [lesser culpability] of the other." United States v. Peveto, 
881 F.2d at 857. 

The incentive for codefendants to prosecute each other in these circumstances is great, 
because this mitigating circumstance provides a powerful plea for a sentence less than 
death. In other cases, it has led to life sentences for people who were deeply involved in 
the capital offense but were nevertheless deemed relatively less blameworthy. See, e.a., 
State v. Black, 816 S.W.2d 350 (Tex.Crim.App. 1991) (triggerman hired by the defendant 
to kill the defendant's wife received a life sentence, despite his having committed two 
previous murders, while defendant was sentenced to death); Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 
Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984) (in separate trials, accomplice to murder was sentenced to 
death, while triggerman was sentenced to life). 

The antagonism created by these two defenses is "'so intense that there is a danger that 
the jury will unjustifiably infer from the conflict alone that both defendants are [equally 
culpable].'" United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d at 857. 

In asserting the competing theories of culpability, counsel for Mr. McVeigh and Mr. 
Nichols will each have to become second prosecutors of the other. All of the dangers 
associated with this, eloquently set out as a warning to all in United States v. Tootick, 
952 F.2d at 1082-83, will come to pass. In every respect possible, counsel for Mr. 
McVeigh and Mr. Nichols will join forces with the prosecutor to make the other look as 
culpable as possible. Indeed, the prosecution could simply take a seat during this aspect 
of the case, as the emperors of Rome did in ancient times, and let the two gladiators 
attempt to slay each other. 

Such a perverse process would destroy the right to individualized sentencing 
determinations for both defendants. Rather than sifting through the evidence and making 
a judgment rooted in the evidence, the jury could well decide that the very intensity of the 
conflict between the two defense theories means that they cannot credit either version and 
that both defendants deserve to die because of the worst-case scenarios painted about 
each other. See United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d at 857.[5/] 


3. Assessing the prejudice to Mr. McVeigh that will flow from a joint sentencing 
proceeding 

It is one thing to describe through abstract legal principles the prejudice that Mr. 
McVeigh will suffer if he remains joined with Mr. Nichols for sentencing -- as we have in 
the preceding sections. It is quite another to see the actual prejudice. In sections C and D, 
we examine the factual context in which Mr. McVeigh's Eighth Amendment rights will 
be compromised. Because these sections contain material highly revelatory of defense 
strategy and defense work product, we have asked that they, like section IV(B), be filed 
and reviewed ex parse. 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


VII. A CONFLICT BETWEEN FIFTH AMENDMENT AND EIGHTH AMENDMENT 
RIGHTS OF THE CODEFENDANTS REQUIRES A SEVERANCE 


(THIS PORTION REDACTED)


VIII. A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RIGHT NOT TO DISCLOSE PENALTY PHASE 
EVIDENCE UNTIL TRIAL AND THE DUE PROCESS RIGHT OF REBUTTAL 
REQUIRES A SEVERANCE 

The inevitably comparative nature of joint capital sentencing proceedings also tears at the 
fabric of elemental due process. Due ,process is violated when a defendant is sentenced to 
death "on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain." 
Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 362 (1977). Moreover, a capital defendant is entitled to 
fair notice of the facts used to support a death sentence, Id., and the issues which he is 
expected to meet during the penalty phase. Lankford v. Idaho, 111 S.Ct. 1723 (1991). 

The constitutional rights to fair notice and full rebuttal have been codified by Congress. 
See 18 U.s.c. Sec. 3593 (before trial the government must notify defendant of intention to 
seek the death penalty and must reveal to the defendant the factors which the government 
proposes to prove to justify a death sentence). However, no such notice provisions exist 
to ensure that a capital codefendant will have a fair opportunity to investigate and rebut 
the harmful information placed before a sentencing jury by his codefendant. Thus, joint 
capital sentencing runs the grave risk that extremely damaging evidence from 
codefendants will be injected into the decision-making process without having been 
subjected to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing. Our system of justice, of 
course, relies upon the adversarial testing process "to produce a just result under the 
standards governing decision." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). 

Defendants on trial for their lives face a "perverse incentive." United States v. Tootick, 
952 F.2d 1078, 1082-83 (9th Cir. 1991). Because joint capital sentencing is comparative 
both by nature and by statutory design, each defendant is encouraged not only to offer 
evidence which mitigates punishment as to him, but also to offer evidence designed to 
aggravate punishment as to his codefendant. And, of course, codefendants are not 
constrained by the rules of prosecutorial ethics which are designed to constrain the 
adversarial zeal of government attorneys. See Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 
(1935). 

The prospect of codefendants, mercilessly shredding each other with damning 
information, accusations and innuendo during a joint sentencing hearing confers on the 
prosecution an unwarranted and unfair advantage. Commonwealth v. Foster, 827 S.W.2d 
670, 680-82 (Ky. 1991) (reversing a death sentence imposed at a joint penalty phase 
hearing where codefendant's counsel "act[ed] as a second prosecutor" in pursuing claim 
of duress, and supported his client's case in mitigation by prejudicial allegations 
concerning the codefendant). 

For these reasons, Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols must be severed should they both be 
convicted of capital crimes. 


IX. CONCLUSION

The issues raised by this motion are of enormous significance and go to the heart of the 
fairness and reliability of both phases of the trial. Separate trials will ensure fairness to all 
parties and reliability of verdicts and, if necessary, sentencing determinations. In its 
response to Mr. McVeigh's motion, the Government will be able to cite for the Court 
countless federal cases in which severance has been denied. Those cases are distinctly 
different because they did not require violation of the Sixth Amendment right to 
confrontation, and they were not capital prosecutions. (Please see the affidavit of Kevin 
McNally attached hereto as Exhibit "LLL" demonstrating the frequency of severance in 
federal capital cases.) 

Although on occasion other courts have employed multiple juries during a unitary trial or 
have severed defendants during the penalty phase only, we believe these remedies are 
wholly inadequate to address the problems described above. Because we do not seek 
these particular remedies, we have not addressed them in this motion. Nonetheless, if the 
Court is inclined to consider such remedies, we respectfully request the opportunity to be 
heard. 

Timothy McVeigh simply requests that the jury that determines his case do so on the 
basis of evidence that is admissible against him. He asks for a factual determination based 
upon a firmer foundation than the hope that jurors are able to ignore that which they have 
heard. He prays for a verdict of intellectual honesty.

ENDNOTES

1/ As one commentator observed, "The courts love limiting instructions, clinging to the 
nonsense that, like electro-shock, they erase selective collops of the jurors' brains. They 
love the word 'compartmentalize,' ignoring that the Titanic was compartmentalized too -- 
up to the water line." James R. Lucas, "Criminal Joinder and Severance," Inter Alia at 20 
(Jan. 1992). 

2/ As Richardson suggests, when there are two or more defendants it may be possible to 
eliminate all reference to a third defendant from a statement of one of the remaining two. 
However, when there are only two defendants, the excision of references to the other is 
not practical. Redaction is impossible when, as here, the one who made the statement is 
speaking mainly about the other (as Terry Nichols clearly was doing). Because there are 
only two defendants in our case, the jury easily will infer who Terry Nichols was talking 
about: Tim McVeigh. 

3/ This Court has previously recognized that the right to cross-examine one's accuser "is a 
vital and indispensable part of the right to trial." Also "when the declarant on the same 
occasion makes both inculpatory and exculpatory statements, the opportunity to cross-
examine becomes an imperative both under the Sixth Amendment and for the 
fundamental fairness necessary for due process of law." (Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, at pp. 63, 65 (D.E. 1850). 

4/ Sec. 3592(a)(3) provides as follows:

(3) Minor participation. -- The defendant is punishable as a principal in the offense, 
which was committed by another, but the defendant's participation was relatively minor, 
regardless of whether the participation was so minor as to constitute a defense to the 
charge. 

5/ In addition, the intensity of this conflict would tend to relieve the prosecution of its 
burden to show that the defendants should be sentenced to death, because it would create 
the risk that "'the jury will unjustifiably infer from the conflict alone that both defendants 
are [equally culpable].'" Peveto. Thus, rather than having to show that both defendants are 
equally culpable, and thus equally deserving of the death penalty, the Government could 
let the mere intensity of the conflict between the defendants carry its burden.

<P>Oklahoma City bombing defendant Terry Nichols is arguing that his trial should be 
separated from that of his codefendant, Timothy McVeigh. In this brief filed September 
5, 1996, portions of which are blacked out per the court's order not to reveal evidence, 
Nichols contends that he and McVeigh have antagonistic defenses -- to prove their 
innocence, each one must blame the other -- so trying them together will aid the 
prosecution. Nichols also proffers a novel argument: The jury in this death penalty trial 
will not be able to distinguish his case from McVeigh's, thus violating their 8th 
Amendment right to individualized sentencing.</P>

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 
Table of Authorities 
 
Motion for Severance and Prayer for Relief 
 
Statement of Relevant Facts 
 
Introduction and Summary of Argument 
 
I.  Severance should be granted at the guilt phase 
 
A.  Mr. Nichols is entitled to severance as a matter of 
law under the traditional test of Rule 14 
 
1. Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's defenses are so 
antagonistic that 
they cannot receive a fair trial if tried together 
 
a. Mr. Nichols must prove that Mr. McVeigh is guilty 
to make his own 
defense 
 
b. The mutually antagonistic defenses will violate 
Mr. Nichols' right to make a case for a lesser included 
offense 
 
2. Severance should be granted because highly 
prejudicial evidence that is inadmissible against Mr. 
Nichols is likely to be admitted against Mr. McVeigh 
 
a. Extremely prejudicial statements by Mr. McVeigh 
[TEXT REDACTED] for violence that are inadmissible against 
Mr. Nichols will be introduced against Mr. McVeigh to prove 
his motive for the bombing 
 
b. Other highly prejudicial evidence linking Mr. 
McVeigh [TEXT REDACTED] none of which is admissible against 
Mr. Nichols, will be introduced against Mr. McVeigh 
 
3. Severance should be granted because the horrendous 
nature of the crime, when combined with the very different 
levels of culpability alleged of Mr. Nichols and Mr. 
McVeigh and the evidence of Mr. Nichols' unpopular but 
protected political views, creates a tremendous risk of 
jury confusion and guilt by mere association 
 
4. Certain statements made by Mr. McVeigh claiming that 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
5. Trying Mr. Nichols separately from Mr. McVeigh poses 
minimal inconvenience to the government and no risk of 
"inconsistent verdicts" 
 
6. Bruton v. United States bars the use of the parts of 
Mr. Nichols' statement the government seeks to introduce at 
a joint trial, and, alternatively, there are irresolvable 
conflicts between Mr. Nichols' right to introduce other 
parts of the statement and Mr. McVeigh's confrontation 
rights 
 
a. Bruton bars the use of the parts of Mr. Nichols' 
statement the government seeks to introduce at a joint 
trial 
 
b. Mr. Nichols is entitled to introduce other parts 
of the April 21, 1995 statement that inculpate Mr. McVeigh 
to assure that the meaning of the statements is not 
distorted and that exculpatory information in the statement 
is not kept from the jury 
 
c. Mr. Nichols is constitutionally entitled to 
introduce other parts of the April 21, 1995 statement that 
inculpate Mr. McVeigh in order to demonstrate the 
circumstances in which the statement was given and the 
credibility of the statements to be introduced 
 
7. To the extent severance is granted at the penalty 
phase, severance at the guilt phase is required as well 
 
B. Special considerations unique to capital cases require 
heightened scrutiny of a capital defendant's motion for 
severance 
 
1. In a capital case, Rule 14 should be construed in 
pari materia with the Eighth Amendment's requirements of 
individualized consideration and heightened reliability in 
factfinding and verdicts 
a. The Eighth Amendment requires "individualized 
consideration" and "heightened reliability of factfinding" 
in a capital case 
 
b. The "individualized consideration" and "heightened 
reliability of factfinding" requirements apply to the guilt 
phase of a capital trial 
 
2. Because of the different purposes of the guilt and 
penalty phases of a capital trial, there is a substantial 
risk that evidence and arguments legitimately introduced at 
the guilt phase may be prejudicial and inadmissible in the 
penalty phase, and the danger that the jury will consider 
this improper evidence and argument at the penalty phase 
cannot be cured by limiting instructions 
 
3. Rule 14 should be construed strictly in favor of a 
capital defendant seeking severance 
 
a. Joint trial of capital defendants seriously risks 
the ability of the jury to give each defendant 
individualized consideration and make reliable judgments 
about guilt or innocence, and limiting instructions cannot 
be relied upon to cure the risk of prejudice 
 
(1) The presumption that limiting instructions cure 
the prejudice associated with joint trials has long been 
questioned even in noncapital cases 
 
(2) Reliance on limiting instructions to cure 
potential prejudice frustrates the appellate review of 
capital verdicts required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3595 and the 
Eighth Amendment 
 
(3) State courts' experience with capital trials 
supports heightened scrutiny of joint capital trials 
 
b. The burden should be on the government to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that joint trial of a capital 
defendant will not "compromise a specific trial right of 
one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a 
reliable judgment about guilt or innocence" 
 
c. In the alternative, even if the burden is not 
placed on the government, the Court should exercise its 
discretion with particular caution to ensure that a capital 
defendant's trial rights are not compromised and that the 
jury will be capable of making a truly reliable judgment 
about guilt or innocence in a joint trial 
 
C. In the circumstances of this case a joint trial would 
violate Mr. Nichols' Eighth Amendment rights 
 
D. In the alternative, the Court should empanel dual 
juries to hear each defendant's case individually 
 
II. In the alternative, severance should be granted at the 
penalty phase 
A. A joint penalty phase would violate Mr. Nichols' 
Eighth Amendment rights 
 
1. The defendants' mutually antagonistic penalty phase 
defenses make a fair joint penalty phase an impossibility 
 
2. The defendants' antagonistic defenses create a 
conflict between each defendant's due process rights to 
notice and a meaningful opportunity to rebut the 
information used to sentence him to death and the other's 
right not to disclose his penalty phase strategy to their 
adversaries until trial 
 
3. There is a serious risk that there will be a 
prejudicial conflict between Mr. Nichols' and Mr. McVeigh's 
theories of mitigation 
 
4. There is an irresolvable conflict between the 
defendants' right to argue the Sec. 3592(a)(3) and (a)(4) 
mitigation factors and their Eighth Amendment right to 
individualized consideration 
 
5. Mr. McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights will 
conflict with Mr. Nichols' Eighth Amendment rights at a 
joint penalty hearing 
 
6. There is a serious risk that Mr. Nichols' and Mr. 
McVeigh's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 
will conflict with the other defendant's Eighth Amendment 
and allocution rights 
 
7. The evidence linking Mr. McVeigh to [TEXT REDACTED] 
will have an extremely prejudicial effect on Mr. Nichols' 
ability to receive a fair and 
individualized penalty hearing 
 
B. Seriatim penalty phases before the same jury will not 
cure the constitutional flaws

MOTION OF DEFENDANT TERRY LYNN NICHOLS FOR SEVERANCE AT THE 
GUILT AND PENALTY PHASES OF TRIAL AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN 
SUPPORT THEREOF 
 
Defendant Terry Lynn Nichols moves pursuant to Rule 14, 
Fed. R. Crim. P., for severance of his case from that of 
codefendant McVeigh at the guilt phase of trial. In the 
event of convictions after separate trials at the guilt 
phase, the defendants would also receive separate death 
penalty hearings under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593 because Sec. 
3593(b)(1) requires that the penalty hearing be conducted 
"before the jury that determined the defendant's guilt." If 
full severance at the guilt phase is denied, Mr. Nichols 
requests in the alternative that the Court empanel dual 
juries to hear the cases simultaneously, except when 
evidence admissible against only one defendant is being 
presented. (Point I, infra.) 
 
In the alternative, if the Court denies the motion to sever 
at the guilt phase, Mr. Nichols moves that any death 
penalty hearing under Sec. 3593 in his case be conducted 
separately and before a different jury than the jury that 
sits in any penalty hearing in the case of Mr. McVeigh. 
(Point II, infra.) 
 
Mr. Nichols also requests that an evidentiary hearing be 
held in connection with this motion, at which he will 
present the expert testimony of Professor Edward J. 
Bronson, Bryan Stevenson, and David D. Wymore on the 
subjects of the prejudicial impact of joint trials on 
capital defendants' rights and the efficacy of limiting 
instructions in curing this prejudice. The qualifications 
of these witnesses and summaries of their testimony are 
attached hereto as Exhibits A, B and C. 
 
 
Statement of Relevant Facts 
 
The facts relevant to the instant motion fall into six 
categories that are relevant to various legal arguments 
made below. These are: 
 
 
(1) The evidence against Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh 
(relevant to the far greater quantity and quality of 
evidence against Mr. McVeigh as against Mr. Nichols; to the 
significantly lesser culpability for the crime that the 
government can prove against Mr. Nichols even if the jury 
accepts all of its evidence and arguments; to the defenses 
that will realistically be available to the defendants at 
trial for purposes of demonstrating the existence of mutual 
antagonism; and to the inconvenience to the Court, the jury 
and the government posed by separate trials); 
 
(2) Extremely prejudicial written statements by Mr. McVeigh 
that are inadmissible as to Mr. Nichols (relevant to show 
spillover prejudice at a joint trial and the likelihood of 
jury confusion); 
 
(3) Written statements by Mr. Nichols included for 
comparison to the written statements of Mr. McVeigh 
(relevant to show spillover prejudice at a joint trial and 
the likelihood of jury confusion); 
 
(4) Certain statements of Michael and Lori Fortier strongly 
inculpating Mr. McVeigh (relevant to demonstrating the far 
greater quantity and quality of evidence against Mr. 
McVeigh as against Mr. Nichols; and the significantly 
lesser culpability for the crime that the government can 
prove against Mr. Nichols even if the jury accepts all of 
its evidence and arguments); 
 
(5) Other statements of Michael and Lori Fortier that 
exculpate Mr. Nichols (relevant to showing that certain 
statements by Mr. McVeigh to Michael Fortier about Mr. 
Nichols' alleged role in the conspiracy will not be 
admissible against Mr. Nichols); 
 
(6) Other highly prejudicial evidence admissible against 
Mr. McVeigh but not Mr. Nichols (also relevant to show 
spillover prejudice at a joint trial and the likelihood of 
jury confusion); and 
 
(7) Exculpatory evidence as to Mr. Nichols that would face 
greater barriers to admissibility in a joint trial than in 
a separate trial. 
 
 
Extensive1/ statements of these facts are set forth in the 
appendices filed with this motion. 
 
Appendix 1 lists in dual column format, by date, much of 
the evidence that we expect will be admitted against each 
defendant in the government's cases.2/ Appendix 2 sets 
forth a number of written statements that will be proved to 
have been made by Mr. McVeigh, none of which are admissible 
against Mr. Nichols and all of which threaten to prejudice 
the case against him. Appendix 3 sets forth three documents 
alleged to have been written or executed by Mr. Nichols, 
which we include for purposes of comparison to Mr. 
McVeigh's written statements. Appendix 4 contains 
statements by Michael and Lori Fortier that strongly 
inculpate Mr. McVeigh (summaries of FBI 302s, excerpts of 
other 302s, and a newspaper report of grand jury 
testimony). Appendix 5 contains excerpts of grand jury 
testimony from Michael and Lori Fortier that strongly 
exculpate Mr. Nichols. Appendix 6 summarizes other evidence 
related to Mr. McVeigh's motives and character, apart from 
his written statements, that will be extremely prejudicial 
to Mr. Nichols. Because these documents contain or 
summarize confidential discovery material we have filed 
them under seal. (We have also filed a redacted version of 
this brief in the public file that omits specific 
references to discovery material.) We summarize these 
materials in the following sections.)3/ 
 
 
The very different cases against Mr. McVeigh and against 
Mr. Nichols 
 
The cases against Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols differ 
dramatically in every relevant respect: the quantity and 
quality of the evidence against each; the degree of 
culpability for the crime demonstrated. and the character 
of each defendant for sentencing purposes. These 
differences seriously threaten Mr. Nichols' ability to 
receive a fair trial if he is tried jointly with Mr. 
McVeigh. 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
Finally, the difference in the two cases means that the 
individual defenses and trials of the two defendants will 
be almost entirely different. Mr. McVeigh must and will 
contest the evidence linking him to the bombing, including 
much of the forensic tests and procedures, the nature of 
the bomb used, and the validity of the eye-witness 
identifications, while Mr. Nichols will contest the linkage 
of himself with Mr. McVeigh -- the government's main 
incriminating evidence against him. The two defendants will 
be concerned with different government witnesses and will 
call different witnesses on very different issues in their 
own defense. Thus, as we explain in Section I.A.5., infra, 
separate trials will pose minimal inconvenience to the 
Court and government. 
 
 
Extremely prejudicial statements by Mr. McVeigh 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
These statements are highly significant because they are 
both inadmissible against and highly prejudicial to Mr. 
Nichols, yet are likely to be used against Mr. McVeigh. See 
Section 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
 
Exculpatory statements by Michael and Lori Fortier 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
Apart from its intrinsic exculpatory value, this evidence 
has special significance for the severance issue insofar as 
it suggests that, even assuming arguendo his initial 
participation in the conspiracy, Mr. Nichols had withdrawn 
by December 1994. As we explain in Section I.A.4., infra' 
among the consequences of withdrawal are the 
inadmissibility of co-conspirator statements made after the 
date of withdrawal. Since Mr. McVeigh apparently discussed 
Mr. Nichols with Mr. Fortier after the date that McVeigh 
complained that he had withdrawn, these statements may pose 
a separate Bruton problem for the government requiring 
severance if it wishes to use them against Mr. McVeigh. 
 
 
Other prejudicial evidence linking Mr. McVeigh to [TEXT 
REDACTED] 
 
 
Exculpatory evidence as to Mr. Nichols that may be 
inadmissible at a joint trial 
 
An additional category of evidence relevant to severance is 
those parts of the statements given by Mr. Nichols on April 
21 and 22, 1995, that the government will not seek to 
introduce in its case against Mr. McVeigh. These omitted 
parts exculpate Mr. Nichols by declaring his innocence and 
inculpate Mr. McVeigh by casting further suspicion on him. 
As we explain in Sections I.A.6.b. and c., infra, there is 
an irresolvable conflict between Mr. Nichols' right to 
introduce these omitted parts to clarify the meaning of the 
statements introduced by the government and to assure that 
exculpatory evidence is not excluded, and Mr. McVeigh's 
Confrontation Clause rights, Accordingly, either Mr. 
Nichols' right to introduce exculpatory evidence in his own 
defense will be violated at a joint trial or Mr. McVeigh 
will be denied his right to cross-examine the witnesses 
against him. See id. 
 
 
Introduction and Summary of Argument 
 
The ordinary severance motion in the ordinary case faces an 
uphill battle. See generally 1 Wright & Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure: Criminal 2d Sec. 223 (1982) 
(discussing cases); but see e.g. United States v. Peveto, 
881 F.2d 844, 856-58 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 
943 (1989) (reversing for failure to sever an alleged 
co-coconspirator at trial). Neither this case nor this 
motion are ordinary: first, because here severance is 
mandated as a matter of law, and second, because the case 
concerns a defendant whom the government is seeking to 
execute. 
 
In United States v. Marchant, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 480 
(1827), the Supreme Court, per Justice Story, ruled that 
two defendants charged jointly with a capital crime do not 
have an automatic right to severance; rather, the decision 
whether to sever was "a matter of sound discretion, to be 
exercised by the Court with all due regard and tenderness 
to the prisoners, according to the known humanity of our 
criminal jurisprudence." Id., at 485. Of course, much has 
changed in the "known humanity of our criminal 
jurisprudence" since 1827, particularly since the Court in 
Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), began to define the 
precise nature of the "due regard and tenderness" that must 
be accorded to capital defendants under the Eighth 
Amendment. 
 
But long before Furman was decided, even under Marchant's 
rule of discretion -- the fount of all subsequent severance 
jurisprudence and the forbear of Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 -- it 
was already clear that the many prejudices inherent in a 
joint prosecution could not be tolerated to the same degree 
in a trial of joined capital defendants that it could in a 
joint noncapital trial. As one federal judge explained in 
1843: 
 
 
In a capital case, and in favor of life, I am disposed to 
secure every protection to the prisoner against the 
influence of testimony not strictly applicable to him, and 
shall therefore order trial of the [capital] prisoner 
Brown, on his plea, to be separated from that of his 
associates. This decision is to be limited in its effect to 
the particular case as presented, and is not to seem as a 
rule in respect to the other indictment, much less in 
regard to ordinary felonies and misdemeanors. United States 
v. Matthews, 26 F.Cas. 1205, 1206 (C.C. S.D.N.Y. 1843) 
(Betts, J.). 
 
 
As Justice Story himself recognized, the phrase "in favor 
of life," sometimes rendered in the Latin "in favorem 
vitae," was a mainstay of capital criminal procedure in the 
18th and 19th Centuries, see United States v. Smith, 2 
Mason 143, 27 F.Cas. 1167, 1169 (No. 16,338) (C.C. Mass. 
1820) (Story, J., in circuit) (recognizing the need for 
stricter adherence to the formal requirements of indictment 
pleading in capital cases); see generally Hall, "Strict or 
Liberal Construction of Penal Statutes." 48 Harv. L. Rev. 
748, 751 (1935) (in favorem vitae the source of the 
doctrine of strict construction of criminal statutes); 
Jeffries, "Legality, Vagueness. and the Construction of 
Penal Statutes," 71 Va. L. Rev. 189, 198 (1985) (same); see 
also 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *353 (15th ed. 
1809) (discussing peremptory challenges in favorem vitae), 
and was acknowledged as an important element of capital 
jurisprudence by the Supreme Court and lower courts before 
Furman was decided. See e.g. Green v. United States, 355 
U.S. 184, 215 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) 
(accusing the majority of having "fashion[ed] a policy in 
favorem vitae" in ruling that a defendant tried on first 
degree murder charges and convicted of second degree murder 
could not be retried after a successful appeal on the 
capital charge); Rankin v. Tennessee, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 
380, 381-82 (1871) ("It is a rule in criminal law in 
favorem vitae, in capital cases, that when a special plea 
in bar found against the prisoner . . . he shall not be 
concluded or convicted thereon . . . and may plead over to 
the felony the general issue, not guilty"); Sanford v. 
Robbins, 115 F.2d 435, 439 (5th Cir. 1940), cert. denied, 
312 U.S. 697 (1941) (presuming in favorem vitae that 
defendant sentenced to death consented to new trial despite 
absence of express request). Indeed, it arguably was 
incorporated into the original understanding of the Due 
Process Clause and Eighth Amendment at the founding. Cf. 
Brinkman, Note, "The Presumption of Life: a Starting Point 
for a Due Process Analysis of Capital Sentencing," 94 Yale 
L. J. 351 (1984) (arguing for a Due Process Clause approach 
to capital sentencing issues as an alternative to the 
Furman Eighth Amendment analysis). 
 
Moreover, then as now, capital sentencing was a matter for 
the jury, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 34 (pre-1994 amendment 
version), which could be swayed by prejudicial evidence or 
argument. Matthews, supra. Judge Betts' justifications for 
a particularly scrupulous exercise of the court's 
discretion to sever "in favor of life" in a capital case 
have only become more compelling in the post-Furman era. 
 
In any event, capital or noncapital, "[g]uilt with us 
remains individual and personal, even as respects 
conspiracies. It is not a matter of mass application." 
Kotteakos v. States, 328 U.S. 750, 772 (1946). In the 
present posture of this case Mr. Nichols stands in serious 
risk of being found guilty by "mass application" if he is 
tried jointly with Mr. McVeigh. The overwhelming horror of 
the crime; the vastly greater quantity and quality of 
evidence and level of culpability that will be proved 
against Mr. McVeigh; the likelihood that the jury will fail 
to distinguish Mr. Nichols' political views from Mr. 
McVeigh's violent extremism; the highly inflammatory nature 
of much of the evidence that will be admissible against Mr. 
McVeigh but not Mr. Nichols; and the exponential 
compounding of these inherently prejudicial factors brought 
about by the fact that Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's 
defenses will be entirely antagonistic, combine to make 
this one of the rare cases in which severance is mandated 
as a matter of law. 
 
The argument for severance at the guilt phase has three 
related but independent prongs, two statutory and the other 
constitutional. In Section I.A., we show that Mr. Nichols 
is entitled to a severance under the traditional criteria 
of Fed R. Crim. P. 14: first, Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's 
defenses are "so antagonistic that they are mutually 
exclusive," United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d 844, 857 
(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 943 (1989) (quoting 
United States v. Esch, 832 F.2d 531, 538 (10th Cir. 1987), 
cert. denied, 485 U.S. 908 (1988)); second, highly 
prejudicial evidence will be admissible against Mr. McVeigh 
that is not admissible against Mr. Nichols; and third. 
given the enormity of the crime and the significant 
weakness of the government's proof of Mr. Nichols' 
culpability in comparison to the proof against Mr. McVeigh, 
there is a strong likelihood that Mr. Nichols may be 
convicted for no reason other than his prior innocent 
associations with Mr. McVeigh. 
 
Severance would be required as a matter of law for these 
and other reasons (including the Bruton problem caused by 
the government's intention to use Mr. Nichols' statement at 
a joint trial, Section I.A.6., infra ) even if this were 
not a capital case. But it is a capital case. and that fact 
makes a difference in two ways, both of which create a 
special need for heightened scrutiny of Mr. Nichols' 
severance motion. 
 
First, since Woodson v. North Carolina 428 U.S. 280 (1976) 
and its companion cases were decided, the two touchstones 
of constitutional validity of a state's death sentencing 
scheme have been the requirements of (a) individualized 
treatment and respect for the capital defendant, Lockett v. 
Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978), and (b) heightened 
reassurance that the capital jury's fact finding is 
reliable and undisturbed by irrelevant and prejudicial 
considerations. Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980). These 
Eighth Amendment touchstones -- individualized treatment 
and reliable fact finding -- are no less a concern in a 
joint federal capital prosecution than they are in state 
capital proceedings. Moreover, they mirror the twin dangers 
of "mass application" of guilt and distortions in jury fact 
finding faced by a jointly indicted defendant moving for 
severance under F. R. Crim. P. 14. Thus, as we demonstrate 
in Sections I.B.1., infra, where a capital defendant moves 
for severance, Rule 14 should be construed in pari materia 
with the Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. 
 
Second, apart from these Eighth Amendment concerns, the 
fact that this proceeding will be bifurcated into separate 
guilt and punishment phases in the event of a capital 
conviction creates a dilemma that also requires special 
scrutiny. Because "the decisions concerning guilt and 
punishment are dynamically different," Hopkinson v. 
Shillinger, 781 F.Supp. 737, 743 (D.Wyo. 1991) (Matsch, J., 
sitting by designation), aff'd, 954 F.2d 609 (10th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1067 (1992), evidence, arguments and 
defenses that are not prejudicial (or are minimally 
prejudicial) at the guilt phase of trial may nevertheless 
turn out to be highly prejudicial in the context of the 
very different purposes of the sentencing phase. United 
States v. McCullah, 76 F.3d 1087, 1101-02 (10th Cir. 1996) 
(finding introduction of a coerced confession at the guilt 
phase to be harmless error but reversing the death sentence 
because of the prejudicial impact of this same evidence at 
the penalty phase); see also United States v. McVeigh, 918 
F.Supp. 1467, 1474 (W.D.Okla. 1996) (special role of jury 
in penalty phase creates special potential prejudices from 
pretrial publicity and juror attitudes). This means that in 
at least some circumstances there will be evidence or 
arguments (for example, mutually antagonistic defenses) 
that would not ordinarily be sufficiently prejudicial to 
warrant severance at the guilt phase, but which 
nevertheless require severance in the context of the 
penalty phase's highly personal "subjective judgments," 
Hopkinson, 781 F.Supp. at 743. Because the same jury hears 
both phases, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(b), there is a significant 
likelihood of a prejudicial "spillover" of such guilt phase 
evidence into the penalty phase in these cases. See Section 
I.B.2., infra. 
 
Together, these two exceptional concerns demand a much 
stricter scrutiny of motions for severance in a capital 
case than is required in a noncapital case. Section 
I.B.3.a., infra. Regardless of whether the Court agrees 
that these considerations require that the burden be placed 
on the government to prove that a joint trial and limiting 
instructions can adequately protect a capital defendants 
rights. Section I.B.3.b., infra, or, alternatively, simply 
mandate that the Court's discretion to sever be excercised 
with special care for the capital defendant's trial rights, 
Section I.B.3.c., infra, it is clear that the capital 
nature of this case tilts the balance of potential 
prejudices and efficiencies decidedly towards the greater 
protection of trial rights and accurate verdicts that 
severance affords. In the specific circumstances of this 
case, that balance points unequivocally toward the need for 
a severance to protect Mr. Nichols' specific trial rights 
and right to a reliable capital verdict. 
 
Finally, we show in Section I.C. that a joint trial in this 
case would violate the Eighth Amendment to the 
Constitution.7/ 
 
In the alternative, we demonstrate that severance should be 
granted at the penalty phase because the antagonistic 
defenses and the many unresolvable conflicts between Mr. 
Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's rights spawned by a joint 
sentencing hearing make such a hearing fundamentally 
unfair. Section II.A. We further show that seriatim penalty 
phases before the same jury cannot solve these problems. 
Section II.B. Accordingly, in the event the Court denies 
severance at the guilt phase, it should sever at the 
penalty phase and empanel a separate jury to hear one of 
the defendant's defenses.8/ 
 
 
POINT I 
TRIAL SHOULD BE SEVERED AT THE GUILT PHASE 
 
Rule 14, Fed. R. Crim. P., provides that where it "appears 
that a defendant . . . is prejudiced by a joinder . . . of 
defendants in an indictment or information or by such 
joinder for trial together, the court may . . . grant a 
severance of defendants or provide whatever other relief 
justice requires." Although it is clear that the trial 
court has broad discretion to sever in appropriate cases, 
the Supreme Court has emphasized that "[t]here is a 
preference in the federal system for joint trials of 
defendants who are indicted together," Zafiro v. United 
States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993), particularly where a 
conspiracy is alleged. United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 
419, 434 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 2497 
(1996). Joint trials, the Supreme Court has explained, 
"promote efficiency and 'serve the interests of justice by 
avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent 
verdicts."' Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537 (quoting Richardson v. 
Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 210 (1987)); see also United States v. 
Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449 (1986). Given these countervailing 
considerations, the Court has held that ordinarily "a 
district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only 
if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would 
compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, 
or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about 
guilt or innocence." Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. We 
demonstrate in Section I.A., infra, that such serious risks 
are present here. 
 
The Court has also emphasized that each case must be 
closely scrutinized on its own merits, since "[t]he risk of 
prejudice will vary with the facts in each case." Id. The 
question presented by the facts in this case -- 
unprecedented and undiscussed in any opinion of the Supreme 
Court or any lower federal court9/ -- is how the standard 
for severance under Rule 14 is to be interpreted where the 
government has announced its intention to seek the death 
penalty against codefendants pursuant to the recently 
enacted federal capital sentencing scheme, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 
3591 et seq. As we explain in Section I.B., the special 
nature of the risks in a capital case require a strict 
construction of Rule 14 in favor of the capital defendant. 
 
 
A. Mr. Nichols is entitled to severance as a matter of law 
under the traditional test of Rule 14 
 
Joint trial in this case poses an unacceptable risk of 
three forms of prejudice: (1) the conflict between Mr. 
Nichols' and Mr. McVeigh's mutually antagonistic defenses 
will be "so intense that there is a danger the jury will 
unjustifiably infer from the conflict alone that both 
defendants are guilty," United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d 
844, 857 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 943 (1989) 
(Section I.A.1.); (2) evidence is likely to be admitted 
against Mr. McVeigh that is inadmissible and highly 
prejudicial as to Mr. Nichols (Section I.A.2.); and (3) the 
horrendous nature of the crime, when combined with the very 
different levels of culpability alleged of Mr. Nichols and 
Mr. McVeigh and the evidence of their unpopular but 
protected political views, creates a tremendous risk of 
jury confusion and guilt by mere association (Section 
I.A.3.) Against these considerations, the government's 
efficiency interest is de minimis, and it has no legitimate 
interest in consistent verdicts. 
 
Other factors mandate severance here as well: (4) the 
likelihood that certain statements made by Mr. McVeigh to 
the Fortiers about Mr. Nichols' supposed role in the 
alleged conspiracy will be inadmissible against Mr. 
Nichols. creating a threat to his Confrontation Clause 
rights (Section I.A.4.); (5) the fact that efficiency 
concerns are de minimis and risk of inconsistent verdicts 
nonexistent (Section I.A.5.); and (6) the threat to Mr. 
McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights posed by a joint 
trial at which Mr. Nichols' statement is introduced, and 
related conflicts between Mr. Nichols' right to introduce 
other parts if the government fails to introduce the entire 
statement and Mr. McVeigh's confrontation rights (Section 
I.A.6.). Finally, to the extent that the Court agrees with 
our alternative argument that the penalty phases, if any, 
should be severed and conducted before separate juries, 
severance should also be granted at the guilt phase 
(Section I.A.7.). 
 
 
1. Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's defenses are so 
antagonistic that they cannot receive a fair trial if tried 
together 
 
The courts of appeals have long recognized that "'mutually 
antagonistic or 'irreconcilable' defenses may be so 
prejudicial in some circumstances as to mandate severance. 
Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 538. As the Tenth Circuit has 
explained, it is not enough to show a "mere conflict of 
theories or one defendant's attempt to cast blame on 
another," but rather "[t]he defendant must demonstrate that 
the acceptance of one party's defense would tend to 
preclude the acquittal of the other, or that the guilt of 
one defendant tends to establish the innocence of the 
other." United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d 844, 857 (10th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 943 (1989) (reversing for 
failure to sever where mutual antagonism demonstrated); see 
also e.g. United States v. Dirden, 38 F.3d 1131, 1141 (10th 
Cir. 1994) ("Severance may be necessary if the defenses are 
'so antagonistic that they are mutually exclusive"') 
(quoting United States v. Esch, 832 F.2d 531, 538 (10th 
Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 908 (1988)); United 
States v. Swingler, 758 F.2d 477, 494-96 (10th Cir. 1985) 
(discussing doctrine).10/ The circuits have not hesitated 
to reverse failures to sever where the facts demonstrate 
that the standard is met. See e.g., Peveto, supra; United 
States v. Tootick, 952 F.2d 1078 (9th Cir. 1991); United 
States v. Rucker, 915 F.2d 1511 (11th Cir. 1990); United 
States v. Romanello, 726 F.2d 173 (5th Cir. 1984); United 
States v. Crawford, 581 F.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1978); United 
States v. Johnson, 478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1973); see also 
United States v. Odom, 888 F.2d 1014, 1021 (4th Cir. 1989), 
cert. denied, 498 U.S. 810 (1990) (double jeopardy case; 
finding "manifest necessity" to sever a defendant because 
of mutually antagonistic defenses). 
 
The Ninth Circuit has helpfully cataloged some of the 
distortions in the trial process created by mutually 
antagonistic defenses: 
 
 
Defendants who accuse each other bring the effect of a 
second prosecutor into the case with respect to their 
codefendant. In order to zealously represent his client, 
each codefendant's counsel must do everything possible to 
convict the other defendant. The existence of this extra 
prosecutor is particularly troublesome because the defense 
counsel are not always held to the limitations and 
standards imposed on the government prosecutor. Opening 
statements . . . can become a forum in which gruesome and 
outlandish tales are told about the exclusive guilt of the 
"other" defendant.... Counsel can make and oppose motions 
that are favorable to their defendant, without objection by 
the government. 
 
Cross-examination of the government's witnesses becomes an 
opportunity to emphasize the exclusive guilt of the other 
defendant or to help rehabilitate a witness that has been 
impeached. Cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses 
provides further opportunities for impeachment and the 
ability to undermine the defendant's case. The presentation 
of the codefendant's case becomes a separate forum in which 
the defendant is accused and tried. Closing arguments allow 
a final opening for codefendant's counsel to portray the 
other defendant as the sole perpetrator of the crime. 
 
Joinder can provide the individual defendants with perverse 
incentives. Defendants do not simply want to demonstrate 
their own innocence, they want to do everything possible to 
convict their codefendants. These incentives may influence 
the decision whether or not to take the stand, as well as 
the truth and content of the testimony. 
 
The joint trial of defendants advocating mutually exclusive 
defenses produces fringe benefits for the prosecution. 
Joinder in these cases can make a complex case seem simple 
to the jury: convict them both. 
 
The government's case becomes the only unified and 
consistent presentation. It presents the jury with a way to 
resolve the logical contradiction inherent in the 
defendants' positions. While the defendants' claims 
contradict each other, each claim individually acts to 
reinforce the government's case. The government is further 
benefited by the additive and profound effects of 
repetition. Each important point the government makes about 
a given defendant is echoed and reinforced by the 
codefendant's counsel. 
 
Joinder of defendants who assert mutually exclusive 
defenses has a final subtle effect. All evidence having the 
effect of exonerating one defendant implicitly indicts the 
other. The defendant must not only contend with the effects 
of the government's case against him, but he must also 
confront the negative effects of the codefendant's case. 
Tootick, 952 F.2d at 1082-83. 
 
 
In addition, where a defendant must attack a codefendant in 
order to establish his own innocence, the constitutional 
burden on the government to prove its case beyond a 
reasonable doubt is lifted. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 544 
(Stevens, J., concurring) ("joinder may invite a jury 
confronted with two defendants. at least one of whom is 
almost certainly guilty, to convict the defendant who 
appears the more guilty of the two regardless of whether 
the prosecutor has proven guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt"); State v. Vinal, 504 a.2d 1364, 1368 (Cone. 1986). 
 
Certain principles should be kept in mind in evaluating a 
claim of mutually antagonistic defenses. First, this 
determination must be based on a practical and realistic 
assessment of the evidence against the defendants likely to 
be put forward by the government, the defenses 
realistically available to the defendants given the 
government's case, and the likely impact of each of the 
defendants' defenses on the other's case. a "theoretical 
possibility that the jury might acquit all defendants," 
Romanello, 726 F.2d at 179 -- a possibility that exists in 
every criminal case, regardless of the evidence, 
prosecution case or defenses -- is not enough by itself to 
defeat a claim of mutual antagonism. Id. 
 
Second, the evil of mutually antagonistic defenses is that 
they destroy the ability of each defendant to exercise his 
constitutional right to make a defense to the government's 
case and lighten the government's constitutional burden by 
interjecting a "second prosecutor" into the trial, not that 
they make conviction of either defendant more or less 
likely. Accordingly, defenses may be mutually antagonistic 
even where the government's evidence against each defendant 
is strong. Crawford, 581 F.2d at 492 ("Although the 
evidence of each defendant's individual guilt was strong, 
this joint trial was intrinsically prejudicial',). 
Conversely, mutual antagonism may exist even where the 
defenses, when compared with the government's case against 
each defendant, are weak. Romanello, 726 F.2d at 179. As 
the Fifth Circuit succinctly put it, "[t]he real question 
for a court in considering a severance motion is not how 
convincing a defendant's evidence is, but whether the core 
of his defense directly implicates the codefendant." Id. 
 
Third, mutual antagonism sufficient to require severance 
may exist even where only one codefendant directly accuses 
the other. Tootick, 952 F.2d at 1081 ("Mutual exclusivity 
may exist when 'only one defendant accuses the other, and 
the other denies any involvement"') (quoting Romanello, 726 
F.2d at 177[11/]). The logic of this rule follows from the 
fact that where one defendant must prove his codefendant's 
guilt as part of his defense, the codefendant must respond 
by attempting to refute the defendant's "prosecutive" 
defense in order to establish his own innocence, and thus 
becomes genuinely antagonistic to the defendant insofar as 
he must also defeat the defendant's only defense as well. 
Romanello, 726 F.2d at 181 ("[a]lthough the core of his 
co-defendants' defense was not [the defendant's] own guilt, 
they nevertheless had to undermine [the defendant's] 
defense to establish their own innocence"); see also 
Swingler, 758 F.2d at 496 (distinguishing Romanello and 
other cases requiring severance for mutual antagonism 
because "[i]n each of them at least one defendant made a 
direct accusation against a specific co-defendant").12/ 
 
Finally, the Tenth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that 
"the danger that a defendant may be denied a fair trial 
when confronted with an antagonistic defense is exacerbated 
when one defendant admits some or all the elements of the 
charge." Peveto, 881 F.2d at 858; see also Swingler, 758 
F.2d at 494 (same); United States v. Roberts, 583 F.9d 
1173, 1177 (10th Cir. 1978) (same), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 
1080 (1979). Typically in these cases, a defendant's only 
realistic defense is based on lack of the required mens rea 
because the evidence of his participation in the crime is 
strong, and proof of the defendant's innocent mental state 
for some reason depends on proving that the codefendant was 
guilty. The special risks in this situation are apparent. 
On one hand, the defendant's admission of conduct that the 
government will argue is consistent with guilt -- 
particularly where these admissions directly implicate the 
codefendant gives dramatic force to the government's case 
against the codefendant, while on the other hand, a defense 
based on lack of intent is inherently vulnerable to attacks 
leveled by an admitted coparticipant in the crime 
(particularly where the crime charged is a conspiracy). 
Where, as here, both defendants attempt to demonstrate that 
their innocent mental state based on the guilty conduct of 
the codefendant, the danger is maximized that "'the jury 
will unjustifiably infer from the conflict alone that both 
defendants are guilty."' Peveto, 881 F.2d at 857 (quoting 
Esch, 832 F.2d at 538). 
 
In Peveto, for example, two defendants, Hines and Rodgers, 
were arrested during a search of a home methamphetamine 
laboratory and were charged with narcotics offenses. 881 
F.2d at 847. At trial, to Rodgers' surprise, Hines' defense 
was that at the time of his arrest he was working as a 
government informant. He admitted buying chemicals and 
glassware for the laboratory and directly implicated 
Rodgers in the narcotics activity, but disclaimed any 
criminal intent based on his alleged employment as a 
government agent. Id. at 848-49. Rodgers, on the other 
hand, claimed that he went to the house (which belonged to 
his brother) coincidentally on the day of the search to 
pick up furniture, that he had no involvement with the 
narcotics, and that he only remained at the house until the 
search party arrived because Hines, who was armed, had 
refused to allow him to leave. L. at 849. 
 
On these facts, the Tenth Circuit found that the district 
court had abused its discretion in failing to grant 
Rodgers' severance motion after Hines made his accusations 
at trial: 
 
 
Hines' defense was not only prejudicial to Rodgers, but was 
also mutually exclusive. Rodgers painted himself as 
innocent too, being held against his will by Hines. If the 
jury believed that Hines was laying the groundwork as an 
informant and Rodgers was a dealer (as Hines said) and was 
at the house in that capacity, then it would necessarily 
have to disbelieve Rodgers' defense -- that he had gone to 
the house to pick up some furniture and appliances and was 
being held against his will by Hines.... The jury's 
acceptance of Hines' defense would "tend to preclude the 
acquittal of [Rodgers]." Peveto, 881 F.2d at 858 (cites 
omitted). 
 
 
Particularly significant to the Court's holding was the 
fact that Hines' admissions lent tremendous credibility to 
the government's case against the other codefendants: 
 
 
Here, Hines admitted buying the glassware and the 
chemicals, claiming it was all part of his work as an 
informant. ... He said that he talked with [another alleged 
coconspirator] about buying dope houses with the intent of 
distributing narcotics and he said that "they" (his 
co-defendants) were "producing amphetamine powder." . . . 
His admissions directly supported the government's charges. 
L. 
 
 
To the same effect are the facts and holding in United 
States v. Johnson, 478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1973) (cited 
with approval in United States v. Roberts, 583 F.2d 1173, 
1177 (10th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1080 (1979)) 
(defendant who admitted to passing counterfeit reserve 
notes defended by claiming to be government informant, 
arguing lack of criminal intent, and accusing codefendant). 
 
 
a. Mr. Nichols must prove that Mr. McVeigh is guilty to 
make his own defense13 
 
These principles dictate the conclusion that Mr. Nichols 
and Mr. McVeigh's defenses are so mutually antagonistic 
that severance is required as a matter of law. [TEXT 
REDACTED] 
 
In sum, like the defendants in Peveto, Mr. Nichols and Mr. 
McVeigh will be forced to defend themselves by accusing the 
other. Severance is therefore required as a matter of 
law.16/ 
 
 
b. The mutually antagonistic defenses will violate Mr. 
Nichols' right to make a case for a lesser included offense 
 
The mutually antagonistic defenses require severance on 
another ground as well: their effect on Mr. Nichols' 
ability to make a case for a lesser included offense. 
 
Federal capital defendants have a right tO lesser included 
offenses where warranted by the evidence both as a matter 
of constitutional law under the Eighth Amendment, Beck v. 
Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980); Trujillo v. Sullivan, 815 
F.2d 597 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 929 (1987), 
and federal statute under Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(c); Keeble v. 
United States, 412 U.S. 205 (1973). The rationale for 
requiring lesser included offenses upon the defendant's 
request under both constitution and federal law is similar: 
the fact that "[w]here one of the elements of the offense 
charged remains in doubt, but the defendant is plainly 
guilty of some offense, the jury is likely to resolve its 
doubts in favor of conviction." Keeble, 412 U.S. at 213; 
see also Beck, 447 U.S. at 643 ("in every case [the state's 
automatic disallowance of lesser included offense 
instructions in capital cases] introduce[s] a level of 
uncertainty and unreliability into the fact finding process 
that cannot be tolerated in a capital case"). 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
The possibility of lesser included offenses for Mr. Nichols 
also raises the specter of jury confusion. The government's 
allegation that Mr. Nichols was not on the scene of the 
crime establishes his right to lesser included offense 
instructions, but it is difficult to believe that McVeigh 
will be entitled to them. His alleged participation in the 
crime -- and therefore his defenses -- are "all or 
nothing." Lesser included offense instructions provided for 
only one makes it likely that the jury will fail to give 
them their due consideration, or will interpret them as a 
judicial suggestion that one defendant is less culpable 
than another. Either way, one of the defendants will be 
prejudiced. 
 
 
2. Severance should be granted because highly prejudicial 
evidence that is inadmissible against Mr. Nichols is likely 
to be admitted against Mr. McVeigh 
 
Severance is appropriate "when evidence that a jury should 
not consider against a defendant and that would not be 
admissible if a defendant were tried alone is admitted 
against a codefendant." Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. The risk 
of prejudice is particularly high when the evidence is 
inflammatory, such as prior wrongdoing. Id. 
 
We acknowledge the many cases holding that this 
consideration, standing alone, typically will not require 
severance as a matter of law, see e.g. United States v. 
Calabrese, 645 F.2d 1379, 1385 (10th Cir. 1981), cert. 
denied, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981), unless "the evidence is so 
complex or confusing that the jury would be unable to make 
individual determinations about the guilt or innocence of 
each defendant." United States v. McClure, 734 F.2d 484, 
492 (10th Cir. 1984). In this case, however, that exacting 
standard is met. The prejudicial evidence to be introduced 
against Mr. McVeigh -- especially when combined with the 
other factors favoring severance poses a near-certainty of 
prejudicial confusion of issues and transference of guilt 
onto Mr. Nichols. 
 
 
a. Extremely prejudicial statements by Mr. McVeigh [TEXT 
REDACTED] that are inadmissible against Mr. Nichols will be 
introduced against Mr. McVeigh to prove his motive for the 
bombing 
 
Even if the statements were relevant, they are inadmissible 
under Rule 801 (d)(2)E). Many of the statements were not 
made "during the course of" the alleged conspiracy and are 
inadmissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) on this basis. The 
other statements are inadmissible because they were not 
made "in furtherance" of the conspiracy within the meaning 
of the coconspirator admission rule. The Tenth Circuit 
holds that the "in furtherance" requirement is "'a 
limitation on the admissibility of co-conspirators' 
statements that is meant to be taken seriously,"' United 
States v. Perez, 989 F.2d 1574, 1578 (10th Cir. 1993) (en 
bane) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 927 F.2d 999, 1001 
(7th Cir.1991)), and that must be construed narrowly. L. 
Coconspirator statements are only admissible against 
another coconspirator where the declarant-coconspirator 
made the statement with the intent of furthering the 
conspiratorial objective. United States v. Guttierez, 48 
F.3d 1134, 1137 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 2598 
(1995). This requires a contextual analysis of the 
declarant's intent at the time of the making of the 
statement. Id. 
 
The statements contained in the letters to Mr. McVeigh's 
sister and friends do not qualify under this narrow 
exception. None of these individuals were coconspirators of 
Mr. McVeigh's, either at the time the statements were made 
or subsequently. Consequently, they cannot be construed to 
be 
 
 
made to induce . . . further participation in the group's 
activities; [or] to prompt further action on the part of 
co-conspirators; [or] to reassure members of the 
conspiracy's continued existence; [or] to allay a 
co-conspirator's fears; [or] to keep co-conspirators 
abreast of an ongoing conspiracy's activities. Perez, 989 
F.2d at 1578. 
 
 
Nor did Mr. McVeigh ever invite or intend them to become 
coconspirators; hence, they cannot be considered to be 
"made to induce enlistment . . . in the group's 
activities." L. While Mr. McVeigh urges his sister and old 
friends not to trust the government or be complacent and to 
stand up for their rights, he at no time suggests that they 
assist him with the bombing of the Murrah Building (or any 
other specific act of violence).18/ 
 
While statements to a nonconspirator may qualify for 
admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), see e.g. United States 
v. Wolf, 839 F.2d 1387, 1394 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 
U.S. 923 (1988) (statements made for purpose of keeping 
conspiracy from being discovered; however, mere narrative 
does not further conspiracy), it is also clear that such 
statements must be closely scrutinized to ascertain whether 
they are truly in furtherance" of the conspiracy. See e.g. 
id., at 1395 (statement to nonconspirator that admitted 
criminal activity by coconspirator was not "in furtherance" 
of conspiracy); United States v. Urbanik, 801 F.2d 692, 696 
(4th Cir. 1986) (casual incriminating remarks by 
coconspirator to nonconspirator not admissible) (cited with 
approval in Perez, supra); United States v. Johnson, 927 
F.2d 999, 1001-02 (7th Cir. 1991) (same). Since Mr. 
McVeigh's purpose in the letters was to voice his general 
views and not recruit for or cover up the conspiracy, the 
statements do not qualify under Rule 801 (d)(2)(E). 
 
On the other hand. admission of these statements against 
Mr. McVeigh threatens to be [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
 
3. Severance should be granted because the horrendous 
nature of the crime, when combined with the very different 
levels of culpability alleged of Mr. Nichols and Mr. 
McVeigh and the evidence of Mr. Nichols' unpopular but 
protected political views, creates a tremendous risk of 
jury confusion and guilt by mere association 
 
The bombing of the Murrah Building was a crime of such 
magnitude and horror that jurors asked to sit in judgment 
over a person charged with committing it cannot but have a 
natural desire to believe that he is in fact the guilty 
party. Our system of justice posits that this desire can be 
checked and jurors induced to play their constitutional 
role of impartial fact finders by instructions on the 
presumption of innocence and the government's burden of 
proof. It is another question entirely, however, whether 
instructions can suffice to overcome that natural desire 
where jurors sit in judgment over two people, one of whom 
is clearly guilty and one whose guilt is in reasonable 
doubt. There is an inevitable tendency for the overwhelming 
horror of the crime, when combined with the clear guilt of 
one defendant, to obliterate the individuality of the case 
against the codefendant -- particularly where, as here, 
that codefendant is linked to the clearly guilty party by 
prior (innocent) associations. 
 
Thus, although "the mere fact that one co-defendant is less 
culpable than the remaining co-defendants is not alone 
sufficient grounds to establish a trial court abused its 
discretion in denying severance," United States v. Emmons, 
24 F.3d 1210, 1218-19 (10th Cir. 1994) (quoting United 
States v. Youngpeter, 986 F.2d 349, ;53 (10th Cir. 1993)), 
the Supreme Court has recognized that disparate levels of 
culpability may nevertheless be an appropriate basis for 
the district court to exercise its discretion in favor of 
severance. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539; see also e.g. United 
States v. Sampol, 636 F.2d 621, 643 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ("Even 
before trial had commenced, the joint trial of defendants 
on charges growing out of the same underlying event . . . 
but premised upon entirely disparate levels and allegations 
of culpability, foreshadowed confusion of the evidence and 
prejudice to [the defendant moving for severance]"); United 
States v. Mardian, 546 F.2d 973, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1976) 
(endorsing "the rule . . . requiring severance when the 
evidence against one or more defendants is 'far more 
damaging' than the evidence against the moving party") 
(cite omitted); United States v. Kelly, 349 F.2d 720, 759 
(2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 947 (1966). 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
motivated by his political views, the jury is likely to 
decide that any individual on trial with him who shares 
some of these views must have been involved, also. 
 
The difference between Mr. McVeigh's and Mr. Nichols' 
political views is subtle yet of overriding evidentiary and 
constitutional significance. Compare Appendix 2 (written 
statements of Mr. McVeigh) with Appendix 3 (written 
statements of Mr. Nichols). One who recruits and urges 
others to take immediate action to overthrow the government 
may be criminally punished, while one who merely advocates 
anti-government views cannot. Yates v. United States, 354 
U.S. 298, 325 (1957).20/ The subtlety of this distinction 
led the Supreme Court to warn against the likelihood of 
jury confusion in Smith Act cases, and to require special 
scrutiny of the evidence tending to show illegal advocacy: 
 
 
The [intent] element of the membership [Smith Act] crime . . . 
must be judged strictissimi juri, for otherwise there 
is a danger that one in sympathy with the legitimate aims 
of the organization, but not specifically intending to 
accomplish them by resort to violence, might be punished 
for his adherence to lawful and constitutionally protected 
purposes, because of other unprotected purposes which he 
does not necessarily share. Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 
290, 299-300 (1961). 
 
 
See also Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 232 (1961) 
("the Smith Act offenses, involving as they do subtler 
elements than are presented in most other crimes, call for 
strict standards in assessing the adequacy of the proof 
needed to make out a case of illegal advocacy"); Yates. 354 
U.S. at 326 (acknowledging that these distinctions "are 
often subtle and difficult to grasp"); United States v. 
Spock, 416 F.2d 165 (1st Cir. 1969) (discussing need for 
strict construction of the conspiracy laws where they 
overlap with conduct involving speech and association). 
 
The government views both defendants' political convictions 
as relevant evidence of motive, see Transcript of April 30, 
1996 Jury Instruction Conference at 75-76, 85-87, but to 
date has shown no sign of understanding the significance or 
subtlety of this distinction between their views. During 
the April 22, 1995 search of Mr. Nichols' home, Special 
Agent Burmeister seized "anti-government literature," which 
he defined, inter alia as "anything that is against the 
philosophy of the United States government, the United 
States doctrine." Deposition of Steven G. Burmeister (June 
26, 1996), at 11.[21/] Mr. Nichols' "anti-government 
literature" figured large in the government's arguments 
against releasing him on bail, see Brief of the United 
States in Opposition to Release of Terry Lynn Nichols 
(filed June 1, 1995), at 8-9 and Addenda a-1, a-2 and a-3 
(relying on Mr. Nichols' disavowals of government 
jurisdiction to keep him incarcerated), and there is no 
doubt that the government intends to use his political 
beliefs in its case at trial. In these circumstances the 
only sure method of safeguarding Mr. Nichols' right to 
individualized consideration of the government's proof 
against him is to sever the two cases. 
 
 
4. [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
Even assuming arguendo that the government proves that Mr. 
Nichols joined the conspiracy initially, this is very 
powerful evidence that he had withdrawn from it no later 
than November 22, 1994. "Affirmative acts inconsistent with 
the object of the conspiracy and communicated in a manner 
reasonably calculated to reach co-conspirators have 
generally been regarded as sufficient to establish 
withdrawal or abandonment." United States v. United States 
Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 464-65 (1978); see also United 
States v. Parnell, 581 F.2d 1374, 1384 (10th Cir. 1978), 
cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1076 (1979) ("In order to withdraw 
from a conspiracy an individual must take affirmative 
action, either making a clean breast to the authorities or 
communicating his withdrawal in a manner reasonably 
calculated to reach coconspirators"). By any measure, Mr. 
Nichols departure for a two month trip to the Phillippines 
to be with his family in the middle of the period of the 
alleged conspiracy qualifies as an "affirmative act 
inconsistent with the object of the conspiracy," Gypsum, 
438 U.S. at 464, and Mr. McVeigh's alleged statements to 
Michael Fortier provide unambiguous evidence (assuming 
arguendo the initial existence of the conspiracy) that Mr. 
Nichols had "communicat[ed] his withdrawal in a manner 
reasonably calculated to reach co-conspirators," Parnell, 
581 F.2d at 1384. 
 
Although withdrawal does not relieve a person of guilt for 
the inchoate crime of conspiracy and acts taken in 
furtherance of the conspiratorial object prior to the 
withdrawal, United States v. Gonzalez, 797 F.2d 915, 917 
(10th Cir. 1986),22/ it does exonerate her of 
responsibility for all future acts taken by coconspirators. 
Id. Thus, if the evidence shows that Mr. Nichols withdrew 
from the conspiracy in November 1994, then all subsequent 
statements by Mr. McVeigh would not be admissible against 
him under FRE 801(d)(2)(E) since they would not have been 
made "during the course of" a conspiracy of which Mr. 
Nichols was a member. Id. 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
"Evidence that is probative of a defendant's guilt but 
technically admissible only against a codefendant" may 
warrant severance. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. Here, limiting 
instructions will [TEXT REDACTED] rule of Bruton v. United 
States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). The government must therefore 
decline to introduce them against Mr. McVeigh or agree to 
sever the two cases. Id. 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] 
 
Thus, in the present posture, there is a real possibility 
that the government will be unable to carry its burden 
under FRE 104(a) to demonstrate that Mr. Nichols was a 
member of Mr. McVeigh's conspiracy at the time of the 
post-November 1994 statements by Mr. McVeigh that mention 
Mr. Nichols. 
 
If the Court reaches this conclusion after the statements 
have already been introduced, see United States v. Reyes, 
798 F.2d 380, 384-85 (10th Cir. 1986) (trial court may make 
Rule 104 finding of conspiratorial relation after 
conditional introduction of coconspirator statements), Mr. 
Nichols will have to be severed in the midst of Mr. 
McVeigh's trial. Cf. United States v. Hill, 901 F.2d 880 
(10th Cir. 1990) (statement of codefendant that implicated 
defendant introduced by government in reasonable 
expectation that codefendant would testify requires 
reversal of defendant's conviction under Bruton where 
codefendant failed to testify).23/ 
 
Rather than risk a mid-trial severance of Mr. Nichols and 
possible mistrial as to Mr. McVeigh, the Court should sever 
pretrial and avoid the potential problem entirely. 
 
 
5. Trying Mr. Nichols separately from Mr. McVeigh poses 
minimal inconvenience to the government and no risk of 
"inconsistent verdicts" 
 
The government's two interests in trying defendants jointly 
are "efficiency" and "'avoiding the scandal and inequity of 
inconsistent verdicts."' Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537 (quoting 
Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 210 (1987)). In this 
case neither of these interests overrides the 
countervailing considerations discussed above. 
 
Because the government has charged a conspiracy, it 
technically has the opportunity to attempt to prove that 
all of Mr. McVeigh's actions taken in furtherance of and 
during the course of the conspiracy are imputable to Mr. 
Nichols. But, as we explained above, the cases against the 
two defendants are coextensive in theory only. In fact, 
most of the relevant evidence against Mr. McVeigh does not 
concern Mr. Nichols at all and is irrelevant to his 
defense. Therefore, unlike Mr. McVeigh, who will vigorously 
contest these facts, Mr. Nichols has little or no interest 
in countering the government's presentation on these issues 
[TEXT REDACTED] terms, the case against Mr. Nichols is 
limited to proving a few specific acts during the period of 
the alleged conspiracy: [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
For these reasons, separate trials of Mr. McVeigh and Mr. 
Nichols would in reality be two very different trials, 
technically covering the same conspiracy but focussing on 
almost entirely distinct acts and evidence. Government 
efficiency concerns are accordingly minimal. 
 
Moreover, separate trials pose no danger whatsoever of 
inconsistent verdicts in this case. a concern for 
inconsistent verdicts arises where two defendants with 
equal or similar participation in a crime are tried 
separately, giving rise to the possibility that 
idiosyncratic differences in the juries will result in 
unjustifiably different verdicts. That situation is not 
presented here. It would be fully consistent for one jury 
to conclude that Mr. McVeigh, who is directly linked to the 
scene of the crime itself and who described his plans and 
intentions with respect to the bombing to others in detail, 
is guilty, while another jury found Mr. Nichols -- who the 
government agrees was not at the scene, and against whom 
there is no remotely similar evidence of participation or 
intention -- to be innocent (or guilty of a lesser included 
noncapital offense). Our witnesses at the requested 
severance hearing will speak to this issue. 
 
Accordingly, the government interests in efficiency and 
consistent verdicts do not justify a joint trial in this 
case. 
 
 
6. Bruton v. United States bars the use of the parts of Mr. 
Nichols' statement the government seeks to introduce at a 
joint trial, and, alternatively, there are irresolvable 
conflicts between Mr. Nichols' right to introduce other 
parts of the statement and Mr. McVeigh's confrontation 
rights 
 
a. Bruton bars the use of the parts of Mr. Nichols' 
statement the government seeks to introduce at a joint 
trial 
 
In its Motion of the United States in Limine Regarding 
Statements of Terry Nichols, the government sought to have 
three alleged assertions by Mr. Nichols that were extracted 
from his April 21, 1995 statement ruled admissible against 
Mr. McVeigh as well. These were claims that (1) Mr. Nichols 
drove Mr. McVeigh to Oklahoma City on April 16, 1995; (2) 
loaned Mr. McVeigh his pickup truck on April 18, 1995; and 
(3) cleaned out Mr. McVeigh's storage locker on April 20, 
1995. Motion in Limine 1. That motion has now been denied. 
However, the government also argued in the alternative that 
introduction of Mr. Nichols' statements against him alone 
at a joint trial would be permissible under Bruton v. 
United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). Id. 8-13. The 
government's alternative argument is also incorrect. Hence, 
if it wishes to use the statements against Mr. Nichols it 
may only do so if the two cases are severed. 
 
Bruton carved out an exception to the usual assumption that 
limiting instructions effectively cabin jury's 
consideration of evidence and held that a jury will not be 
presumed to follow an instruction to disregard a 
nontestifying codefendant's confession that implicates the 
defendant. Accordingly, because "a defendant is deprived of 
his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when the 
facially incriminating confession of a nontestifying 
codefendant is introduced at their joint trial," Richardson 
v. Marsh, 481 U.S.200, 207 (1987), the government must 
choose between severance and use of the statement. In 
Richardson, the Court refined the Bruton rule and held that 
"the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission 
of a nontestifying codefendant's confession with a proper 
limiting instruction when . . . the confession is redacted 
to eliminate not only the defendant's name, but any 
reference to his or her existence," id. at 211, even if the 
defendant can be connected inferentially with the 
confession through other evidence at trial. Id. at 208-09. 
 
Here, of course, the statements in question do each 
"facially incriminate" Mr. McVeigh by naming him as 
involved in the actions described. Nevertheless, the 
government argues that these statements fall outside the 
scope of Bruton because the Tenth Circuit has allegedly 
"limit[ed] Bruton applications to 'clearly inculpatory' 
comments that are 'vitally important to the government's 
case,"' Motion in Limine 9 (quoting United States v. Hill, 
901 F.2d 880,884 (10th Cir. 1990)), and because these 
statements are assertedly "inferentially" rather than 
"facially" incriminating within the meaning of Richardson. 
Motion in Limine 10 (citing Richardson, supra). 
 
Neither of these claims has any basis in the cases cited. 
Hill does not address the hypothesized "limits" of Bruton 
at all -- it addressed a garden-variety inculpatory 
codefendant statement and, fully consistent with Bruton, 
reversed because of its admission at a joint trial. The 
quoted language highlighted by the government comes from 
another case, United States v. Espinosa, 771 F.2d 1382, 
1399 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1023 (1985), which 
does not even deal with a codefendant statement. Espinosa 
instead addresses a brief and relatively innocuous comment 
made during an opening statement by a pro se codefendant. 
Following a long line of similar cases recognizing the 
significant difference between argument and testimony in 
the minds of jurors, the court held that "we will not apply 
Bruton unless [a pro se defendant's opening statement was] 
"clearly inculpatory' as to the complaining co-defendant[s] 
and . . . 'vitally important to the government's case."" 
Id., 771 F.2d at 1399 (cites omitted), 1400 n.23. The 
"clearly inculpatory" language relied upon by the 
government is thus not a "limitation" on Bruton but a test 
for applying it to opening statements. 
 
The government also mistakes Richardson's distinction 
between "inferentially" and "facially" incriminating 
statements as reflecting a difference in degrees of 
inculpation. See Motion in Limine 10 (suggesting that even 
facially incriminating statements may pass muster under 
Richardson if they are only slightly incriminating). It 
does not. Richardson nowhere suggests that the Bruton 
analysis turns on how "powerfully incriminating," Motion in 
Limine 12, a codefendant statement is, in the sense of 
harmfulness to the defendant's case. Rather, it is the fact 
that a codefendant statement that mentions the defendant is 
far less likely to be disregarded by the jury than is a 
statement which does not mention him, that makes the former 
statement more "powerfully incriminating." Richardson, 481 
U.S. at 208; see also id. at 208 n.3 ("the very premise of 
our discussion is that [the defendant] would have been 
harmed by [the codefendant's] confession if the jury had 
disobeyed its instructions.... Our disagreement [with the 
dissent] pertains not to whether the confession 
incriminated respondent, but to whether the trial court 
could properly assume that the jury did not use it against 
her."). The reason that the codefendant statement in 
Richardson was only inferentially incriminating was that it 
omitted any mention of the defendant at all, which meant 
that the jury was less likely to be riveted by the "vivid," 
id., 481 U.S. at 208, spectacle of one defendant accusing 
another and thus more likely to "obey the instruction to 
disregard the evidence." L.; see also United States v. 
Chatman, 994 F.2d 1510, 1513 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 114 
S.Ct. 230 (1993) (cited by government, Motion in Limine 10) 
(inferentially incriminating because codefendant statement 
redacted to omit mention of defendant's existence); United 
States v. Markopoulos, 848 F.2d 1036, 1038-39 (10th Cir. 
1988) (same).24/ It is for this reason that, contrary to 
the government's unsupported suggestion to the contrary 
(Motion in Limine 11), "facial incrimination" marks the 
dividing line between statements that require exclusion 
under Bruton and those that do not.25/ 
 
In this case there is little doubt that Mr. Nichols' 
statement will be among the most "vivid" pieces of evidence 
the government introduces against him, and the jury can be 
expected to be riveted by this testimony and the mutually 
conflicting interpretations all three parties will attempt 
to ascribe to it through direct and cross-examination. It 
is inconceivable that the jury will be able to separate 
what they hear about the statement from their consideration 
of the case against Mr. McVeigh. Indeed, since the 
government has argued that his association with Mr. McVeigh 
is among the most incriminating facts they intend to prove 
against Mr. Nichols, the government will be directing the 
jurors to focus their attention on Mr. McVeigh even while 
the Court is instructing them to disregard the effect of 
the statement on his case. See Reply Brief of the United 
States Regarding Admissibility of Nichols' Statements, at 
8 ("Nichols' core statements were incriminating precisely 
because, and for the most part only because, McVeigh too 
was involved"). Accordingly, the statement is "powerfully 
incriminating" as to Mr. McVeigh in the only sense that 
matters for Bruton purposes: the jurors will be unable to 
follow an instruction not to consider it in the case 
against him. 
 
 
b. Mr. Nichols is entitled to introduce other parts of the 
April 21, 1995 statement that inculpate Mr. McVeigh to 
assure that the meaning of the statements is not distorted 
and that exculpatory information in the statement is not 
kept from the jury 
 
Alternatively, even if the three specific statements that 
the government wishes to introduce against Mr. Nichols 
could be admitted without implicating Mr. McVeigh's 
Confrontation Clause rights, it is clear that many of the 
other statements Mr. Nichols made on April 21, 1995 could 
not. In the event that the specified statements are 
introduced at trial, however, Mr. Nichols will have the 
right to introduce these additional statements under Fed. 
R. Evid. 106 and 611 (a)26/ in order to give the jury a 
complete, fair and accurate account of the statements 
introduced by the government. Thus, there will be 
insuperable Bruton problems even if the government is 
correct about the part of the statement it will seek to 
introduce. 
 
When the government seeks to introduce part of a 
codefendant's statement against the codefendant at a joint 
trial in order to avoid Bruton problems, the codefendant 
has the right to introduce other, omitted parts -- even if 
introduction of these parts requires severance under Bruton 
where "admission of the statement in its edited form 
distorts the meaning of the statement or excludes 
information substantially exculpatory of the declarant." 
United States v. Bolden, --- F.3d ---, 1996 WL 447756, at 
* 1 (8th Cir. August 9, 1996) (quoting United States v. 
Kaminski, 692 F.2d 505, 522 (8th Cir. 1982)). 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] rule. These explanations go directly to 
explaining the "meaning of the statement," since they 
clarify that Mr. Nichols was not the party who initiated or 
desired the three favors to Mr. McVeigh. For the same 
reason. they are "substantially exculpatory" of Mr. 
Nichols, because they eliminate the inference that makes 
these otherwise innocent acts criminal -- that he knowingly 
furthered Mr. McVeigh's plan to commit the bombing. These 
statements thus represent a situation that courts have 
recognized would pose a serious completeness problem 
redactions in which the omitted material would cast into 
doubt whether the codefendant had the required criminal 
intent. See e.g. United States v. Velasco, 953 F.2d 1467, 
1475 (7th Cir. 1992) (no error in admitting redacted 
statement because "[t]here is nothing in the portions of 
defendant's post-arrest statement that he tried to admit 
under Rule 106 that make the fact of his guilty knowledge 
more probable or less probable"); Kaminski, 692 F.2d at 522 
& 523 n.28 (no error in admitting redacted statement 
because "rather than being exculpatory, [the omitted 
portion] actually corroborated the government's charge that 
[the declarant-codefendant] was intimately involved with 
the operation of FGS and that he had total knowledge of 
what was going on").27/ 
 
Accordingly, Mr. Nichols' right to a complete and fair 
presentation of his statement will be violated unless all 
of the exculpatory explanations contained in the statement 
including those that directly implicate and accuse Mr. 
McVeigh -- are admitted contemporaneously with the 
statements extracted by the government. Since this cannot 
be done consistent with Mr. McVeigh's confrontation rights, 
the government must either forego use of any part of the 
statement or agree to a severance. Kaminiski, supra. 
 
 
c. Mr. Nichols is constitutionally entitled to introduce 
other parts of the April 21, 1995 statement that inculpate 
Mr. McVeigh in order to demonstrate the circumstances in 
which the statement was given and the credibility of the 
statements to be introduced 
 
Finally, and independently, Mr. Nichols is also 
constitutionally entitled to introduce his exculpatory 
responses to the agents' questions concerning Mr. McVeigh's 
possible involvement in the bombing to prove that his other 
statements were truthful, reliable and were exculpatory 
rather than inculpatory. 
 
a criminal defendant against whom the government seeks to 
introduce a statement has a constitutional right to 
introduce evidence of the circumstances in which the 
statement was given - in order to demonstrate its 
credibility and the weight that should be given to it by 
the jury. Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 691 (1986). As 
the Supreme Court explained in Crane: 
 
 
Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, Chambers v. Mississippi, [410 U.S. 
284 (1973)], or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation 
clauses of the Sixth Amendment, Washington v. Texas, 388 
U.S. 14, 23 (1967); Davis v. Alaska 415 U.S. 308 (1974), 
the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants "a 
meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense." 
California v. Trombetta 467 U.S. [479, 485 (1984)].... We 
break no new ground in observing that an essential 
component of procedural fairness is the opportunity to be 
heard. ... That opportunity would be an empty one if the 
State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable 
evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when 
such evidence is central to the defendant's claim of 
innocence. In the absence of any valid state justification, 
exclusion of this kind of exculpatory evidence deprives a 
defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor's case 
encounter and "survive the crucible of meaningful 
adversarial testing." . . . Id., 476 U.S. at 690-91 (some 
cites omitted). 
 
 
Similarly, "where constitutional rights directly affecting 
the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule 
may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of 
justice." Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 309 
(1973). 
 
This case stands at the intersection of Crane and Chambers. 
Introduction of the limited portion of the statement 
tendered by the government could easily lead the jury to 
conclude that Mr. Nichols was conceding some knowing 
involvement in the bombing; indeed, the government has 
already suggested that it will argue that parts of the 
statement demonstrate guilty knowledge through the use of 
false exculpatory explanations. See Letter dated March 15, 
1996, from Joseph H. Hartzler to Michael E. Tigar and 
Stephen Jones, at 6 (describing portions of statement to be 
introduced against Mr. Nichols as allegedly false 
exculpatory statements). To paraphrase Crane, the jurors 
will inevitably be led to ask: "If the defendant is 
innocent, why did he previously admit [significant facts 
suggesting] his guilt?" Crane. 476 U.S. at 689. Mr. 
Nichols' voluntary appearance at the Herington Department 
of Public Safety and willingness to provide all the 
information requested of him about possible leads in the 
bombing investigation -- [TEXT REDACTED] credibility at the 
time he made the statements.28/ 
 
Accordingly, should the government attempt to use his 
statement against him, Mr. Nichols has the right to 
introduce the other portions that exculpate him and 
inculpate Mr. McVeigh, including his statement of his 
beliefs regarding Mr. McVeigh's involvement in the bombing. 
Since introduction of these additional statements would 
clearly implicate Mr. McVeigh's Confrontation Clause 
rights, the government must decline to use the statement at 
all or agree to a severance. 
 
 
7. To the extent severance is granted at the penalty phase, 
severance at the guilt phase is required as well 
 
Finally, to the extent that the Court agrees with our 
alternative argument that severance at the penalty phase 
and sentencing hearings before different juries is 
required, Point II, infra, it should also grant guilt phase 
severance as well. 
 
First, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(b)(1), there is an express 
preference for the same jury to hear both the guilt and 
penalty phases. As we argue under Point II below, that 
preference is not sufficient in this case to permit the 
same jury that heard the joint guilt phase to hear the 
defendants' joint penalty phases, either together or 
seriatim. But, once having reached this conclusion, the 
preference can still be given effect by severing at the 
guilt phase as well and trying each defendant individually 
before the same jury at both stages in separate 
proceedings. 
 
Second, any efficiency concerns weighing against guilt 
phase severance are largely obviated once penalty phase 
severance is granted, because the separately empaneled 
penalty phase jury must be educated in detail about the 
facts of the crime before it can render an individualized 
sentencing judgment. For example, the jury must be 
sufficiently educated so that it can determine with some 
precision the relative levels of culpability of the 
individuals who participated in the crime. See 18 U.S.C. 
Secs. 3592(a)(3) (requiring the penalty phase jury to 
consider whether the defendant's participation in the crime 
was "relatively minor"); 3592(a)(4) (requiring the jury to 
consider whether another who participated in the crime and 
was not sentenced to death was "equally culpable ' as the 
defendant). Since this education will require that much of 
the evidence relating to the crime be entered at the 
penalty hearing and the defendant be allowed the 
opportunity to contest the government's account, in effect, 
the better part of a de facto separate guilt phase will be 
required at the severed penalty phase in any event. Given 
this, the added burden on governmental and judicial 
resources represented by a full, severed guilt phase is not 
nearly as great as it might otherwise appear. Cf. Lockhart 
v. McCree. 476 U.S. 162, 181 (1986) ("it seems obvious to 
us that in most, if not all, capital cases much of the 
evidence adduced at the guilt phase of the trial will also 
have a bearing on the penalty phase; if two different 
juries were to be required, such testimony would have to be 
presented twice, once to each jury"). 
 
Finally, if trial is severed at the penalty phase but not 
the guilt phase, one of the defendants -- the one for whom 
a new jury is empaneled to hear his sentencing hearing -- 
will lose a critical mitigating factor, residual doubt. a 
capital defendant's interest in being able to rely on the 
jury's lingering doubt about his participation in the crime 
(or his degree of participation) is so significant that it 
was one of the chief pillars of the Supreme Court's 
decision in Lockhart v. McCree, supra, which upheld the 
constitutionality of a unified capital trial such as the 
one conducted in this case. As the Court explained, 
"'[s]uch residual doubt has been recognized as an extremely 
effective argument for defendants in capital cases. To 
divide the responsibility . to some degree would eliminate 
the influence of such doubts."' Id. (quoting McCree v. 
Lockhart, 758 F.2d 226, 947-248 (8th Cir. 1985) (Gibson, 
J., dissenting)). 
 
Loss of this factor would be particularly critical to Mr. 
Nichols. As we showed above, the evidence against him is 
far weaker than that against Mr. McVeigh, and his relative 
culpability, even as alleged by the government, is far 
less. Given the horror of the crime, the jury's lingering 
uncertainty about Mr. Nichols' role may be the most 
significant mitigating factor that it would consider in the 
event a penalty hearing is necessary. 
 
The undisputed fact that Mr. Nichols was not at the scene 
of the crime and had no participation in the actual 
placement and detonation of the bomb on April 19 also means 
that there is substantial room for residual doubt (as well 
as reasonable doubt) about his intentions, even if the jury 
convicts him of a capital crime. The defendant's intention 
with respect to "resulting death" is a threshold finding 
that, under the federal statute, the penalty phase jury 
must find beyond a reasonable doubt before imposing the 
death penalty, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3591(a)(2), and for this 
reason lingering uncertainty about Mr. Nichols' intentions 
may play a particularly critical role in the event he is 
convicted of a capital offense. 
 
Accordingly, even if the preceding considerations are 
deemed insufficient by the Court to require guilt phase 
severance, to the extent that the Court agrees that the 
defendants' penalty phases should be severed completely and 
held before separate juries, the Court should sever at the 
guilt phase anyway. 
 
 
B. Special considerations unique to capital cases require 
heightened scrutiny of a capital defendant's motion for 
severance 
 
Two factors unique to capital trials dictate that Rule 14 
be construed to require heightened scrutiny of a capital 
defendant's motion for severance. These are the special 
role of Eighth Amendment values in capital proceedings. and 
the very different natures of the decisions and decision 
making processes of the jury at the guilt and penalty 
phases of a capital trial. We discuss these in turn, and 
then explain how together they require heightened scrutiny 
under Rule 14. 
 
 
1. In a capital case, Rule 14 should be construed in pari 
materia with the Eighth Amendment's requirements of 
individualized consideration and heightened reliability in 
fact finding and verdicts 
 
Two considerations, both unique to capital cases and both 
of constitutional dimension, must inform the court's 
decision about whether "it appears that a [capital] 
defendant . . . is prejudiced by a joinder" within the 
meaning of Rule 14 in a capital case. These are: (1) the 
requirement of heightened reliability of verdicts in 
capital cases, since in capital cases "the Eighth Amendment 
requires a greater degree of accuracy and fact finding than 
would be true in a noncapital case," Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 
U.S. 333. 342 (1993); and (2) the related requirement of 
truly individualized consideration prior to imposition of 
a death sentence -- a decision that must possess the 
"precision that individualized consideration demands," 
Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222, 231 (1992), to ensure that 
"each defendant in a capital case [is treated] with that 
degree of respect due the uniqueness of the individual." 
Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586,605 (1978). Only where these 
conditions are met has the Supreme Court been willing to 
find that the jury "has treated the defendant as a 
'uniquely individual human bein[g]' and . . . made a 
reliable determination that death is the appropriate 
sentence." Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) 
(quoting Woodson v. North Carolina 428 U.S. 280, 304 (1976) 
(plurality opinion)). 
 
These two factors are equally weighty considerations in 
determining the statutory question of how Zafiro's 
fact-specific "risk of prejudice" analysis applies to a 
federal capital defendant seeking severance under Rule 14 
at the guilt phase of her trial. The need for extra 
reliability in a capital case is not reduced (much less 
eliminated) simply because the federal court is determining 
the application of its own procedural rules rather than 
passing judgment over the constitutionality of state 
procedures in a habeas corpus proceeding. Indeed, absent 
the federalism concerns constraining a federal court's 
review of state procedures, a federal court applying its 
own rules has greater freedom -- and therefore greater 
responsibility -- to ensure, as the Supreme Court has 
admonished, that the procedures before it are fair, that 
the defendant's "specific trial rights" are not prejudiced, 
and that the jury's "judgments about guilt and innocence" 
are "reliable." Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. And "fairness," 
prejudice of "trial rights," and "reliability" in this 
context have been given specific and definite meanings by 
the Supreme Court in twenty years of death penalty 
jurisprudence, definitions that should control the federal 
courts' interpretation of their own rules no less than 
their interpretations of the constitutional proscription 
against cruel and unusual punishment used to regulate state 
procedures. 
 
The notion that statutes, and criminal procedural statutes 
in particular, should be interpreted in light of related 
constitutional values is hardly a novel one, since "[i]t is 
a commonplace . . . that 'constitutional policy can provide 
a valuable aid in determining the legitimate boundaries of 
statutory meaning."' National Treasury Employees Union v. 
Federal Labor Relations Authority, 986 F.2d 537, 539 (D.C. 
Cir. 1993) (quoting Singer, 2A Sutherland Statutory 
Construction Sec. 56.02 (4th ed. 1984)). See e.g. Gomez v. 
United States, 490 U.S. 858, 864 (1989) (interpreting the 
Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 631 et seq., in 
light of Article III and the Due Process Clause and holding 
that, as a matter of statutory construction and not 
constitutional law, voir dire was not among the duties that 
a magistrate could perform absent the defendant's consent); 
Gregorv v. Ashcroft. 501 U.S. 452, 459-460 (1991) (Tenth 
Amendment value protecting traditionally sensitive areas of 
state regulation mandates presumption that Congressional 
legislation not meant to "preempt the historic powers of 
the States" absent clear statement of intention to do so); 
Hall v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 30 F.3d 1304, 
1306-7 (10th Cir. 1994) (disagreeing with the Tax Court's 
limiting interpretation of a tax exemption provision for 
ministers because "the Tax Court's interpretation of Sec. 
1402(e) could arbitrarily and unconstitutionally interfere 
with the adherence to sincere religious beliefs of 
individuals," and interpreting provision to cover taxpayer 
because the "plain language of the statute does not 
preclude this sensible reading"). 
 
Indeed, as we noted above, the doctrine that criminal 
procedural rules should be interpreted in favorem vitae in 
a capital case dates to the English common law, and was an 
element of American jurisprudence -- including the American 
common law of severance -- from the beginning. United 
States v. Matthews, 26 F.Cas. 1205, 1206 (C.C. S.D.N.Y. 
1843) (recognizing special need for severance of a capital 
defendant to avoid spillover prejudice); see also United 
States v. Smith, 2 Mason 143, 27 F.Cas. 1167, 
1169(No.16,338)(C.C. Mass. 1820) (Story, J., in circuit) 
(recognizing the need for stricter adherence to the formal 
requirements of indictment pleading in capital cases) and 
other authorities cited at pages 12-14, supra. 
 
In granting a change of venue this Court has itself 
interpreted Fed. R. Crim. P. 21(a) in light of the Eighth 
Amendment's constraints on capital trials. United States v. 
McVeigh, 918 F.Supp. 1467, 1474 (W.D.Okla. 1996) (special 
role of jury in penalty phase requires venire not 
predisposed toward death sentence). Many other examples of 
statutory interpretation guided by underlying 
constitutional values could be adduced, but the point is 
clear: although interpreting the Rules of Criminal 
Procedure in light of the Supreme Court's constitutional 
death penalty jurisprudence may be novel, this is only 
because the post-Furman federal death penalty itself is 
novel. Construction of statutes by reference to related 
constitutional values is so far from unprecedented as to be 
an established canon of statutory construction. See 2B 
Sutherland Statutory Construction Sec. 56.04 (5th ed. 1992) 
("Constitutional policy"); Eskridge and Frickey, "Foreword: 
Law as Equilibrium," 108 Harv. L. Rev. 26, 81-87 (1994) 
(discussing role of constitutional values in statutory 
interpretation); id at 101-105 (listing cases). 
 
Equally noteworthy -- since this is a statutory and not a 
constitutional argument Congress itself has long recognized 
the need for special procedural protections in capital 
cases. Prior to the ratification of the Constitution, 
colonial legislatures distinguished capital from noncapital 
defendants for purposes of making counsel available, see 
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 61-63, 65 (1932), and, 
consistent with this practice, the First Congress provided 
for appointment of counsel for capital defendants in the 
same act that authorized capital punishment.29/ It did not 
make similar provision for noncapital defendants for almost 
another century. See Mallard v. United States District 
Court, 490 U.S. 296, 306 (1989) (discussing Act of July 20, 
1892, ch. 209, Sec. 1, 27 Stat. 252, codified at 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1915(d)). Moreover, Congress initially limited the 
federal right of appeal to capital cases. See Evitts v. 
Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 409 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., 
dissenting). Capital defendants have also had a special 
statutory right to early receipt of the government's 
witness list, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3432 dating to the First 
Congress, and special legislative protections for 
defendants accused of federal capital crimes continue to 
this day. See 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3005, 848(q)(4)-(10) (special 
provisions for appointment and funding of counsel, 
investigators and experts in capital cases). These sources 
demonstrate that interpreting Rule 14 to require heightened 
scrutiny of the effect of joinder on a capital defendant's 
case would be fully consistent with longstanding 
Congressional policy as well. 
 
The concerns for individualized consideration and reliable 
fact finding animating the Supreme Court's death penalty 
jurisprudence are therefore independently applicable and 
compelling where a district court must make the decision 
whether or not to sever a capital defendant under Rule 14 
in the guilt phase of a capital trial. Whether the 
operative legal provision is Rule 14 or the Eighth 
Amendment, the danger is the same: that the jury will treat 
the co-defendants "not as uniquely individual human beings, 
but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be 
subjected to the blind infliction of the death penalty." 
Woodson, 428 U.S. at 304. 
 
In the following subsections, we briefly canvass the Eighth 
Amendment values relevant to this case (Section I.B.1.a.) 
and show that these values must inform the procedures of 
the guilt phase of a capital trial as well as at the 
penalty phase (Section I.B. l.b.). 
 
 
a. The Eighth Amendment requires "individualized 
consideration" and "heightened reliability of fact finding" 
in a capital case 
 
In an unbroken string of cases beginning with Woodson v. 
North Carolina. 428 U.S. 280 (1976), the Supreme Court has 
held that individualized consideration of a defendant's 
arguments for being spared the death penalty is a sine qua 
non of a constitutional capital sentencing procedure. See 
e.g. Stringer. 503 U.S. at 230-31 (vague aggravating factor 
denied defendant "individualized consideration"); Parker v. 
Dugger. 498 U.S. 308, 322 (1991) (appellate court's failure 
to reweigh aggravating and mitigating factors after 
striking two aggravating factors failed to provide 
"individualized treatment"); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 
U.S. 738, 751 (1990) (reweighing required to provide 
individualized treatment); Lockett v. Ohio. 438 U.S. 586, 
605 (1978) (all mitigating factors must be considered by 
jury in order to accord respect due defendant as "uniquely 
individual human bein[g]"); Eddings v. Oklahoma 455 U.S. 
104 (1982). 
 
The requirement of individualized consideration of the 
whole person is rooted in the deeper lesson of Woodson -- 
that the unique finality of the death penalty requires a 
uniquely certain determination of the appropriateness of 
the penalty. "Death, in its finality, differs more from 
life imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from 
one of only a year or two. Because of that qualitative 
difference, there is a corresponding difference in the need 
for reliability in the determination that death is the 
appropriate punishment in a specific case." Woodson, 428 
U.S. at 305. The "individualized consideration" doctrine 
gives body to the principle that a defendant's life should 
be taken only where the fact finder is morally certain that 
she deserves to die, a conclusion that cannot and should 
not be based on a trial process that "interjects irrelevant 
considerations into the fact finding process." Beck v. 
Alabama. 447 U.S. 625, 642 (1980). 
 
Accordingly, the Supreme Court has consistently emphasized 
the heightened requirement of reliability in capital fact 
finding procedures. As Justice Marshall put it in Ford v. 
Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986), "[i]n capital proceedings 
generally, this Court has demanded that fact finding 
procedures aspire to a heightened standard of reliability. . . 
This especial concern is a natural consequence of the 
knowledge that execution is the most irremediable and 
unfathomable of penalties; that death is different." 151, 
at 411 (plurality opinion); see also Lankford v. Idaho, 500 
U.S. 110 (1991) (requiring notice of possibility that death 
penalty will be imposed to ensure accurate capital 
verdict); California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 998-999 (1983) 
(the Court "has recognized that the qualitative difference 
of death from all other punishments requires a 
correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital 
sentencing determination"); Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 
87 (1985) (Burger, C.J., concurring) ("In capital cases the 
finality of the sentence imposed warrants protections that 
may or may not be required in other cases"); see also e.g. 
Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 399 (1993) ("[i]n capital 
cases, we have required additional protections because of 
the nature of the penalty at stake"); Beck v. Alabama 447 
U.S. 625, 638 (1980) ("[W]e have invalidated procedural 
rules that tend to diminish the reliability of the 
sentencing determination. The same reasoning must apply to 
rules that diminish the reliability of the guilt 
determination"; note omitted). 
 
 
b. The "individualized consideration" and "heightened 
reliability of fact finding" requirements apply to the 
guilt phase of a capital trial 
 
Most of the cases discussing the individualized 
consideration and heightened reliability requirements have 
dealt with challenges to penalty phase procedures. It has 
long been clear, however, that the Supreme Court's concern 
with heightened reliability extends to the guilt phase of 
the trial as well. Well before the onset of the modem era 
of capital jurisprudence in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 232 
(1972), the Supreme Court recognized that capital 
proceedings required special procedural rules and 
protections not extended to noncapital defendants. In 
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), for example, the 
Court held that at least some capital defendants had a 
right to effective appointed counsel thirty years before 
extending that right to others accused of noncapital 
felonies. Compare Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 
(1963); see also Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.S. 640, 674 (1948) 
(no obligation on part of state court to inquire whether 
noncapital defendant wished to be represented by counsel; 
contrasting due process right of capital defendant to 
appointed counsel); Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 45-46 
(1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("It is in capital 
cases especially that the balance of conflicting interests 
must be weighted most heavily in favor of the procedural 
safeguards of the Bill of Rights"). 
 
More recently, recognizing that "[t]he quintessential 
miscarriage of justice is the execution of a person who is 
actually innocent," Schlup v. Delo. 115 S.Ct. 851, 866 
(1995), the modem Court also has imposed special procedural 
requirements on determinations of guilt and innocence in 
capital cases that it has not imposed in noncapital cases. 
As Justice Stevens explained in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 
625 (1980), "we have invalidated procedural rules that tend 
to diminish the reliability of the sentencing 
determination. The same reasoning must apply to rules that 
diminish the reliability of the guilt determination." L. at 
638 (note omitted). In Beck the Court held that the Eighth 
Amendment forbids imposition of a death sentence where the 
jury was denied the opportunity to find that the defendant 
was guilty of a lesser included noncapital offense that was 
rationally supported by the evidence. The problem with 
Alabama's capital punishment scheme (which did not allow 
lesser included offense instructions in capital cases) was 
that it "enhance[d] the risk of an unwarranted conviction," 
id. at 637, by distracting the jury from its overriding 
obligation to determine whether a defendant is among those 
that deserve to be eligible for death: 
 
 
In the final analysis the difficulty with the Alabama 
statute is that it interjects irrelevant considerations 
into the fact finding process, diverting the jury's 
attention from the central issue of whether the State has 
satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the defendant is guilty of a capital crime. L. at 642. 
 
 
Because of the magnitude of this "central issue," the Court 
held there to be a special Eighth Amendment right to a 
lesser included offense instruction in capital cases, even 
though no such right existed in noncapital cases. See id. 
at 637 ("we have never held that a defendant is entitled to 
a lesser included offense instruction as a matter of due 
process"). 
 
As the Court later explained, the Beck rationale was not 
limited to the specific issue of all-or-nothing jury 
instructions, but represented a more general principle 
requiring enhanced reliability in the jury's guilt phase 
determinations: "The element the Court in Beck found 
essential to a fair trial was not simply a lesser included 
offense instruction in the abstract, but the enhanced 
rationality and reliability the existence of the 
instruction introduced into the jury's deliberations." 
Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 455 (1984). Subsequent 
cases have reiterated the Supreme Court's belief that the 
potential danger of executing the "actually innocent," 
Schlup, 115 S.Ct. at 866, requires special guarantees of 
reliability where the conviction of a capital defendant is 
at issue. See e.g. Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U.S. 333, 342 
(1993) (in capital guilt phase "the Eighth Amendment 
requires a greater degree of accuracy and fact finding than 
would be true in a noncapital case"); Herrera v. Collins, 
506 U.S. 390, 399 (1993) ("[i]n capital cases, we have 
required additional protections because of the nature of 
the penalty at stake"); Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U.S. 648, 
669 (1987) (Powell, J., concurring) (reverse-Witherspoon 
case; declining to find harmless error because "[g]iven our 
requirement of enhanced reliability in capital cases, I 
would hesitate to conclude that the composition of the 
venire 'definitely' would have been the same"). 
 
Apart from its enshrinement as Supreme Court doctrine, the 
notion that the Eighth Amendment values of individualized 
consideration and extra-reliable verdicts apply at the 
guilt phase is unassailable as a matter of logic. Only 
defendants who are convicted of capital crimes are eligible 
in the first instance for the death penalty, and the Eighth 
Amendment would be a shadow protection if its only effect 
was on the death selection, but not the death eligibility, 
procedure. Furthermore, the jury that decides guilt or 
acquittal of the capital offense is well-aware of the 
sentencing implications of its decision -- in fact, much of 
voir dire is spent on imparting just that information. 
Having once committed itself to making the defendant 
eligible for death, this decision cannot but influence the 
penalty phase decision whether to actually impose the 
penalty. Empirical research on the decision making of 
capital juries bears out this common sense hypothesis. See 
Bowers, "The Capital Jury Project: Rationale, Design, and 
Preview of Early Findings," 70 Ind. L. J. 1043 (1995). For 
both these reasons, the Eighth Amendment would be toothless 
unless it also controlled during the guilt phase. 
 
The Supreme Court made both these points in Beck. The 
Alabama capital sentencing scheme at issue there placed 
ultimate sentencing responsibility with the judge, by 
requiring him to hold an evidentiary hearing following a 
capital conviction to determine whether or not the death 
sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment without 
parole. Beck, 447 U.S. at 62829 & n.4. The state therefore 
argued that the Eighth Amendment was satisfied because 
"even if a defendant is erroneously convicted, the fact 
that the judge has the ultimate sentencing power will 
ensure that he is not improperly sentenced to death." Id. 
at 645. The Court was "not persuaded": 
 
 
If a fully instructed jury would find the defendant guilty 
of a lesser, noncapital offense, the judge would not have 
the opportunity to impose the death sentence. Moreover, it 
is manifest that the jury's verdict must have a tendency to 
motivate the judge to impose the same sentence that the 
jury did. ... Under these circumstances, we are unwilling 
to presume that a post-trial hearing will always correct 
whatever mistakes have occurred in the performance of the 
jury's fact finding function. Id. at 645-46. 
 
 
In the federal capital scheme it iS the jury and not the 
judge that makes the ultimate decision, but the logic is 
the same. Since guilt phase proceedings directly influence 
(indeed make possible) the jury's decision whether or not 
to impose the death penalty, Eighth Amendment values must 
be respected during that phase as well. 
 
 
2. Because of the different purposes of the guilt and 
penalty phases of a capital trial, there is a substantial 
risk that evidence and arguments legitimately introduced at 
the guilt phase may be prejudicial and inadmissible in the 
penalty phase, and the danger that the jury will 
nevertheless consider this improper evidence and argument 
cannot be cured by limiting instructions 
 
The different purposes of the bifurcated guilt and penalty 
phases of a capital trial creates a dilemma that also 
requires special scrutiny of a capital defendant's guilt 
phase severance motion. 
 
As this Court has explained, the jury plays a very 
different role in the guilt and punishment phases of a 
capital trial, because "the decisions concerning guilt and 
punishment are dynamically different." 
 
 
To decide guilt of the offense charged, a jury analyzes 
factual evidence to determine whether it proves beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the accused committed the criminal 
acts with the requisite intent. That is an objective 
process. To decide between life and death in sentencing, 
the jury exercises subjective judgment. a guilty or not 
guilty verdict is an act of analysis. a penalty verdict of 
life or death is an act of conscience. Hopkinson v. 
Shillinger, 781 F.Supp. 737, 743 (D.Wyo. 1991) (Matsch, J., 
sitting by designation), aff'd. 954 F.2d 609 (10th Cir.), 
cert. denied. 502 U.S. 1067 (1992). 
 
 
Because the two phases serve such different purposes, 
evidence that has relatively little prejudicial impact at 
the guilt stage may take on enormous significance during 
the very different deliberations at the penalty phase. This 
is the teaching of United States v. McCullah, 76 F.3d 1087 
(10th Cir. 1996), which found the introduction of a coerced 
confession at the guilt phase of a capital trial to be 
harmless error, yet reversed the death sentence because of 
the prejudicial impact of this same evidence at the penalty 
phase of the trial. L. at 1101-02. 
 
Despite the different goals of the two phases, the same 
jury that hears the guilt phase evidence also decides 
whether or not to impose the death sentence in the penalty 
phase. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(b). As a result, in capital case 
tried pursuant to Sec. 3593, jurors deciding the death 
penalty question will frequently have heard evidence in the 
guilt phase that, although not sufficiently prejudicial to 
warrant severance at the guilt phase under the usual 
(noncapital) circumstances, is highly prejudicial and would 
warrant severance when considered in the context of the 
penalty deliberations. 
 
This is not a problem that can be solved by severing the 
joint trial at the penalty phase alone, because once the 
penalty phase jury has been "poisoned" by evidence or 
argument presented at the joint guilt phase, it is too late 
to avoid the risk that illicit prejudicial considerations 
will enter into the jury's penalty phase deliberations. 
Whether the attempted solution is seriatim penalty hearings 
before the same jury or empaneling one new jury to hear one 
of the defendant's penalty hearings, the problem remains: 
a jury that is exposed to sentencing prejudicial evidence 
or defenses in the guilt phase cannot wipe this from its 
mind at the penalty phase, even if that phase relates to 
only one of the two defendants.30/ Hence the wisdom of the 
Supreme Court of South Carolina's admonition: "We caution 
the trial bench when considering a capital defendant's 
motion to sever that the effect of a joint trial on each 
defendant at both the guilt and sentencing phases must be 
considered." State v. Howard, 295 S.C. 462, 473, 369 S.E.2d 
132, 138 (1988), cert denied, 490 U.S. 1113 (1989). 
 
The inevitability of this "spillover" of evidence between 
the guilt and penalty proceedings,31/ when combined with 
the very different nature of the judgment being rendered at 
the penalty phase, requires a much more exacting scrutiny 
of the potential for prejudice than is required in a 
noncapital case. When evaluating a capital defendant's 
motion to sever at the guilt phase the Court must consider 
not only the prejudicial impact of evidence introduced at 
the guilt phase on the guilt/innocence determination, but 
its prejudicial impact on the jury's later penalty phase 
deliberations as well. 
 
The potential conflict between guilt and penalty phase 
prejudice can arise in innumerable ways. One example of 
immediate relevance here is the differing prejudicial 
effects of antagonistic defenses at the two phases. As we 
explained above, Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's guilt phase 
defenses will be mutually exclusive, in the sense that "the 
acceptance of one party's defense would tend to preclude 
the acquittal of the other, or that the guilt of one 
defendant tends to establish the innocence of the other." 
United States v. Peveto, 881 F.2d 844, 857 (10th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 943 (1989); see Section I.A.1., 
supra. Only mutual antagonisms satisfying this strict test 
suffice to require severance. Id. At a penalty phase 
hearing, however, a much broader definition of prejudice is 
required to ensure a proceeding consistent with the Eighth 
Amendment. 
 
At the guilt phase, as in a noncapital case, the jury does 
not decide degrees of relative culpability. a defendant is 
guilty of a bank robbery regardless of whether she planned 
the crime, robbed the bank alone and kept all the loot 
herself, or whether she unwillingly but knowingly loaned 
her car to the person who actually performed the robbery to 
use as a getaway vehicle. But in the penalty phase, in 
which legal culpability is already established, it is 
relative culpability that matters.32/ As the Oklahoma Court 
of Criminal Appeals explained in Lafevers v. Oklahoma 819 
P.2d 1362 (Okl.Cr. 1991), "[u]nlike the first stage of a 
bifurcated trial, in the second stage [relative] 
culpability of the defendant is a critical issue." 819 P.2d 
at 1367. Describing a very typical joint penalty phase 
scenario, the court went on: 
 
 
In this case, neither defendant denied that the victim had 
been viciously treated. Instead, their attempt to avoid the 
death penalty focused on attempting to lessen their own 
participation in the events of that evening. The defense 
presented by defendant Cannon in mitigation to his own 
responsibilities for the events resulted in evidence that 
was directly aggravating to Appellant Lafevers. Again, the 
inherent problems involved when two defendants with 
mutually antagonistic defenses are put on trial together 
results in fundamental unfairness. The granting of separate 
trials would have solved this problem. Id. 
 
 
"[A]ttempting to lessen their own participation" in the 
crime by pointing their fingers at each other would 
probably not suffice to require severance as a matter of 
law at the guilt phase of a noncapital trial. See Section 
I.A. 1., infra. Nevertheless, this level of antagonism 
requires penalty phase severance, because the critical 
issue at the penalty phase is relative and not legal 
culpability. See Sections II.A. 1.-4., infra. 
 
If the penalty phase is reached, however, the jury will 
already have heard the antagonistic codefendants' attempts 
to pin the blame for the crime on each other and minimize 
their own role.33/ Regardless of whether this mutual 
finger-pointing meets the guilt phase standard for 
severance, there is a serious risk that it will have 
prejudiced the jury's ability to determine each defendant's 
culpability on the individual basis required by the Eighth 
Amendment at the subsequent penalty phase.34/ 
 
Thus, unless the trial court has the foresight to predict 
with confidence that limiting instructions at the penalty 
phase will suffice to cure any potential prejudice stemming 
from antagonistic guilt phase defenses and evidence, the 
court should sever at the guilt phase. Even making the 
questionable assumption that penalty phase problems 
originating in the guilt phase can be predicted with 
accuracy, however, the Court should not lightly conclude 
that instructions will suffice to cure the prejudice. It is 
one thing to hold (in a noncapital case) that limiting 
instructions are sufficient to guide the jury's "act of 
analysis" in distinguishing between the guilt or innocence 
of jointly tried defendants; it is quite another to assume 
that the same jury is capable of putting aside its 
recollection of the defendants' mutual accusations and 
recriminations once made at the guilt phase when engaging 
in the subjective "act of conscience," Hopkinson, 781 
F.Supp. at 743, of deciding whether either or both -- or 
which -- of two convicted defendants deserves to die. 
 
"Mutually antagonistic defenses" is only one example of the 
many types of argument and evidence that may have a 
differing impact at the guilt and penalty phases. The 
government's proposed partial introduction of Mr. Nichols' 
statement -- assuming arguendo that the Court finds it 
admissible in the guilt phase -- represents another 
example, since Mr. Nichols' right to place those parts in 
context by introducing the remainder of the statement would 
create an insurmountable conflict in the two defendants' 
penalty rights even if it passes muster in the guilt phase. 
Compare Section II.A.5. (discussing problem in penalty 
phase) with Section I.A.6.b. and c. (same problem in guilt 
phase). Other categories include inflammatory evidence -- 
which may be relevant to the guilt or innocence 
determination but irrelevant (or incidental) and highly 
prejudicial to the death determination -- and evidence of 
motive, which may be admissible for very different purposes 
at the guilt and penalty phases. Both of these types of 
evidence will be put in evidence in the event of a guilt 
phase at this trial. 
 
The general point is that before deciding that limiting 
instructions are an adequate substitute for guilt phase 
severance under Rule 14, the court must be convinced that 
these instructions can guarantee that evidence or arguments 
that are acceptable at the guilt phase, but prejudicial at 
the penalty phase, will not creep into the jurors' 
subjective and emotional penalty phase deliberations about 
whether the defendant deserves to live or die. 
 
 
3. Rule 14 should be construed strictly in favor of a 
capital defendant seeking severance 
 
Because Rule 14 must be construed in pari materia with the 
Eighth Amendment in a capital case, the requirements of 
individualized consideration and heightened reliability of 
verdicts are factors that should weigh heavily whenever a 
capital defendant moves for severance under Rule 14. 
Indeed, the core values protected by Rule 14 in a 
noncapital case already point toward the Eighth Amendment's 
heightened protections. The Zafiro Court explained these 
values -- avoiding serious risks to the defendant's 
"specific trial rights" and the jury's "reliable judgments 
about guilt or innocence" -- in terms that embody Eighth 
Amendment concerns in only slightly different language. 506 
U.S. at 539. The likelihood of spillover prejudice between 
the guilt and penalty phases and the difficulty of 
predicting and curing this spillover with limiting 
instructions similarly requires special vigilance of a 
joined capital defendant's rights. Finally, the Court's 
open-ended approach to the prejudice inquiry contemplates 
the possibility of novel claims of prejudice based on 
unprecedented situations -- including, presumably, the 
situation of a defendant charged under post-Furman death 
penalty legislation. See Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539 (noting 
that the "risk of prejudice will vary with the facts in 
each case, and district courts may find prejudice in 
situations not discussed here"). 
 
In a capital case, these considerations tilt the 
traditional balance among the competing considerations of 
judicial economy, consistent verdicts, individual rights 
and accurate judgments of guilt and innocence in a new 
direction. Given the extraordinary need for individualized 
consideration and more reliable jury verdicts in capital 
cases, given the potential prejudicial impact of guilt 
phase evidence on the ensuing penalty phase, given the 
uniform criticism which the routine joinder of defendants 
has been subject to, given the empirical evidence showing 
that jury confusion and prejudice are highly likely in 
joint trials, and given the minimal weight of the, 
efficiency rationale where the stakes are a defendant's 
life, risks to a defendant's trial rights that might be 
tolerable in a noncapital case cannot be tolerated where 
the stakes are death. 
 
 
a. Joint trial of capital defendants seriously risks the 
ability of the jury to give each defendant individualized 
consideration and make reliable judgments about guilt or 
innocence, and limiting instructions cannot be relied upon 
to cure the risk of prejudice 
 
Courts have never denied the risks posed to criminal 
defendants by joint trials. Joint trials significantly 
increase the opportunities for jury confusion and 
misunderstanding and create the likelihood of guilt by 
association. As Justice Jackson observed in his concurrence 
in Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949), "[a] 
co-defendant in a conspiracy trial occupies an uneasy seat. 
There generally will be evidence of wrongdoing by somebody. 
It is difficult for the individual to make his own case 
stand on its own merits in the minds of jurors who are 
ready to believe that birds of a feather are flocked 
together." W., at 454 (Jackson, J., concurring); see also 
United States v. Mardian, 546 F.2d 973, 977 (D.C. Cir. 
1976) ("The 'dangers of transference of guilt are such that 
a court should use 'every safeguard to individualize each 
defendant in his relation to the mass.' .... [Para.] 
Particularly where there is a great disparity in the weight 
of the evidence, strongly establishing the guilt of some 
defendants, the danger persists that that guilt will 
improperly 'rub off on the others") (quoting Kotteakos v. 
United States, 328 U.S.750, 774, 773 (1946)); United States 
v. Tootick, 952 F.2d 1078,1080 (9th Cir. 1991 ) 
(recognizing "some degree of bias inherent in joint 
trials"); United States v. Marszalkowski, 669 F.7d 655, 660 
(11th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 906(1982) ("Inherent in 
every joint trial is, of necessity, some degree of bias"). 
 
In Zafiro the Supreme Court addressed one possible source 
of prejudice in a joint trial, "mutually antagonistic or 
irreconcilable defenses," 506 U.S. at 538, and identified 
others: 
 
 
Such a risk might occur when evidence that the jury should 
not consider against a defendant and that would not be 
admissible if a defendant were tried alone is admitted 
against a codefendant. For example, evidence of a 
codefendant's wrongdoing in some circumstances erroneously 
could lead a jury to conclude that a defendant was guilty. 
When many defendants are tried together in a complex case 
and they have markedly different degrees of culpability, 
this risk of prejudice is heightened. Evidence that is 
probative of a defendant's guilt but technically admissible 
only against a codefendant also might present a risk of 
prejudice. Conversely, a defendant might suffer prejudice 
if essential exculpatory evidence that would be available 
to a defendant tried alone were unavailable at a joint 
trial. Id. at 539 (cites omitted). 
 
 
Each of these types of prejudice directly threatens a joint 
capital defendant's right to have the facts of his case 
considered individually, by "interject[ing] irrelevant 
considerations into the fact finding process, diverting the 
jury's attention from the central issue of whether the 
State has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a capital 
crime." Beck, 447 U.S. at 642. 
 
Of course, the Court also held in Zafiro that the remedy 
for each of these potential problems was committed to the 
broad discretion of the trial court, and that "less drastic 
measures [than severance], such as limiting instructions, 
often will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice." Id. 506 
U.S. at 539. The general rule is that courts presume such 
instructions to be effective. United States v. Wright, 932 
F.2d 868, 876 (10th Cir.), cert. denied. 502 U.S. 962 
(1991); United States v. Lane. 883 F.2d 1484, 1498 (10th 
Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1059 (1990). 
 
This presumption is based on a perceived practical 
necessity, however, and not on a factual conclusion about 
jurors' actual abilities to follow such instructions in 
every instance. "The rule that juries are presumed to 
follow their instructions is a pragmatic one, rooted less 
in the absolute certitude that the presumption is true than 
in the belief that it represents a reasonable practical 
accommodation of the interests of the state and the 
defendant in the criminal process." Richardson v. Marsh, 
481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987). 
 
Appellate courts acknowledge their lack of"absolute 
certitude" regarding the efficacy of limiting instructions 
by holding them to be inadequate protection of a 
defendant's trial rights in certain circumstances. See e.g. 
Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968); United States 
v. Butler, 494 F.2d 1246, 1256 (10th Cir. 1974) (reversing 
conviction for failure to sever defendant involved in only 
one of three conspiracies proved at trial). Moreover, as 
the Tenth Circuit has explained, these circumstances are 
not subject to precise definition. "The point at which an 
instruction no longer provides adequate protection and a 
severance must be granted is incapable of precise location. 
It must be determined in light of the facts of the 
particular case and with reference to the established rules 
otherwise governing joinder and severance." Butler, 494 
F.2d at 1256. 
 
The question presented in this capital case, therefore, is 
not whether limiting instructions can be presumed to "work" 
in some abstract sense, but whether, on the specific facts 
of this case, such instructions "represent[] a reasonable 
practical accommodation of the interests of the state and 
the defendant in the criminal process." Richardson, 481 
U.S. at 211. Because this is a capital case, the 
defendant's "interests" are defined in part by the Eighth 
Amendment values discussed above, and the peculiarities of 
the bifurcated capital trial structure is one of the 
"practicalities" that must be weighed in the balance. As 
this suggests. a very different "practical accommodation" 
of the different interests is required in capital cases. 
Limiting instructions cannot routinely be relied upon to 
cure the prejudice inherent in joint capital cases as they 
are in noncapital cases. 
 
Three additional factors also militate the conclusion that 
limiting instructions cannot be given their usual deference 
in a capital case: (1) Even in noncapital cases, the 
routine reliance on limiting instructions has long been 
criticized by attorneys, legal academics and social 
scientists as inadequate protection of joined defendants' 
rights; (2) reliance on limiting instructions obstructs the 
searching appellate review of capital verdicts that is a 
requirement of the federal death penalty scheme, 18 U.S.C. 
Sec. 3595, and the Eighth Amendment; and (3) several 
states, which have far greater experience with capital 
sentencing regimes than does the federal government, have 
adopted special severance rights for capital defendants 
either by legislation or judicial interpretation. We 
discuss these in turn below. 
 
 
(1) The presumption that limiting instructions cure the 
prejudice associated with joint trials has long been 
questioned even in noncapital cases 
 
"The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be 
overcome by instructions to the jury . . . all practicing 
lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction." Krulewitch v. 
United States, 336 U.S. 440, 453 (1946) (Jackson, J., 
concurring). It is a commonplace among practicing lawyers, 
academics and, occasionally, judges that despite their 
widespread use and approval, limiting instructions are 
frequently no more than "recommendation[s] to the jury of 
a mental gymnastic which is beyond, not only their powers, 
but anybody else's." Nash v. United States. 54 F.2d 1006, 
1007 (2d Cir.), cert. denied. 285 U.S. 556 (1932) (Hand, 
J.). Since the purpose of limiting instructions is to 
protect the rights of defendants, moreover, the burden of 
their failure falls exclusively on the trial rights of 
defendants. Joinder is therefore almost always considered 
a boon to the prosecution.35/ a fact that even prosecutors 
sometimes admit. Cf. Horowitz, Bordens and Feldman, "A 
Comparison of Verdicts Obtained in Severed and Joined 
Criminal Trials," 10 J. . Applied Social Psychology 444, 
446 & 456 n.1 (1980) (discussing joinder of charges) 
("Prosecutors will freely admit the joinder of strong and 
weak cases within a single indictment with the hope that 
the sheer amount of evidence presented cumulates, yielding 
a guilty verdict on at least some of the counts") (citing 
to authors personal communication with an Assistant United 
States Attorney). 
 
Apart from the complaints of trial lawyers, criticism of 
the routine reliance on limiting instructions has also come 
from treatise authors, see 1 Wright & Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure: Criminal 2d Sec. 223 (1982) (noting 
that the common interpretation of Rule 14 "points in a 
direction contrary to that in which many believe the law 
should go"), drafters of the Uniform Rules of Criminal 
Procedure, see Uniform Rule of Criminal Procedure 472 
(Approved Draft, 1974) (providing for a defendant's right 
to sever his case unless the court "determines that because 
of a significant risk that material evidence which cannot 
otherwise be preserved will be lost, the severance would 
defeat the ends of justice"), and the legal academy. See 
e.g. Dawson, "Joint Trials of Defendants in Criminal Cases: 
An Analysis of the Efficiencies and Prejudices," 77 Mich. 
L. Rev. 1379, 1381, 1452-55 (1979) (criticizing the 
"present blind preference for joint trials and the 
correlative barriers to severance" and suggesting 
alternatives); Calo, "Joint Trials, Spillover Prejudice, 
and the Ineffectiveness of a Bare Limiting Instruction," 9 
Am. I. Trial Advoc. 21, 30-31 (1985). 
 
Most relevant are the growing number of studies (based on 
extensive post-trial interviews with capital jurors) 
demonstrating that capital jurors in particular are often 
unable to understand and follow the judge's instructions. 
Luginbuhl and Howe, "Discretion in Capital Sentencing 
Instructions: Guided or Misguided?," 70 Ind. L. J. 1161 
(1995); Tiersma, "Dictionaries and Death: Do Capital Jurors 
Understand Mitigation?," 1995 Utah L. Rev. I (1995); 
Eisenberg & Wells, "Deadly Confusion: Juror Confusion in 
Capital Cases," 79 Cornell L. Rev. 1 (1993); see also 
Bienan, "Helping Jurors Out: Post-Verdict Debriefing for 
Jurors in Emotionally Disturbing Trials," 68 Ind. L. J. 
1333, 1346-47 (1993) (capital jurors confuse definitions of 
"mitigating" and "aggravating"). 
 
There is also an extensive social science literature on the 
capacity of jurors to follow judges' instructions to 
disregard prejudicial or inadmissible evidence, and it is 
unanimous in finding this capacity to be severely limited. 
See e.g. Pickman, "Inducing Jurors to Disregard 
Inadmissible Evidence: A Legal Explanation Does Not Help," 
19 Law & Human Behavior 407 (1995); Reifman, et al., "Real 
Jurors' Understanding of the Law in Real Cases," 16 Law & 
Human Behavior 539 (1992); Kramer, et al., "Pretrial 
Publicity, Judicial Remedies, and Jury Bias," 14 Law & 
Human Behavior 409, 430 (1990) ("Our results are completely 
consistent with prior research on the ineffectiveness of 
judicial cautionary instructions. An admonition from the 
judge to ignore all publicity had no effect on juror or 
jury verdicts."); see generally Affidavit of Dr. Edward J. 
Bronson (Exhibit A hereto). 
 
Most of the empirical research has focussed on joinder of 
criminal charges and not defendants. Nevertheless, this 
literature strongly supports the notion that jurors are 
unable to cabin their consideration of evidence in 
accordance with judicial instructions, since there is a 
marked tilt toward conviction on charges that are joined as 
compared to conviction on the same charges when they are 
severed even where the appropriate limiting instructions 
are given. Note, "Rethinking Criminal Joinder: An Analysis 
of the Empirical Research and Its Implications for 
Justice," 52 Law & Contemporary Problems 325 (1989) 
(canvassing research and literature); Bordens & Horowitz, 
"Joinder of Criminal Offenses: A Review of the Legal and 
Psychological Literature," 9 Law & Human Behavior 339, 340 
(1985); Tanford and Penrod, "Social Inference Processes in 
Juror Judgments of Multiple Offense Trials," 47 J. Personal 
& Social Psychology 749 (1984); Bordens and Horowitz, 
"Information Processing in Joined and Severed Trials," 13 
J. Applied Social Psychology 351 (1983); Horowitz, Bordens 
and Feldman, "A Comparison of Verdicts Obtained in Severed 
and Joined Criminal Trials," 10 J. Applied Social 
Psychology 444 (1980). 
 
The empirical research that has been performed on the 
effect of joinder of defendants in capital cases 
demonstrates a statistically significant increase in the 
imposition of the death penalty when defendants are joined 
in the capital sentencing phase. Two recent studies by 
Professor Edward J. Bronson strongly support this 
conclusion. Each involved 250-300 participants drawn from 
California county juror lists and college students, all of 
whom qualified for jury duty and all of whom were in 
addition "death-qualified" for the experiments. In both 
studies the "jurors" were informed that guilty verdicts had 
been returned against three capital defendants, and were 
provided with extensive descriptions of a penalty phase in 
which aggravating and mitigating evidence was presented. 
Some of the jurors were asked to rule on sentences for all 
three defendants (modeling a joint penalty phase) and 
others were given individual defendants to rule on 
(modeling severed penalty phases). The results showed a 
statistically significant increase in the decisions to 
execute in joined penalty phases. Follow-up interviews with 
the jurors demonstrated other highly prejudicial 
consequences for joined capital defendants, including a 
statistically significant difference in the importance 
jurors appeared to attribute to the mitigating life 
histories of joined versus severed defendants. See Bronson, 
"Severance of Co-Defendants in Capital Cases: Some 
Empirical Evidence," Discussion Paper Series No. 94-1 
(Department of Political Science, California State 
University, Chico) (1994); Affidavit of Dr. Edward J. 
Bronson (discussing the second study). 
 
These studies relate most directly to the extreme prejudice 
inherent in joint penalty phases. Nevertheless, it is a 
short inference from this evidence to the conclusion that 
jurors who are unable to treat joined defendants 
individually when making the paramount decision of whether 
they should live or die are unlikely to be better able to 
give them individual consideration at the guilt phase. 
 
Together with the consensus among trial lawyers and 
academics that limiting instructions are not as effective 
as their routine use warrants, the empirical evidence 
throws into serious question the continued validity of such 
routine use in capital cases. If "death is different," then 
questionable presumptions allowed to pass muster in the 
noncapital context should not automatically be transposed 
into a context where the stakes of an unfair trial are so 
much higher. 
 
 
(2) Reliance on limiting instructions to cure potential 
prejudice frustrates the appellate review of capital 
verdicts required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3595 and the Eighth 
Amendment 
 
The capital sentencing provisions applicable in this case 
provide for comprehensive appellate review of a death 
verdict. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3595. The statute provides that an 
appeal from a death verdict "shall have priority over all 
other cases," Sec. 3595(a); that "the court of appeals 
shall review the entire record in the case, including . . . 
the evidence submitted during the trial [at the guilt 
phase]," Sec. 3595(b)(1); and that the reviewing court 
"shall address all substantive and procedural issues raised 
on the appeal of a sentence of death, and shall consider 
whether the sentence was imposed under the influence of 
passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor." Sec. 
3595(c)(1). In other words, the appeals court in a capital 
case has a special duty to scrutinize the entire record and 
make an independent determination whether the decision for 
death was a rational moral judgment or the product of 
"passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor." Id. 
 
Section 3595 is intended to satisfy the Supreme Court's 
frequently-stated concern that death verdicts receive 
"meaningful appellate review" under the Eighth Amendment. 
"We have emphasized repeatedly the crucial role of 
meaningful appellate review in ensuring that death penalty 
is not imposed arbitrarily or irrationally." Parker v. 
Dugger, 498 U.S. 308, 321 (1991); see also Clemons v. 
Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 749 (1990) ("this Court has 
repeatedly emphasized that meaningful appellate review of 
death sentences promotes reliability and consistency"); 
Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 59 (1984) (Stevens, J., 
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (';in 
each of the statutory schemes approved in our prior cases, 
as in the scheme we review today, meaningful appellate 
review is an indispensable component of the Court's 
determination that the State's capital sentencing procedure 
is valid"); Zant v. Stephens. 462 U.S. 862, 879-80 & n.19 
(1983); Gregg v. Georgia 428 U.S. 153, 204-206 (1976); 
Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 942, 253 (1976); Dobbert v. 
Florida 432 U.S. 282, 295-96 (1977); Jurek v. Texas. 428 
U.S. 262, 276 (1976); see also United States v. McCullah, 
87 F.3d 1136, 1139 (10th Cir. 1996) (denying rehearing en 
bane) (finding that error was preserved below despite 
nonspecific nature of the objection in part because "[t]his 
is a capital case -- failure to say the 'magic words' 
should not result in the affirmance of a death sentence 
which might not otherwise have been imposed"). 
 
"Meaningful review" at the appellate level serves the same 
Eighth Amendment values that must be respected at the 
capital trial, individualized consideration and heightened 
reliability of capital decision making. The Supreme Court 
has upheld appellate "reweighing" of aggravating and 
mitigating factors to determine the appropriateness of the 
death penalty for defendants appealing death verdicts, for 
example, but only because the Court "conclude[d] that state 
appellate courts can and do give each defendant an 
individualized and reliable sentencing determination based 
on the defendant's circumstances, his background, and the 
crime." Clemons, 494 U.S. at 749. Such an "individualized 
and reliable [appellate] sentencing determination" cannot 
be made, however, unless the appellate court is able to 
scrutinize the record below as it relates specifically to 
the individual defendant. "[M]eaningful appellate review 
requires that the appellate court consider the defendant's 
actual record . . . [because] '[w]hat is important . . . is 
an individualized determination on the basis of the 
character of the individual and the circumstances of the 
crime."' Parker. 498 U.S. at 321 (quoting Zant v. Stephens, 
462 U.S. 862, 879 (1983)).36/ 
 
Review of a capital defendant's "actual" individual record 
is impossible, however, whenever evidence is admitted 
against one defendant but not the other in a joint capital 
trial. This is particularly true in cases like this one, in 
which much of the evidence admissible against only one 
defendant will be highly inflammatory. Similarly, when a 
defendant with questionable or minor culpability is joined 
for trial of a heinous crime with a codefendant against 
whom there is massive evidence, the question of whether the 
death verdict was improperly influenced by associational 
"spillover" prejudice cannot be answered on the 
individualized basis required in capital cases. In these 
situations-both present in this case -- the extent to which 
the jury's reasoned moral judgment has been swayed by "the 
influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary 
factor," Sec. 3595(c)(1), cannot be determined, because 
whether the jury's decision was based on improper 
consideration of the inadmissible and prejudicial evidence 
or other extraneous factors can be no more than a 
conjecture by the reviewing court. Regardless of whether 
this conjecture is proper in noncapital cases, see Wright, 
932 F.2d at 876 ("'we presume that the jury was able to 
follow the court's instructions and evaluate the evidence 
against each defendant independently'") (quoting United 
States v. Badia, 827 F.2d 1458, 1466 (11th Cir. 1987)), it 
is inconsistent with the dictates of Sec. 3595 and the 
Eighth Amendment's concern with 'meaningful appellate 
review" in this capital case.37/ 
 
Finally, although Sec. 3595 treats appeals from sentencing 
verdicts and not guilt verdicts, the "passion and 
prejudice" that it requires the appeals courts to review 
can have its source in either the guilt phase or the 
penalty phase. See Section I.B.2. In this case it is clear 
that many of the problems with inflammatory evidence and 
differing levels of culpability will arise in the guilt 
phase, and their prejudicial effects will not be erased 
from the jurors' minds in the penalty phase. Id. Thus, the 
reviewability concerns raised by Sec. 3595 and the Eighth 
Amendment's "meaningful appellate review" requirement tilt 
strongly in favor of severance at the guilt phase as well 
as the penalty phase. 
 
 
(3) State courts' experience with capital trials supports 
heightened scrutiny of joint capital trials 
 
In deciding how Eighth Amendment considerations should 
influence the analysis of a federal capital defendant's 
severance motion, the comparable practice of the states -- 
those "laboratories" of federalism, New State Ice Co. v. 
Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., 
dissenting) -- is instructive. The constitutional concern 
for individualized consideration and more reliable fact 
finding in capital cases is reflected in a number of 
states' treatment of the severance issue in their own 
capital cases, notably in states with large death row 
populations. 
 
Three states specially grant capital defendants an 
automatic right to sever their cases from codefendants, or 
shift the burden of proof in severance motions from the 
capital defendant to the state, in their rules of criminal 
procedure. See Ga. Code Ann. Sec. 17-8-4 ("When two or more 
defendants are jointly indicted for a capital offense, any 
defendant so electing shall be separately tried unless the 
state shall waive the death penalty"); Mississippi Uniform 
Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 9.04 ("The 
granting or refusing of severance of defendants in cases 
not involving the death penalty shall be in the discretion 
of the trial judge"); Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 99-15-47 ("Any 
of several persons jointly indicted for a felony may be 
tried separately on making application therefor, in capital 
cases"); Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 ("When two or 
more persons are jointly indicted for a capital offense, 
each of such persons shall be tried separately, unless the 
court orders the defendants to be tried jointly, upon 
application by the prosecuting attorney or one or more of 
the defendants, and for good cause shown"); see also Reaves 
v. Georgia. 242 Ga. 542, 545, 250 S.E.2d 376, 382 (1978) 
(rejecting an equal protection challenge by noncapital 
defendants to the special rules for capital defendants); 
Rigby v. Mississippi, 485 So.2d 1060 (Miss. 1986); Ohio v. 
Henry, 4 Ohio St.3d 44, 46, 446 N.E.2d 436, 438 (Ohio 
1983).38/ 
 
As the Supreme Court of Georgia has explained in connection 
with its special capital severance rights, "[i]t is too 
late in the history of capital punishment to argue that 
trials in which the death penalty is being sought are not 
different from other trials." Reaves. 242 Ga. at 545, 250 
S.E.2d at 382. In agreement with this principle, several 
courts sitting in jurisdictions that have not legislated 
special capital severance rights have nevertheless taken 
judicial cognizance of the need for special caution in the 
exercise of trial courts' discretion when a capital 
defendant requests severance.39/ See e.g. People v. Keenan, 
46 Cal.3d 478, 500, 250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 564, 758 P.2d 1081, 
1094 (Cal. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1012 (1990) 
(holding that "[s]everance motions in capital cases should 
receive heightened scrutiny for potential prejudice", but 
affirming joint trial on facts of the case); State v. 
Howard, 295 S.C. 462, 473, 369 S.E.2d 132, 138 (1988), cert 
denied, 490 U.S. 1113 (1989) ("We caution the trial bench 
when considering a capital defendant's motion to sever that 
the effect of a joint trial on each defendant at both the 
guilt and sentencing phases must be considered"); McDaniel 
v. Arkansas, 278 Ark. 631, 639, 648 S.W.2d 57, 60 (1983) 
("[W]here the defenses are antagonistic, particularly in 
capital cases, careful consideration should be given to all 
factors which weigh for or against achieving substantial 
justice"); Lafevers v. Oklahoma 819 P.2d 1362, 1364-67 
(Okl.Cr. 1991) (error to deny severance at both guilt and 
penalty phases based on mutually antagonistic defenses); 
see also Day v. Maryland, 196 Md. 384, 391, 76 A.9d 729, 
732 (1950) (pre-Furman case granting severance to capital 
defendant based on mutually antagonistic defenses because 
of jury's special role in weighing relative culpability 
when making death sentencing determination); People v. 
Smallwood, 42 Cal.3d 415, 430, 722 P.2d 197, 206, 228 
Cal.Rptr. 913, 923 (1986) (discussing severance of charges) 
("there remains the fact that this case is a capital one, 
'carrying the gravest possible consequences ....' This 
factor should have prompted the trial court to 'analyze the 
severance issue with a higher degree of scrutiny and care 
than is normally applied in a noncapital case"') (quoting 
Williams v. Superior Court, 36 Cal.3d 431, 454, 204 
Cal.Rptr. 700, 683 P.2d 699, 707 (1984)); North Carolina v. 
Hucks, 323 N.C. 574, 581-84, 374 S.E.2d 240, 245 47 (1988) 
(jury instructions unavailing where same jury asked to 
serve simultaneously as guilt phase jury for defendant and 
sentencing jury for codefendant who had pleaded guilty). 
 
Still other courts have exhibited a heightened sensitivity 
to the prejudicial potential of joint capital trials 
without expressly discussing the significance of the 
capital nature of the charges. See e.g. Neill v. Oklahoma, 
827 P.2d 884, 886-890 (Okl.Cr. 1992) (reversing for failure 
to sever where mutually antagonistic defenses became 
apparent at trial); Woodruff v. Oklahoma, 825 P.2d 273, 
274-75 (Okl.Cr. 1992) (same); Romano v. Oklahoma, 827 P.2d 
1335, 1337-38 (Okl.Cr. 1992) (same). Many of the state 
cases discussing or exhibiting this heightened sensitivity 
have focussed on one of the grounds Mr. Nichols advances 
for severance here, the special problems created when two 
capital defendants present mutually antagonistic defenses. 
See e.g. McDaniel, supra; Neill, supra; Woodruff, supra; 
Romano, supra; Lafevers, supra; Day, supra. 
 
Finally, there are states in which as a matter of common 
practice capital cases are simply not tried jointly. Johnny 
Holmes, the District Attorney of Harris County, Texas, for 
example, recently stated to Dick DeGuerin that he cannot 
recall a single joint capital trial tried in Texas.40/ 
While information about prosecutorial and judicial practice 
is difficult to quantify for obvious reasons, it is 
significant that a very knowledgeable and active 
participant in capital proceedings has no recollection of 
a joint capital trial in a state with among the largest 
death row populations.41/ 
 
In sum, the basic lesson of twenty years of state courts' 
attempts to reconcile the dictates of the Eighth Amendment 
with the problems arising at joint capital trials is that 
the requests of capital defendants for severance must 
receive significantly closer scrutiny and consideration 
than similar requests of noncapital defendants. 
 
 
b. The burden should be on the government to prove beyond 
a reasonable doubt that joint trial of a capital defendant 
will not "compromise a specific trial right of one of the 
defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable 
judgment about guilt or innocence" 
 
Two terms ago the Supreme Court stated that "it is quite 
consistent with our jurisprudence to give content through 
a burden of proof to the understanding that fundamental 
injustice would result from the erroneous conviction and 
execution of an innocent person." Schlup v. Delo, 115 S.Ct. 
851, 866 n.43 (1995). In a capital prosecution of two 
defendants who are presumed innocent,42/ the burden should 
be on the government to establish that measures short of a 
separate trial will be sufficient to eliminate the risks of 
losing the "specific trial right" to individualized 
consideration and of an erroneous capital conviction. 
Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. 
 
"The function of a standard of proof, as that concept is 
embodied in the Due Process Clause and in the realm of fact 
finding, is to 'instruct the fact finder concerning the 
degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in 
the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular 
type of adjudication."' Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 
423 (1979) (quoting In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 370 (1970) 
(Harlan, J., concurring)). Moreover, "due process places a 
heightened burden of proof on the State in . . . 
proceedings in which the 'individual interests at stake . . . 
are both 'particularly important' and 'more substantial 
than mere loss of money."' Cooper v. Oklahoma, 116 S.Ct. 
1373, 1381 (1996) (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 
745, 756 (1982)). 
 
The "particular importance" of a capital defendant's 
interest in life is obvious, and the defendant's Eighth 
Amendment interests in individualized consideration and 
extra-reliable fact finding mandate a far higher "degree of 
confidence . . . in the correctness of factual 
conclusions," Addington, 441 U.S. at 423, in capital 
adjudications than is required of noncapital fact finding. 
On the other hand, the government's interests in conducting 
a joint capital trial are the same as its interests in any 
other noncapital case -- efficiency and "avoiding the 
scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts." Richardson, 
481 U.S. at 210; see also Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. Indeed, 
the government shares the defendant's interest in accurate 
fact finding and just verdicts, particularly, one hopes, in 
a capital case. 
 
The balance of interests arrayed around the severance 
determination in a capital case therefore tilts decisively 
in the direction of the extra reliability and 
individualized consideration provided by separate trials. 
The fact that "[i]nherent in every joint trial is, of 
necessity, some degree of bias," Marszalkowski, 669 F.2d at 
660, cannot be blithely accepted as a necessary evil when 
a defendant is to be jointly tried for his life, nor can 
limiting instructions routinely be deemed a "reasonable 
practical accommodation of the interests of the state and 
the defendant in the [capital] criminal process." 
Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211. 
 
The different balance of interests suggests a different 
approach to the Rule 14 determination: where a joint 
capital trial involves one of the circumstances recognized 
by the Supreme Court as creating a potential for prejudice 
introduction of evidence admissible against less than all 
defendants, significantly differing degrees of culpability, 
unavailability of exculpatory evidence, or antagonistic 
defenses, see Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539 -- the burden should 
shift to the government to demonstrate that some remedial 
measure short of severance is sufficient to guarantee that 
the risk of prejudice is eliminated. 
 
Because of the inevitability of some prejudice at a joint 
trial in these circumstances, the government's position at 
a joint capital trial where one of these circumstances is 
present most closely resembles its position when arguing 
for harmless error on appeal from a conviction. While not 
precisely identical,43/ in both situations the defendant's 
interest in fair and accurate trial procedures has been 
presumptively violated absent the clearest showing that the 
violation did not in fact prejudice him in any way. Given 
this similarity and the overriding significance of the 
capital defendant's interests in life and individualized 
consideration, the harmless error burden of proof should 
also be imposed here. Where a jointly indicted capital 
defendant moves for severance, the government should have 
the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that 
no "specific trial rights" of the capital defendant will be 
infringed and that nothing that will occur at the joint 
trial will "prevent the jury from making a reliable 
judgment about guilt or innocence." Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 
539. 
 
This case is among the first to present Rule 14 issues in 
a post-Furman capital context. The arguments we present, 
like those in our venue motion, ask this Court to look at 
old rules in the informing light of new law. There have 
been relatively few joint federal capital prosecutions in 
the modem era and, to our knowledge, our argument has not 
been made in those joint prosecutions which have been 
brought. Nevertheless, nothing in the text, Advisory 
Committee Notes or common law background of the rule 
precludes interpreting it in this manner in the novel 
context of a joint capital prosecution. Indeed, the 
pre-Rules cases support stricter scrutiny of capital 
severance motions, as we have shown above, and even the 
noncapital authorities speak not at all to the placement of 
the burden of proof. See Rule 14, Fed. R. Crim. P.; 
Advisory Committee Note (1944 Adoption); Stilson v. United 
States, 250 U.S. 583, 585-86 (1919); United States v. Ball, 
163 U.S. 662, 672 (1896); United States v. Marchant, 25 
U.S. (12 Wheat.) 480, 485 (1827). 
 
It is true that the Supreme Court has recently expressed a 
"preference" for joint trials of defendants who have been 
indicted together. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537; see also 
Richardson, 481 U.S. at 209. However, these cases make 
clear that this "preference" is based, as Justice Scalia 
has explained, on a "practical accommodation of the 
interests of the state and the defendant in the [capital] 
criminal process," Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, and not on 
any fixed interpretation of Rule 14 (an interpretation 
which would run counter both to the common law historical 
background of the rule and the Supreme Court's recent 
emphatic command that criminal procedural rules be 
interpreted as written, see Carlisle v. United States, 116 
S.Ct. 1460 (1996)). Neither Zafiro nor Richardson were 
capital cases,44/ and they therefore could not and did not 
address what "practical accommodation' might be acceptable 
under Rule 14 in a capital case. 
 
For the reasons stated above, this 'practical 
accommodation" should be a presumption of separate trials 
which may be overcome if the government can show beyond a 
reasonable doubt that limiting instructions will be 
sufficient to provide the same protection of the capital 
defendant's "specific trial rights" and right to have the 
jury make a "reliable judgment about guilt or innocence," 
Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539, that would be provided by a 
severance. That burden cannot be met here. See Section 
I.A., supra. 
 
 
c. In the alternative, even if the burden is not placed on 
the government, the Court should exercise its discretion 
with particular caution to ensure that a capital 
defendant's trial rights are not compromised and that the 
jury will be capable of making a truly reliable judgment 
about guilt or innocence in a joint trial 
 
Regardless of whether the burden is placed on the 
government or Mr. Nichols, it is clear that the foregoing 
considerations mandate that the Court exercise its 
discretion to sever with special care in this capital case. 
 
The doctrinal linchpin of the vast number of appellate 
decisions affirming denials of defendants' motions to sever 
is the very broad discretion afforded to trial courts to 
fashion the appropriate remedy under Rule 14 where it 
"appears that a defendant . . . is prejudiced by a 
joinder." From the early years of the Republic, this 
discretion was understood to include a special 
solicitousness where a joined defendant's life was at 
stake. See United States v. Matthews, 26 F.Cas. 1205, 1206 
(C.C. S.D.N.Y. 1843) (Betts, J.) ("In a capital case, and 
in favor of life, I am disposed to secure every protection 
to the prisoner against the influence of testimony not 
strictly applicable to him, and shall therefore order trial 
of the [capital] prisoner Brown, on his plea, to be 
separated from that of his associates"). Even the Supreme 
Court's recent pronouncement of a "preference" for joint 
trials, Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537, must be read in connection 
with its simultaneous acknowledgment of the various 
situations that do pose a cognizable risk of prejudice in 
a joint trial, and its reaffirmation of the principle that 
in these situations Rule 14 "leaves the tailoring of the 
relief to be granted, if any, to the district court's sound 
discretion." Id. at 539. Again, it is relevant here as well 
that the Court explicitly recognized the open-ended nature 
of the Rule 14 "prejudice" inquiry. Id. 
 
Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate for this Court to 
take the capital context of this case -- including both the 
Eighth Amendment values and potential conflict between the 
goals of the guilt and penalty phases discussed previously 
into account in exercising its discretion to grant a 
capital defendant's severance motion. Even if the burden is 
placed on Mr. Nichols, when these capital considerations 
are added to the specific forms of prejudice certain to 
arise in this case, see Section I.A., supra, it is clear 
that severance is required. 
 
 
C. In the circumstances of this case a joint trial would 
violate Mr. Nichols' Eighth Amendment rights 
 
We explained previously that the Eighth Amendment's 
requirements of individualized consideration and heightened 
reliability in fact finding applies to the guilt phase of 
trial as well as the penalty phase. Section I.B. I., supra. 
This means that in at least some situations the prejudice 
attending a joint trial of capital defendants will render 
the proceeding inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, cf. 
United States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d 861, 1996 WL 377046, at 
*29 (4th Cir. July 8, 1996) (Eighth Amendment imposes 
constraints on severance decision at penalty phase), and 
arguably the Due Process Clause as well. See Brinkman, 
Note, "The Presumption of Life: A Starting Point for a Due 
Process Analysis of Capital Sentencing," 94 Yale L. J. 351 
(1984) (arguing for a Due Process Clause approach to 
capital sentencing issues as an alternative to the Furman 
Eighth Amendment analysis). The doctrine of "infavorem 
vitae" discussed previously was sufficiently entrenched in 
the common law understanding at the founding that it is 
reasonable to assume that the authors of the Due Process 
Clause understood "due process" to incorporate this basic 
principle of fairness. See Matthews, 26 F.Cas. at 1206; see 
also authorities cited at pages 12-14, supra. 
 
Assuming arguendo that a constitutionally fair joint trial 
of capital defendants is possible in principle, it is clear 
that this is not such a case. The many forms of potential 
prejudice identified above -- arising from mutually 
antagonistic defenses; the introduction of inflammatory 
evidence inadmissible as to Mr. Nichols; different levels 
of culpability; the likelihood of prejudicial jury 
confusion arising from their subtly different political 
views; the likely inadmissibility of some of Mr. McVeigh's 
statements to Michael Fortier about Mr. Nichols; and the 
Bruton problem and the related conflicts between Mr. 
Nichols' right to introduce his entire statement if the 
government seeks to use any part of it at trial and Mr. 
McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights, see Sections 
I.A.1.-6., supra -- virtually guarantee that the jury will 
be prevented from providing Mr. Nichols with the 
individualized consideration and reliable verdict required 
by the Constitution. Nor can limiting instructions be 
relied upon to avoid constitutional prejudice to the same 
degree as they can in a noncapital case. Section 
I.B.3.a.(1), supra. If the joint trial results in a capital 
conviction, appellate scrutiny to determine whether the 
likelihood of prejudice was realized will be stymied. 
Section I.B.3.a.(2). 
 
Thus, beyond his statutory right to severance, in these 
circumstances a joint trial will violate Mr. Nichols' 
Eighth Amendment rights as well. 
 
 
D. In the alternative, the Court should empanel dual juries 
to hear each defendant's case individually 
 
If the Court does not find guilt phase severance 
appropriate on the preceding grounds) we request that it 
empanel dual juries to hear the two defendants' case 
simultaneously, except when evidence admissible against 
only one of the two defendants is being introduced. The use 
of dual juries in federal criminal cases have been 
sustained by appellate courts, albeit with some hesitation. 
See e.g. United States v. Lebron-Gonzalez, 816 F.2d 823 
(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 843 (1987); United 
States v. Lewis, 716 F.2d 16 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 464 
U.S. 996 (1983); United States v. Rimar, 558 F.2d 1271 (6th 
Cir. 1977), cert. denied. 434 U.S. 984 (1977); United 
States v. Haves, 676 F.2d 1359 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 
459 U.S. 1040 (1982); see generally Annotation, "Propriety 
of Use of Multiple Juries at Joint Trial of Multiple 
Defendants in Federal Criminal Case," 72 A.L.R. Fed. 875 
(1985). 
 
Whatever the potential for jury confusion and prejudice 
that attends a joint prosecution tried before dual juries, 
it is still less than the jury confusion and prejudice that 
will result if this case is tried jointly before one jury. 
Accordingly, we request in the alternative that dual juries 
be empaneled. 
 
 
POINT II 
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SEVERANCE SHOULD BE GRANTED AT THE 
PENALTY PHASE 
 
We have already identified some of the guilt phase factors 
which may so prejudice any ensuing penalty phase in this 
case that guilt phase severance is the only realistic 
protection for Mr. Nichols' penalty phase rights. See 
Section I.B.2. (discussing problem of prejudicial 
"spillover" between guilt and penalty phases). The scope 
and quantity of potentially prejudicial evidence and 
antagonism that will be introduced at the guilt phase, 
however, pales in comparison to what is certain to occur at 
a joint penalty phase. Accordingly, if severance is not 
granted at the guilt phase, it should be granted at the 
penalty phase and sentencing hearings should be held before 
separate juries. 
 
This Court has well described the fundamental difference 
between the guilt and penalty phases: "A guilty or not 
guilty verdict is an act of analysis. A penalty verdict of 
life or death is an act of conscience." Hopkinson. 781 
F.Supp. at 743. Unlike the guilt phase verdict, the 
life-or-death decision made in the penalty phase is a moral 
judgment about the intrinsic worth of a specific human 
life, a decision, as the Supreme Court has emphasized 
repeatedly, that can only be made on the basis of the most 
individualized scrutiny of the particulars of that life. 
 
The potential risks to a fair trial identified in the 
preceding sections are maximized in this delicate context, 
for two reasons. First, there is an inherent tension 
between the highly individualized consideration of each 
defendant required in the penalty phase on one hand and a 
joint hearing's unavoidable tendency toward amalgamation 
and/or comparison of the defendants' situations in the 
minds of jurors on the other. The result is a series of 
conflicts, some of which we discuss below, pitting one 
defendant's constitutional and statutory rights against the 
right of the codefendant to individualized treatment by the 
sentencer. 
 
Second, because the relevant facts to be litigated and 
decided in a capital sentencing hearing are potentially 
numberless, the issues before the sentencer are 
exponentially more complex than at the guilt phase and the 
opportunity for prejudicial error that much greater. See 
McCleskey v. Kemp. 481 U.S. 279, 294 (1987) ("the 
Constitution requires that [the jury's capital sentencing] 
decision rest on innumerable factors that vary according to 
the characteristics of the individual defendant and the 
facts of the particular capital offense"); California v. 
Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 1008 (1983) (referring to the "myriad 
of factors" which determine sentencer's on choice between 
life and death); Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 900 (1983) 
(Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing "the countless 
considerations" weighed by capital sentencing authorities). 
Especially when it is kept in mind that these factors do 
not admit of the rational categorical analysis appropriate 
when guilt or innocence are determined, Hopkinson, supra, 
it is clear that limiting instructions cannot be relied 
upon to the same extent to guide the jurors"'act of 
conscience" at the penalty phase as they can at the guilt 
phase. 
 
Against these considerations, concerns about the efficient 
allocation of government resources are at a minimum in a 
proceeding whose sole purpose is to pass life-or-death 
judgment on a person. As the Fourth Circuit recently put 
it, "More important of course than any consideration of 
inconvenience or possible unfairness to the Government from 
sequential separate trials are the possibilities of 
unfairness to the accused persons from a joint 
penalty-phase trial -- specifically the threat posed to 
individualized consideration of their situations, and in 
particular the quite different mitigating factors relevant 
to each." United States v. Tipton. 90 F.3d 861, ---, 1996 
WL 377046, at *29 (4th Cir. July 8, 1996).45/ 
 
Together these considerations would make any joint penalty 
hearing a morass of potential unfairness and prejudicial 
error. Regardless of whether a fair joint death-sentencing 
proceeding could ever be held, however -- a question that 
the Court is not called upon to answer here -- it is 
abundantly clear in this case that the mutual antagonism of 
the defendants (which will only be heightened in the 
penalty phase), the prejudicial evidence that will be 
entered against Mr. McVeigh, the existence of a statement 
by Mr. Nichols implicating Mr. McVeigh in the crime, and 
the political overtones of the government's prosecution 
theory combine to make it impossible to protect Mr. 
Nichols"'specific trial rights" and his paramount right to 
a reliable, individualized sentencing verdict, Zafiro, 506 
U.S. at 539, at a joint penalty phase. See Section II.A., 
infra. 
 
Moreover, these rights cannot be protected by seriatim 
penalty proceedings before the same jury -- a procedure 
that is likely to exacerbate rather than relieve the 
prejudice. Accordingly, Mr. Nichols' penalty phases, if 
any, should be held before a different jury than the one 
that hears Mr. McVeigh's sentencing case. Section II.B., 
infra. 
 
 
A. A joint penalty phase would violate Mr. Nichols' 
constitutional rights 
 
1. The defendants' mutually antagonistic penalty phase 
defenses make a fair joint penalty phase an impossibility 
 
We argued in Point I that the mutual antagonism between the 
defenses of the two defendants makes a fair guilt phase 
impossible in this case. It is even more clear that the 
antagonism makes a fair penalty phase impossible. 
 
Indeed, unlike in a joint guilt phase, potentially 
prejudicial antagonism is inherent in the very fact of a 
joint penalty phase. In a joint penalty phase, the jury's 
verdict is no longer dependent on a categorical finding of 
guilt, but on, among other factors, an evaluation of each 
defendant's degree of"relative participation" in the 
offense. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3592(a)(3) (requiring jury to 
consider in mitigation whether "the defendant's 
participation [in the crime] was relatively minor, 
regardless of whether the participation was so minor as to 
constitute a defense to the charge"); see also Lafevers v. 
Oklahoma, 819 P.2d 1362, 1367 (Okl.Cr. 1991) ("[u]nlike the 
first stage of a bifurcated trial, in the second stage 
[relative] culpability of the defendant is a critical 
issue'); Day v. Maryland, 196 Md. 384, 391-92, 76 A.2d 729, 
732 (1950) (discussing difference between culpability 
determination in two phases). The verdict also depends in 
part on the consistency and fairness of imposing the death 
sentence on the defendant in light of the sentences imposed 
on other participants in the same crime. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 
3592(a)(4) (requiring jury to consider in mitigation 
whether "[a]nother defendant or defendants, equally 
culpable in the crime, will not be punished by death"). 
 
Because these mitigating factors are implicitly or 
explicitly comparative, competition between capital 
defendants is built into a joint penalty proceeding. In 
this case, for example, if Mr. Nichols is convicted of the 
capital crime, it will be his constitutional and statutory 
right to argue in mitigation that he played no more than a 
very minor role in the crime and that he is by no account 
as "equally culpable" as Mr. McVeigh. These arguments will, 
of necessity, involve proof of Mr. McVeigh's major role in 
the bombing and of his far greater culpability. Mr. 
Nichols, in other words, will quite certainly become a 
"second prosecutor" of Mr. McVeigh in the penalty phase, 
and it can be anticipated that Mr. McVeigh will seek to 
minimize his own role and culpability by the same means 
against Mr. Nichols. 
 
The prospect of two defendants dropped into the penalty 
phase arena for a (literal) fight to the death is 
disturbing enough. It is made more disturbing, however, by 
the significant constraints on the Court's ability to 
control the resulting prejudice. Capital defendants have a 
constitutional right to present any and all relevant 
mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury, Lockett. supra; 
Eddings, supra and the greater participation and 
culpability of the other defendant constitute such 
mitigating evidence. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3592(a)(3), (4). 
Furthermore, the Rules of Evidence do not apply at the 
penalty phase. Sec. 3593(c). While the Court retains 
latitude to control the introduction of unduly prejudicial 
or confusing "information," id., the additional Eighth 
Amendment dimension when a codefendant is presenting his 
mitigation case means that this latitude is more cabined 
during the defense cases. See id. ("The defendant may 
present any information relevant to a mitigating factor") 
(emphasis added). Mr. Nichols has a constitutional right, 
for example, to introduce Mr. McVeigh's admissions to the 
Fortiers, and arguably his other written statements as well 
even if they are deemed to be hearsay as to him. Green v. 
Georgia 442 U.S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (capital 
defendant had right to introduce codefendant's confession 
in mitigation even though inadmissible under state hearsay 
rules). 
 
The net result is that the Court's penalty phase 
evidentiary rulings must attempt to thread their way 
between the prejudicial introduction of inculpatory 
evidence by Mr. Nichols against Mr. McVeigh on one side and 
the prejudicial denial of Mr. Nichols' right to make his 
mitigation case on the other (and likewise for Mr. 
McVeigh's case against Mr. Nichols as well). Even assuming 
arguendo that rulings which pay sufficient respect to both 
horns of this dilemma will be possible -- a proposition 
which is far from clear, and which cannot be predicted in 
advance of the penalty hearing itself -- the likelihood of 
prejudicial error in these circumstances is obviously 
great. 
 
Accordingly, even more than at the guilt phase, the 
mutually antagonistic positions of the two defendants at 
the penalty phase create a certainty of prejudice and 
mandate severance. 
 
 
2. The defendants' antagonistic defenses create a conflict 
between each defendant's due process rights to notice and 
a meaningful opportunity to rebut the information used to 
sentence him to death and the other's right not to disclose 
his penalty phase strategy to their adversaries until trial 
 
One of the most consistent threads of the Supreme Court's 
constitutional jurisprudence of capital punishment is "the 
elemental due process requirement that a defendant not be 
sentenced to death 'on the basis of information which he 
had no opportunity to deny or explain."' Skipper v. South 
Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 5 n. 1 (1986) (quoting Gardner v. 
Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 362 (1977)). This requirement has 
been applied to strike down death sentences imposed after 
the prisoner was denied fair notice of the facts used to 
sentence him to death, Gardner, supra or of the issues 
which he would be expected to meet at the penalty hearing. 
Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U.S. 110 (1991). Congress has 
codified the constitutional right to notice in the 
requirement of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(a) that the Government 
provide written pretrial notice of both the statutory and 
nonstatutory aggravating factors upon which it intends to 
rely as the basis for a sentence of death. See also 18 
U.S.C. Sec. 3432 (capital defendant has right to list of 
witnesses's names and addresses at least three days prior 
to trial). 
 
However, no such notice provisions exist to ensure that a 
capital defendant will have a fair opportunity to 
investigate and rebut the harmful information placed before 
the sentencing jury by his codefendant. And because such 
evidence will be propounded by defendants on trial for 
their own lives and unconstrained by the rules of 
prosecutorial ethics which are supposed to limit the 
adversarial zeal of the government's attorneys, see Berger 
v. United States. 295 U.S. 78 (1935), there is an 
especially grave risk that harmful evidence from the 
codefendants will be injected into the decision-making 
process without being subjected to "the adversarial testing 
process" upon which our system of justice relies "to 
produce a just result under the standards governing 
decision." Strickland v. Washington. 466 U.S. 668, 687 
(1984). Commonwealth v. Foster, 827 S.W.2d 670, 680-682 
(Ky. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 921 (1992) (reversing 
death sentence imposed at joint penalty phase hearing where 
co-defendant's counsel "act[ed] as a second prosecutor" in 
pursuing claim of duress, and supported his client's case 
in mitigation by prejudicial allegations concerning 
defendant). 
 
On the other hand, there is no authority for requiring a 
capital defendant to disclose his penalty phase defense 
prior to trial, and indeed to require such disclosure would 
implicate the defendant's Sixth and Eighth Amendment rights 
to make a capital defense. Accordingly, there is a conflict 
between these rights that cannot be resolved by measures 
short of severance. 
 
 
3. There is a serious risk that there will be a prejudicial 
conflict between Mr. Nichols' and Mr. McVeigh's theories of 
mitigation 
 
Many mitigating factors are inherently inconsistent with 
others, and, as a result, a jury required simultaneously to 
weigh inconsistent theories of mitigation offered on behalf 
of two codefendants is unlikely to be able to accord both 
codefendants the individualized consideration required by 
the Eighth Amendment.46/ 
 
For example, one defendant may offer evidence that prior to 
the present offense he worked steadily at gainful 
employment, and that he has a stable and loving family with 
parents, a spouse and children who describe his otherwise 
exemplary life. In this case the jury is being asked to 
look to the future, to the defendant's likely reform and 
the contributions he may yet make to his family. The same 
jury is then asked to consider, also in mitigation of 
punishment, evidence that the second defendant has suffered 
childhood abuse or an organic brain impairment which has 
left him chronically paranoid, socially isolated, 
unemployable, and subject to intermittent explosive 
outbursts of rage and physical aggression. The jury in the 
second defendant's case is asked to look to the past, to 
the defendant's prior life-experiences that might make his 
act understandable. The first defendant presents evidence 
tending to show that he will likely prove a model inmate if 
sent to prison instead of executed; the second defendant's 
history of abuse or neurological impairment makes his past 
and likely future prison behavior problematic. 
 
Such starkly contrasting mitigation cases are likely in 
this case in the event of capital convictions, and the 
potential for jury confusion is apparent. The jurors are 
instructed to seriously consider, and sympathize with if 
they can, factors relevant to each defendant that -- if in 
fact they are considered mitigating to the defendant -- 
necessarily puts the other defendant in a bad light. To the 
extent that the jury actually accords substantial 
mitigating weight to the first defendant's evidence, the 
second defendant's case in mitigation will be 
correspondingly weakened, and may even become 
transmogrified into evidence justifying a sentence of 
death. Conversely, if the second defendant's plight arouses 
the jury's sympathy, that may well bias the jury against 
the first who -- on this theory of mitigation -- appears to 
have no excuse for his conduct. 
 
Moreover, the likelihood of confusion is significantly 
compounded by the structure of the guilt phase 
deliberations, which requires each juror to vote as 
mitigating any factor that she individually finds to be 
mitigating. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(d). Individual jurors will 
therefore be asked to consider and vote for conflicting and 
even contradictory factors as to each defendant in 
mitigation. Instructions to keep each factor separate as to 
each defendant will be entirely unavailing. 
 
Under the Eighth Amendment and the capital sentencing 
scheme created by Congress in 18 U.S.C.Sec. 3591 et seq., 
a defendant's abusive childhood or psychiatric impairments 
are factors to be considered in mitigation, not in 
aggravation, and the fact that these disabilities may 
render the defendant more likely to pose a risk of violence 
in the future may not be used by a capital sentencing jury 
to place those impairments on death's side of the scale. 
Zant v. Stephens. 462 U.S.862, 885 (1983) (suggesting that 
eighth amendment would be violated by attachment of 
"'aggravating' label" to factors "that actually should 
militate in favor of a lesser penalty, such as perhaps the 
defendant's mental illness"). But when counsel for a 
capital codefendant at a joint hearing stresses his own 
client's mental stability in order to reassure the jury 
concerning his future behavior if spared, there arises a 
constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury will 
impose death on the codefendant "despite the existence of 
factors which may call for a less severe penalty." Lockett 
v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978). Likewise, the failure of 
a defendant to have his parents testify on his behalf may 
be perceived as aggravating, or even damning, if the, other 
codefendant's parents testify for their son -- although the 
absence of the first defendant's family may actually 
reflect facts about his emotionally impoverished background 
that should be given weight in mitigation, not aggravation. 
Eddings, supra. In each case, the problem is that evidence 
which the constitution requires to be considered on the 
side of life is undermined or even metamorphosed into 
evidence for death by irrelevant and arbitrary comparison 
with the mitigating evidence offered on behalf of the 
codefendant. 
 
 
4. There is an irresolvable conflict between the 
defendants' right to argue the Sec. 3592(a)(3) and (4) 
mitigation factors and their Eighth Amendment right to 
individualized consideration 
 
Prejudicially inconsistent mitigating cases is but one 
example of the general problem of invidious comparisons in 
capital sentencing proceedings. These problems are 
significantly exacerbated by the defendants' right to argue 
the comparative (a)(3) and (a)(4) mitigation factors, which 
by their terms require comparative judgments be made. 
 
Inasmuch as Congress limited the effect of these factors to 
the mitigation side of the sentencing calculus, it is clear 
as a matter of statutory construction (as well as of 
constitutional law) that neither a lesser degree of 
participation by a codefendant nor a death-sentenced 
codefendant's equal culpability can be treated as a factor 
in aggravation of punishment. Congress made clear that the 
(a)(3) and (a)(4) mitigating factors are included in the 
statute to benefit capital defendants, not to help the 
Government secure more death sentences in pursuit of a 
false consistency. The evident purpose of these factors is 
to allow the jury to guarantee a measure of fairness and 
consistency where the Government has plea-bargained with 
equally culpable codefendants, as well as to avoid "the 
scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts," Richardson, 
481 U.S. at 210, resulting from the idiosyncrasies the 
government's plea-bargaining decisions. 
 
However, when these factors are injected into 
multi-defendant jury sentencing deliberations, they create 
a potential for prejudice that Congress never intended and 
the Eighth Amendment forbids, by turning mitigating 
characteristics of one defendant into de facto aggravators 
for the other. 
 
First, the presence of the (a)(3) and (a)(4) factors in the 
sentencing calculus virtually guarantees that the jury will 
compare and contrast both the mitigating and aggravating 
factors present as to each defendant in arriving at 
sentencing decisions for both of them. In the event of a 
penalty phase in this case, for example, it is highly 
likely that the jury would find that one defendant's 
participation in the offense is less than the other's. If 
the jury then decides that that defendant's "participation" 
is "relatively minor" within the meaning of Sec. 
3592(a)(3), it is significantly less likely that the jury 
will conclude that the other's participation -- which was 
more extensive -- was also "relatively minor," even though 
that is a possibility in this case.47/ 
 
Similarly, the much broader injunction of Sec. 3592(a)(4) 
to consider the "equal culpability" of each defendant -- 
which includes the likelihood of future dangerousness, 
moral desert, life history and other factors unrelated to 
the crime itself -- ensures that any potential conflict 
between theories of mitigation will become actual and 
prejudicial. Even if one were to indulge the unrealistic 
assumption that a jury can compartmentalize the evidence in 
mitigation for each defendant so as to give mitigating 
weight both to the presence and absence of 
violence-inducing mental illness, the presence and absence 
of strong and loving families, the presence and absence of 
crimogenic influences in the defendants' respective 
backgrounds, and so on, see Section II.A.3., infra. such 
compartmentalization will crumble once the (a)(4) factor 
enters the jury's deliberations. At that point (and 
realistically, the factor may be expected to pervade the 
jury's deliberations throughout), the jury will be invited 
to choose which mitigating factors are "really" mitigating, 
and which should be minimized -- or even treated as 
aggravating -- in order to provide the intra-case 
sentencing consistency which the (a)(4) factor seeks. 
 
The invidiousness of this compare-and-contrast approach to 
mitigating factors at a joint sentencing hearing is 
increased by the "either/or" decision before the jury. The 
fact that the jury has before it a stark life or 
imprisonment choice for two different codefendants creates 
the risk that the jury will tend to conflate the full range 
of mitigation and moral desert into a simple either/or 
framework. The jury is likely to ask not whether Mr. 
Nichols deserves death or life, but whether he deserves 
greater, lesser or equal punishment as Mr. McVeigh. 
 
This can distort the jury's sentencing decisions in either 
one or both of two different ways. First, it can skew the 
jury's determination of whether either of the defendants 
deserve death: the likelihood of an affirmative answer to 
that question will be capriciously increased by joinder 
whenever a single jury is required to fashion appropriate 
sentences for two defendants with differing culpability. 
Once the jury concludes that it would not be fair to 
sentence the less culpable defendant to the same punishment 
as the more culpable defendant, a powerful but legally 
extraneous reason to impose a death sentence on the more 
culpable defendant is introduced into the jury's 
deliberations. 
 
Second, multiple-defendant jury sentencing risks another 
decisional process which might be called "bootstrapping for 
death." This occurs once the jury decides to sentence the 
first codefendant to death: that codefendant's case then 
becomes a benchmark for death against which the other's is 
measured. And if this happens, the subsequent defendant can 
avert death for himself only by establishing that the 
difference between the death-sentenced defendant's 
culpability and his own is large enough to take him out of 
the now-determined "death" range. If he cannot establish a 
sufficiently dramatic difference between the 
death-sentenced defendant's case and his own, the jury can 
be expected (with impetus from the (a)(4) factor) "to feed 
him from the same spoon," and in the process to deny his 
eighth amendment right to individualized and untrammeled 
consideration of his own culpability. 
 
Finally, the very difficulty of comparing two defendants' 
relative culpability as required by Sec. 3592(a)(4) 
introduces an impermissibly arbitrary factor into the 
death-sentencing balance. The difficult factual and moral 
questions posed by the issue of "equal culpability" is most 
easily resolved by sentencing both defendants to death, 
which removes the obligation of the jury to consider the 
(a)(4) factor by ensuring that there is no other "defendant . . . 
[who] will not be punished by death."48/ Sec. 
3592(a)(4). It could not have been the intent of Congress, 
in engrafting the (a)(4) mitigating factor onto the federal 
capital sentencing scheme, to encumber the decision to 
impose life by requiring the jury to justify any sentencing 
disparity before it could show mercy to a particular 
defendant. See Beck v. Alabama 447 U.S. 625, 640 (1980) 
(due process violated by withholding lesser included 
offenses from capital juries: contrived "all or nothing" 
choice at guilt phase impermissibly increases risk of 
wrongful conviction). 
 
This is not what Congress intended, and it is not what the 
eighth amendment demands. The sentence to be imposed on one 
capital defendant has absolutely nothing to do with the 
moral culpability of any other defendant, and while such 
considerations may operate (for reasons quite apart from 
the defendant's own moral desert) to militate against the 
death penalty under some circumstances, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 
3592(a)(3), (4), they may never play any part in deciding 
which defendants should be sentenced to death and executed. 
 
 
5. Mr. McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights will conflict 
with Mr. Nichols' Eighth Amendment rights at a joint 
penalty hearing 
 
We explained above that the government's proposed use of 
certain statements from Mr. Nichols' statement creates a 
Bruton problem that requires severance or forgoing use of 
the statements. Section I.A.6.a., supra. In the 
alternative, we demonstrated that Mr. Nichols will be 
permitted to use other parts of the statement, not 
introduced by the government, which will again implicate 
Mr. McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights in a manner that 
requires severance. Sections I.A.6.b. and c., supra. Even 
if the Court disagrees and finds that these dilemmas do not 
require the government to choose between severance or 
forgoing use of the statement at the guilt phase, at the 
penalty phase the dilemmas creates an even more serious 
conflict between Mr. Nichols' Eighth Amendment rights and 
Mr. McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights requiring 
severance at that stage. 
 
The parts of Mr. Nichols' April 21, 1995 statement omitted 
by the government include numerous statements that 
exculpate Mr. Nichols and inculpate Mr. McVeigh, often at 
the same time. Assuming arguendo that omission of these 
statements is found not to "distort[] the meaning of the 
statement or exclude[] information substantially 
exculpatory of the declarant" at the guilt phase, Kaminski, 
692 F.2d at 522, when the issues before the jury shift from 
relatively straightforward questions of guilt or innocence 
to the countless gradations of moral culpability which must 
be made at the sentencing phase, the same omissions will 
turn out to be highly prejudicial to Mr. Nichols. When 
presented in full, the statement furnishes proof that Mr. 
Nichols was either unaware of Mr. McVeigh's criminal intent 
or, if aware, at the very least that Mr. Nichols acted 
entirely at the urging and behest of Mr. McVeigh, who took 
the lead in perpetrating the crime. The statement thus 
strongly supports the mitigating consideration that Mr. 
Nichols' "participation was relatively minor, regardless of 
whether the participation was so minor as to constitute a 
defense to the charge" as well as his lesser culpability. 
18 U.S.C. Secs. 3593(a)(3), (4) 
 
In State v. Howard, 295 S.C. 462, 369 S.E.2d 132 (1988), 
cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1113 (1989), the trial court was 
found to have violated the defendant's Eighth Amendment 
rights to present mitigating evidence when it redacted 
references in his confession to the allegedly dominant role 
of his codefendant. Reversing the first defendant's death 
sentence, the South Carolina Supreme Court concluded that 
the exclusion of references to domination by the 
codefendant had undermined his case in mitigation, and 
concluded by "caution[ing] the trial bench when considering 
a capital defendant's motion to sever that the effect of a 
joint trial on each defendant at both the guilt and 
sentencing phases must be considered." 369 S.E.2d at 138. 
As here, the conflict between the defendants' 
constitutional rights arose in Howard because introduction 
of the unedited statement by the government would have 
violated the codefendant's constitutional right to confront 
the witnesses against him. 
 
It would therefore violate Mr. Nichols' Eighth Amendment 
and due process rights to permit the government to 
introduce the statement or mention it (assuming it was 
previously entered in its edited form at the guilt 
phase49/) at the penalty phase as aggravating evidence 
against Mr. Nichols or Mr. McVeigh without also entering 
the omitted parts of the statement in mitigation of Mr. 
Nichols' role. 
 
Entering the full statement, however, would once again run 
afoul of Mr. McVeigh's Confrontation Clause rights. Since 
there is no solution to the problem that adequately 
protects both Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh's rights, 
severance is required.50/ 
 
 
6. There is a serious risk that Mr. Nichols' and Mr. 
McVeigh's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 
will conflict with the other defendant's Eighth Amendment 
and allocution rights 
 
It is settled that a capital defendant must be permitted to 
offer in mitigation of punishment, and the sentencer must 
consider, such factors as his post-crime cooperation with 
law enforcement and his expressed remorse before and during 
the trial or sentencing proceedings. See Gregg v. Georgia. 
428 U.S. 153, 197 (1976) (listing the extent of the 
defendant's cooperation with law enforcement as an example 
of a mitigating factor), cf. Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 
U.S. 146, 167 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("A 
confession is rightly regarded by the [federal] sentencing 
guidelines as warranting a reduction of sentence, because 
it 'demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance 
of personal responsibility for . . . criminal conduct' . 
which is the beginning of reform." (citation omitted)). The 
comparative Sec. 3592(a)(4) factor raises the substantial 
likelihood that in according mitigating weight to one 
defendant's voluntary self-incrimination and expressions of 
remorse, the jury will at the same time treat as 
aggravating the failure of his codefendant or codefendants 
to produce similar evidence in mitigation. 
 
However, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled 
self-incrimination applies with undiminished force to the 
penalty phase of a capital case. Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 
454 (1981). Thus any adverse consideration by a sentencing 
jury of a capital defendant's failure to incriminate 
himself -- whether by cooperating with the police 
investigation, confessing to his role in the offenses 
charged, or expressing remorse either before or after 
conviction -- would violate that defendant's Fifth 
Amendment rights, Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288 (1981), 
Griffin v. California 380 U.S. 609 (1965), and by extension 
his Eighth Amendment rights as well. Zant v. Stephens, 462 
U.S. 862, 885 (1983) (suggesting that eighth amendment 
violated by state's attachment of "aggravating" label to 
defendant's assertion of constitutional right); Dawson v. 
Delaware, 503 U.S. 159 (1992) (capital sentencer's 
consideration, as nonstatutory aggravating factor, of 
irrelevant evidence concerning defendant's 
constitutionally-protected association violated due 
process). 
 
This conflict between the Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights 
of capital codefendant is particularly difficult to cure 
because the trial court typically will be unable to foresee 
it prior to trial or resolve it by instructions. The 
conflict is unforeseeable prior to trial because a 
defendant may not be required to decide whether or not to 
testify until the close of the defense case. Brooks v. 
Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605, 610-11 (1972). Indeed, one of the 
reasons for a bifurcated sentencing proceeding is to permit 
a defendant to assert his constitutional right to remain 
silent with respect to his guilt or innocence, and yet to 
express remorse or contrition for his crime at the 
sentencing hearing after conviction. 
 
Just as the Court may not predict before trial how both the 
presence and the absence of codefendants' remorse, 
cooperation and voluntary self-incrimination may enter into 
a joint jury sentencing trial, neither will limiting 
instructions be an option to safeguard the Fifth Amendment 
rights of the silent codefendants. For the Court cannot 
tell the jury to disregard the fact that one defendant 
exercised his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent 
throughout the pretrial, trial and sentencing stages of the 
proceedings, as required by Carter v. Kentucky supra, Bruno 
v. United States, 308 U.S. 287 (1939), and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 
1381, without threatening the codefendant's Lockett right 
to have his waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights considered 
in mitigation of his punishment.51/ If a defendant's 
willingness to waive his rights against self-incrimination 
is logically relevant to the sentence he should receive, 
then a codefendant's unwillingness to make a similar waiver 
is relevant to the question of whether the other defendant 
is "equally culpable" within the meaning of Sec. 
3592(a)(4). The Court cannot by instructions deny the 
probative significance of the latter without nullifying the 
significance of the former as well. Severance of the 
defendants' capital sentencing hearings is the only remedy 
available to resolve this conflict between constitutional 
rights. 
 
There is, in addition, a related conflict between the 
defendants' Fifth Amendment rights and their separate right 
to allocute prior to being sentenced. "The most persuasive 
counsel may not be able to speak for a defendant as the 
defendant might, with halting eloquence, speak for 
himself." Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 304 (1961) 
(plurality opinion) (Frankfurter, J.). Accordingly, a 
criminal defendant has a constitutional right to personally 
address the fact finder who will pass sentence on him. 
Boardman v. Estelle, 957 F.2d 1523, 1530 (9th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 506 U.S. 904 (1992); see also Ashe v. North 
Carolina, 586 F.2d 334, 336 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 
441 U.S. 966 (1979); United States v. Jackson, 923 F.2d 
1494, 1496 (11th Cir. 1991). 
 
To the extent that one defendant testifies and the other 
chooses instead to allocute, there is a distinct danger 
that one choice will suffer by comparison with the other -- 
either the defendant who subjects himself to 
cross-examination will appear the more remorseful (or more 
truthful) than the one who does not, or the 
cross-examination of the defendant will be sufficiently 
damaging that the defendant who allocutes will have the 
comparative advantage. In either case, a defendant's Fifth 
Amendment right, allocution right and/or Eighth Amendment 
right to individualized consideration will be prejudiced. 
 
 
7. [TEXT REDACTED] will have an extremely prejudicial 
effect on Mr. Nichols' ability to receive a fair and 
individualized penalty hearing 
 
[TEXT REDACTED] this case, likely to inflame and confuse 
the jury regarding Mr. Nichols' guilt. See Section [TEXT 
REDACTED] supra. The prejudicial impact of this evidence on 
Mr. Nichols will be even greater at the penalty phase, 
since the exercise of the jury's moral judgment and 
sympathy at sentencing is even more sensitive to 
prejudicial influences of this type than the categorical 
guilt phase judgment. 
 
It is improper for a jury to consider these controversial 
(but constitutionally protected) views as an aggravating 
factor in their own right, independent of their relevance 
to other, proper aggravating factors. Dawson v. Delaware, 
503 U.S. 159 (1992) (capital sentencer's consideration, as 
nonstatutory aggravating factor, of irrelevant evidence 
concerning defendant's constitutionally-protected 
association violated due process). Nevertheless, the 
evidence of Mr. McVeigh's [TEXT REDACTED] makes Mr. 
McVeigh's beliefs relevant to prove both his required 
"gateway" mental state finding of intent to kill under Sec. 
3591(a)(2) and the aggravating factors leveled against him. 
Accordingly, they may be admissible at the penalty phase 
regardless of their protected status. Dawson, 503 U.S. at 
164-65 (evidence of constitutionally protected association 
is admissible where relevant to some legitimate issue at 
penalty phase); Barclay v. Florida 463 U.S. 939, 949-50 
(1983) (holding that defendant's desire to start a "race 
war" was properly considered relevant to several 
aggravating factors at the capital sentencing hearing). 
 
Mr. Nichols, on the other hand, [TEXT REDACTED]. It is 
apparent that Mr. McVeigh's political views are irrelevant 
to the jury's individualized consideration of Mr. Nichols' 
sentencing case. Nevertheless, the inflammatory nature of 
the evidence against Mr. McVeigh, when combined with Mr. 
Nichols' admitted prior associations with him and the 
subjective and emotional nature of the sentencing decision, 
make it inevitable that in a joint penalty phase Mr. 
Nichols will be tarred in the jurors' minds at least to 
some extent [TEXT REDACTED] Since the individualized 
consideration of Mr. Nichols' case required by the Eighth 
Amendment will be impossible in these circumstances, the 
penalty phases should be severed. 
 
 
B. Seriatim penalty phases before the same jury will not 
cure the constitutional flaws 
 
The dangers discussed above will not be solved by 
separating the sentencing hearings while retaining the same 
jury to hear them both; indeed, this procedure will even 
create new ones. Accordingly, in the event of capital 
convictions against both defendants at a joint guilt phase, 
the Court should specially empanel a separate penalty phase 
jury to hear one of the defendant's sentencing cases. See 
18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(b)(2)(C) (authorizing impanelment of 
new sentencing jury where guilt phase jury has been 
"discharged for good cause"). 
 
The first, and intractable, problem would be the decision 
as to which defendant should go first. Given the antagonism 
of the defenses, it requires little imagination to see the 
likely advantage of the first defendant to get the ear of 
the jury. Even if the first defendant's penalty case fails, 
he will have done untold damage to the second defendant's 
chances for life by painting the second defendant as the 
more culpable in the crime. Indeed, the second defendant 
will not even have the opportunity to contest the first 
defendant's evidence against him, but will have to stand by 
helplessly and watch the jury that will sentence him be 
poisoned by unrebutted accusations and insinuations against 
him. On the other hand, allowing the later defendant's 
counsel to cross-examine, argue and present rebuttal 
witnesses at the first defendant's penalty hearing would 
defeat the whole purpose of separating the hearings in the 
first instance. 
 
The second defendant will also be disadvantaged in the 
consideration of his mitigating evidence. If it is similar 
to that already offered by the first defendant, what might 
have seemed compelling when heard for the first time will 
likely sound stale and contrived on a second hearing. And 
if the subsequent defendant's case in mitigation is 
conceptually inconsistent with the first defendant's, the 
later defendant may be even more severely disadvantaged. 
Having accepted, for example, that the first defendant's 
abusive childhood or mental impairment was a mitigating 
factor, a jury may be less likely for that reason to accord 
mitigating weight to a subsequent defendant's evidence of 
his good mental health and desirable character traits and 
talents. While the mitigating weight to be accorded any 
particular factor is for the jury to determine? that 
determination must not be skewed by a jury's prior 
determination of another defendant's sentence, and by the 
jurors' understandable but legally irrelevant desire to 
appear and to be consistent. For parallel reasons, each of 
the other problems identified above will be exacerbated, 
or, at best, go unsolved by seriatim penalty phases. 
 
Finally, the government might well receive an advantage 
from having the most culpable defendant sentenced first, 
since in this way the jury will be most likely to establish 
for both defendants that the crime itself merits the death 
penalty. While the second defendant might still save 
himself by a sufficiently compelling showing in mitigation, 
the fact remains that at least half of the Government's 
burden will have been carried before the second sentencing 
hearing has begun. 
 
In sum, the danger is that the jurors' responses to 
critical issues at the first sentencing hearing will tend 
to predetermine their decisions on the same or related 
issues at the subsequent hearing. Since this will 
exacerbate rather than solve the problems with a joint 
penalty hearing, severed penalty phases before different 
juries is required.52/ 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Nichols respectfully 
requests that his case be severed for trial or, 
alternatively, that dual juries be empaneled to hear the 
cases against the two defendants separately. If severance 
at the guilt phase is not granted, Mr. Nichols requests in 
the alternative that any resulting sentencing hearing be 
severed and conducted before a different jury than the jury 
that hears Mr. McVeigh's sentencing hearing.

ENDNOTES 
 
1/ Because the discovery process continues as of the date 
of this filing, we have neither received all of the 
materials relevant to severance nor have had the time to do 
a full, trial-ready analysis of the materials we have 
received. Nevertheless, we believe the evidence discussed 
below is sufficient to demonstrate the need for severance. 
 
2/ Because this appendix contains privileged work product 
that reveals Mr. Nichols' counsel's analysis of the case he 
will have to meet and make at trial, we seek to file this 
document ex parse. See Motion of Defendant Terry Lynn 
Nichols to Receive Under Seal an Unredacted Version of the 
Motion for Severance and to Receive Ex Parte Defendant's 
Appendix 1 (filed today). 
 
3/ The government has accumulated a great deal of forensic 
evidence. Our preliminary response to this was filed on 
September 3, 1996. The relative strength of this evidence 
as it relates to the two defendants cannot be definitively 
evaluated, but the limited initial reports that we have 
received are entirely consistent with our arguments for 
severance. 
 
4/ [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
5/ [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
6/ [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
7/ In the alternative, we ask that two juries be empaneled 
to hear the two defendants' cases separately. Section I.D., 
infra. 
 
8/ Once the Court grants this alternative relief, guilt 
phase severance becomes appropriate for independent 
reasons. See Section I.A.7. 
 
9/ In United States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d 861, 1996 WL 377046 
(4th Cir. 1996), the Fourth Circuit rejected the claim of 
a federal capital defendant that his case should have been 
severed at the guilt phase. The defendant in Tipton, 
however, argued for severance in the guilt phase solely on 
the basis of an allegedly improper joinder of multiple 
separate conspiracies; he did not raise the Eighth 
Amendment-related arguments we make here. Id., at * 17-19. 
Tipton does address Eighth Amendment considerations in its 
ruling on the joint penalty phase held in that case. L., at 
*28-30. We discuss this aspect of Tipton under Point II, 
infra. 
 
10/ Zafiro itself addressed a claim of antagonism that fell 
short of this mark, see id., 506 U.S. at 540 ("As to the 
second contention [that the defenses were truly mutually 
exclusive], the short answer is that petitioners' scenario 
simply did not occur here"), and the Court accordingly held 
that "even if there were some risk of prejudice, here it is 
of the type that can be cured with proper instructions." 
L.; see also id., 506 U.S. at 542 44 (Stevens, J., 
concurring) (pointing out that the defenses raised by the 
defendants were not truly mutually antagonistic). 
 
11/ Romanello was cited with approval for this point by the 
Tenth Circuit in Peveto, 881 F.2d at 858. 
 
12/ Romanello established a five-part test for whether 
severance is mandated in this situation: (1) "the core of 
[the defendant's] defense is the guilt of the co-defendant; 
(2) to disprove his defense would establish his guilt; (3) 
his defense and the defense of his codefendant are mutually 
exclusive and irreconcilable; (4) the co-defendant actively 
attacks his defense at trial; and (5) he suffers compelling 
prejudice as a result." 726 F.2d at 181. These conditions 
are plainly met here. 
 
13/ We have moved to file a detailed account of the 
evidence against Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols under seal and 
ex parse. See Appendix 1. The need for ex parte filing 
results from the enormous strategic advantage both Mr. 
Nichols' adversaries -- the government and Mr. McVeigh -- 
would have at trial if they were apprised of our strategy 
and our beliefs about their strategies. In view of the 
frequency with which claims of antagonistic defenses are 
rejected because of the lack of a detailed account of the 
prejudice suffered by the defendant, see e.g. United States 
v. McClure, 734 F.2d 484, 488 (10th Cir. 1984) (rejecting 
"mere abstract allegation[s]" of prejudice and requiring a 
"close review of the record" where antagonistic defenses 
claimed), a detailed description is required here to make 
our record. 
 
14/ Indeed, the government argued in the context of its 
Rule 804(b)(3) in limine motion that Mr. Nichols' 
statements linking him to Mr. McVeigh in the days 
immediately preceding and following the bombing were among 
the most incriminating evidence against him. See Reply 
Brief of the United States Regarding Admissibility of 
Nichols' Statements, at 8 ("Nichols' core statements were 
incriminating precisely because, and for the most part only 
because, McVeigh too was involved"). 
 
15/ [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
16/ The prejudicial impact of guilt phase antagonistic 
defenses on the penalty phase must be considered as well. 
As we discuss in Section I.B.2., infra, even defenses that 
fall short of "mutual exclusivity" may be sufficient to 
prejudice the penalty phase of a joint capital trial, and 
it is unlikely that this prejudice, once introduced at the 
guilt phase, can be cured by penalty phase instructions. 
For this reason, even if the Court deems Mr. Nichols and 
Mr. McVeigh's defenses to fall below the level of mutual 
exclusivity required by Peveto, it should still grant 
severance at the guilt phase to preserve Mr. Nichols' 
Eighth Amendment rights in the event of a subsequent 
penalty phase. Id.

18/ [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
19/ [TEXT REDACTED] 
 
20/ Such advocacy may not be criminalized even if it is 
done with the hope and intent that others will take up arms 
against the government (which, in Mr. Nichols' case, there 
is no proof of here). Yates, 354 U.S. at 325. 
 
21/ Agent Burmeister later qualified this definition 
slightly: "Well, anything that would be threats against the 
United States, something like that, that would show those 
kind of actions." Burmeister Tr. 12. 
 
22/ An exception might arise in a capital case, if the 
government sought the death penalty for a mere agreement. 
 
23/ The government may also argue in the alternative that 
if Mr. Nichols did withdraw, he rejoined the conspiracy 
prior to the bombing. Assuming arguendo that the evidence 
is sufficient to permit this inference, it is equally clear 
that the contrary conclusion would be warranted as well, 
and the potential Bruton problem remains. 
 
24/ The other cases relied upon by the government are even 
more beside the point. See Motion in Limine 11-13. The 
government's heavy reliance on United States v. Clark, 456 
F.2d 1375, 1376 (10th Cir. 1972), is entirely inexplicable 
since both defendants testified and were cross-examined by 
each other's counsel, obviating any Confrontation Clause 
(and therefore Bruton) concerns. United States v. Escobar, 
50 F.3d 1414 (8th Cir. 1995), ruled Bruton inapplicable to 
a codefendant's exculpatory statement about three 
defendants (he claimed not to know them) that was 
introduced by the government as a false exculpatory 
statement. Id. at 1422. In United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 
1223 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 176 (1995), the 
district court found that introduction of the challenged 
statement "had been an 'egregious error' under Bruton" and 
the First Circuit assumed that ruling to be correct, id. at 
1299; the language relied upon in the government's brief 
comes from the court's discussion of the harmless error 
issue, not the Bruton question for which it is cited. In 
United States v. Foree, 43 F.3d 1572 (11th Cir. 1995), a 
plain error case, the Eleventh Circuit mentioned the 
"powerfully incriminating" language from Bruton as a 
requirement for exclusion where the codefendant statement 
does not expressly mention the defendant by name, but 
nevertheless assumes that there was a Bruton violation in 
finding harmless error. Finally, the Ninth Circuit's 
cursory discussion in United States v. Olano, 62 F.3d 1180 
(9th Cir. 1995), of one nontestifying codefendant's 
statement that he had "two loans for Guy Olano to make" 
leaves it unclear whether this statement was inculpatory or 
even disputed by the defendant. L., at 1196; compare Clark, 
supra (codefendant's statement that defendant had engaged 
in certain financial transactions did not violate Bruton in 
part because underlying facts were not disputed). 
 
25/ The government's actions in other cases speak louder 
than its arguments in this instance, since it routinely 
redacts all mention of a defendant from a codefendant's 
statement before attempting to introduce it at trial. In 
the event the government attempts to redact Mr. Nichols' 
statement to comply with Richardson, we reserve the right 
to object and brief the issues of whether "admission of the 
statement in its edited form distorts the meaning of the 
statement or excludes information substantially exculpatory 
of the declarant," United States v. Kaminski. 692 F.2d 505, 
522 (8th Cir. 1982), and whether Bruton is satisfied. 
 
26/ Rule 106, which by its terms applies only to "a writing 
or recorded statement," provides in relevant part that when 
part of a writing or recording is introduced, "an adverse 
party may require the introduction at that time of any 
other part or any other writing or recorded statement which 
ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with 
it." Courts have extended this "rule of completeness" to 
oral testimony under the aegis of FRE 611 (a), which 
requires the district court to "make the interrogation and 
presentation effective for the ascertainment of truth." See 
e.g. United States v. Mussaleen, 35 F.3d 692, 696 (2d Cir. 
1994). 
 
27/ Velasco and Kaminski address codefendant statements 
from which mention of other defendants was redacted in 
order to avoid Bruton problems. Should the government 
attempt such a redaction here, the problem identified in 
the text infra will be greatly exacerbated because it will 
make it appear that Mr. Nichols went to Oklahoma City, 
cleaned out the storage locker, etc., for his own purposes. 
 
28/ Of course, Crane is most often cited for the 
defendant's right to contest the credibility of a prior 
confession rather than bolstering it. See e.g. United 
States v. March, 999 F.2d 456, 462-63 (10th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 510 U.S. 983 (1993) (improper for court to instruct 
jury to disregard evidence relating to circumstances of 
confession where defendant was attempting to impeach its 
credibility). Nothing in Crane's logic, however, suggests 
that it should not also apply where the government is 
attempting to use the statement against a defendant by 
demonstrating its falsehood. 
 
29/ Act of April 30, 1790, ch. 9, Sec. 29, 1 Stat. 118, as 
amended, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3005 (appointment of counsel for 
capital defendants); id, Secs. 1, 3, 8-10, 14, 1 Stat. 
112-115 (authorizing death penalty). 
 
30/ Of course, the problem of prejudicial "spillover" 
between guilt and penalty phases could be avoided by 
empaneling a new penalty phase jury for each defendant 
following a conviction of a capital offense. The federal 
statute expressly prefers that the same jury hear both 
phases, however. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3593(b); see also Lockhart 
v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 181 (1986) (approving single 
bifurcated capital trial). Moreover, empaneling a new jury 
solely to hear the penalty phase would deny to Mr. Nichols 
what may be the only effective mitigating factor in this 
case, residual doubt about his guilt. See Section I.A.7., 
infra. 
 
31/ The federal statute contemplates that guilt phase 
evidence will be used during the penalty phase even where 
a new penalty phase jury is empaneled. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 
3593(c) ("Information presented [at the sentencing hearing] 
may include the trial transcript and exhibits if the 
hearing is held before a jury or judge not present during 
the trial, or at the judge's discretion"). In these 
circumstances, however, the trial judge has control over 
the admission of sentencing-prejudicial guilt phase 
evidence, since she can redact transcripts and otherwise 
selectively put non-prejudicial guilt phase evidence before 
the jury. 
 
32/ indeed, the fact that "the defendant's participation 
was relatively minor, regardless of whether the 
participation was so minor as to constitute a defense to 
the charge," is a statutorily designated mitigating 
circumstance which must be considered by the jury in this 
case. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3592(a)(3); see also Sec. 3592(a)(4) 
("equal culpability" of participant in crime who does not 
receive death sentence is a mitigating factor). 
 
33/ In many cases, this will be exacerbated by capital 
counsel's common (and entirely proper) strategy of using 
the guilt phase to prepare the jury for the penalty phase 
arguments. 
 
34/ a pre-Furman case, Day v. Maryland, 196 Md. 384, 76 
a.2d 729 (1950), explains very well this conflict between 
the different senses of "prejudice" at the guilt and 
penalty phases, and the interplay between the antagonistic 
defenses and evidence presented at the two phases:

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO

Criminal Action No. 96-CR-68-M

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Plaintiff,

v.

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and
TERRY LYNN NICHOLS,

Defendants.

DEFENDANT TIMOTHY McVEIGH'S MOTION
FOR MEDIA ACCESS AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT


I. INTRODUCTION

Defendant Timothy James McVeigh, by counsel, respectfully requests
the Court to authorize and permit Mr. McVeigh, a pre-trial detainee, to
have reasonable access to members of the local, Oklahoma, national,
and European media as specified herein, including the opportunity to
participate in one videotaped interview with either Barbara Walters,
Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Susan Candiotti or Jack
Bowen, and a videotaped interview with the BBC-TV (Documentary
Division) "BBC".


II. DISCUSSION

A. Factual Background: Virtually every aspect of the April 19, 1995,
Oklahoma City bombing has generated unprecedented public interest
worldwide and a corresponding surfeit of international media
attention. As this Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order on Motion
for Change of Venue held, a fair and impartial trial in Oklahoma was
impossible. Memorandum Opinion and Order on Motions for Change
of Venue at 10 (filed April 19, 1996). United States v. McVeigh, 918
F. Supp.1467 (1996). Evidence produced at the venue hearing
demonstrated that an overwhelming percentage of Americans believe
Mr. McVeigh to be guilty of the Oklahoma City bombing. Indeed, this
Court found that the publicity concerning Mr. McVeigh (and Mr.
Nichols) had "demonized" the Defendant. Lengthy articles appearing
in the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Dallas Morning
News have presented false, misleading, or half truths concerning the
Defendant's background. A purported biography by Brandon
Stickney will be released in September by a well known publishing
house, and the demonization continues.1  The description of the book,
as published in Publisher's Weekly (Exhibit "A") indicates that it will
be harsh in its treatment of Mr. McVeigh and clearly one-sided, and
present an unfair representation of his youth and early years. The
television Channel A & E produced, filmed and showed an hour long
biography of Mr. McVeigh, and that video biography is now available
in book stores across the United States in video cassettes. Both CNN
and ABC News likewise did lengthy video biographies or purported
biographies of Mr. McVeigh. Morris Dees has authored a book,
Gathering Storm, which contains an entire chapter arguing Mr.
McVeigh's guilt and outlining how his lawyer can save his life if he
will only follow Morris Dees' crusade against the author of The
Turner Dairies, William Pierce. Dees, a lawyer, promoted his book
actively in Denver. All of these films, books and television
presentations, have received widespread publicity. Many of them have
relied upon interviews with individuals who would not recognize Mr.
McVeigh if he walked in the room today, but for the publicity
surrounding this case. These interviews, which have been published,
have had the effect of "chilling" family, former employers, and former
colleagues in the military from a willingness to testify or to assist the
Defendant until recently when after repeated efforts by defense
investigators, some, but not all, family members, former employers,
and military colleagues are now willing to give a more balanced
picture of Mr. McVeigh. The juggernaut of guilt, supported in part, by
the media has made the work of the Defendant much greater. For
example, Lea McGown, the owner of the Dreamland Motel, has
repeatedly been interviewed by national and local television and the
FBI, but to this day refuses to talk to any defense investigator
because, as she expressed it, fear of retaliation against her. Numerous
witnesses claim the FBI has advised them not to talk with us (the FBI
has denied this allegation), and some expert witnesses simply will not
aid the defendant's lawyers with their expertise because of the
widespread presumption of guilt.

From the beginning of counsel's appointment, radio and television
stations and newspapers from Brazil, Israel, Hong Kong, Great
Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and worldwide services
such as the Associated Press and Reuters have requested interviews
with Mr. McVeigh. Exhibit "C". Mr. McVeigh has granted only four
(4) interviews to print media. These interviews were submitted for
approval to the Bureau of Prisons before the interview and in each
case approval was granted during various periods of time when
different judges had control of the case, including Chief Judge
Russell, Judge Alley and Chief Judge Matsch. A Newsweek interview
was granted in the late Spring of 1995, a Time Magazine interview on
the first anniversary of the bombing, and approximately two weeks
later an interview with the Times of London (Sunday edition). With
the exception of two isolated portions taken out of context, nothing in
either interview violated the Court's guidelines with respect to
comment on this case, and those guidelines, in any event, were not in
effect at the time of interviews.

In an attempt to set the balance true and dispel the demonization
effects, counsel for Mr. McVeigh, has in addition permitted various
members of the media to talk to Mr. McVeigh, off-the-record, at the El
Reno Federal Correctional Institution. "Bomb Defendant's Lawyer
Controls Access by Press" The New York Times, June 2, 1996,
attached as Exhibit "D" hereto. These individuals who have talked
with Mr. McVeigh agreed that the conversations were off-the-record,
not for publication, not for attribution, that Mr. McVeigh could not
discuss the facts of the case or his strategy, and that Mr. McVeigh
would neither be tape recorded nor filmed, and no reference could
even be made publicly to the fact that the reporter had met with Mr.
McVeigh. Reporters and/or media which were granted this limited
opportunity to talk to Mr. McVeigh, without exception, honored the
written requirements. That is to say no one of them quoted Mr.
McVeigh, referred to the meeting, tape recorded or filmed him (again,
with the exception of Time, Newsweek and The Times of London).
These other reporters included the following services: The Associated
Press, Reuters, The Dallas Morning News, Channel 4, 5 and 9 in
Oklahoma City, Jack Bowen for Fox Television, Barbara Walters,
Diane Sawyer, Harry Smith of CBS Morning News, Dick Reavis, a
well known author, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times
and the Wall Street Journal.

In addition, Mr. McVeigh did grant an interview, concerning only his
family and military background, to Media Bypass Magazine. Since
Mr. McVeigh's transfer to the Federal Correctional Institution at
Englewood, counsel for Mr. McVeigh has permitted Tom Brokaw
from NBC News and Scott Pelley from CBS News to meet, film and
record a very brief casual meeting with Mr. McVeigh. Portions of
these brief meetings were broadcast nationally as part of the evening
news on April 18, 1996, and neither lasted more than three minutes.
The United States Attorney's Office did not oppose these meetings or
the interview with Time. No facts of the case were discussed in these
brief meetings.

Although all these media contacts occurred before this Court entered
the June 13, 1996 Memorandum Opinion and Order Regarding
Extrajudicial Statements by Attorneys and Support Personnel, none of
these contacts or interviews violates the spirit, much less the letter, of
that Order except for the single reference to Mr. McVeigh when he
said he was "innocent" as opposed to "not guilty" as reflected in the
Time Magazine interview and Time Magazine took one other brief
statement out of context, almost surely inadvertently.

This defense effort has sought to humanize Mr. McVeigh and stop the
rush to judgment of guilt by undermining the inaccurate impression of
Mr. McVeigh conveyed throughout the world by incessant repetition
of a Noble County Courthouse walk-out footage (and, sadly, the
Oklahoma County Jail walk-out footage).

We live in a time in which we as a nation are peculiarly vulnerable to
anger and hatred, a time in which we have a marked tendency to
identify certain people as enemies, then seek to eliminate them.

The government took advantage of this attitude from the day the
Murrah Building was bombed: Most people felt anger, bewilderment,
and fear over what happened in Oklahoma City. Tim McVeigh was
then accused as the person primarily responsible. He was portrayed--
falsely as a person who refused to answer the questions of law
enforcement officers and who asserted he was a prisoner of war--a
person who hated the government for its actions at Waco and Ruby
Ridge, whose hatred grew to encompass anyone associated with the
government, and who was willing to and did kill many people as
reprisal for what he perceived as the government's misdeeds. Mr.
McVeigh was then marginalized. He was characterized as an
aberration, "All American Monster" as the title of a recent biography
suggests (Exhibit "B"), as a person who lived alone and embittered on
the fringes of society, not bound by relationships to other human
beings, seething in misplaced and deluded anger at the federal
government, as a "loser" whose own inadequacies produced the
tragedy.

Through this process, Tim McVeigh came to symbolize our nation's
worst fears, our own worst enemy. Who he was portrayed to be
readily confirmed the accusations of guilt. Very quickly. Mr. McVeigh
was tried. convicted (before the first piece of evidence was admitted at
trial) and condemned in the minds of many, and he became "the most
hated man in America." If there was ever an accused tried and
convicted in the media, it was Tim McVeigh.

This is the process of demonization about which we have complained
from the time we became Mr. McVeigh's counsel. The Court
recognized it as a reason for changing venue from the Western District
of Oklahoma to the District of Colorado. It is insidious and can never
be fully overcome. In the few cautious attempts counsel for Mr.
McVeigh have made to allow the national media access to Mr.
McVeigh, counsel have been accused of "dressing him up"--trying to
portray him, falsely, as a likeable, fully human young man, rather
than allowing him to be seen as the demon that he really is.

If Mr. McVeigh is to receive a fair trial, one of the things that must be
done is to present information that will begin to counter the false view
that he is a demon. Allowing limited access to him for interview on a
respected, nationally televised program will contribute to such a;
process. It can be accomplished without transgressing in any way the
Court's guidelines for media contact. Moreover, it can serve the same
goal--assuring a fair trial--that the Court sought to serve in its media
contact Order.

Shortly after counsel was appointed, and he became aware of the
worldwide interest in Mr. McVeigh, counsel was approached by Mr.
Neil Grant of the BBC Television, Documentary Division, and ask
whether counsel would permit the BBC-TV to film an interview with
Mr. McVeigh, with counsel, and some footage of counsel at work as a
part of an overall one or two hour documentary on this case. Counsel
interviewed the BBC-TV in Enid, Oklahoma, together with numerous
other organizations that made a similar or the same request.

After reviewing about 20 tapes of similar interviews or programs
including three (3) submitted by the BBC-TV, counsel decided in his
mind that he would cooperate with one, and only one, documentary
and that would be the BBC-TV. That decision was made for the
following reasons:

1. Counsel relies upon the worldwide reputation established over 70
years of the fairness, balance, proportion and integrity of the BBC-
TV. Counsel is a regular listener of the BBC World Service and for a
period of two years subscribed weekly to a video cassette program of
the Best of BBC Television, and counsel watches BBC-TV when in
the United Kingdom.

2. Counsel was furnished three tapes of BBC-TV documentary
programs: an extended program on Terry Waite, a program entitled
"Fourteen Days in May" and one entitled "Caroline's Baby." The
documentary of Terry Waite could only be described as moving and
eloquent. Although counsel is opposed of the imposition of the death
penalty in this case, counsel was convinced that "Fourteen Days in
May" was the finest portrayal of the death penalty judgment at work
that he had ever seen. It is the story of the last fourteen days in the life
of young black male in Mississippi sentenced to die and the program
ends five minutes before the execution takes place. The BBC-TV had
the cooperation of the Mississippi State Department of Corrections and
filmed the Warden and his staff preparing for the execution, various
prison staff meetings, the security considerations, the young man's
family, and the young man and his lawyer. Counsel believes that
"Fourteen Days in May" is a positive contribution to the debate and
discussion on capital punishment in this country and shows the
Department of Corrections of a state at its finest in implementing a
Court's judgment under sad and tragic circumstances. "Caroline's
Baby" is a documentary on a trial in New York State Court where a
young British woman was charged, and ultimately acquitted, of
murdering her infant child. In addition, counsel learned that the United
Kingdom Ministry of Defense had authorized Mr. Grant and the BBC-
TV Documentary Division to film an unprecedented documentary of
life on a British nuclear Trident submarine: Trident Countdown. The
documentary concludes with an equally unprecedented filming of a
live firing, from a submerged nuclear submarine, of a Trident
(unarmed) nuclear missile. Mr. Grant also produced, with the
permission of the Ministry of Defense, a second video documentary:
Phantom Platoon.

3. The BBC-TV advised counsel that it was filming for history, not
for news and that sensationalism and conflict, were being avoided,
and that the BBC-TV wished that 25 or 50 years from now its'
documentary would survive as a balanced, proportioned, and accurate
account of what the BBC-TV described as an "unprecedented"
criminal trial in the United States.

4. Meetings with the BBC's personnel convinced counsel of their
resourcefulness, professionalism and integrity and on that basis,
counsel recommended to Mr. McVeigh that he cooperate with the
understanding that (1) Judge Matsch's guidelines must be followed,
(2) the program would not be released to an American broadcasting
unit in advance of the trial, and (3) that it would not be shown in the
United Kingdom before the commencement of the trial. The BBC-TV
was agreeable to all but the last consideration, i.e. the showing in the
United Kingdom. BBC-TV said that it would certainly try to honor
that request, but in any event would not release it to any American
broadcaster in advance of the trial. BBC-TV does have a contractual
relationship with the Discovery Channel which presumably would air
the documentary in the United States, but after the trial.

Counsel discussed the matter with Warden Perrill who advised
counsel that all organizations which had a right to comment on such an
interview had no objection to the interview except that he had not yet
heard from the United States Marshal's Office and the Marshal's
Office was waiting on approval from the Court.

Counsel submitted to the Marshal's Office copies of "Fourteen Days
in May" and "Caroline's Baby."

Aside from the proposed BBC-TV program, which is a documentary,
counsel was also besieged with requests for media interviews with
Mr. McVeigh which would be shown in this country. Counsel met
with all those who requested such interviews including Diane Sawyer,
Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw and Barbara Walters. Each
of their representatives met with Mr. McVeigh, as indicated above,
and in addition, Harry Smith, Tom Brokaw, Barbara Walters and
Diane Sawyer met personally with Mr. McVeigh.

Mr. McVeigh, on his own election, has decided that he would choose
one from among the following individuals, subject to Court
authorization, to conduct one (1) national television interview: Barbara
Walters of ABC, Diane Sawyer of ABC, Susan Candiotti of CNN,
Dan Rather of CBS, Tom Brokaw of NBC, and Jack Bowen of Fox
Television. Counsel has concurred. In face-to-face meetings with
these individuals and several meetings with their very competent
staffs, counsel of Mr. McVeigh have become convinced that each has
a high degree of professionalism, will not exploit or sensationalize the
interview, will not "browbeat" the Defendant, or expect him to answer
questions which he cannot answer, in advance of trial. The national
reputation of these individuals is well established. Ms. Walters has
interviewed a large number of prominent personalities including
several involved in the criminal justice process, including Jean Harris
and the Menendez Brothers, as well as interviews with Christopher
Reeves, the actor, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China, Dr. Fidel
Castro, and the former president of Poland, Field Marshal General
Wojecht Jaroulski. Mr. Rather has interviewed presidents and vice
presidents of the United States and Dr. Castro, and Mr. Brokaw's
interview with the Communist Party General Secretary and President
of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, received widespread praise.
Susan Candiotti is a well known journalist who has covered a variety
of major news events in 1995 and 1996, including the Montana
Freeman siege, the crash of the Value Jet in Florida, and the
Oklahoma City bombing. Diane Sawyer is a well known commentator
on Prime Time for ABC and Jack Bowen is well known to
Defendant's counsel because of the interview that he did with
Oklahoma City convicted serial killer, Roger Dale Stafford2, shortly
before his execution. What we are asking for is authority of the Court
to choose from one of these individuals to conduct one television
interview. The Defendant will not grant any other television interviews
before trial other than the two (2) requested herein: the BBC-TV and
the American television interview.

Warden Perrill has indicated, informally, no objection whatsoever to
the interview.

We believe that the public interest is served by such interviews in that,
at a minimum (but at an important minimum) the interview and
documentary will serve the public interest and the mission of the
Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, in establishing that Mr.
McVeigh is well protected, and maintained in adequate physiological
and physical conditions and that the federal government is not abusing
its custodial holding of Mr. McVeigh. Counsel certifies to the Court,
based upon his experience in this case, that it is absolutely essential
that such an image continue. The possibility for exploitation,
politically, or in a more dangerous and adventuresome ways, by those
who believe that Mr. McVeigh is a "political prisoner" and that the
federal government is "evil" simply cannot be discounted. Public
safety is not an unimportant consideration and access to Mr. McVeigh
by television is an important contribution to the confidence of the
public and to circumstances in which Mr. McVeigh is being held.

The Court has had a limited opportunity to observe Mr. McVeigh, in
other than in a purely formal Courtroom setting, and can judge for
itself whether Mr. McVeigh is mature, mentally and emotionally fit,
articulate, and capable of conducting himself as an interview subject in
the manner that the Court would expect. That is to say, that the
Defendant would not exploit the situation or make unreasonable,
untrue or inflammatory statements.

An honest, but limited, television access to Mr. McVeigh is desirable
to offset numerous stories, which we would contend, are untrue about
his background and also to offset the continuing parade of survivors
who speak about "clawing out his eyes" or "coming over the bar and
hitting him" or mocking his receiving a shirt for his birthday when one
survivor "celebrated Christmas at the graves of her grandchildren."
Mr. McVeigh is entitled, at least for a total of one hour, to be
interviewed and to be seen for what he is.

In addition, the Defendant seeks permission to authorize the following
interviews not to exceed one hour and to be published at least sixty
(60) days in advance of the case being called to trial, but after the
national television interview.

1. One interview with a national print media from among the Boston
Globe, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal or the Los
Angeles Times. Mr. McVeigh has interviewed representatives of each
of these organizations except the Boston Globe and the New York
Times. No further access to the Defendant is necessary except for the
interview.

2. One print media from the Southwest including Oklahoma which
will come from one of the following media organizations: the Tulsa
World, the Dallas Morning News, the Oklahoma Gazette. No
additional media access is necessary for Mr. McVeigh to see other
than the choice he makes of the person to do the interview.

3 . One interview conducted with a representative of the Associated
Press, or Reuters, or United Press International. No further media
access is necessary except for the interview.

4. One interview with a Denver media (print): the Rocky Mountain
News. On Saturday, August 17, 1996, the Denver Post decided it
would not submit to an off-the-record pre-interview meeting.

5. One local Denver television interview limited to 15 minutes air time,
to be chosen from Channel 4, 7 and 9. Channel 2 has advised counsel
it does not wish to be considered. Mr. McVeigh would like to meet
briefly, no more than 30 minutes apiece, with a designated reporter for
each of these three channels so that he can make an informed opinion
as to which one he would choose for an interview, should the Court
authorize such an interview.

6. One television interview of no greater than 15 minutes with one of
the Oklahoma City stations: Channel 4, 5, 9 and Oklahoma
Educational Television authority. No additional media contact is
necessary as Mr. McVeigh has met with representatives of those
channels interested in pursuing the interview.

The net effect if the Court were to grant the entire relief here would be
the following:

1. A documentary to be shown to British audiences;

2. One national American television broadcast limited to no more than
30 minutes commercial air time (actually closer to 22 minutes because
of commercials);

3. One print interview in Denver;

4. One national print interview with a newspaper;

5. One national print interview with a wire service;

6. One Oklahoma print interview;

7. One 15 minute Oklahoma City television interview (with the
understanding that the interview could not be shown in Denver); and

8. One Denver, Colorado, television interview of 15 minutes.

Each of these interviews would be subject to the following:

1. All Rules and Regulations of the Bureau of Prisons and United
States Marshal Service;

2. The Court's guidelines one extrajudicial statements; and

3. The total amount of television time for all interviews would not
exceed one (1) hour.


B. Legal Standards: As a pre-trial detainee, Mr. McVeigh retains at
least those constitutional rights that are enjoyed by convicted
prisoners. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545 (1979). Thus, Mr.
McVeigh has "a First Amendment right to be free from governmental
interference with [his] contacts with the press if that interference is
based on the content of the speech or proposed speech." Kimberlin v.
Quinlan, 774 F. Supp. 1, 34 (D.D.C. 1991), rev'd on other grounds,
6 F.3d 789 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Nonetheless, Mr. McVeigh recognizes
that the First Amendment is not violated by denying a prisoner
permission to conduct a face-to-face interview with a television news
program if doing so would disrupt the orderly operation of the prison.
Saxbe v. Washington Post, 417 U.S. 843 (1974); Johnson v.
Stephan, 6 F.3d 691, 692 (10th Cir. 1993).

Mr. McVeigh need not rely upon the Constitution, however, because
federal regulations and United States Department of Justice policies
both recognize and regulate inmates' rights to contact with news
media, including interviews which are videotaped for subsequent
broadcasts. 28 C.F.R. Section 540.63(h)(4) (authorizing the Warden
to limit the amount of video equipment or number of medial personnel
allowed to enter the institution to prevent a disruption). See also,
United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons
Program Statement 1480.03 (Oct. 7, 1994) (News Media Contracts).

The Code of Federal Regulations acknowledges the desirability of
providing public information about its operations via the news media.
28 C.F.R. Section 540.60. More specifically, the Code endorses,
while closely regulating, personal interviews between inmates and
media representatives. 28 C.F.R. Section 540.63 (personal
interviews).

As a pre-trial detainee, Mr. McVeigh falls within the scope of 28
C.F.R. Section 540.63(g)(6). That section requires "unconvicted
persons . . . held in federal institutions" to seek "clearance with the
court having jurisdiction" prior to arranging media interviews.3 This
motion seeks this Court's clearance. Although this Court's
Memorandum Opinion and Order Regarding Extrajudicial Statements
by Attorneys and Support Personnel (filed June 13, 1996) does not by
its terms specifically apply to statements by the Defendants in this
case, any interviews granted pursuant to Court authorization would
comply with that directive.

Judicial clearance for Mr. McVeigh to grant a videotaped interview
either to Barbara Walters, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Susan Candiotti,
Jack Bowen or Diane Sawyer, as well as the limited interviews with
other media representatives, is consistent with existing federal
regulations and Department of Justice policies. Granting this motion is
entirely consistent with the Fair Trial and Free Press standards
promulgated by the American Bar Association. ABA Standard 8-
2,1(b)(ii) explicitly endorses the right of a person in custody to
consent to or request a televised interview by news media
representatives. American Bar Association Standards on Criminal
Justice, Commentary on 8-2.1.


III. DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S RIGHT TO BE SEEN.

The process of the demonization of Timothy McVeigh undertaken by
the government and some media in this case was proven at the hearing
upon the Defendant's Motion of Change of Venue. The evidence
included statements from the President and the Attorney General that
the death penalty would be sought. The evidence proved the
Department of Justice officials had made extrajudicial statements
concerning Mr. McVeigh's character as a "drifter" and "militia
member" and had detailed the supposed evidence against him.
Evidence at the hearing tended to prove that federal officials speaking
on condition of anonymity had stated that chemical traces were found
upon McVeigh's clothing, that McVeigh had refused to provide any
information to Government officials (except name, rank and serial
number) and claimed to be a prisoner of war, that Mr. McVeigh's
fingerprint was found upon a receipt for the purchase of fertilizer, and
that Mr. McVeigh had authored a diary indicating bombings would
take place in three other cities. During the hearing upon Motion for
Change of Venue itself, Department of Justice officials allowed media
representatives to take video footage of Timothy McVeigh and Terry
Nichols shackled, in prison garb and under heavy guard. The
Government did not make a motion to the Court to allow for this
action and Timothy McVeigh did not have the opportunity to resist
such an exhibit which even today is repeatedly shown on national
television. The Government and press has succeeded in convincing
the public that not only is Timothy McVeigh guilty, but he deserves to
die. He is less than human. This tactic has been extremely effective
and can be proven by the following:

i. The New York Times headline on May 4, 1995, in reference to
McVeigh was "Life of Solitude, Obsession and Anger" (See Exhibit
"E" attached hereto);

ii. The Washington Post headline on July 2, 1995, was "An Ordinary
Boy's Extraordinary Rage" (See Exhibit "F" attached hereto);

iii.The Star Tribune reported on July 9, 1995, that "Investigators
speculate that the 27-year-old veteran of the Persian Gulf War had
come to see himself as a soldier in his own strange war against the
United States." (See Exhibit "G" attached hereto);

iv. Journalistic cartoons consistently portray McVeigh as a demon
with such characteristics as pointed ears and fangs (See Exhibit "H"
attached hereto);

v. The headline in the "Star" Magazine for May 16, 1995, complete
with a picture of McVeigh's image superimposed over the rubble of
the Murrah Building was "I Was Evil Bomber's Lover" (See Exhibit
"I" attached hereto);

vi. The headline in the New York Times on Sunday, December 31,
1995, was "Oklahoma Bombing Suspect: Unraveling of Frayed Life"
(See Exhibit "J" attached hereto);

vii. The headline in the Dallas Morning News on Monday, May 1,
1995, was "Sales Slip May Link Nichols to McVeigh, Blast Ton of
Ammonium Nitrate Purchased at Kansas Store" (See Exhibit "K"
attached hereto);

viii. The headline in the Washington Post on Wednesday, April 26,
1995, was "Two Brothers Face Explosives Charges, McVeigh Won't
Talk, Claiming He's a POW" (See Exhibit "L" attached hereto);

ix. The headline in the Tulsa World on Thursday, February 1, 1996,
was "Tulsa May Get Bomb Trial" (See Exhibit "M" attached hereto);

x. Photograph appearing in the Daily Oklahoman on April 22, 1995,
of FBI officials escorting Timothy McVeigh at the walk-out at the
Noble County Jail on April 21, 1995 (See Exhibit "N" attached
hereto); and

xi. Statement by the President on July 18, 1996 stating that Timothy
McVeigh and Terry Nichols are guilty (See Exhibit "O") attached
hereto.

A fair trial presupposes that the public perception of the defendant has
not been so skewered, distorted or prejudiced by the media or leaks so
as to render the trial a meaningless ritual where all parties are simply
going through the motions.4 We seek to avoid a Sam Shepherd type
trial. Mr. McVeigh, at the minimum, is entitled to be seen as a human
being and to the extent that any interview or meeting halts the rush to
judgment in advance of trial, the interests of justice are served. There
is no "selling of McVeigh". There is no press spokesman for the
McVeigh defense team except his lawyer, and there is no public
relations consultant. The McVeigh defense has not contacted a single
media representative to suggest an interview with either counsel or
client. We are not in the "favored circle" of Washington "insiders"
whom the press is dependent upon for information off-the-record or
guidance or tips. When the media contacts us we attempt to stay
within the guidelines, but we recognize that some steps are necessary
to prevent a prejudgment. The abuse, distortion, calumny heaped
upon our client from the very front steps of the courthouse will
ultimately influence the reporting and the jury unless there is some
modicum of balance.

As the Supreme Court has clearly stated:

'With his life at stake, it is not requiring too much that petitioner be
tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so huge a wave of public
passion. . . '

Shepherd v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 351 (1966) quoting Irvin v.
Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 at 728 (1961).

Our motivation in putting a picture of Timothy McVeigh before the
public is identical to the motivation of the petitioner in Gentile v. State
Bar of Nevada:

He sought only to counter publicity already deemed prejudicial. The
Southern Nevada Disciplinary Committee so found. It said petitioner
attempted:

(i) to counter public opinion which he perceived as adverse to Mr.
Sanders, (ii). . . to refute certain matters regarding his client which
had appeared in the media, (iii) to fight back against the perversive
efforts of the prosecution to poison the prospective jury pool and (iv)
to publicly present Sanders side of the case. app 3-4

Far from an admission that he sought to 'materially prejudice an
adjudicative proceeding', petitioner sought only to stop a wave of
publicity he perceived as prejudicing potential jurors against his client
and injuring his client's reputation in the community.

Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1042 and 1043
(1991).

There is not, in the United States of America in the year 1996, one
First Amendment for the Department of Justice, the survivors, and the
media and another for Timothy McVeigh. Under the circumstances of
the gross distortion of Mr. McVeigh which has been permitted to
appear, Mr. McVeigh's limited, restrained, responses in the requested
interviews would not even begin to bring the scales into balance, nor
do we seek to bring them into balance. What we do seek is to prevent
a juggernaut of prejudgment conviction which even today exists (see
Gallup Poll, Exhibit "P") and we simply try to chip it away slowly
and carefully, with dignity, with individuals such as Time,
Newsweek, and Tom Brokaw and Barbara Walters, and others.
Timothy McVeigh has a right to appear in Court as an accused
defendant in something other than sackcloth and ashes and the
Government does not have a role in determining what he does to
remove that incredibly false image, and we respectfully submit the
Court's role in it is extremely limited. Although saying that, we
certainly recognize the Court's concern about prejudicial publicity, but
we respectfully submit that the concern arises from the actions of
others.

There is absolutely nothing that Timothy McVeigh can do or say in an
interview which would prejudice the fairness of this criminal
proceeding. He does not intend nor will he say anything about the
facts of the case nor will he make statements which violate any of the
Court's directives concerning extrajudicial statements. What he might
be able to do in some very limited sense would be to soften the less
than human sculpture that the Government has chiseled into the
consciousness of the nation. That would be completely consistent with
Mr. McVeigh's First Amendment rights and the Government does not
have the right to comment upon it.

The only possible restriction that might be applied in addition to the
Court's Memorandum Opinion would be a restriction upon timing. A
trial date has not yet been set, but the Court might well impose a
moratorium which prevents the interviews sought for a period of three
months prior to trial. Government input into such a restriction is not
necessary, because Timothy McVeigh consents.

For these reasons, Counsel respectfully requests that the Court grant
the Motion for Access to the media.


IV. CONCLUSION

Mr. McVeigh respectfully requests that this Court grant judicial
clearance under 28 C.F.R. Section 540.63(g)(6) and grant the
following relief:

1. Authorize the BBC-TV, Documentary Division, through its
reporter/producer, Neil Grant, to film an interview with Mr. McVeigh
at Englewood Federal Correctional Institution during the week of
October 7, 1996. This week is important given the scheduling
commitments of the BBC and the necessity to transport a crew from
London and elsewhere to Colorado;

2. That Mr. McVeigh and his counsel be permitted to choose among
Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Susan
Candiotti and Jack Bowen for one (1) television interview which must
be filmed and completed in the month of October-1996, to be aired no
later than the week of Thanksgiving; and

3. That the limited other interviews outlined herein be authorized.

DATED this 19th day of August, 1996.

Respectfully submitted

ENDNOTES

1. The publisher has cornrnitted a "$75,000.00 national marketing
budget, national media appearances, national advertising and an author
tour." Exhibit "B". Undoubtedly, Denver will be on this tour.

2. Counsel for Mr. McVeigh represented, by appointment of Judge
West, Mr. Stafford.

3. That same provision recites that judicial clearance is "ordinarily
[obtained] through the U.S. Attorney's Office." 28 C.F.R. Sec.
540.63(g)(6). This motion seeks judicial clearance without
intervention of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Because the U.S. Attorney
is presently prosecuting Mr. McVeigh for a capital offense, Mr.
McVeigh respectfully submits that his case is "extraordinary."
Allowing the U.S. Attorney to deny unilaterally Mr. McVeigh the
right to grant personal interviews with the media makes no more sense
than suggesting that Mr. McVeigh's defense counsel should have the
power to veto interviews contemplated by Attorney General Janet
Reno or other Justice Department officials.

4. A guest on the nationally televised cable program "Politically
Incorrectt' referred to our client as "garbage" at which point the
audience burst into applause. (Exhibit "Q").

<P> This brief was put into evidence by the prosecution during 
hearings in July, 1996, concerning suppression of evidence in the 
Oklahoma City bombing trial. In 1992, Terry Nichols was being sued 
by his bank in Michigan for non-payment of a debt. He filed this 
motion challenging the court's jurisdiction. In the Oklahoma City case, 
prosecutors used the brief to argue that Nichols was fully cognizant of 
his rights when he orally argued to speak with the FBI without an 
attorney present.</P>

6. Above Motions are supported by accompanying Brief. 
 
 
BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF (ALLEGED) DEFENDANT'S ABOVE 
MOTIONS 
 
<u>BACKGROUND</u> 
 
Terry L. Nichols comes as a "Non-lawyer (Alleged) Defendant" not 
Pro Se as Plaintiff's attorney is alleging and presuming. I am with 
capable, sound mind and body defending self against a very strong 
political law system that runs over the average Individual without a 
care for Truth, Honesty and Justice. 
 
<u>ARGUMENT</u> 
 
There has not been one piece of evidence brought forward that Nichols' 
is under the Court's jurisdiction. Plaintiff must prove the Court has 
jurisdiction. 
 
Who is handling this case for the Plaintiff, Richard Roosen or Jack 
Gibson, Jr. of Kahn, Kahn and Gibson, P.C.. And who is Jack Gibson, 
Jr. associated with as a practicing Attorney, Kahn, Kahn and Givson, 
P.C. or Kemp, Klien, Umprey & Endelman. 
 
I can see the 'Play on words', 'Smoke screening', 'Denying', 'Ignoring', 
and 'Twisting' that lawyers (attorneys) use of the Laws. 
 
Example # 1: Jack Gibson, Jr. states on pages 7 and 11 of his 
Supporting Brief dated 27 July 1992 That U.C.C. 3-303:7 and 3-303:1 
are "non-existent sections/cites", apparently this professional has never 
heard of ANDERSON ON THE U.C.C. - see EXHIBIT # 1 and # 2 
(highlighted). Also attached is EXHIBIT # 3, U.C.C. 3-303:21, 
'EXTENSION OF CREDIT', which is a major part of the Counterclaim 
along with "Constructive Fraud". 
 
Example # 2: Further evidence that Jack Gibson, Jr. twists words, 
phrases, and sentences (as lawyers love doing) is the statement in 
Gibson's Brief on page 6, last paragraph -- "are acting under color of 
money", which is only part of Nichols' statement on Nichols' 
Counterclaim, page 1, first paragraph, which by Gibson's manipulation 
takes Nichols' meaning out of context. 
 
These are just two of numerous items that Gibson tries to bend and 
mold to his client's advantage.  
 
Jack Gibson, Jr. also stated on page 7 that Article 3 applies to 
"Negotiable Instruments"2 what is a negotiable instrument, Jack. 
 
By providing Nichols with the answers to the Interrogatories that was 
attached to the Counterclaim that Nichols filed on 06 July 1992 as 
exhibit # 3, I can prove my claims. But, Jack Gibson, Jr., his law firm, 
and the Plaintiffs have chose to ignore these. Where is the Justice!! 
 
As for U.C.C. 3-505 "Rights of the Party to Whom Presentment is 
Made", again by Plaintiff and Plaintiff's Attorneys fully and completely 
answering the Interrogatories Nichols can prove and show evidence as 
to Nichols Counterclaim. I have been denied Justice. Nichols can tie 
these and other U.C.C. Sections in to show my cause of actions. 
 
My writings and communications are no more confusing and garbled 
then Jack Gibson, Jr's. writings and communications. No average 
Individual can understand the laws, rules, codes, and garbage language 
that all lawyers use. The lawyers are the ones that make the laws 
confusing, they don't want the average Individual to understand the 
laws. If all these Bloodsucking Parasites (lawyers) disappeared, this 
whole world would be better off. Most lawyers don't even understand 
or know the law themselves. It boils down to who can throw up the 
most garbage and see what sticks. THERE IS NO REASON IN THE 
WORLD WHY ANY CODE, RULE, OR LAW SHOULD BE 
WRITTEN SO THAT THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL CAN NOT 
EASILY UNDERSTAND THEM. THEREFORE NO NEED FOR 
LAWYERS, PERIOD. But no, they love to complicate the hell out of 
anything. Proof of this is Jack Gibson, Jr's. ignorance of the U.C.C. 
Sections that he stated are non-existent and inapplicable as stated 
earlier. 
 
The Fraud and Misrepresentation that Nichols claims in his 
Counterclaim apparently needs clarifying. 
 
CAVEAT/CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE TO ALL 
 
Plaintiff is guilty of Fraud and Usury by "Constructive Fraud without 
Scienter" (38 Cal. Rplr. 148, 157) "No Scienter (Intent) is required; 
thus, party who makes misrepresentation need not know it is false" 
(437 S.W. 2d 20, 28). 
 
Plaintiff's deceptive practices created, loaned and charged me, Terry L. 
Nichols, interest on "created-credit' all contrary to several Court 
Decisions: "Banks canNOT loan Credit" (First Natl. Bank v. Monroe, 
69 S.E. 1123; St. Louis Savings Bank v. Parmalee, 95 U.S. 557; 
American Express Co. v. Citizens State Bank, 181 Wis. 172). 
 
I refuse to partake of "Constructive Fraud Without Scienter" and do 
hereby withdraw from said account, and will make NO PAYMENTS 
obtained by "Constructive Fraud Without Scienter" (437 S.W. 2d 
20,28). 
 
Plaintiff's Attorney will find himself violating 7 C.J.S. Section 4 
Lawyers Code of Ethics, and Co-Plaintiff with Client/Lender as an 
Accessory to Collusion and Conspiracy in Client/Lender's "Bad-Check-
of-Bank-Credit"; lacking, "Lawful Consideration for Contract/Note to 
exist" (Wingate v. Wingate, 11 Tex. 430); thus, Before the Court 
"Without Clean Hands"..."Without Claim for Relief"... "Without 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction", and "Without Cause of Action to 
Complain". 
 
Take Judicial Notice (187 N.W. 2d 845, 847), of Caveat/Constructive 
Notice, herein; and Govern Yourself Accordingly. 
 
Once again I state that Nichols' Counterclaims are valid and I stand 
firm on them. 
 
In reference to Gibson's statement in his Brief on page 3, paragraph 
numbered 8 and the comment following, if the Plaintiff and the 
Plaintiff's Attorneys do not understand what colorable3 means then 
they are more of a functional illiterate then I am and should definitely 
NOT be in business. 
 
As for my Counterclaim for monetary damages in "the sum certaim of 
50,000 dollars or 14,200 ounces of Silver"; I am stating that I want 
tangible value. 
 
Again, all of Plaintiff's and Plaintiff's Attorneys Motions, Notices, 
Summaries, Sanctions, Briefs, Praecipe, and any other matter should be 
striker for the reason that they are attempting to steamroll over Nichols 
and the Court is willing to allow this Injustice to occur, unless the 
Court orders the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's Attorneys to fully and 
completely answer the Interrogatories that were attached to Nichols' 
Counterclaim. Again, the Interrogatories will prove and show evidence 
that what I claim is true and fact. WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO 
HIDE!! 
 
I am sure that Plaintiff's Attorney and the Court fully understands what 
a "Non-resident Alein[sic], Non-forgeiner[sic], Stranger" to the current 
State of the Forum is. Should he not, then I suggest he had better go 
back to studying his law books or obtain some better law books that 
will explain it. 
 
As for the Motion to Include Other Persons in Counterclaim. The 
Court, Plaintiff, and Plaintiff's Attorneys are hereby put on Notice that 
any person assisting4 Plaintiff and/or 
Plaintiff's Attorneys shall be liable, accountable, and subject to the 
same resitutions[sic] as stated in Nichols' Counterclaim against Plaintiff 
and Plaintiff's Attorneys. 
 
Boiling it all down into a nutshell, plain English, Terry L. Nichols is 
entitled to a Default Judgement[sic] from Plaintiff and Plaintiff's 
Attorneys for having failed to do the following -- 
 
1. Prove court's Jurisdiction 
 
2. State a claim upon which relief can be granted

you. Do you understand that? 
 
NICHOLS: No, I don't. 
 
TEEPLE: Well, they're entitled to ask you questions about your assets 
and liabilities and income.  
 
NICHOLS: I... simply do not understand that. 
 
TEEPLE: What is it that you don't understand about that? 
 
NICHOLS: All of it. How can you proceed...without jurisdiction...over 
me? 
 
TEEPLE: Well, I've already decided that, so if I'm wrong, I've been 
wrong in the past. 
 
NICHOLS: Then how did you get jurisdiction over me? 
 
TEEPLE: That's already been decided. There's a judgement[sic] against 
you. The question today is...you are being asked to answer questions in 
regard to your assets and liabilities and income and so on...in terms of, 
in terms of collecting the judgement[sic]. 
 
(Pause) 
 
NICHOLS: Before I give anything...I want to see the original genuine 
document that I signed..the true document that's signed...that shows 
that I'm liable for anything. I've not seen that. 
 
(Shuffling noises) 
 
TEEPLE: You've never got.. 
 
NICHOLS: I don't want copies. Copies, I can get a copy from anyone 
with (U) signature on anything...make it look good and I can put an 
affidavit with it and it'll look good.

NICHOLS: I want to see the document they said I signed...that shows 
that I'm liable. 
 
(Pause) 
 
TEEPLE: Right now all you have to worry about is that this document 
says you owe them...thirteen thousand, six hundred ninety one dollars

Dear Sgt. John Wynalda: 
 
RE: Notice of Revocation of Signature and Power of Attorney 
 
This letter is to clarify the above referenced document that was not sent 
back to me as stated in your letter you sent to me on 27 March 1992. 
 
I am stating that I no longer am a citizen of the corrupt political 
corporate State of Michigan and the United States of America.  (The 
current state of the forum).  I am a "Non Resident Alien" to the State of 
Michigan and the United States of America.  I am a natural born human 
being born in the area you call Michigan not the corporate State of 
Michigan.  Not being part of the corporate system of the State of 
Michigan I do not need to obtain any of the State's privileges (licenses).  
Therefore, I am not under the jurisdiction of the corporate State of 
Michigan.  I follow the Common Laws, not the Uniform Commercial 
Codes, Michigan Statutes, etc., that are all colorable laws. 
 
Therefore, I want the "Notice of Revocation of Signature and Power of 
Attorney" document made as a permanent part of your records so when 
and if a DNR Officer stops me he can check with your office and know 
that I'm not within your jurisdiction.  Or your department can send me 
a document stating such so that I can present it to any DNR Officer at 
any time. 
 
Should you have any further questions you may want to check with a 
good knowledge honest attorney or judge. 
 
Explicitly reserving all of my rights without prejudice

Sincerely,

<P> Terry Nichols' attorneys have been trying to have Chief Judge 
Richard Matsch throw out key evidence obtained by the FBI thrown 
out of court. As part of their motions, the Nichols' legal team alleged 
that phone records from Nichols' house show calls being made at a time 
when Nichols was at the local police station. In this brief Nichols' 
lawyers contend that the FBI was in the house and using the phone 
during a time when they did not have a search warrant. In an Aug. 14 
ruling Matsch denied Nichols' motions to suppress evidence. However, 
Matsch reserved ruling on this specific matter until trial.</P> 
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT> 
<PRE>
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT 
OF COLORADO 
 
Chief Judge Richard P. Matsch 
 
Crim. Action No. 96-CR-68-M 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS, 
Defendants. 
 
Terry Lynn Nichols' Motion to Supplement the  Record of June 26-29 
Suppression Hearing 
 
 
Terry Lynn Nichols moves the Court to supplement the record of the 
Suppression Hearing of June 26-29, 1996 with the attached exhibit 
which, if accepted by the Court, would be denominated Nichols Exhibit 
W83. 
 
The exhibit consists of two pages of government summaries of 
telephone calls to and from the Nichols' family telephone on April 21, 
1995. The government provided these records to the defense in 
discovery. 
 
The evidentiary significance of the records is that they show telephone 
calls both into and out of the Nichols home during a time when it is 
undisputed that both Mr. and Mrs. Nichols were out of the house and in 
F.B.I. custody. 
 
For example, the records show the following: 
 
* At 5:36 pm on April 21, 1995, a 3 minute and 41 second phone call 
from "A Current Affair," located in Cleveland Ohio to the Nichols 
home number in Herington, Kansas. 
 
* At 8:38 pm on April 21, 1995, a 2 minute and three second phone 
call from ABC in New York to the Nichols home number in Herington, 
Kansas. 
 
* At 8:40 pm on April 21, 1995, a 19 minute phone call from the 
Nichols home number in Herington, to the James Nichols number in 
Cass City, MI (at that time, of course, James Nichols was himself in 
custody and the FBI was occupying his house and doing a search). 
 
These records indicate one of two possibilities: First, that the F.B.I. was 
actually in the Nichols' Herington home on the evening of April 21, 
1995 (after the home was 
secured and Mr. and Mrs. Nichols were occupied by their respective 
interrogators) answering the phone as calls came in from the press and 
making calls to FBI colleagues who were simultaneously conducting a 
search of the James Nichols home in Michigan. 
 
Or second, that there are significant, if not fundamental flaws with the 
very phone records on which the FBI in part relied to compile the list 
of Mrs. Marife Nichols' phone calls during her custody. See GX 64; 
Hearing Transcript June 29, Tongate pp. 1030-31. 
 
No matter which of these scenarios actually transpired, the records are 
of indisputable evidentiary value to the issues the Court is considering 
with respect to the motion to suppress. If the FBI was inside the 
Herington home using the telephone on the night of April 21, 1995, the 
United States has an obligation to so inform the Court. 
 
Therefore, Mr. Nichols respectfully prays that the Court exercise its 
discretion by granting this motion and accepting the attached exhibit as 
a supplement to the evidence before the Court on Mr. Nichols' Motion 
to Suppress. 
 
Respectfully submitted,

<P> This brief was put into evidence by the prosecution during 
hearings in July, 1996, concerning suppression of evidence in the 
Oklahoma City bombing trial. 
In 1992, Terry Nichols was being sued by his bank in Michigan for 
non-payment of a debt. He filed this motion challenging the court's 
jurisdiction. In the Oklahoma City case, prosecutors used the brief to 
argue that Nichols was fully cognizant of his rights when he orally 
argreed to speak with the FBI without an attorney present.</P>

is under the Court's jurisdiction. Plaintiff must prove the Court has 
jurisdiction.

Who is handling this case for the Plaintiff, Richard Roosen or Jack 
Gibson, Jr. of Kahn, Kahn and Gibson, P.C.. And who is Jack Gibson, 
Jr. associated with as a practicing Attorney, Kahn, Kahn and Givson, 
P.C. or Kemp, Klien, Umprey & Endelman.

I can see the 'Play on words', 'Smoke screening', 'Denying', 'Ignoring', 
and 'Twisting' that lawyers (attorneys) use of the Laws.

Example # 1: Jack Gibson, Jr. states on pages 7 and 11 of his 
Supporting Brief dated 27 July 1992 That U.C.C. 3-303:7 and 3-303:1 
are "non-existent sections/cites", apparently this professional has never 
heard of ANDERSON ON THE U.C.C. - see EXHIBIT # 1 and # 2 
(highlighted). Also attached is EXHIBIT # 3, U.C.C. 3-303:21, 
'EXTENSION OF CREDIT', which is a major part of the Counterclaim 
along with "Constructive Fraud".

Example # 2: Further evidence that Jack Gibson, Jr. twists words, 
phrases, and sentences (as lawyers love doing) is the statement in 
Gibson's Brief on page 6, last paragraph -- "are acting under color of 
money", which is only part of Nichols' statement on Nichols' 
Counterclaim, page 1, first paragraph, which by Gibson's manipulation 
takes Nichols' meaning out of context.

These are just two of numerous items that Gibson tries to bend and 
mold to his client's advantage. 

Jack Gibson, Jr. also stated on page 7 that Article 3 applies to 
"Negotiable Instruments"2 what is a negotiable instrument, Jack.

By providing Nichols with the answers to the Interrogatories that was 
attached to the Counterclaim that Nichols filed on 06 July 1992 as 
exhibit # 3, I can prove my claims. But, Jack Gibson, Jr., his law firm, 
and the Plaintiffs have chose to ignore these. Where is the Justice!!

As for U.C.C. 3-505 "Rights of the Party to Whom Presentment is 
Made", again by Plaintiff and Plaintiff's Attorneys fully and completely 
answering the Interrogatories Nichols can prove and show evidence as 
to Nichols Counterclaim. I have been denied Justice. Nichols can tie 
these and other U.C.C. Sections in to show my cause of actions.

My writings and communications are no more confusing and garbled 
then Jack Gibson, Jr's. writings and communications. No average 
Individual can understand the laws, rules, codes, and garbage language 
that all lawyers use. The lawyers are the ones that make the laws 
confusing, they don't want the average Individual to understand the 
laws. If all these Bloodsucking Parasites (lawyers) disappeared, this 
whole world would be better off. Most lawyers don't even understand 
or know the law themselves. It boils down to who can throw up the 
most garbage and see what sticks. THERE IS NO REASON IN THE 
WORLD WHY ANY CODE, RULE, OR LAW SHOULD BE 
WRITTEN SO THAT THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL CAN NOT 
EASILY UNDERSTAND THEM. THEREFORE NO NEED FOR 
LAWYERS, PERIOD. But no, they love to complicate the hell out of 
anything. Proof of this is Jack Gibson, Jr's. ignorance of the U.C.C. 
Sections that he stated are non-existent and inapplicable as stated 
earlier.

The Fraud and Misrepresentation that Nichols claims in his 
Counterclaim apparently needs clarifying.

CAVEAT/CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE TO ALL

Plaintiff is guilty of Fraud and Usury by "Constructive Fraud without 
Scienter" (38 Cal. Rplr. 148, 157) "No Scienter (Intent) is required; 
thus, party who makes misrepresentation need not know it is false" 
(437 S.W. 2d 20, 28).

Plaintiff's deceptive practices created, loaned and charged me, Terry L. 
Nichols, interest on "created-credit' all contrary to several Court 
Decisions: "Banks canNOT loan Credit" (First Natl. Bank v. Monroe, 
69 S.E. 1123; St. Louis Savings Bank v. Parmalee, 95 U.S. 557; 
American Express Co. v. Citizens State Bank, 181 Wis. 172).

I refuse to partake of "Constructive Fraud Without Scienter" and do 
hereby withdraw from said account, and will make NO PAYMENTS 
obtained by "Constructive Fraud Without Scienter" (437 S.W. 2d 
20,28).

Plaintiff's Attorney will find himself violating 7 C.J.S. Section 4 
Lawyers Code of Ethics, and Co-Plaintiff with Client/Lender as an 
Accessory to Collusion and Conspiracy in Client/Lender's "Bad-Check-
of-Bank-Credit"; lacking, "Lawful Consideration for Contract/Note to 
exist" (Wingate v. Wingate, 11 Tex. 430); thus, Before the Court 
"Without Clean Hands"..."Without Claim for Relief"... "Without 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction", and "Without Cause of Action to 
Complain".

Take Judicial Notice (187 N.W. 2d 845, 847), of Caveat/Constructive 
Notice, herein; and Govern Yourself Accordingly.

Once again I state that Nichols' Counterclaims are valid and I stand 
firm on them.

In reference to Gibson's statement in his Brief on page 3, paragraph 
numbered 8 and the comment following, if the Plaintiff and the 
Plaintiff's Attorneys do not understand what colorable3 means then 
they are more of a functional illiterate then I am and should definitely 
NOT be in business.

As for my Counterclaim for monetary damages in "the sum certaim of 
50,000 dollars or 14,200 ounces of Silver"; I am stating that I want 
tangible value.

Again, all of Plaintiff's and Plaintiff's Attorneys Motions, Notices, 
Summaries, Sanctions, Briefs, Praecipe, and any other matter should be 
striker for the reason that they are attempting to steamroll over Nichols 
and the Court is willing to allow this Injustice to occur, unless the 
Court orders the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's Attorneys to fully and 
completely answer the Interrogatories that were attached to Nichols' 
Counterclaim. Again, the Interrogatories will prove and show evidence 
that what I claim is true and fact. WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO 
HIDE!!

I am sure that Plaintiff's Attorney and the Court fully understands what 
a "Non-resident Alein[sic], Non-forgeiner[sic], Stranger" to the current 
State of the Forum is. Should he not, then I suggest he had better go 
back to studying his law books or obtain some better law books that 
will explain it.

As for the Motion to Include Other Persons in Counterclaim. The 
Court, Plaintiff, and Plaintiff's Attorneys are hereby put on Notice that 
any person assisting4 Plaintiff and/or
Plaintiff's Attorneys shall be liable, accountable, and subject to the 
same resitutions[sic] as stated in Nichols' Counterclaim against Plaintiff 
and Plaintiff's Attorneys.

Boiling it all down into a nutshell, plain English, Terry L. Nichols is 
entitled to a Default Judgement[sic] from Plaintiff and Plaintiff's 
Attorneys for having failed to do the following --

1. Prove court's Jurisdiction

2. State a claim upon which relief can be granted

3. Show standing for their claim

4. Answer Interrogatories in Counterclaim.

Dear Sgt. John Wynalda:

RE: Notice of Revocation of Signature and Power of Attorney

This letter is to clarify the above referenced document that was not sent 
back to me as stated in your letter you sent to me on 27 March 1992.

I am stating that I no longer am a citizen of the corrupt political 
corporate State of Michigan and the United States of America.  (The 
current state of the forum).  I am a "Non Resident Alien" to the State of 
Michigan and the United States of America.  I am a natural born human 
being born in the area you call Michigan not the corporate State of 
Michigan.  Not being part of the corporate system of the State of 
Michigan I do not need to obtain any of the State's privileges (licenses).  
Therefore, I am not under the jurisdiction of the corporate State of 
Michigan.  I follow the Common Laws, not the Uniform Commercial 
Codes, Michigan Statutes, etc., that are all colorable laws.

Therefore, I want the "Notice of Revocation of Signature and Power of 
Attorney" document made as a permanent part of your records so when 
and if a DNR Officer stops me he can check with your office and know 
that I'm not within your jurisdiction.  Or your department can send me 
a document stating such so that I can present it to any DNR Officer at 
any time.

Should you have any further questions you may want to check with a 
good knowledge honest attorney or judge.

Explicitly reserving all of my rights without prejudice

Sincerely,

<P>U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ruled July 15, 1996 that victims and their families could watch the trial on closed-circuit TV. He also ruled that government agents had "judicial approval" for seizing Timothy McVeigh's clothing after McVeigh's arrest. Defense lawyers had asked for  the evidence to be excluded from trial, claiming that a warrant was not used during the search. You can also read the <a href=/casefiles/oklahoma/documents/july15ed.html> transcript excerpts</a> that deal with the constitutionality of closed-circuit TV.</P>

for the United States.  With me at counsel table is Sean

Connelly, Scott Mendeloff, Vicki Behenna, Beth Wilkinson and
Larry Mackey.  Also in the courtroom are several government
employees including our two case agents.  I don't believe any
of the Government employees other than the two case agents
would be witnesses at any hearing or the trial.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

For Mr. McVeigh?

MR. JONES:  Stephen Jones for the defendant, Timothy
McVeigh, who is present in court; and with me at the counsel
table is Mr. Richard Burr, Mr. Rob Nigh, Ms. Jeralyn Merritt
and Mr. Robert Wyatt, IV.

THE COURT:  And Mr. Tigar for the defendant Terry Lynn
Nichols.

MR. TIGAR:  Michael Tigar.  Mr. Terry Lynn Nichols is
present in court.  With me at counsel table, Ron Woods, Adam
Thurschwell, and Reid Neureiter.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

And Mr. McVeigh is present, I note.

I suggest our schedule be that we have first a motion
to supplement the record with respect to an additional exhibit
on behalf of Mr. Nichols, then we have oral arguments on the
motions to suppress; and I suggest we take argument for the
motion by Mr. McVeigh first and then for Mr. Nichols.  Then the
Government's motion in limine regarding statement --
admissibility of Mr. Nichols' statements as against

Mr. McVeigh; then we'll discuss the Government's motion for
closed circuit television transmission to Oklahoma City.

I would hope also before we're done today we could set
some other hearings on some of the other matters that need to
be resolved before trial.

So unless there is objection to that schedule or it
presents any problems, we'll start, Mr. Tigar, with your motion
for this exhibit, which as I understand it is based on
telephone records that were provided; and you're offering W83;
and there is opposition to it as filed by the Government.
      DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT

MR. TIGAR:  That's correct, your Honor.  If the Court
please, over the last number of months, we have received
telephone records or purported telephone records in the form
that W83 appears.  We have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours
of investigator time and Mr. Nichols' time and counsel time
analyzing these.  The Court will recall that these records or
records in this form were widely leaked to the press and claims
were made that these records fully and accurately portrayed
telephone calls from one telephone to another; for instance,
Mr. McVeigh to Mr. Nichols.

Thus, when in a routine check after the suppression
hearing as our investigators were working, we discovered these
two pages, we thought that they were important.  This is not a
case of us going and looking at the records after the motion to

suppress.  It was one of the investigators came to us and said,
Look, this is what I found; is it important?

We called the Government and the Government said,
Well, these records are indeed accurate so far as we're aware.
We oppose the motion.

The significance of the records is apparent from the
face of our motion because it shows -- the records show that on
the 21st of April, 1995, there were a number of telephone calls
made to and from the Nichols' residence in Herington at a time
when Mr. Nichols, Mrs. Nichols, and little Nicole were in the
police station.  The inference is that the FBI or other law
enforcement agencies were in the house and were answering the
phone.

For example, there are three telephone calls from the
number of Capital Cities/ABC, one of which is 54 seconds and
another of which is 2 minutes and 3 seconds.  In terms of an
outgoing call, it shows that at 8:40 and 45 seconds there was a
19-minute, 18-second telephone call made from that telephone to
the home of James Nichols in Cass City, Michigan.

Now, at that time, 8:40 p.m., as the evidence shows,
Mr. James Nichols' house had been occupied by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation under a search warrant.

THE COURT:  With respect to that one, the Government's
response is that that is an error; that it -- instead of being
4-21, it should be 4-12.

MR. TIGAR:  I'm about to show the Court that with all
due respect, the Government's position simply doesn't hold
water.  I have before me the telephone records for 4-12, 1995.
And indeed, there is a telephone call on 4-12, 1995, from the
Nichols home to the farm of James Nichols there in Cass City,
Michigan.  The telephone call begins at 8:20 p.m., not 8:40;
and it lasts for a period of -- let me make sure I get the
right numbers here -- not -- for a period of some 19 minutes
and a different number of seconds than the 19 minutes, 18
seconds.

So what the Government is telling your Honor is not
simply that an FBI agent transposed a number but -- and I know
Government counsel will admit this, because I think they've had
a burst of candor about it, when they stand up; that is, that
on the 12th of April, there is a call shown beginning at 8:20
and ending at 8:40.  That's on the records we already have.
The Government says that the other call listed on the 21st is
that same telephone call.  It isn't a transposition.  The
Government says that they're in fact one telephone call listed
twice with a different duration, a different starting time, a
different code key number and reflected only once in the
billing records for the 12th.

I have before me the billing record on which the call
of the 12th is based, and that starts at 8:20 and goes for 20.0
minutes.  And the bill was for $2.90.  I can hand that up to
the Court.

So that alleged error, if the Court please, simply
doesn't wash; that is, it isn't a question of somebody
transposed a number.  The Government is now claiming that, Gee
whiz, we just listed the call twice with completely different
characteristics.

The Government's other claim, your Honor, with respect
to the calls from ABC is that the telephone rings at the
Nichols residence and as soon as the telephone rings, the
counter starts.  Now, your Honor, these are not cellular
phones; these are ordinary phones like all of us have in our
house.

The only problem with the story that a telephone call
that lasts for 2 minutes, 3 seconds represents the telephone
ringing and nobody talking is that two lines up there is a call
that is listed as zero minutes and zero seconds.  Does that
mean that somebody just thought about telephoning but didn't
really and never did make the phone ring and that's how it's
zero, whereas when the phone rings, it's 2 minutes and 3
seconds?  The Government doesn't have an explanation for that,
other than to say that different long distance companies bill
differently.

In sum, your Honor, either there were FBI agents in
that house answering that telephone and making telephone calls,
which is what this record shows that the Government gave us and

to the accuracy of which they have sworn, or, for the past six
months, thousands of pages of discovery have been provided to
us purporting to show telephone calls to and from particular
subscribers with particular durations and all of those
thousands of pages upon which the taxpayers of this good land
of ours have spent thousands of dollars to have investigators
working are complete nonsense, they are lies and falsehoods, at
the very least reckless, and we simply have wasted months of
time attempting to analyze this evidence.  One of those two
inferences inescapably appears.

We submit, your Honor, that the internal
inconsistencies in the Government's position about whether or
not the agents were in that house and using that telephone
require the inference be made against the person who, after
all, was the sponsor of this evidence and provided it to us.
And that's the reason we want that exhibit in evidence.

THE COURT:  And why is it that we didn't have this on
June 26 or 28th?

MR. TIGAR:  Because, your Honor, we, to begin with,
believed the Government that the agents were not in the house.
We have, your Honor, back at our office hundreds of thousands
of pages of records provided us by the Government.  It is the
purest fluke and accident that our investigators were working
through these telephone records for this crucial period for
Terry's calls to and from his house in connection with our

preparation of the defense; and when they brought it to our
attention, we brought it to the Court's attention as speedily
as we possibly could.

THE COURT:  And that was when?

MR. TIGAR:  That was on the date that this motion was
filed, your Honor, which was last week.

THE COURT:  July 11.

MR. TIGAR:  July 11.

In short, your Honor, we've been plowing through the
records, as the Court knows, and we simply had no reason until
the investigator found this to think that this sort of
incursion into the Nichols home had taken place.

THE COURT:  What is Cass City and its relationship to
Dexter?  I thought we had had the address of Dexter, Michigan,
before.

MR. TIGAR:  Cass City, Michigan, your Honor, is
apparently the telephone company's listing of the James Nichols
farm.  They list it as Cass City because that's where the
telephone service is provided out of.  There is no dispute that
that telephone number is the James Nichols farm, the very same
one that FBI S.W.A.T. teams had occupied beginning, if
perimeter security marks the beginning, at approximately noon
on the 21st.

THE COURT:  All right.

Well, Mr. Mackey, are you responding to this?  You

signed the written response.

PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT

MR. MACKEY:  I am, your Honor.

Your Honor, I would ask the Court the same question I
asked Mr. Woods when he called some 10 or 12 days after the
close of the evidence in this case; and that is, what does this
go to?  What does it prove about the suppression hearing?  And
he asserted then, as Mr. Tigar has asserted now, that this
telephone record proves that there were FBI agents in Terry
Nichols' house before the search warrant.

THE COURT:  Or, as Mr. Tigar said, that the summary is
incorrect.

MR. MACKEY:  Right.

THE COURT:  And apparently it was your position when
you made the written response that there at least is one error.

Tell me something about this summary.  I haven't
looked at it.  And this is a summary prepared by some FBI
agents?

MR. MACKEY:  Yes, your Honor.  On January 17 of this
year, 1996, I met with Mr. Woods and representatives for
Mr. McVeigh and tendered at that time a number of summaries.
And that summary is simply a document that is produced as a
result of FBI personnel sitting down with the raw business
records from the telephone companies and entering data,
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of numbers, into a format
that all the parties hopefully can benefit from.

At the same time that we turned over the summary, we
turned over an inventory that related each of those raw records
to the corresponding entry so that any party would be in a
position to examine the accuracy of those records.

This motion points out one innocent error in that
summary.  But it also points out there is a lot to know about
business records when it comes from telephone companies that
can lead to innocent misinterpretations.  Clearly what happened
in the afternoon of April 21 is news organizations got Terry
Nichols' listed phone number, got on the phone and started
calling; and there is a record maintained by telephone
companies that shows when that call started and when it ended,
even if no one in the Terry Nichols residence answered that
phone.

THE COURT:  And you think they let it ring for three
minutes?

MR. MACKEY:  We probably could call more than one
witness behind me, Judge, who would say that that afternoon
they wanted to keep that line open with the hope that somebody
would answer, yes.

THE COURT:  Well, tell me more about this one, though,
that goes to James Nichols' residence.  Your written response
is that that's just a transposition of numbers and it should be
the 12th instead of the 21st.  Mr. Tigar has gone into some
detail here with respect to the records of the 12th to say that
it is not an error.  I don't know -- I'm somewhat at a loss
here.

MR. MACKEY:  And again, I don't know how much time the
Court wants to spend on this.  We could submit affidavits or
produce other witnesses; but the fact of the matter is on
April 12 there was a long distance phone call placed from the
Terry Nichols residence lasting approximately 20 minutes.  It
began at approximately 8:20 p.m. and ended at approximately
8:40.  In entering that record about that phone call, it was
inverted and shown as April 21 instead of April 12.  The
additional error is that it was shown twice, 8:20 and 8:40, as
Mr. Tigar pointed out.

But the whole point, your Honor, is that it doesn't
demonstrate to suggest that the evidence that the Court heard
during four days of suppression evidence has proven that the
FBI agents were in that residence prior to the time they were
authorized by warrant.

THE COURT:  Well, here's what I'm going to do.  I'll
receive W83 for what it is.  Now, if you want to supplement the
record with some affidavits and explanations with respect to
that, you may do so.

MR. MACKEY:  With the Court's permission --

THE COURT:  I don't intend to reopen the evidentiary
record and pursue that in any depth.

MR. MACKEY:  With the Court's permission, we'll
attach, then, the raw records that the --

THE COURT:  Not all of them, just the one that relates
to the 12th, the 21st.  All right?

MR. MACKEY:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That's how we'll deal with it.

MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I don't believe we have
received a copy of the Government's response.

THE COURT:  You didn't?

MR. JONES:  And I've checked with counsel here at the
table.  I wonder if they have a copy.  And I want to be sure we
get copies of these supplemental filings.

THE COURT:  Of course you should.

It's now been handed to you?

MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  We'll go forward next with
argument supporting the motion of Mr. McVeigh on suppressing
clothing, personal effects taken from the Noble County Jail.

MR. JONES:  Ms. Merritt will make that argument.

THE COURT:  All right, Ms. Merritt.

I don't think we have any factual dispute here with
respect to what happened; and mostly it looks like we have a
question here of what does United States vs. Edwards mean as
applicable to this case and this Fifth Circuit case.

DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

MS. MERRITT:  That's correct, your Honor.  I don't
think the facts are in dispute.  I think that the key to
resolving this issue is -- probably lies in examining and
identifying each of the searches and seizures involved, because
it isn't just one search and seizure of his clothing.  There is
actually four separate searches and seizures that took place,
and I don't believe, as the Court said, that the facts are in
dispute.

The first search and seizure was a search incident to
his arrest on April 21, when Mr. McVeigh was stopped in
Oklahoma by Trooper Hanger.  At that time, there was a search
incident to his arrest, and a gun and a knife were taken from
Mr. McVeigh.  He then -- the trooper then put those in his car
and transported them to the Noble County Jail.  That's the
first seizure.  And the seizure of those items, the validity of
it, is not in dispute.  I mean that's clearly a search incident
to an arrest.

The second search, the booking search, in which that's
the search that occurred at the time that Mr. McVeigh arrived
at the Noble County jail and was subjected to search of his
person and personal effects -- and that is divided into two
categories.  There is the seizure of his personal effects for
safekeeping by Officer or Jailer Moritz, and then there is the
exchange of clothing whereby he was ordered to disrobe and put
his clothes in a bag which then went into the property room,
where it stayed until the FBI came on April 21.  And that's the
clothing part of the search when he was given the jumpsuit to
wear.

The third search is the search and seizure or is the
transfer of the personal effects and the clothing and I assume
the gun and the knife from the Noble County Jail personnel to
the FBI.

And then the fourth and final search and seizure is
the submission by the FBI of the personal effects and clothing
and, I believe, the knife to their laboratory in Washington,
D.C., for testing.

And I think what we have to do is look at each of
those four searches and see whether or not an exception to the
warrant requirement applies, since none of these were
warrantless searches.

As I said, we don't have any quarrel with the search
incident to arrest of the weapons and the knife.  We can't say
that the Noble County Jail overstepped its bounds in taking
Mr. McVeigh's personal effects or his clothing at the time that
he was booked into the jail.  That happens to be under the case
law, as we've submitted, a booking search, where the personal
effects and clothing of the arrestee are kept for safekeeping
and they're kept in such a way that the arrestee can't make any
claims that there was a theft or that he didn't get all his
property back.

Of course, the only other issue we've raised with
respect to that is that the testimony at this hearing was that
the Noble County Jail did not have routine, standardized
booking procedures for this property.  And in fact, that's why
they changed their procedures after this case.  And as the
Court is aware, the case law says that in order for a booking
or inventory search to be valid, it has to be done pursuant to
standardized procedures.  It also may not be done as a general
rummaging or search for evidence.  It is only for the
safekeeping of property.

Where we get into the area that the Court is most
concerned about, which is Edwards and that line of cases, has
to do in our case, although not in Edwards, with the transfer
of these items to the FBI.  And that is the major difference
between this case and Edwards.

In Edwards, there was one continuous offense.  Edwards
was arrested for a offense.  He got to the jail at night.  They
didn't have clothing to give him at the jail at night or a
jumpsuit, so they didn't take his clothing until the next
morning.  But the court found that that was the earliest
practicable time that they could get his clothing to test it
for evidence.

The two other key points in Edwards are (1) the
testing was done for the crime for which he was arrested and
the evidence was seized.  That is not the case with

Mr. McVeigh.  With Mr. McVeigh, the evidence -- the crime for
which he was arrested was not having a license plate on his
vehicle, not having proper proof of insurance, carrying a
concealed weapon, and carrying a loaded weapon in a vehicle.
That is the crime for which he was taken to the jail and the
clothing and personal effects were taken.

And if the Court will examine the rationale behind
both search incident to arrest and the booking search, it is so
that an arrestee cannot reach for a weapon or reach for
evidence and -- to destroy.  So the search incident to arrest
only applies to the person of the arrestee and to the area
within his immediate control within which he might be able to
reach for a weapon or destroy evidence.  That isn't present in
this case.

What isn't present in this case that is present in
Edwards, Robinson and that entire line of cases is exigency.
The rationale for those exceptions is that there are exigent
circumstances, the safety of the officers, the destruction of
property.

In this case, there are no exigencies.  Mr. McVeigh
was put in custody in a jail, his clothing and personal effects
removed on April 19, 1995.  He did not have access to that
personal -- to those personal effects or clothing at the time
of his arrest on the FBI warrant on April 21, two days later.

All of the cases say that in order for a search to be
deemed search incident to arrest, it must be contemporaneous
with the arrest and it must be essentially in the same place as
the arrest.

That isn't -- that isn't true in this case.
Mr. McVeigh was up on the fourth floor of the jail, in custody,
when the FBI went there to arrest him on April 21 at 4:35 p.m.,
at which time they had already received his clothing and
personal effects from the FBI (sic).  There was no possibility
that he could have reached for his clothing or personal effects
to destroy them or to reach for a weapon.

And that, your Honor, I believe is the distinguishing
factor with Edwards, because in Mr. McVeigh's case, the search
incident to arrest had been completed two days earlier.  The
booking and inventory had been completed two days earlier.

In Edwards it was ruled one continuous course of
events, one continuous search and seizure, and the seizure had
not been consummated until the seizure of his clothes for
testing the next morning.  And again, it was testing in
connection with the offense for which he was arrested.

THE COURT:  Well, but in this case, we do have
judicial approval of this seizure by virtue of the issuance of
the warrant by Magistrate Judge Howland.  Now, it is true that
that warrant wasn't -- or a copy of it wasn't submitted to the
sheriff in Noble County?  But what difference does it make?
We're talking here about, you know, the whole purpose for the
suppression and the exclusion is to deter police misconduct,
there isn't anywhere they go before a magistrate judge and get
judicial approval before they do it.

MS. MERRITT:  Okay.  Can I respond to that?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. MERRITT:  I think what the court is suggesting in
that case is that it is almost like inevitable discovery.

THE COURT:  No, it isn't at all.  It is judicial
approval of what you're doing, and that's what we ask law
enforcement people to do.

MS. MERRITT:  Okay.  Well, let me refer the Court to
United States vs. Griffin, 502 F.2d 959, which is a Sixth
Circuit case from 1974 that is still valid.  And in that case,
the police went to the apartment to -- and they sent someone
out to go get the search warrant.  Before the search warrant
came, knowing that the search warrant was going to arrive, the
police went in and did their search, and the search was thrown
out.  And the court said that "we hold that absent any of the
narrowly limited exceptions to the search warrant requirement,
police who believe they have probable cause to search cannot
enter a home without a warrant merely because they plan
subsequently to get one."

THE COURT:  Well, I suggest there is a strong
difference between entering a home and taking the personal
effects that were seized when a person was in -- was arrested
and is now in custody.  What are -- what is the scope of the
Fourth Amendment privacy interest of Mr. McVeigh under these
circumstances?

MS. MERRITT:  Well, your Honor, the Fourth Amendment,
as the Court knows, applies -- it protects people as well as
places.  He had a privacy interest in those clothes and those
personal effects because at some point when the case was over,
they would have been returned to him.  They were only kept by
Noble County as safekeeping.  They were not being kept as
evidence.

And in fact, the testimony at the hearing was when
Mr. McVeigh was transferred to FBI custody, those county court
charges were dropped altogether.  So even the gun and weapon
and knife at that point weren't even going to be used as
evidence.  So he retained his privacy interest in those items.

THE COURT:  Well, what's the scope of it?

MS. MERRITT:  The scope?

THE COURT:  The privacy interest.

MS. MERRITT:  The scope of the privacy interest is
that it is his property.

THE COURT:  And it can't be turned over to the persons
who are executing a subsequent arrest warrant?

MS. MERRITT:  If it can be turned over to the persons
executing a subsequent arrest warrant, it certainly cannot be
tested and sent to a laboratory without a warrant.  And that is
why I was trying to separate out the searches, because you have
to go in stages.  And even were the Court to determine that the
Noble County sheriff could legitimately turn those items over
to the FBI for -- because there is a transfer of the prisoner,
they're being transferred for safekeeping -- and that certainly
does not allow the FBI to put them on an airplane for
Washington, D.C., without a warrant and submit them for
testing.

And again, your Honor, I would just say that in that
Griffin case it was not the -- whether it was a home or a
person.  It was the fact that the police took a shortcut.

THE COURT:  Well, I think it is a difference to enter
a home.

MS. MERRITT:  All right.

THE COURT:  I'm not persuaded by the case.

MS. MERRITT:  Okay.  I just want to point out one more
thing about it, though, which is that it's the shortcut that
the police took; and the court found that if we allow these
shortcuts, we are going to basically eviscerate the exclusion
rule.

THE COURT:  Well, what's the shortcut?  Should they
have faxed this search warrant from the magistrate judge to --
what was his name, the fella who took the material?

MS. MERRITT:  Hupp?

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MS. MERRITT:  I think what should have been done is
the FBI should have held onto the items, personal effects and
clothing and not sent it to Washington for testing until they
had the warrant.  And that was the problem.  That was the
problem.  That warrant was returned unexecuted.  They never had
relied on it.  It had been issued at 3:55 in the afternoon and
they just ignored it.  And that's the shortcut, your Honor.
They sent the stuff for testing and never relied on that
warrant; and they sent the warrant back, and the warrant
expired on April 28 by its own terms.  So I believe that that
is the shortcut that the police took.

THE COURT:  All right.

MS. MERRITT:  The Government has argued in addition to
this search incident to arrest that good faith applies, and I
would strongly disagree with that because good faith applies to
a search with a warrant.  This search, there is no dispute, was
not conducted pursuant to warrant; and therefore good faith is
not applicable.  In fact, that's why Congress is right now
considering that bill, HR-666 to make warrantless searches
subject to the good faith exception; but that hasn't been done
yet.

So good faith doesn't apply.  The only issue that they
have raised is search incident to arrest -- and because of the
difference in -- because of the fact that the FBI's search and
seizure was not contemporaneous for the arrest for which the
effects and clothing were taken, we submit that that exception
does not apply and that the Court should, if it is inclined to
say that the -- it was okay for the FBI to take either the
personal effects or the clothing, that it still was not okay
for them to send it on for testing in the absence of a warrant.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

Mr. Connelly, are you responding for the Government?
You signed the written response.

PLAINTIFF'S ARUGMENT ON MCVEIGH'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS

MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.

The only issue before the Court is whether the FBI
properly took custody of Mr. McVeigh's personal property that
had been seized by Noble County two days earlier.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't think so.  I think it's more
than taking custody for safekeeping.

MR. CONNELLY:  Taking custody and submitting it for
laboratory testing.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I mean I wouldn't have any problem
if they just became a bailee because that happens all the time
when you transfer personal effects from one law enforcement
agency to another.

MR. CONNELLY:  Fair enough, your Honor.  And our
points is that Edwards makes clear that the FBI could properly
both take custody and then submit it for laboratory testing,
and that's exactly what Edwards said.  Edwards also said that
it can be done not only on the very day they take custody but
also on a later day.

THE COURT:  Ms. Merritt makes the point that that case
dealt with the same law enforcement agency that made the arrest
and dealt essentially with a delay in taking these effects.

MR. CONNELLY:  And Edwards went out of its way to hold
and to state that the same rule applies where there is a delay
between the formal -- the completion of the booking process and
the taking of custody and the submission of laboratory testing.
In a footnote they cited the Tenth Circuit's 1955 decision in
Baskerville where they took custody on December 23 and did not
submit it for laboratory testing until January 26.  The only
case cited to the contrary by Mr. McVeigh is the Brett case,
the 1969 Fifth Circuit decision that preceded Edwards and was
cited in Edwards; and Edwards said specifically that Brett is
contra to the rule that they follow.  And they cited
Baskerville, the Tenth Circuit case; and then they noted that
Brett is contra.

THE COURT:  They didn't disapprove it as such, did
they?

MR. CONNELLY:  They cited the rule that it's well
established that the authorities may submit it for laboratory
testing at a later date.

THE COURT:  Well, what is your position respecting the
legal effect of the search warrant issued by Magistrate Judge

Howland at what, 3:30, 4:00?

MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.  And I think the key point is that
this was issued before they actually took custody and certainly
before they submitted for laboratory testing.  The Fourth
Amendment requires an independent judicial judgment of proper
cause where a warrant is required before police can act.
That's exactly what they got.  An independent officer had
determined that there was probable cause to seize and to submit
for laboratory testing all the clothing and effects of
Mr. McVeigh.

THE COURT:  So should I consider this a warranted
seizure?

MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely, your Honor.  I think it's
form over substance to hold to the contrary.  I think the key
is that the point of the Fourth Amendment that the framers
wanted to interpose the independent judgment of a judicial
officer before police officers could act in certain cases was
fully satisfied here.  So yes, there was a question of form.
Did they formally serve it on Sheriff Cook?  The answer is
clearly no.  He said, I've never been served with a warrant in
all my history as a jailer; but clearly they did not do that.
So if as a matter of form they're required to serve it on
Sheriff Cook, they did not.

We would submit that that is not a basis under the
Fourth Amendment for suppressing evidence; that everything the
framers required of the police in this situation was complied
with and that Mr. McVeigh's rights were fully protected and
that there is no basis for suppressing evidence.  Under
Edwards, we would submit that a fair reading of the case is
that a warrant was not required; but No. 2, even if it was,
everything necessary to protect Mr. McVeigh's rights was done;
so there is no basis for suppressing evidence.

THE COURT:  All right.

MS. MERRITT:  Your Honor, may I respond briefly?

THE COURT:  Yes.

DEFENDANT'S MCVEIGH'S REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

MS. MERRITT:  Your Honor, Mr. Connelly asked the Court
not to consider Brett.  However, I would just point out to the
Court that Brett has been expressly approved in the Tenth
Circuit in the case of Faubion, which is in the brief.  And it
says, "The language of Brett, supra, coincides with this
court's position in Humphrey, supra, which emphasizes the
requirement for a warrant."

And I would also ask whether or not this -- or the
actual warrant which was not used should be considered to have
been used.  I think it is more than a form argument.  The
documents in front of the Court which have been submitted into
evidence show that that warrant was returned unexecuted, so I
think they can rely on that warrant.

THE COURT:  Well, but, you know, still, if you step
back and think about why we have exclusion of evidence, it is
so that the police will conform their conduct to the
requirements of the law.  And the requirements of the law, as
you suggest, is -- is that they get a warrant before seizing
this -- these effects and exposing them to whatever laboratory
tests they were -- that were done.

The only thing that you're saying here, it seems to
me, has to be that because this warrant wasn't actually used
and returned, that that misconduct requires suppression of this
evidence.

MS. MERRITT:  Correct, because that misconduct is a
shortcut; and the purpose of the exclusionary rule -- you just
set forth the purpose of the Fourth Amendment; but the purpose
of the exclusionary rule is to stop police from making their
own decisions.  And in this case, there may have been a warrant
issued, but these police didn't know about it, so they made
their own decision to shortcut the Fourth Amendment and do this
search.  And that's the kind of conduct that the exclusionary
rule is designed to prevent; and for that reason, we submit
that they shouldn't be allowed to rely on the warrant.

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, that matter stands
submitted.

We'll proceed to the motion to suppress on behalf of
Mr. Nichols.  Mr. Tigar?

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, we have briefed this
matter in exhaustive and I trust not wearisome detail; and I
won't tax your Honor's patience by repeating what we wrote
there.

I will focus instead on responding to the Government's
submission with some reference to what we already filed but I
hope in a very minimal way.

I think the principal difference between the
Government's statement of facts and ours lies with what I might
call a metaphor.  I have done a lot of suppression motions in
which an individual police officer meets an individual civilian
on the street and we file a motion to suppress and we invoke
this notion of the individual vs. the massive power of the
state; but we do that metaphorically.

In this case, I think when we look at what happened
first with respect to Mr. Nichols' nine-hour interrogation at
the Herington police station, it's important to review what was
going on outside.

Mr. Nichols had heard his name on the television.  The
television coverage was massive.  The search of the James
Nichols farm had already begun.

But let's look at who was on the Government's team.
Starting early that day, Jamie Gorelick, the Deputy Attorney
General of the United States, had called Randal Rathbun and
asked him, and as it happened his assistant, Robin Fowler, to

go to Herington.  So they had those lawyers.  Merrick Garland,
who tried the preliminary hearing, was available.  Mr. Howard
Shapiro, the FBI SIOC, was there; and John O'Neil was with him.
In Oklahoma City, Henry Gibbons was there, who said that he had
not had much experience with material witness warrants; but
after all, he was assisted by Donna Bucella, the No. 2 person
for U.S. Attorneys, Arlene Joplin, Jerome Holmes, and Jim
Reynolds from the Department of Justice.  That's just the
lawyers that were on the scene for the Government.

They had been given their orders the day before by the
President of the United States and the Attorney General.  Their
objective was clear.  It was to round up anybody as to whom
they had cause to arrest, to charge them, try them, convict
them, if possible, and execute them.  That was their plan.

The FBI had a command post in Kansas City, a command
post in Fort Riley, agents that had scooped up Mrs. Lana
Padilla and Josh Nichols in Las Vegas.  They had agents in
Oklahoma City.  And as the Court heard, they had these groups
of agents converging from Wichita, from Kansas City, from
Fort Riley.  They had all the resources they needed.

Now, Mr. Nichols goes to the police station.  What was
his state of mind?  The Government does not dispute the
evidence with respect to this.  They draw different inferences
from it.  But there is no dispute that Mr. Nichols was
frightened, he was concerned -- he said he was -- he didn't
want to have another Waco; and that's in both of the sets of
findings and conclusions.  He was scared.

And the evidence shows that when his house was
searched there were things in there that showed what had
happened at Waco, showed what had happened at Ruby Ridge.
There is some reason for him to be frightened.  When told he
was free to leave, he said he didn't want to go out there.  He
didn't want to provoke an incident.

What he did want to do, your Honor, was to ask
questions.  All of the people that spoke to him, the agents,
admitted that what he said was, I've got some questions for
you.  Did they answer his questions?  Were they candid with
him?  No, your Honor, they were not.

First they told him that he was free to go -- well,
free to go in some metaphorical sense.  He certainly wasn't
free to get in his pickup truck, wasn't free to go to his
house, go in his door and sit on his sofa, because those had
been secured.  They didn't answer his questions.  They did tell
him at one point that he could have the notes.  But what Agent
Smith had in his mind about the notes was that he didn't get
them until after he was indicted.

When an attorney called, David Phillips, having first
contacted the defender in the United States who is responsible
for seeing that counsel is available in capital cases, that
message was not relayed.

Now, that, it seems to me, your Honor, is significant.
I know the Government is going to rely when they stand and
argue, as they have in their brief, on Moran vs. Burbine; but
the defendant in that case, which came to the Supreme Court on
habeas, was an in-custody suspect.  No formal charge, no
process of any kind had been started.  There weren't any of the
due process or Sixth Amendment applications or aspects of the
case that brought it within the rule of law for which we
contend.

After all, Mr. Phillips was not, as the Government
portrays him in their statement of facts, simply a lawyer who
called unbidden.  He is the public defender with the District
of Kansas with as much a statutory responsibility to perform
his job for the Sixth Amendment as this platoon, this regiment
of lawyers has under the laws and statutes of the United States
to execute the game plan the President of the United States and
the Attorney General had told them the day before to execute.

Mr. Phillips called the man who was responsible for
getting me appointed; that is to say, advised the
Administrative Office, he called the Assistant United States
Attorney, and yet that message wasn't relayed.

Now, there is another funny thing about the timing.
When we look at the lies, your Honor -- and I hesitate to say
this, but Mr. Nichols was lied to.  Mr. Nichols had information
concealed from him.  Mr. Nichols was consciously made the pawn
of these people who were executing their prearranged plan.

Let's look at the warrant timing to get a picture of
this.  When I stood before your Honor and described what I
thought I would prove, I was wrong.  I thought I could prove,
your Honor, that that material witness warrant had been issued
sometime around 3:00.  I said that to your Honor; and I failed.
But in failing, I respectfully submit that we succeeded -- our
team succeeded in showing something that was even more
significant.  A decision had been made to seek a warrant as to
Mr. Nichols for arrest and search or arrest or search,
depending upon which version, sometime that morning, certainly
by noon.  That's why Mr. Rathbun was there at the direction of
the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, a Deputy
Attorney General of the United States, by the way, a person who
came out of one of Washington, D.C.'s most prestigious criminal
law firms, with extensive experience.  She knew what she was
talking about.

Mr. Hartzler is smiling.  She clerked for me one
summer, but then she later learned how to do her job properly.

MR. HARTZLER:  I'm accepting the compliment, having
worked at the firm with her.

MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, that decision was
then reinforced by the decision to dispatch the S.W.A.T. team
to execute that warrant.  In the meantime, the warrant is being
drafted in Oklahoma City.

Now, what happened in Oklahoma City?  Let me put it
all together.  First, Agent Gibbons, under the supervision of
senior Justice Department lawyers, prepares a warrant
application that falsely says Mr. Nichols is attempting to
leave the country.  That's why the later timing is significant,
because since he started at about 4:00, he was aware that
Mr. Nichols was already in the police station.

They attributed probable cause simply to
Mr. McNichols' friendship with Mr. McVeigh.  That warrant
application was, in short, your Honor, not probable cause to
interfere with anybody's liberty.  It was a tissue of
falsehoods.

Regardless of that, your Honor, it was an unequivocal
judicial command to do something.  Indeed, it was such an
important judicial command, so important to Chief Judge
Russell, that he took time to read it and endorse "of material
witness" on the first edition of the warrant and then to
suggest, when the error was pointed out to him, that the thing
be shredded and a new one substituted.

At 4-something that afternoon, 4:28, 4:30, that
warrant is issued.  By 4:45, it's in Kansas City.

The team of lawyers, your Honor, had advised what was
to be done.  Mr. Nichols was to be followed closely, if
possible, if he did manage to get out, and they were to wait
for the warrant.

Now, your Honor, comes what is the most difficult to
believe of all of this, and that is that the only four people
in the United States Government establishment concerned with
this case who didn't know anything about the warrant were the
four agents who just happened to be in there interrogating
Mr. Nichols.

Now, the Government has a interesting contradiction,
your Honor.  Maybe it's the speed with which these findings
were drafted.  They tell us that the agents didn't know about
the warrant and that it was okay for them not to know about the
warrant because nobody wanted to interrupt them.  And yet in
proposed finding 88, they say that when Agents Smith and
Crabtree were out of the room, Smith and Crabtree were
bombarded with material and information from many other sources
for possible use in later stages of the interview.

In Government's Exhibit 72 at page 12, your Honor,
Agent Smith recounts that he had to go out of the room to get
okay as to whether or not Mr. Nichols' condition on the consent
for Mrs. Nichols was all right.  "Went out of room, got okay,"
it says there.

At page 2 of Government's Exhibit 72, the litany with
respect to reading Mr. Nichols the form and trying to get him
to sign it on the Miranda waiver goes on for 20 minutes, a
lengthy discussion about whether he's going to sign it, is he
going to read it and so on.  When an agent -- when Chief Kuhn
is concerned about what's going on in the room in the basement
where the interrogation is taking place, a room without a door
except at the top of the stairs, Chief Kuhn comes in to turn
down the radio.  The interrogation log shows that the agents
repeatedly interrupted the hearing or the interrogation,
rather, to go up and get pizza, get water, use the rest room,
talk to their superiors.

Your Honor, it simply isn't credible that the agents
didn't know; but whether that's so or not, it isn't credible
that they couldn't have known.  Somebody upstairs, if the
Government's version is to be credited, operating a system in
which these agents doing the interrogation were informed of
everything they needed to ask questions, including getting tape
recordings of Josh Nichols -- somebody upstairs decided they're
not going to know about the warrant.

Now, your Honor, to continue that -- by the way, when
we get to Wichita the next day, Deputy Ingermanson's testimony
about Mr. Nichols' asking to see the agent -- that contradicts
the agents' version, by the way, of what happened.  They say
that they told him if he wanted to talk to him that they would
be available for that.

But let me go back now and talk about the legal
significance of the evidence.  We have made what can be
described as four separate arguments with respect to this
interrogation of Mr. Nichols.  The first is a straight up and
down Miranda argument, your Honor.  And that rests on this:
When Mr. Nichols read the advice of rights form and said
"interrogation" reminds me of the Nazis, I won't sign this,
that was a statement that he did not want further
interrogation.

Now, the Government says no, that's not quite right
because, after all, Mr. Nichols is a sophisticated person.  And
they put in evidence some transcript of a court proceeding
which ended so disastrously for him that his household goods
were at risk from his creditors.

But if your Honor looks at Government's Exhibit 72 at
page 2, you will see the amount of time that the agents spent
to try to get Mr. Nichols to sign that form.  And after that
amount of time, the only thing that's noted -- and it's on the
form itself -- is Agent Smith, who says he said he understood
his rights but he wouldn't sign the form.

There is not a line, a word, a syllable in that form
in the 302 that says that Mr. Nichols agreed to further
questioning.  It's a straight up and down Miranda issue.

The next point --

THE COURT:  Well, let's stop with that for a moment.

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Because, you know, there is no doubt that
this began as voluntary statements.  Correct?

MR. TIGAR:  A conditional voluntary statement, yes,

your Honor.

THE COURT:  Now, what's the condition?

MR. TIGAR:  The condition was Agent Smith walked in
the door and said that he -- he was there, Chief Kuhn had said
these people are going to answer your questions, and
Mr. Nichols is quoted as saying, "It's good that you're here.
I've got some questions for you."

THE COURT:  All right.  So what is your position; that
they had to answer his questions before he should proceed with
his statement?

MR. TIGAR:  No, your Honor.  The position is that
the -- with respect to Miranda and with respect to
voluntariness, the purpose of Mr. Nichols' presence at the
police station as indicated by that statement has to do with
whether or not he consented to answer the agents' questions.  I
mean the voluntary -- if he was voluntarily at the police
station, why was he there?  If I go to a police station and say
excuse me, I have a parking ticket notice here and I never got
the ticket, I go there for that purpose and instead of the
police saying, Oh, well, let us help you, let us answer the
question how the parking ticket came, they take me into a
basement room having already decided on orders from on high
that they're going to try to convict me and execute me and
start interrogating, that's -- that's different from the
purpose for which I went there.

THE COURT:  Well, that's a little strong with respect
to the Government's position at the time of this interview.
They -- there is nothing here to suggest that at that time, the
Government believed that they had more here than an association
between Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh --

MR. TIGAR:  I disagree with your Honor.

THE COURT:  -- and they were exploring what that
relationship was.  What is there in this evidence that shows
that at that time they really had him, Mr. Nichols, as a
suspect?

MR. TIGAR:  At 11:30 the previous evening, the FBI in
Michigan had contacted the deputy sheriff in Sanilac County and
received information about explosions and a so-called
fertilizer bomb experience at the James Nichols farm which
involved both Terry Nichols and James Nichols.  At 8:30 the
following morning Eastern Time, 7:30 Central Time the agents
met with Kelly Langenburg, who turned out to be the
confidential informant, the former wife of James Nichols.  She
happens to be the sister of Lana Padilla, Terry Nichols' former
wife.  Kelly Langenburg provided extensive information saying
that James and Terry Nichols were members of the Michigan
Militia, that there had been bombs out there, and so on.  And
she also said that Terry Nichols had visited the James Nichols
farm perhaps in company with Tim McVeigh earlier in April, so
there was more than just that association.

Then the agents had the evidence of -- from Lana
Padilla, who they began to interrogate quite early that morning
and well before Terry Nichols arrived at the Herington police
station.  That information was solid enough that Jamie
Gorelick, the Deputy Attorney General, called Randal Rathbun
and said, Go to Herington to execute an arrest or search
warrant.  Agent Reightler testified he left at about 1:30 to go
execute an arrest or search warrant.  Well, "arrest or search
warrant" means probable cause, if the Court please; and the
only thing to get probable cause on was Terry Nichols and his
house.

THE COURT:  Still, though, it's probable cause for
what?  There is the -- the record shows that it isn't until
May 9 that the Government's position is that it has probable
cause to file a complaint and arrest Mr. Nichols as a
defendant.  Right?

MR. TIGAR:  That's true.  They filed a complaint only
on May 9; but if your Honor please, the Government lawyers had
to be aware, because the Bacon case was the leading case that
in order to even get a material witness warrant, they had to
have probable cause of some sort.

Moreover, the search warrant that was executed was --
if you read Agent Crabtree's affidavit, Agent Crabtree is
swearing as of 11:00 on the morning of the 22nd that a fuel
meter of the type found -- that would be found in Mr. Nichols'
home could be used to make the very bomb that detonated in
Oklahoma City.

So I think that the May 9 does not seem to us at least
to be the relevant date.  Even Mr. Rathbun in arguing that
Mr. Nichols should be held without bail, which he was, made
references to Mr. Nichols' alleged involvement, the guns in his
house and so on.  But irrespective of that --

THE COURT:  Well, you know, but it's still a material
witness arrest; and we don't have much law about material
witness arrests, as has been shown here by all the papers
filed.  We don't have much except this class action case in
Texas, which is really quite a different situation.  But there
is very little law that I'm aware of about using, as you're
suggesting, I think, that the Government here was using a
material witness warrant as a substitute for an arrest warrant
of a suspect -- I mean a defendant.

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, we do say that, your Honor.  In fact,
we do bring to the Court's attention the Drake case in the
Tenth Circuit and that language about deliberate tactical delay
to get something they wouldn't otherwise be able to get.

Let me focus on that, then, because those facts are
also relevant to us and that -- your Honor is right.  There is
not a great deal of law out there about a material witness, but
some of the outlines of it, it seems to us, are quite clear.

Agent Jablonski said that he thought a material
witness warrant was no different than a warrant to arrest a
bank robber, and you go to the bank robber's house with the
warrant in your pocket and if the bank robber would talk to
you, well, that was just fine.

THE COURT:  Incidentally, is there anything wrong with
his legal analysis there?

MR. TIGAR:  Well, if he tries it in the Tenth Circuit
and does it for tactical advantage, your Honor, he's going to
find that he's -- that the fruits of that conduct will be
suppressed.  Other than that, there is nothing wrong with it.

I'm sorry, your Honor.  I should not indulge in
sarcasm.

Yes, your Honor, the candid answer is he's wrong.
He's wrong under the Tenth Circuit law, if he does it for that
improper purpose.

THE COURT:  Well, except that there is a substantial
difference between delaying and taking -- executing an arrest
warrant and taking them before a magistrate judge and simply at
the time that you execute the warrant taking the person into
custody.  You don't tell them about it until you give him an
opportunity to make a statement.  We don't have a case that
says he's wrong in that respect, do we?

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor, we do.

THE COURT:  Which one?

MR. TIGAR:  The -- well, the Drake case is an example

of a case in which the delay was -- not executing the warrant
was for tactical purposes.

THE COURT:  What did they do?

MR. TIGAR:  The Court held in that case that the
evidence could have been come at from -- on another basis, so
that, in fact, the --

THE COURT:  Well, I don't remember what happened in
that case.

MR. TIGAR:  The court said that the search was okay
because, in fact, the delay there was not for the improper
purpose.  They recognized the rule.  That's all.  That was the
flamingo case.  They wouldn't give the man back his flamingo.

But what the Court is touching on, it seems to me, are
two aspects of this that I want to make sure that I've said our
argument the best way I can.  The first seems to be something
about voluntariness.  Agent Jablonski is right and the
Government is right:  There is hardly any privilege or right
under our system of government that I possess or Mr. Nichols
possessed that I can't waive, and that includes the -- I can go
talk to the Government in such a way that I have put myself in
a position to be executed by the state.  However, in the
calculus of determining whether that can happen, I must
intentionally relinquish my known right.  That's the waiver
standard.  Intentional relinquishment of a known right.

And this litany of lies, deceptions, and failures to
answer what the questions Mr. Nichols was legitimately
answering, legitimately concerned for the safety of himself and
his family, pretermit any legitimate argument that he waived
his right not to speak.

THE COURT:  Which applies when he's in custody; right?

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Now, when is he first in custody on these
facts?

MR. TIGAR:  Mr. Nichols is in custody no later than
3:20 p.m. on the 21st of April.

THE COURT:  And why do you pick that time?

MR. TIGAR:  I pick that time because that's when
they -- they have secured his pickup so that he's not going to
leave in the vehicle he arrived in and an FBI team is at his
house surrounding it and preventing anybody from going in or
out.

His liberty is meaningless.  It could be earlier than
that, your Honor, depending upon how you read Agent Chornyak's
notes because Mr. Shapiro in Washington, D.C., said let him
loose but follow him.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. TIGAR:  Close surveillance.

Your Honor, there is no way that Terry Nichols was
going home to his house on the 21st because keep him under
surveillance meant keep him under surveillance until we get a
warrant to do something else, a decision that had been made
well before he ever went to the Herington police station.

THE COURT:  Well, being under surveillance is not the
equivalent of being in custody, is it?

MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, the closest analogy -- and
it's not in our brief -- is the habeas corpus cases.  There is
such a thing as house arrest, arrest in the city.  The purpose
of following him was to keep him within their sight and hearing
until such time as they could get a warrant.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. TIGAR:  It was like letting him out on a leash.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. TIGAR:  That, again, your Honor -- that's just one
independent part.  The fact of their having taken his truck and
his house as of the time he got in the station is clear.

Now I want to turn to the material witness warrant.
Your Honor, you're absolutely right there is not a lot of law
about this but what law there is seems to us to make matters
clear.  A material witness is fundamentally different from a
criminal defendant in a way that Agent Jablonski did not seem
to appreciate; that is, a criminal defendant is being taken
into custody based on probable cause or warrantless arrest or
under a warrant in order to start a process, the process of
formal charge, and so on.

A material witness has his or her liberty interfered
with for a very different reason.  When the material witness
warrant is used for legitimate purposes, it is used to obtain
testimony; that is to say, to bring someone before the grand
jury.

At footnote 22 of our proposed findings and
conclusions, we cite some cases in connection with
Mrs. Nichols' interrogation that deal with so-called "office
subpoenas."  There were a lot of U.S. Attorney's offices around
the country that used to use grand jury process to get people
into their office to interrogate them.  And the courts, upon
being confronted with this practice, uniformly held that the
use of the office subpoena was improper and simply should not
be permitted.

I'll get the page, if I may here.

125.  As your Honor can see, a lot of people worked on
the project, and I'm just the reporter.

Those cases at page 125 show us that U.S. Attorney's
office is not a proper substitute for the grand jury room.

Let us be clear, your Honor:  Ours is an adversarial
system of criminal justice.  The grand jury is tolerated as its
one and only one inquisitorial element.  And it is tolerated
because it is thought that the rights of person there summoned
are hedged about with certain clear protections, such as the
right to counsel, such as the fact that proceedings are taking
place in a courthouse or some place that's like a courthouse;
that is, the dignity of the system attaches to it.

The material witness warrant is a means to get
somebody to a grand jury or to a trial.  Who?  A citizen
thought to have evidence.

Now, the fact is, of course, that the Government was
using the material witness warrant for these improper purposes.
The fact is that they really thought they had had or were about
to get probable cause.  But our material witness warrant
argument takes them at their word.  The piece of paper they had
and were so assiduous to get that -- when it was wrong, they
had another one issued simply commanded the agents to get
Mr. Nichols and bring him before a Federal grand jury.

Under Section 3006(a) of Title 18, at the moment he
was brought in on a material witness warrant, the moment it was
served, he would have the right to counsel, he would have the
public defender represent him.

Had Mr. Nichols been told candidly, Mr. Nichols, you
want to know why your name is on the radio?  Your name is on
the radio because in about an hour, we're going to have a
material witness warrant for you and we're going to take you to
Oklahoma City and we're going to put you before the grand jury
and you'll have the lawyer at that time, maybe you better ask
the lawyer the questions -- it is unimaginable that Mr. Nichols
would have continued to talk to them, particularly given the
fact that he refused to sign their interrogation form.  Had
they been truly candid and said Mr. Nichols, we're intending to
execute you just as quickly as we can manage it, it is doubly
unimaginable he would have talked to them.

The rights of a material witness person named in the
warrant, however, are not Sixth Amendment rights.  They partake
of the same sets of principles, but they've been identified by
the court as due process rights.  Well, what is due process?
Your Honor, what do you get with due process when you're
seized?  Well, I think that it's -- as we point out, that's the
same in civil and criminal cases.  Due process is Matthews vs. 
Eldridge due process; it's Goldberg vs. Kelly due process.
Matthews vs. Eldridge is the Supreme Court's last case in the
due process series, a series that begins with the Fuentes case,
in which the court held that you couldn't seizure Mrs. Fuentes'
stove and stereo without a judicial officer having done
something that would be calculated to notify her that she had
the right to keep you from getting her stove and her stereo.

A hearing at a meaningful time and in a meaningful
manner:  That's what due process says.  And given the fact that
a material witness warrant is a way to take innocent citizens
off the street and get their testimony, the way in which the
Government handled this matter, we respectfully suggest,
requires the suppression of the statements.

Now, the final point with respect to this is the fruit
of --

THE COURT:  Let me just test that for a moment.  So
what you're saying is that at least as soon as this arrest
warrant for a material witness was issued, it should have been
executed and he should have been given a Miranda -- and you're
suggesting that that would have resulted in no more
statements -- and take him to Wichita, I guess, was the nearest
magistrate.

MR. TIGAR:  I amend what your Honor suggested.  First,
once the warrant is served, another Miranda warning might be
necessary; but that's not the most important part.  And yes, I
do suggest there would be no more statements; but beyond that,
the failure to serve the warrant, the deliberate deception with
respect to it, makes the custody unlawful, and the statements
become the fruit of the unlawful custody.

Now, there is also a fruits argument with respect to
the legality of the warrant itself.

THE COURT:  Well, why is the custody unlawful?  They
have a warrant for his arrest as a material witness.  Now, I
understand you have an argument about the validity of the
warrant.

MR. TIGAR:  Putting that to one side --

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. TIGAR:  -- the custody is unlawful, your Honor --
the custody becomes unlawful because it is based upon
deception, based upon the agents' not informing Mr. Nichols of
the rights that he possesses as a material witness and failing
from the moment they get that warrant to afford him those
rights.  Once the agents downstairs got that warrant in their
hand, they have the unequivocal command of a judicial officer
to do one thing, after they've told him we have it and here it
is, and that is to get him before a judicial officer without
unnecessary delay.  That's the unequivocal command.

And even the Government concedes that.  At least they
concede that once the warrant is served under Rule 40(a), he
had to go before a judicial officer without unnecessary delay.

THE COURT:  Well, does that mean they have to stop, if
he had after receiving a Miranda and being notified that he's
under arrest; that he's a material witness; that that had been
issued from Oklahoma City and what it's in connection with and
he chose to say, Well, let's -- I want to talk to you?  There
wouldn't be anything wrong with continuing the discussion
there, would there?

MR. TIGAR:  If, your Honor, the waiver was free and
voluntary and made in full knowledge of his rights, no.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. TIGAR:  But the Government is not given, if the
Court please, the luxury of speculating as to what would have
been done.

THE COURT:  No.  I understand that.  I just -- when
you say "taken immediately," I'm just trying to find out how
immediately you mean.

MR. TIGAR:  Well, there is case law about this; and
there is a statute that applies to arrest warrants for
criminals, not for material witness warrants, therefore not
relevant here.

Another factor here, your Honor, is, of course, that
the judicial officer was standing by.  I have driven from
Herington to Wichita and Wichita to Herington.  Judge Belot was
a telephone call away; and Mr. Rathbun had been instructed to
make sure that Judge Belot was a telephone call away, not to
protect Mr. Nichols' rights but to further Deputy Attorney
General Gorelick's interest to be sure, but the judicial
officer was available.

I turn now, your Honor, unless your Honor has further
questions about the Nichols interrogation --

THE COURT:  No, go ahead.

MR. TIGAR:  We have -- I'm going to turn -- I should
mention one point.  We have briefed the issue of the booby trap
speech in the car the next day, which we think the equivalent
of the Christian burial speech.  And that's our position.

Let's turn to the situation of -- I'm sorry, your
Honor.  I should put my glasses on.

The Hoffa case that the Government cites, of course,
doesn't have anything to do with this.  That was a case in
which a court held that once you have probable cause to arrest
somebody, you don't have to get a warrant immediately.  That's
the context in which the court said there is no right to be
arrested.  The Government quotes it out of context.

Let's turn to Mrs. Nichols, if we may.  This is a
classic situation:  Government claims that Mrs. Nichols
consented voluntarily in all of the consents that she was asked
and required to sign over the period when she had her assigned
companions.  They used to have elections in the Soviet union,
your Honor, and everybody voted and everybody voted for the
regime; and that was called consent of the governed.

I'd like the Court to imagine for a moment what
Mrs. Nichols must have felt.  One doesn't have to guess a great
deal:  She testified about it.  There she was in the police
station with her breast-feeding daughter, and at some point
during the evening she became aware that her husband would not
be going home with her; that he was going to stay in the
custody of the Government.

Within a few days of her being in these motels, she
was surely aware that anyone charged with or regarded as a
suspect in or regarded as connected with this event would face
the death penalty; that there were serious, serious issues
here.  Indeed, it is the seriousness of those issues and the
concerns that they must have raised in her that led the FBI
agents to write her the Mother's Day card, referring to her
need to cry, referring to her sense of loneliness, referring to
perhaps her feelings that the Government was -- were the bad
people and urging her to think only, only of herself and her
own interests.

Mrs. Nichols realized that when she first was taken
into Government custody that if she was to act independently,
she would have to go home; and she asked whether she could go
home.

Now, it's interesting that when the Government spoke
to her about that, they told her that she shouldn't go home and
couldn't go home because the media would bombard her.  Now, one
of the things we saw this morning is that there were a number
of media telephone calls to the Nichols residence.  And the
Court will recall that scene described by several witnesses in
the Nichols home in Herington, Kansas, on the afternoon of
Sunday, the 23rd, in which Mrs. Nichols evidenced once again
her desire to live in her own house with her breast-feeding
child.  Chief Kuhn said that the media would find her and that
he didn't have enough officers to protect her.  And the FBI
went along with that story.

The Government's whole position in their statement of
facts is that they were protecting Mrs. Nichols.  Why, they
were providing her lodging, food.  They were paying her phone
bills and collecting the records of all the phone calls so they
could use them as evidence and recording some of the telephone
calls, the most intimate ones to her husband.  Yes, they were
paying her phone bills.

The Government had all the resources that it needed to
meet Mrs. Nichols' concerns about security but not resources to
permit her to live where she said she wanted to?

The Government's claim that it was interested only in
her security and safety stands in stark contrast to what
occurred when finally she was given back the money that was
hers, the $5,000 less the 200 they kept.

If your Honor please, they left her in Oklahoma City
in a hotel she could pay for for herself, let her get on a
Greyhound bus and travel alone with her breast-feeding child to
California, and they did so having successfully opposed her
right to kiss her husband goodbye.  That, if the Court please,
is the Government's protection of Mrs. Nichols during this
period of time.

Their claim is that Mrs. Nichols acted voluntarily;
and yet, if your Honor please, looking at page 38 of the
Government's brief -- I'm sorry -- page 119.

THE COURT:  119?

MR. TIGAR:  No, there is no 119.

THE COURT:  There is none.

MR. TIGAR:  I've got page 38 -- here it is, page 38,
paragraph 119.  Yes, your Honor.  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I've
got the pages and paragraphs mixed up.  It is page 38,
paragraph 119.

Now, your Honor will recall that various government
agents testified as to what Mrs. Nichols was told before she
signed the consents.  And -- but with respect to this, notice
after Marife Nichols signed the consent to search form, Agent
Dobson explained to her that other agents would be
accompanying, so forth and so on.  So at least with respect to
the most crucial consent, the explanation concededly comes
after the consent was extracted.

Now, consent is not difficult, your Honor.  Consent to
search or consent to do anything is a contractual idea; and
thus, the relative level of knowledge of the parties, the
ability of a party to say no, the information that's provided,
and the total -- totality of the circumstances dictate whether
the consent is voluntary or not.  Mrs. Nichols testified as to
what she was or wasn't told.

Now, Agent Dobson did say that she meticulously
explained certain things.  And I -- I'm not going to repeat it
here, because this is a very sensitive issue and don't need to
take time with it.  It's in the briefs.  We've asked the Court
to make a credibility determination, because with all
solemnity, I tell the Court that I think there is a lack of
candor about what was said here and what was said here about
what happened to Mrs. Nichols.

It is interesting to note that this assertedly
assiduous effort to inform Mrs. Nichols of her rights found no
reflection in the 302's.  It only was repeated here and it's
contrary to the other evidence that your Honor heard.

Moreover, the Government in its brief, page 52 at
paragraph 169, tells the Court that as much as three days would
go by without the agents seeing Mrs. Nichols.  And yet all
that -- the citation there to the transcript is that Agent
Dobson wouldn't see her for as many as three days at a time.

Well, your Honor will recall that at least one of
Mrs. Nichols trips -- that is, the one up to Kansas -- was made
over a weekend so that Agents Dobson and Thomeczek would could
be with their families for a weekend.  There is no evidence
that the agents left Mrs. Nichols alone for as much as three
days at a time.

The FBI claims that they arranged a meeting with the
Philippine embassy for Mrs. Nichols.  Well, it is true that
they facilitated contact between Mrs. Nichols and the
Philippine embassy; but your Honor, my declaration is in
evidence with respect to this:  Nothing happened.  Mrs. Nichols
was never permitted by the Government to give out a phone
number where she could be reached.  The agents say she was told
not to, it would be better if she didn't, more of this
protective atmosphere.  She was never permitted to give out a
phone number, your Honor, until, as my declaration recites, I
called the ambassador to the United States for the Republic of
the Philippines because I had represented the Aquino government
in recovering the Marcos assets and I got through to those
people and they said they would do something about it.  And
they did something about it, and we got her rights respected.

And finally, your Honor, looking at this paragraph
169, it's interesting:  Here's another unintentional lapse.
Two trips to Oklahoma City, it says, quote "to meet with United
States Attorney's office personnel there."  Gee, your Honor, I
think there are two grand jury subpoenas in evidence.  I had
thought that it was the federal grand jury, this body sitting
indifferent between citizen and sovereign, whose testimony it
was sought, Mrs. Nichols -- Mrs. Nichols' testimony might have
given some information to.  But no, to it was to meet with the
United States Attorney's office personnel.

In short, your Honor, there is a concession.  Those
grand jury subpoenas were shams.  The meeting was a sham.  They
never intended to put her before the grand jury unless they
could get something incriminating out of her.  They were just
shuttling her to conduct further interrogation, politely
phrased as to meet with United States Attorney's office
personnel, including, by the way, the No. 4 or 5 person in the
Justice Department.

In short, your Honor, the captivity of Mrs. Nichols
belies any assertion that this -- these consents were voluntary
in any accepted sense of the word.  Mrs. Nichols was used in
order to obtain warrants that Jamie Gorelick had already given
the order were going to be obtained sometime during the day.

Very briefly, your Honor, I would like to turn to the
search warrant issues, the Franks issues.  This whole business
of search of the house begins with what Agent Reightler did.
Now, Agent Reightler was there having dismantled the S.W.A.T.
team.  Although Chief Kuhn did say that he recognized the
S.W.A.T. team as having been there, he wouldn't admit it on the
stand.  We had to put an investigator on to show that he --
that's what he had said before.  And your Honor can take the
hearsay for the truth of the matter asserted.

Agent Reightler testifies that he went and looked in
the window.  Now, the interesting thing about the Reightler
search is that the Government has now portrayed Agent Reightler
as having walked, as they say in their proposed findings, up
and down the property line.  He walked up and down the property
line, on the edge of the curtilage.  In other words, they want
your Honor to find that nobody trespassed on the house.

Well, if you look at the map of 2nd Street in
Herington, Kansas, your Honor, there are no sidewalks between
the houses.  If the agents were there, they were on somebody's
property.  And the lots are small there.  It's not a ranch.
They're little lots in which all of the areas certainly fall
within the what the Tenth Circuit has described as the
curtilage; that is to say, if in the Tenth Circuit a chicken
coop is a curtilage, then all the houses in Herington and their
little yards constitute the home, the core, core Fourth
Amendment area.

So the first -- first notion is, your Honor, that yes,
the agents were there -- and not just Agent Reightler -- and
they were trespassing on the place, even if they say they
weren't answering the telephone.

The next thing about Agent Reightler is he goes and
looks in the window.  This becomes important because various
claims have been made: consent, exigent circumstances, and so
on.  I'll deal simply with exigent circumstances.  I think it's
important to note what was in that shed in that garage and what
Agent Reightler saw there.

Remember, your Honor, we had a dispute about whether I
could put some 302's in to try to take the force out of it.
Here's what Agent Reightler saw:  He looked in through the
window and he saw some barrels.  And the barrels said Ster-Bak,
S-T-E-R dash B-A-K, which is ammonia -- and it had the word
"ammonia" on there -- which is something used to clean dairy
barns.

Now, it's odd, your Honor, that all of these agents
who live in Kansas all these years didn't know how you clean a
dairy barn; but okay, their Herculean labors were performed by
other means.  They didn't use Ster-Bak.

But the barrels didn't seem to be anything other than
what they were, and they're barrels that you can get at any
recycling depot after they've been used for the Ster-Bak
purpose.  But Reightler reports that.

Now, your Honor, here's another contradiction in the
evidence, the famous "what kind of smell was there."  Reightler
says that the lawn was dirt and weeds.  You look at the
Government's Exhibits, you see that the Nichols lawn is a
lovely lawn; it's not dirt and weeds.  Ammonium nitrate
fertilizer, if that's what they were concerned about, doesn't
have an odor even when you mix it with water.  So if you spread
it on your lawn and then water it with your garden hose, it
doesn't have an odor.  It certainly doesn't smell like ammonia.

So whatever it is that Agent Reightler smelled could
not have related to any bombing concern.  I mean I understand
why he wanted to go out there and he got a little impatient and
so on; but after all, he had a United States attorney who was
in telephone contact with a judge.

The Reightler observation then becomes transmuted; and
this is the Franks issue, your Honor.  Let's look at the
warrant for the house, the warrant that was executed beginning
on the 22nd.  Remember Agent Crabtree and Attorney -- U.S.
Attorney Rathbun and Assistant U.S. Attorney Fowler all go back
to Wichita, and they work until the early hours of the morning
to get that affidavit done.  Well, "strong odor of ammonia,"
which we say never happened, becomes "odor of fertilizer,"
because by now it's a fertilizer bomb.  And then the rest of
the Franks issues begin to fall into place.

Your Honor, there is only one Government.  The
Government says that -- they have a long business in their
statement of facts that Agent Jablonski was in the room for
part of the time and Agent Foley and Agent Smith and Agent
Crabtree; and one person heard one thing and one person heard
another; and they just went with what they had, and after all,
Mr. Nichols, every time he was asked about the fuel meter, he
didn't repeat everything he had said before about it.  And
that's their position.

It is undisputed that Mr. Nichols said that he had a
fuel meter that was inoperative; that it didn't work and the
gears were broken.  That's undisputed.  It's also undisputed
that he told that to the agents.  It's undisputed that the four
agents were back and forth and in and out of that room and
comparing notes.

So there is no excuse whatever for saying that
Mr. Nichols had a fuel meter, particularly when Agent Crabtree,
hearing about the fuel meter, decides that it must be the key
to the case, decided it was important.  Having decided it was
important, he didn't even bother to check his facts.  He simply
put in the ATF paragraph about "could be used to mix the bomb"
that makes it really sinister.

So now we've got the ammonia smell, we've got the fuel
meter, and then we have the misrepresentation of Mr. Nichols'
statements.

When you strike those out of the warrant, your Honor,
the fruits of the illegal search and the Franks matters, there
simply is not probable cause.  There is association with
Mr. McVeigh.

The Government relies on the doctrine of inevitable
discovery; but the problem with inevitable discovery is that
the argument is belied by the search inventory that they
prepared.  This is not an inevitable discovery case, if the
Court please.  The FBI went in there under that warrant, and
they looked at everything that they could conceivably want to
look at.  There wasn't anything of significance that was left
until later.

The doctrine of inevitable discovery simply doesn't
apply, unless you want to assume that having once searched the
house and pulled out of it 30 or so pages worth of inventory of
goods that sometime in the future they would have thought about
getting a valid warrant.  And that is not what the doctrine of
inevitable discovery is about.

Well, I've -- I hope I haven't taxed your Honor's
patience.  I've tried to focus on the issues that I think are
most relevant.

THE COURT:  I have a question about what significance
there is to the April 29 warrant search.  You're asserting the
warrant is invalid because it's tainted; but the Government
indicates in its papers that nothing was seized in that search
and it's not relevant to the evidence.  But you refer to visual
observations; and I don't know whether we're talking about
testimony from that, or that that relates to the May 2 warrant
and the May 3 search.  I'm not sure where we are on the
April 29 search.

MR. TIGAR:  We included the April 29 search, your
Honor, because the Government says it's going to rely on visual
observations made during that search.

THE COURT:  I don't remember whether in the May 2
affidavit some of those observations are present.  I guess that
seeing nods from the Government side, that must be the case.

MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, on the April 29 execution
of that warrant, the agents observed the Makita drill that they
later went back in for on the May 2 warrant.

THE COURT:  That's in the affidavit.

MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.

THE COURT:  So that's the significance of your
argument.

MR. TIGAR:  That's the fruit, your Honor.  And to the
extent the Government is going to disclaim reliance on a
particular search, it may not be necessary to it rule on it
now, although if it turns out the fruits are later used, then
we may challenge it.

THE COURT:  I understand.

MR. TIGAR:  In short, your Honor, this is a case in
which the Government had -- they had every advantage.  They had
every resource they could possibly want, and they had it
because they wanted to pursue a single objective; that is, the
trial, conviction, and execution of anybody found by them that
they thought had anything to do with this.  Under these
circumstances, to tolerate the studied -- and I say studied --
deception that was practiced on Mr. and Mrs. Nichols makes the
government, as Justice Brandeis said, "an omnipresent teacher
of but of entirely the wrong thing."

I'll reserve now, and maybe I could have a short
rebuttal.

THE COURT:  We'll take our recess before hearing from
the Government.  20 minutes.

    (Recess at 10:32 a.m.)
    (Reconvened at 10:51 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Be seated, please.  Who is arguing for the
Government?  Mr. Connelly?  All right.

PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

MR. CONNELLY:  Thank you, your Honor.  The defendant's
suppression motions require this Court to answer four general
questions:  First, were Nichols' statements to the FBI on
April 21 and 22 voluntary and taken in compliance with the
Constitution; second, was the warrant-authorized search on
April 22 and 23 valid; third, was a later consent search on

April 23 valid and would, in any event, the evidence received
been inevitably discovered pursuant to the later warrant
searches; and fourth and finally, was the warrant-authorized
search on May 3 valid.  I'd like to address these issues in
turn.

First, Mr. Nichols' statements to the FBI on April 21
and 22 clearly were voluntary and taken in compliance with the
Constitution.  Mr. Tigar's complaints about what happened that
day are not so much about what the FBI said and did to his
client, but rather on what the FBI did not do and say.  These
complaints reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the
Constitution.  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights in
particular limit what Government authority can do and do not
require affirmative action to advise a defendant and an
interviewee of information that may be helpful to that person.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court in cases such as
Colorado vs. Springs and Moran vs. Irvine has held that the
police and authorities do not have an affirmative duty to tell
a suspect or interviewee exactly what they know about that
person and provide information that may be helpful to that
person.

Before addressing, therefore, what the FBI agents did
not say and do to Mr. Nichols on April 21 and 22, I'd like to
address what they did do and say.  First, minutes into the
interview, at 3:26 p.m., the FBI agents went beyond what they
were required to do by fully advising him of his Miranda
rights.  There is no question -- no serious question -- I know
Mr. Tigar got up here today and said custody established as
early as 3:20 p.m.  But in our view, there is no serious
question that at the time they advised Mr. Nichols of Miranda,
they were not required to do so because he was not in custody.

There is no dispute that Mr. Nichols voluntarily
turned himself in to the Herington police station on April 21,
not at the request of the FBI but solely on his initiative.
When he did arrive at the Herington police station, again,
there's no dispute that at least three times Herington police
officials told him that he was free to go.

Agent Smith also testified, and as did Agent Foley,
that when Mr. Nichols -- when they first arrived to question
Mr. Nichols, they told him, We have questions we would like to
ask you.  Mr. Nichols said, That's good because I have
questions that I want to ask, too.  Clearly Mr. Nichols was
advised that the FBI was interested in interviewing him on the
subject of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he clearly assented
to that.  At 3:26 p.m., for 17 minutes, the FBI agents went
over the form with him, fully advising him of his rights.
Mr. Nichols deliberately reviewed that form and clearly
understood it.

Mr. Nichols' only complaint with the form -- his only
complaint was it contained a term "interrogation," which in

Mr. Nichols' mind reminded him of Nazi Germany.  I don't need
to remind the Court, of course, that "interrogation" is an
accepted legal term of art.  The Supreme Court has used it, and
the fact that Mr. Nichols in his own mind was reminded of Nazi
Germany has no constitutional significance.  The key fact is
that nothing the agents did in the course of those nine hours
of interviews had anything to do with Nazi Germany, but rather
was consistent with the highest ideals of American justice.

Again, at 4:12 p.m. when new agents joined the
interview, Mr. Nichols was again advised of his rights; and in
his presence, the agents went over the fact that they had told
him that he had -- of his Miranda rights, that he understood
them and that he was not willing to sign the form because of
his aversion to the term "interrogation" but for no other
reason.

Case after case, your Honor, from the Supreme Court in
North Carolina versus Butler to the Tenth Circuit in Austin and
every other Federal Court of Appeals has rejected the argument
that the mere refusal to sign a waiver form precludes a valid
waiver of Miranda rights.  That is the only basis upon which
Mr. Nichols refused to sign the form, the "interrogation" word.
And otherwise, he clearly was willing to answer questions,
clearly understood his rights far more than, I think, most
defendants.  I think it's probably a very rare case where 17
minutes are spent advising a defendant of his rights and
discussing the rights in detail with him and having them read
aloud the form quietly -- or slowly and deliberately.

Mr. Nichols made a calculated decision to speak with
the FBI.  And like many other defendants in his situation, he
may now wish he did not.  But at that time, his choice was
voluntary and knowing, and the agents went well beyond what the
Constitution required.

The next thing that happened in the course of that
interview was that a voluntary period of questioning and
answering occurred.  I think there is no question that it was
entirely voluntary and that the FBI agents' conduct was
perfectly consistent with the Constitution and with
professional responsibilities that they have as FBI agents.

FBI Agents Smith and Crabtree, the two principal
interviewers, testified before the Court, and the Court was
able to evaluate their demean and manner.  They testified that
the questioning and their manner on that day and in the hours
with Mr. Nichols that evening was roughly the same as their
demeanor in court.  They were two low-key agents.  There was no
pressure applied.  There was just a voluntary period of asking
questions and learning information from Mr. Nichols, exactly
what we would expect the FBI to be doing two days after the
Oklahoma City bombing.

I'd like to turn then if I could from what the agents
did say and do to what they did not say and do.  The first
thing the defense complains about is that Mr. Nichols was not
arrested.  As the evidence made clear, a material witness
warrant was issued in Oklahoma City at around 4:25 p.m. that
day.  The question before the Court is whether the agents had
any obligation under the law or under the Constitution to
immediately execute that warrant.  The answer, we submit, your
Honor, to that question is clear, they did not.

The Supreme Court has held there is no constitutional
right to be arrested.  Every federal circuit who has considered
the issue has held there is no right to an immediate execution
of an arrest warrant.  The arrest warrant by its own terms says
you are hereby commanded to arrest Mr. Nichols and to bring him
forthwith to a grand jury in Oklahoma City.  The forthwith
language that we heard so much about, your Honor, from the
witness stand and every witness that got up there was
questioned about, did you read this and understand you had to
arrest him forthwith?  The answer was no, and the answer was
proper under the law.  The requirement under the law is that
once a defendant is arrested, he be brought forthwith before a
magistrate to determine the validity of that arrest.

THE COURT:  Now, Mr. Tigar argues really that at that
point, this witness warrant was really pretextual, a
circumvention of all the things that would follow if the
complaint had been filed and he had been made a defendant.  And
I take it you're in agreement that at that time the Government
didn't have probable cause to arrest him as a defendant.

MR. CONNELLY:  That is correct, your Honor.  Most of
the incriminating information -- the initial incriminating
information came from Mr. Nichols' mouth throughout the course
of that interview.  It was certainly not at the beginning of
the interview that they knew he had been in Oklahoma City with
Mr. McVeigh three days before the bombing and many other things
that he said about bomb making knowledge, and I won't go into
the details.  It was as the night went on that the -- that the
initial incriminating information really started to come out
and of course --

THE COURT:  And also, there are other things as
comparing the affidavit for the complaint with the affidavit
for the material witness warrant.

MR. CONNELLY:  Oh, clearly.  And then in the course of
searching the house and other investigation, more information
was learned; so certainly, as of May 9, when the complaint
issued, there was probable cause -- and that probable cause has
been upheld by the courts in Oklahoma -- to arrest Mr. Nichols
as a defendant.  The question --

THE COURT:  There's a strong suggestion here, of
course, that he really wasn't free to leave.  There had been
this instruction from Mr. Shapiro that if he left, they should
keep him under close surveillance.

MR. CONNELLY:  And, your Honor, I think, as the Court
pointed out, keeping somebody under surveillance is not an
arrest; that is entirely proper.  The Supreme Court has clearly
held an arrest occurs once they take custody of a person.  You
can follow a person or even tell the person stop; and if the
person does not stop, the arrest does not come until there is a
laying on of hands, as Justice Scalia said in his opinion, to
effectuate that arrest.

THE COURT:  What is your understanding of what happens
when a person is arrested as a material witness?  Is a Miranda
required at that time?

MR. CONNELLY:  I think a Miranda is required if he is
in custody.

THE COURT:  Any kind of custody?

MR. CONNELLY:  If he's in custody and if there's
interrogation.  Certainly, if they wanted to question him after
they arrested him, they would have to Mirandize him.  I think
the key point here, of course, they did Mirandize at 3:26.
Nothing more would be required after the arrest.  That's what
the Supreme Court has held in Patterson.  Even after a
defendant is indicted, the only thing required is that he be
Mirandized.

And so clearly in an indictment when there are Sixth
Amendment rights that attach, the only thing the Supreme Court
has held necessary to have a valid waiver of his right to
counsel and his right to remain silent after indictment is that
you Mirandize him and give him the same warnings that
Mr. Nichols was given.  So I would say that yes, after they
arrested him and if they wanted to question him, they would
have to Mirandize him.

THE COURT:  Of course, at that point in making a
decision about whether to waive the right to remain silent and
proceed to talk, the factor that you know there is this arrest
there, and that wasn't true when they Mirandized Mr. Nichols.

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, that's a good -- second point.
And I think that leads me to the second point that he complains
about, not only did they not arrest him, but they did not tell
him there is an arrest warrant out.  I think the case law again
is very clear.  Every court of appeals that considered the
question after Patterson has held that a defendant need not be
told that he was indicted, which I would submit that it's even
more significant.  There's even a more irreversible changed
position postindictment.  The Sixth Amendment attaches, for one
thing.  But also the adversarial lines have been more clearly
drawn after indictment versus after arrest.

There's also a case -- the Eighth Circuit has held and
it is cited in our brief that a defendant need not even be told
that an arrest warrant has been issued; that he's under arrest.
The Second Circuit has similarly held in the Valdez case, very
closely on point.  The defendant there argued -- in that case
the defendant was a witness in court.  And the judge and the
government had together agreed to delay execution of a warrant
for the very reason that they thought the defendant may not be
willing to testify if he knew that an arrest warrant was out
for him.

The Court of Appeals -- I think it's directly on
point -- the Court of Appeals applying the reasoning of Moran
said things that the defendant does not know about are not
material to his voluntariness of his waiver; that is, you don't
have to provide a defendant with information that may be
helpful to him.

THE COURT:  I'm not familiar with the case.  This
person was a witness at a trial?

MR. CONNELLY:  Witness at a trial; and there was an
arrest warrant issued for him, but he did not know about it.
And the judge and the government together -- got together and
agreed that they would delay mention -- delay execution of the
warrant and delay mentioning the fact of the warrant to him so
that -- that he would not be chilled in his testimony.  His
statements at that trial were later used against him in his own
trial, and he claimed that it was involuntary because he was
not given critical knowledge of the fact that there was an
arrest warrant for him.

THE COURT:  What's the name of that case?

MR. CONNELLY:  Valdez.  16 F.3d -- I don't have the
page, but it is cited in our brief.  It's a Second Circuit case
directly on point.  It implies -- it really is consistent with
the Supreme Court's teaching in cases like Colorado vs. Brady
and Moran where the fact is that you have to know your right to
remain silent.  You have to know the fact that anything you say
can be used against you.  You have to know you have a right to
an attorney if you want.

All those things are implicit in the Miranda warnings,
and that's what Mr. Nichols know -- knew.  The teaching of the
Supreme Court and relied on in the Valdez case is that you need
not know information that may bear on the wisdom of whether you
should talk to the authorities or not.  All you have to know is
the consequences of what you -- if you do talk to them, they
can use anything you say against you.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. CONNELLY:  And Colorado vs. Springs, the Supreme
Court decision, is a good example of that.  In that case, the
defendant complained that the authorities had not even told him
the subject in which they were interested in questioning him
about.  He thought it was about some innocuous or smaller
offense when they were really interested in a murder case; and
he said, If I really knew you were looking at me for a murder,
I might not have spoken with you.  The Supreme Court in Spring
said that's irrelevant.  The question is did you know anything
you say could be used against you and did you know you had a
right to an attorney.  And that's all Miranda requires.  It
doesn't require anything more.

That I think -- that principle is fatal to the whole
notion that Mr. Nichols had some kind of right to be told about
an arrest warrant.

 The third thing that he complains about that he was
not told was that a public defender was trying to contact him.
I think these same cases forestall that claim; particularly
Moran vs. Irvine, which is dispositive of it.  In that case,
the defendant had an even stronger claim because he had a prior
attorney-client relationship with the attorney and the attorney
was contacting him on behalf of his family.  Nonetheless, the
authorities did not tell him that the attorney was calling.  He
claimed that that violated my -- the knowing -- my knowing
waiver of rights.  It also violated my Sixth Amendment rights.
The Supreme Court rejected that and saying, again, that things
that occur outside the interview room and that are unknown to
the defendant are irrelevant to the validity of his waiver of
constitutional rights.

So for all those reasons, your Honor, and particularly
in this case -- in that case, it was a suggestion that there
was some kind of misconduct of the authorities in not notifying
him of the attorney call.  Even though it didn't violate the
Constitution, there was still some idea that they didn't --
they weren't exactly square with the defendant.

In this case, there's no suggestion to that even.

Every one of Mr. Phillips' notes reflects that he called and he
said I'm available to represent Mr. Nichols if he requests that
counsel.  The evidence is undisputed that at no time that
evening did Mr. Nichols request counsel.  So not only was there
no constitutional violation, there was certainly no ethical
violation or nothing done that they shouldn't have done.  The
very premise of Mr. Phillips' request is that I just want you
to know I'm available if he requests counsel.

Agent Price testified that when he was told you have
that, that he said, well, if he requests counsel, let's give
him Mr. Phillips' name.  That's exactly what Mr. Phillips
requested.  That's what the agents did.  They didn't have to do
it because he never requested counsel.  That contingency never
came about.

I'd also like to note the factual premise of this
claim that somehow he violated my rights by not telling me that
counsel was calling on my behalf is misplaced.  The factual
premise is that had Mr. Nichols known of the arrest warrant,
had he known that counsel was trying to call him, he would have
stopped talking.  He would have just shut up and said I'm not
going to talk anymore.  That's belied by the facts of this
case.

Agent Foley testified that he thought Mr. Nichols had
a story to tell that night, and that is confirmed by the
actions on April 22.  On April 22, after Mr. Nichols had been
arrested, after he had been told of his Miranda rights and
after he had been told at the outset of the trip to Abilene
where the jail was to Wichita where the federal court was, that
he was going there to get an attorney, an attorney would be
appointed for him, he initiated discussions with the agents.

Clearly, the fact that he had been arrested as a
material witness was not something that caused him
automatically not to want to talk to the authorities.  I think
that's understandable, your Honor, particularly because there's
a difference between being arrested as a material witness and
being arrested as a defendant, as counsel pointed out.  A
material witness is somebody who is being held because he may
have information relevant to the case.  That's -- and
Mr. Nichols did have information relevant to the case and was
happy to share it with the authorities, in fact was very
calculating, we would submit, in his decision to speak with the
authorities.  He knew his rights.  He knew his situation,
certainly knew everything there was to know on April 22 and,
nonetheless, still spoke.

So we would submit that as a matter of law, the agents
did everything entirely properly and, as a matter of fact,
there's no basis to the suggestion that Mr. Nichols would not
have spoken to the authorities had he known of the facts that
they now complain about.

I turn then to the three searches that are in
question.  The first search is the April 22 to 23 warranted
search.  The first challenge to that search is that it was
based largely on Mr. Nichols' own statements.  That's correct.
They were a key part of the search warrant.  What Mr. Nichols
had said to the authorities on April 21 and 22, into the early
morning of the 22nd, was a key part of what that search warrant
was about.  We would submit that because those statements were
voluntary, because they were taken in compliance with Miranda,
there is no basis for suppressing or excising those statements
from the warrant.

The second challenge to the warrant that included a
paragraph describing the observations of Agent Reightler who on
the evening of April 21 looked through an opening in the garage
window of Mr. Nichols' home and saw plastic barrels, we submit,
your Honor, that that -- it happened on two occasions.  There
were two separate peeks through the windows.  We would submit,
your Honor, that those peeks are valid based on exigent
circumstances.

THE COURT:  What about the consent?  We have during
the time of the interview a consent to search.

MR. CONNELLY:  In fact, there were two consents to
search.  One was of Terry Nichols.

THE COURT:  I'm talking about Terry Nichols.

MR. CONNELLY:  That --

THE COURT:  You're not emphasizing that in your papers
here, but you're relying on that.

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, we do emphasize that for other
searches.  We do not emphasize it, though, for Agent
Reightler's look through the window because Mr. Nichols said,
Would it be possible for my wife or I to be present when you
did the search of my house?  The agent said it would be
possible, so we are -- we are accepting the argument that that
was a condition of the consent, that before they can rely on
that consent, they have to ensure or allow either Mr. Nichols
or Mrs. Nichols to be present at the home.  They were not
present at that home on April 21 when Agent Reightler looked
through the garage, and therefore we do not rely on that Terry
Nichols' consent for that search.  We rely for that search
on --

THE COURT:  I thought your position was that earlier,
that that wasn't really a condition.  That was a request but
not a -- an actual condition on the consent.  Now, which is it?

MR. CONNELLY:  I don't think we've ever argued it was
not a condition.  I think we could have made the argument.  I'm
confident that none of our papers have ever made that argument,
your Honor.  I think we could have said that.  I think we have
given it the status of a condition.  I think maybe we have bent
over backwards in doing that.  We have consistently said that
that's a condition.  We're not going to rely on his consent
unless either he or his wife were present at the time.  And so
I don't think we've ever sought to justify Agent Reightler's
peek through the garage window based on his consent.

THE COURT:  Agent Reightler thought he had consent.

MR. CONNELLY:  He thought he had consent and --

THE COURT:  But that's subjective and not the
standard.

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, he thought he had the consent of
the occupants of the home.  He didn't differentiate whether --
Mr. Nichols or Mrs. Nichols.  He thought he had consent and, in
fact, he did have consent of both of them, although we're
saying now we're not allowing the consent of Terry, but he did
have the consent of Mrs. Nichols.  By that time, I think the
testimony is fairly clear -- very clear that by at least
6 p.m., Mrs. Nichols had signed written consents to the search
of her home.

THE COURT:  If we're dealing with exigent
circumstances and I understand that argument, why is it
limited?  Why does he only go peek in with his flashlight to
this one window in the garage that has a broken blind and is
the only one that -- we don't know anything about the house and
whether the windows were covered or not in the house.  I don't
remember anything about that.  If these circumstances warrant
this early peek, why is it so limited?

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, perhaps it could have gone
further than that.  I think he did -- he took a limited step
that, in his judgment, was appropriate to determine whether
there was any demonstrable safety hazard to people or danger
inside that garage because harm to him.  There, I think there's
no question that he in good faith believed that there were
exigent circumstances.  There has been a lot of testimony about
the Government's actions that day in terms of securing the
truck, in terms of sending a S.W.A.T. team to Herington.  And I
think that is largely overstated; that a lot of the statements
that were made here in the papers and also here this morning of
Mr. Tigar overstated with respect to the S.W.A.T. team.  All
that was done was members of the S.W.A.T. team who were also
criminal investigators, as well, were sent to Herington and
were available were -- were it needed to call them out.  They
never sprang into action.  But clearly, the Government had a
good faith concern on that day that there were possible safety
hazards.

I think it's easy, looking back a year and some
several months after the bombing, to forget what happened.  But
on April 21, two days after the bombing, there was indications
that Kansas had been a staging ground for the bombing at that
point, and there were concerns at that point.  I think this
Court can remember -- and certainly throughout the country,
there were evacuations in federal buildings and all kinds of
buildings in the days after the bombing.  There were clearly
safety concerns at that time.  I don't think there was any
suggestion that Agent Reightler, as in many exigent
circumstances cases -- there is a suggestion that somehow
really what was going on, he wanted to get a sneak peek at what
was happening.

I think really, his legitimate interest was two-fold.
One, he had a consent; and two, he had valid concerns that he
wanted to make sure there was no safety hazards.  It was not an
exploratory search.  He just wanted to satisfy himself that
there were no safety hazards.  And I think that was a
reasonable judgment under the circumstances, and it did not
violate the Fourth Amendment.

I would also point out, however, that even if you
struck that part of the paragraph -- and that's what the Tenth
Circuit has taught us in several cases, most recently en banc
case in Cusamano, is that the remedy is if there was -- one
part of the warrant contained information illegally obtained,
the remedy is just to strike it out.  And even if the Court
were to strike it out, it would have no effect on the probable
cause.

The barrels were in no sense critical to the probable
cause showing.  The probable cause showing, as I've argued, is
largely on Terry Nichols' own mouth and the things he said that
evening.  But the barrels were not an important part of that --
of that calculus.  They were clearly included in there; but our
submission is if you take it out, the warrants would be no
different.  It would be unaffected.

The second challenge -- or the third challenge --
there are three challenges, as I understand it, to the April 22
warrant, the first one being Nichols' statements were
involuntary and they shouldn't have been included, the second
being that Agent Reightler's observations were illegal and
should not be included.  The third one is a Franks challenge.

And the first challenge under Franks is that the
agents did not include everything that Terry Nichols had said
about the fuel meter.  What the affidavit did say -- and which
was true and was exactly what Agent Crabtree had been told
during the interview -- was that Nichols admitted possessing a
fuel meter, and he claimed that he bought it for resale
purposes.  The agent included both those facts.

And I think the second fact is particularly critical
because if it were accepted, it would be reason for finding
that Nichols had an innocent purpose for that fuel meter.  He
claimed an innocent purpose, and Agent Crabtree told the
issuing judge, Judge Bligh in Kansas, what that claim was.  It
was not a case where Agent Crabtree was trying to hide the ball
from the judge and trying to hide from the judge the fact that
Nichols had claimed there was an innocent purpose for the fuel
meter.  The fuel meter, however, was relevant to this
investigation because it could have been used.  It could have
been used or -- could have not just been used.  It could have
been purchased for use in constructing an ammonium nitrate
fertilizer fuel oil bomb.

The key point, I think, your Honor, is that -- what
was Defendant Nichols' intent in purchasing that item.  If he
purchased it for use in constructing an ammonium nitrate fuel
oil bomb, then it certainly would have been relevant evidence
whether or not it ultimately served that purpose.

So it is true, your Honor, that the affidavit did not
describe the additional statement of Mr. Nichols made earlier
in the interview to two other agents that -- that the fuel
meter did not work and was not in working condition and was now
disassembled.

THE COURT:  So as I look at the affidavit now, I
should include that?

MR. CONNELLY:  You -- well, there are two -- I think
there are two elements that must be found in a Franks claim.
First is that the defendant acted with scienter.

THE COURT:  I understand that.

MR. CONNELLY:  So if you concluded that Agent Crabtree
recklessly omitted that with intent or omitted that with
reckless or deliberate intent to mislead the issuing judge,
then yes, the remedy would be to include it; and you say is it
material in the sense would it defeat probable cause if you
added that.  We would submit on both those grounds that
defendants failed to carry the burden by a preponderance of the
evidence that there was a Franks violation.  One, because there
was no scienter.  Agent Crabtree candidly admitted that had he
to do it over again and were he not acting under the time
constraints, he would have included that and explained
credibly, we submit, why he did not include it.

Mr. Nichols had first mentioned the fuel meter, and
the only time he mentioned that it was not working and was
disassembled was at a break of Agents Jablonski and Foley.
When Agents Crabtree and Smith came back in the room, Jablonski
and Foley briefed them on what he said and did tell him he
claimed it was not in working order.  That statement did not
make its way into Agent Smith's notes because he was only
writing down what he had heard from Mr. Nichols.  It made its
way into Agent Jablonski's notes.

The affidavit in the wee hours of the morning of
April 22 after Agent Crabtree had just gotten through several
hours of questioning Mr. Nichols, was writing it up -- I
believe the testimony is from 2:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. in the U.S.
Attorney office in Wichita, just forgot about it and he -- so I
would submit, your Honor, that there's no basis for any
scienter, any intent or reckless disregard to mislead Judge
Block.

Second of all, your Honor is correct that the remedy
in that case, if the Court were to conclude that there were any
scienter, would be to just add it to the affidavit and ask
whether that addition would defeat probable cause.  Clearly,
your Honor, it would not.  Even with that addition, it was
still a relevant piece of evidence that the agents were
entitled to go into and look for.  And beyond that, even if the
Court were to strike the fuel meter allegation entirely, there
would still be probable cause to go in and search that house
for relevant evidence related to the bombing.

Mr. Nichols, for example -- I don't want to go into
all of Mr. Nichols' statements in this proceeding, but
Mr. Nichols made several statements in which it was suggested
that there was relevant evidence to be found, including
evidence that belonged to Mr. McVeigh in his house.  But
clearly with or without the fuel meter, there was probable
cause to the agents to conduct that search on April 22nd to
23rd.

So for all those reasons, we would represent the
Franks claim as to the fuel meter should be denied.

The Franks claim is also made as to the statements of
Mr. Nichols admitted he knew how to make a bomb.  We have
submitted under seal the entire statement relevant to that.  We
would submit that is a fair summary of what Mr. Nichols told
the agents.  The fair reading of the entire 302 and the entire
interview including the notes of Agent Smith is that
Mr. Nichols admitted he had the knowledge of how to build the
bomb.

But even if you were to disregard that paragraph,
there was a separate paragraph in the affidavit, paragraph 20,
which reports that a co-worker of Mr. Nichols talked about
Mr. Nichols bragging about his ability to make fertilizer
bombs.  Clearly, Mr. Nichols' own words are not the only part
of the affidavit that go to his bomb making knowledge and
ability, but, also, there's a separate paragraph that is not
the subject of any Franks challenge that confirms his
ability -- his own acknowledged ability anyway.

The third and I think final Franks challenge to the
affidavit is that it included Agent Reightler's additional
statement that he smelled the smell of fertilizer when he went
up to the house.

There was testimony introduced -- Agent Reightler
testified that he has a degree in biology and training in the
DEA lab that allows him to recognize the smell of certain bombs
and chemicals.  And he testified that ammonium nitrate does
have the distinct smell of ammonia.

There was testimony by a defense investigator with no
background or experience that says I bought a bag of
fertilizer.  Didn't smell to me.  Well, it was totally
different conditions; his bag of fertilizer versus what
Mr. Nichols may have had to put on his lawn the day before.

But we would urge the Court to take judicial notice of
the case we cited, the Standard Oil case that was a commercial
dispute in the Ninth Circuit about 30 years ago, in which the
dispute was there had been contamination, that a truck that
contained ammonium nitrate should not have contained that and
the result was that there was a strong ammonia smell resulting
from that -- from that improper use of a truck to carry
ammonium nitrate.  And that is how they proved that the truck
had, in fact, carried ammonium nitrate, is that there was a
strong ammonia smell.  I think that the Court should take
notice of the fact that other cases have involved ammonium
nitrate and have an ammonia smell.

I would point out for the Court that this Franks claim
was never raised in any papers beforehand.  It was never the
basis of any hearing in this case.  The first time we heard it
was on the very last day of testimony when a defense
investigator got up and said I think that statement must be
false because I bought a bag of ammonium nitrate and it didn't
smell to me.

THE COURT:  Well, the affidavit doesn't say ammonium
nitrate.  It just says fertilizer.

MR. CONNELLY:  Then I think there are two links in the
chain.  I think Agent Reightler testified that he reported that
he had smelled ammonia which suggested to him the presence of
ammonium nitrate, which is a fertilizer.  And then Agent
Crabtree went on and said that he smelled fertilizer, which I
think is an entirely accurate statement.  He didn't
differentiate the type of fertilizer smell.  In fact, if he had
been more specific, I think there would even be stronger
probable cause because there was indications that this may have
been an ammonium nitrate fuel oil bomb.

So the fact that he just said more generically
fertilizer certainly is in no way prejudicial to the defense
rights.  It's a fair statement of exactly what Agent
Reightler -- again, it's a fair summary which was -- the entire
affidavit was a summary of statements.

THE COURT:  Your position is the smell of fertilizer
is not very significant to the probable cause determination?

MR. CONNELLY:  That's our -- that's our other
position, and I think you can strike that entirely just like
you can strike the barrels, and it makes no difference to the
affidavit.

The third search in question is the April 23 search of
Nichols' residence.  After the agents had finished executing
the search warrant on April 22 and into the early morning hours
of April 23, they went back and reviewed the inventory lot.

And Mary Jasnowski -- the lead search agent's
testimony in this is very clear and very credible, we submit --
realized they had left behind some items of significance.
Foremost among them was the fuel meter.  They also recognized
that they had left behind a sleeping bag that Nichols had said
in his interview he had taken and belonged to McVeigh.

They went back on April 23 in the afternoon -- now
after they had executed the warrant, they had left the house
and locked the doors, and they made no argument that this was
some kind of continuing search under the warrant, even though I
think possibly they could have, because it was all within a
matter of hours.  They had left the house.  They had left the
inventory there, and they made no argument that the search was
anything but over.

So at that point, they approached Mrs. Nichols and
they said, Would you be willing to consent to a search of the
house?  And she gave a written consent; and those are all in
the record, like all her consents.  The question --

THE COURT:  I can't recall on April 23.  She wanted
something out of house at that time; right?

MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.  She was going to get some of her
clothes and other items of personal property.

THE COURT:  Which she did, indeed, do.

MR. CONNELLY:  She did.  And so our argument on the
validity of the April 23 search is three-fold.  I think there
are three alternative grounds upon which it is stated.  First
is that Terry Nichols' consent was at that point an independent
justification for the search.  His consent was voluntary.  Just
as his statements were voluntary, we would submit his consent
was voluntary.

The question was whether his condition was satisfied.

And there's also another question as to whether his consent on
April 21, which he refreshed again on April 22 when he asked
the agents, Have you been in my house to start the search --
whether that April 21 or April 22 consent can still apply on
April 23.  The defense argues that it can't.  Their argument,
as I understand it, is that there was an intervening
illegality; that in between his consent on the night of the
21st -- after that, he was illegally arrested pursuant, they
say, to the illegal material arrest warrant in Oklahoma City.

We would submit, your Honor, first of all, that that
material arrest warrant was entirely legal.  It was issued by
Chief Judge Russell.  It was upheld by Judge Belot against
defense challenges later in Kansas, and we submit there's no
basis for finding anything but legal and valid.

But second of all, even after he was allegedly
illegally arrested, he refreshed his consent.  On April 22, he
said, have you started searching yet, and they said no; and
they asked about booby traps, and he specifically gave them
advice that would facilitate them conducting that search safely
and without hazard to themselves.

And then again on April 22 and April 26, his counsel
in his presence and before Judge Belot said he voluntarily
consented to a search of his house and his car, so we would
submit that there's no basis for holding that as of April 2 his
consent somehow had expired.

So given that it's voluntary and given that it's still
extant and in force, the question for the Court is whether its
condition was satisfied.  Again, we have conceded that it was
conditional.  No argument can be made on that.  I think we at
all times have conceded it was the conditional.  The question
is was Marife Nichols present during that search.

THE COURT:  Incidentally, on the car search, I didn't
see any discussion in here about the searches of the truck.
There were in the motions before we held the hearing.  I take
it that the reason I'm not seeing that is there's nothing
obtained from there that is admissible evidence here or leads
to admissible evidence?  Is that --

MR. CONNELLY:  That's right.  That's always been our
position, your Honor.  And at the June 18 hearing when we
argued that the Court need not consider all these other
searches and need not consider even Marife Nichols' consent
because it was not a necessary basis for any of the five
searches we did rely on, Mr. Tigar got up and said I'm going to
prove -- I'm going to prove that there was taint.  I'm going to
prove you have to decide these other searches because they
tainted the five searches upon which the Government relies on.

That claim has disappeared because today and -- in his
papers and today, they said you only have to consider these
five searches.  So there's no taint claim; and it was raised,
your Honor, and we submitted to the --

THE COURT:  I'm just asking you now so it's clear in
my mind that it is the Government's position, as it was in the
prehearing papers, that nothing was obtained in -- in, you
know, going into the car.  There was an address book or
telephone book or something in there.

MR. CONNELLY:  Our position has always remained the
same.  We don't intend to introduce any of that evidence, and
none of that evidence in any way affected any of the other
searches; and I think the testimony from the witness stand was
very clear on that.  I guess we would ask the Court to make a
finding if it's still disputed in that way.  I think there's
only one possible finding, and I think it may even be conceded
at this point, that there has been no showing of any taint from
any of the car searches or indeed from any of the consent
searches pursuant to the Marife Nichols' consent other than the
April 23 searches which we're now discussing.

So first justification of that April 23 search is that
Terry Nichols consented, it was valid and its condition was
satisfied because Mr. Nichols was present there.

The second argument is Mrs. Nichols' consent was valid
and properly served as a basis for that search.  And I'd like
to discuss the whole Mrs. Nichols issue separately if I could
at the end.  That's our -- that's our second position on that.

And our third position is that even if they improperly
entered the house that day and improperly seized the items
about which they already knew, the fuel meter and sleeping bag
and other items that are material in that search, that they
inevitably would have been discovered anyway during the later
April 29 warranted search and during the May 3 warranted
search.

I think there rarely would be a stronger case than
this one for inevitable discovery.  The agents knew going in
what they wanted.  It's not like they found something they
didn't know about.  And they clearly -- it's not that they just
could have gone in later and got it.  It's that they did, in
fact, go in pursuant to valid warrants on April 29 and May 3.

So for that reason, we would submit even if the search
somehow were not -- or the entries somehow were not valid, that
second entry on April 23, there would still be no basis for the
exclusionary rule in this case.

The fourth and final issue in the third search issue
is the May 3 warranted search.  That search, as the testimony
made clear, the agents went in and seized some drills and other
materials that they had known about and that they had first
observed during the April 29 warranted search; and that's the
reason, your Honor, why the April 29 search is at all relevant.
Nothing relevant came out of that except the observation that
later was one of the foundations for the May 3 warranted
search.

There is no colorable challenge, we would submit, to
that May 3 warrant.  The same challenges that were made in the
April 22 and 23 warrant are made; that is that Mr. Nichols'
statements were involuntary and therefore should not have been
included; that there were Franks violations and basically a
repetition of the same challenges were made on the April 22 and
23 search.  And for the same reasons, they don't have merit
with respect to that search.  They have even less merit with
this search because at that time there was additional
information that the agents knew and included in the affidavit
that had nothing to do or -- on top of what Mr. Nichols had
told them and the other information they learned as of
April 23.

I'd like to turn then, if I could, to the issue of
Marife Nichols.  We argued to this Court on June 18 that that
issue didn't have to be determined.  We argue today there is an
independent ground for each of the three searches upon which we
rely on, having nothing do with anything Marife Nichols said or
did.

Mr. Tigar, as I pointed out, stood up and said no, you
have to decide that issue because all those other entries and
everything that they did with Marife Nichols, including
bringing her to the grand jury on -- in mid-May and including
not giving her back her money on April 23 and including
allegedly keeping her in captivity and incommunicado for 37
days, all of that tainted the three searches upon which you
rely.

Again, your Honor, that taint claim has disappeared
and if it hasn't disappeared, should disappear because it's
been conclusively refuted by unrebutted testimony in this case.

Nonetheless, having heard Mrs. Nichols' testimony and
having spent hundreds of pages in terms of FBI agents
testifying about their treatment and dealings with
Mrs. Nichols, we would urge the Court to make a finding that
her consents were valid.  And that finding would have to relate
only to three searches because there are three independent
grounds for three of the searches; that is, first, Agent
Reightler's warrantless peeks through the window on April 21,
the garage window; second, the April 22nd and 23rd warrant.
There would be an alternative ground for that.  I don't think
it's necessary, but it would be an alternative.  Third, it
would be an alternative ground for the April 23 consent search
that Mrs. Nichols provided consent for that.  We would submit
the record is clear that Mrs. Nichols' consents were voluntary.

THE COURT:  Just so I have this, your position is that
her participation on the 22nd and the 23rd simply was
satisfying Mr. Nichols' condition?

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, that was originally -- your
Honor -- yes, there are two --

THE COURT:  That's why her consent doesn't mean
anything from one look at it?

MR. CONNELLY:  That's why it's not necessary to decide
that, and also because there's inevitable discovery.  There are
two grounds upon which that April -- well, really, it's the
April 23.  The second -- the return on April 23 when they
seized the fuel meter after the warrant has been executed.
There are two bases on which to uphold that search.  One is
that Nichols --

THE COURT:  She's not in there on the 22nd?

MR. CONNELLY:  No.  No.  But she consented to -- by
then, she had consented to a home search.  So her consent can
provide backup, if you will, to the search warrant.  There were
two possible authorities for the 22nd and 23rd.  One, the
search warrant.  And we submit that's all you need.  That's why
you don't have to determine the validity for her consent.  Her
consent is another ground upon which they could have entered
that day.  And it would be backup to that; it would be a backup
to Agent Reightler.

It would also be an alternative to the April 23, as we
have two arguments to that consent search on April 23 regarding
the fuel meter.  One is the Terry Nichols consent, that she was
there, and that satisfied his condition.  The second one is
that she independently consented.  She signed a consent form
that day again, that second consent form that authorized them
to go in and search the house that day.

I'd like to talk generally about this Marife Nichols
issue.  The defense said in the papers and again today
Mr. Tigar has argued that it's really a credibility choice
between Marife Nichols and FBI Agent Sheila Dobson.  Agent
Dobson testified here credibly, consistently and
professionally; and we would urge the Court to credit her
testimony.  I'm happy and, indeed, proud to defend the
credibility of her testimony.  But in some ways, the issue is
not so much Marife Nichols versus Sheila Dobson, but it's
Marife Nichols versus Marife Nichols.

The defense in their papers have portrayed Marife
Nichols as an unsophisticated woman.  We think this gives her
far too little credit.  We think the testimony on the stand and
her background and it has been made clear in the evidence that
she is an intelligent and strong woman capable of standing up
to Government authority.  Most telling perhaps was Mr. Woods
got up and asked her a hypothetical question, a hypothetical
question of if the authorities in the Philippines had come to
you and said can we get in your house, what would you have
done.  Now, this question arguably was objectionable and under
Tenth Circuit law in Little and Zapata arguably irrelevant
because a person's general attitude to foreign law enforcement
is entitled to little or no weight as a matter of law.  I think
her answer is telling.  She said, I don't know.  It would
depend on if they were being nice.

It also came out that Mrs. Nichols' first entry into
this country, her first dealing with Government authorities in
this country, she lied about her age and her birthdate.
Clearly, she is not someone who is timid and unsophisticated.
I don't think there are very many lay witnesses that have come
before this Court and testified that they have read Black's Law
Dictionary.  I think that their argument that she is naive and
unsophisticated gives her too little credit.

And it is important to know that she has taken
sophisticated courses in English, college courses in anatomy
and psychology in English; that she is not the naive and
unsophisticated person they would put her out to be.

I think the question in the end comes down to do you
believe what Marife Nichols said at one point in her testimony
or another point.  Give you an example.  She testified on page
725 of the transcript that Agent Dobson had told her she had a
right to refuse consent.  Page 726, she testified, I didn't
know I had a right to refuse consent.  She testified I think on
page 732 of the transcript that Agent Thomeczek told her, We
want to go in the house to search for items.  Later on in that
transcript -- I don't have the exact page, but later on in the
transcript she said, I didn't know they were going to search
the house on April 23.  Then she later amended it to say, All I
knew is that they were going to search for a little receipt.  I
didn't know they were going to do any more than that.

Agent Dobson's testimony is that she was free anywhere
in that house, to go wherever she wanted; in fact, went out in
the garage for a short period of time and were aware the agents
were conducting the fuel meter search.

So we would submit, your Honor, that the Court should,
in fact, credit Agent Dobson's testimony and the testimony of
the other FBI agents and not credit Mrs. Nichols in those
points where she is inconsistent or -- or -- or not entirely
free from memory in terms of exactly what happened.  She said,
for example, it's possible I may have been in the garage.  I
think it's -- it's -- the Court should clearly credit Agent
Dobson's testimony that, in fact, she went out to the garage.
That testimony is uncontradicted even by Mrs. Nichols.

But the key point on -- and there are other
inconsistencies in her testimony and other places where we ask
the Court to make a credibility finding; for example, what the
agent said.  It's undisputed that Mrs. Nichols read and signed
the forms.  She admitted that.  And it's also undisputed -- by
the way, the fact that she read and signed the forms under the
case law is sufficient by itself in Tenth Circuit cases to
uphold the finding of consent.  She clearly read the forms.
She -- she was, in those forms, told she had a right to refuse
to consent, and that's -- goes beyond what the Supreme Court
has required in Schneckloff and other cases.  The defendant --
or a person does not have to be told they have a right to
refuse consent.

But she was clearly told by her own admission she had
a right to refuse consent.  She testified, as well, that the
agents went beyond the form and told her orally, yes,
Mrs. Nichols, you do have a right to refuse consent.

There is some dispute that comes up in the record
between her and Agent White and Agent Dobson to a lesser extent
as to what were you told in the event you refused consent.
Mrs. Nichols claimed -- admitted they would have to get a
warrant from a judge.  Mrs. Nichols said that they made very
clear to the -- Mrs. Nichols that the judge would issue the
warrant.  The agents testified, on the other hand, that it was
very carefully explained to her that there was no guarantee the
judge would issue a warrant and it was up to the judge.

Again, this is an example of a case we would have to
credit the agent's testimony over Mrs. Nichols.  But in the
end, I don't think it comes down to credibility findings as
much as the bottom-line fact of Mrs. Nichols' own words when
asked on direct examination, Why did you consent to the search
of your home and the search of the truck -- which is not at
issue in this case, but why did you consent to the search of
the home.  She said, I consented because I thought I had
nothing to hide and I thought it was the right thing to do.
Later on in her testimony, she said, I thought Terry was
innocent also.

This case in some respects is far easier than many
consent cases.  A case comes before this Court and a
defendant -- it's argued the defendant gave consent to a search
of his trunk when you know there are kilos upon kilos of
cocaine in that trunk.  And the question is why would any
defendant voluntarily agree to a search of his trunk when he
knew the agent -- the agent was going to go right in there and
find all the drugs.  That's a little difficult in some cases.
And quite candidly, it's difficult to square as to why is that
really voluntary and why was he not just submitting to
authority in that case.

In this case, your Honor, I think from Mrs. Nichols'
own mouth came the reason she was not submitting to authority
and why she was doing it voluntarily and not just submitting to
authority.  And that's precisely because she thought it was the
right thing to do and she had nothing to hide.

And for all those reasons, your Honor, we would urge
the Court to uphold each of the searches, to admit Terry
Nichols' statements and to make a specific finding now that
we've litigated the issue that Mrs. Nichols' consent provided
justification for three of the challenged searches.

I'd be happy to answer any questions.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Tigar, do you have some
rejoinder?

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

MR. TIGAR:  Very briefly, your Honor.

Question one, what does the Valdez case hold at 16
F.3d 1324?  There was a witness in Judge Mary Johnson-Lowe's
court who -- for whom a warrant had been issued.  He was not
told that the warrant was issued and he went ahead and
testified.

It is true that the Second Circuit held that the --
his testimony given under those circumstances was admissible.
However, we are troubled by the district court's choice to
deliberately delay the execution of an arrest warrant to ensure
a witness' testimony at trial.  There is something vaguely
inappropriate about the district judge arranging matters so
that Mock's testimony on behalf of the defendants would not be
jeopardized by execution of the arrest warrant.  Even though
Mock did not have a Fifth Amendment right to the information,
the district court's determination to withhold the information
itself implicates concerns of fundamental fairness of the
courtroom.

Hardly a ringing endorsement of the tactics employed
by Government counsel with the connivance, the cooperation of a
district judge.  And when one considers that the warrant here
was an unequivocal judicial command to bring the person before
the court and the Tenth Circuit language about tactical delay,
we submit the case has to come out the other way.

Now, the -- Mr. Connelly, Government counsel, has
suggested that the Government does not have an obligation of
candor in dealing with citizens.  The Ninth Circuit in a case
we cited at page 80 has discussed the use of misinformation
material in a decision to speak to agents.  And -- excuse me --
that is the Tenth Circuit in Erickson.  It says that simple
failure to inform the defendant he was a subject of the
investigation or that the investigation was criminal does not
amount to affirmative deceit until defendant inquired about the
nature of the investigation and the agent's failure to respond
was intended to mislead.  Pages 80 and 81 of our brief.

Years ago, before my hair was gray and my posture was
stooped, I represented Selective Service registrants whose
lives were in some sense in question, in jeopardy if they were
drafted.  Justice Clark said in a Supreme Court case called
Simmons vs. United States, Registrants are not to be treated as
though they were engaged in formal litigation assisted by
counsel, at 348 U.S. 397.  I submit that the same
due-process-based concerns that led the Court to say that in
Simmons are at work in a material witness situation.  After
all, one can't lie to a court about the purpose of a search
warrant one is obtaining.  And we submit the same principle
should be applied here.

With respect to the -- whether Mr. Nichols initiated
discussions with the agent, our brief at page 32 deals with
that question.  That is the -- the car ride on the way to
Wichita and the Christian burial speech.

The Reightler search, he returned -- Mrs. Nichols'
consent does say no searches were conducted pursuant to it.

Ammonium nitrate, the Government could have put in
some evidence that ammonium nitrate has this odor that's been
referred to here instead of asking the Court to take judicial
notice, which we submit is improper.  The ammonium nitrate or
ammonia or fertilizer allegation is important to the warrant,
particularly when taken together with the attribution to
Mr. Nichols of bomb-building knowledge to which he had
admitted -- to which they said he had admitted.  After all,
what really happened was Mr. Nichols said that a farmer told
him about ammonium nitrate bombs.  Now, that's an entirely
innocent ammonium nitrate statement because as is clear in this
case, the use of ammonium nitrate fuel oil bombs for farming
purposes, as the Government will not deny, is quite routine.

Turning to the 23rd, Mr. Nichols' consent was
conditional.  Mrs. Nichols was told she had 45 minutes to go in
there and get her clothes.  The most she did was not to go in
the garage.  All the agents would give us is that she saw
agents in the garage because she stood at the door.  There is
no evidence that she was affirmatively told she was there to
satisfy this condition on the consent.

Pickup truck.  I did stand in front of the Court and
say that we would attack the pickup truck search, and we did.
The totality of circumstances make it important that we talk
about that truck being unavailable to Mr. Nichols and that
Ms. Dobson was unable to get into it.  More important, your
Honor, when they went in there the first time, they found an
address book that had Tim McVeigh's name in it.  That's
Mrs. Nichols' address book that had Mr. McVeigh's name in it.

The Government says we're not going to use that.  We
have ample other evidence that under the Longson test means
that we don't have to litigate the question of taint; but if
that pickup truck search is invalid, your Honor, and the Court
so holds, not only does it go to totality of circumstances, but
if at trial it turns out that the Government's bland assurances
about not relying on what they found in that pickup truck
aren't so, we'll be able to litigate it.

THE COURT:  Well, there isn't any observation from
that or reference to that in the subsequent affidavits, is
there?

MR. TIGAR:  That is correct, your Honor.  It does not
go to the invalidity of those affidavits to which I now turn.

Inevitable discovery.  The later searches, your Honor,
are worse than the earlier searches because those later
searches happen after the fuel meter has been seized.  The fuel
meter which -- to which such cosmic importance was attached in
the initial affidavit is put in a box, if the evidence is to be
credited, and sent on to Washington, D.C., without anybody
noticing that this supposedly significant piece of evidence
doesn't mean anything at all.

Moreover, in going for the search warrants for those
later searches, the agents used the information that they
obtained during the search on the 22nd and especially the 23rd.
Government Exhibit 46D, Mr. Hartzler's letter, recites that the
Government is still relying upon the search conducted on the
23rd at which they saw the guns and the video case and that
patterned quilt.

Therefore, that search on the 23rd absolutely knocks
out any claim of inevitable discovery because you simply can't
purge those searches of the taint.

I will not spend any time -- appreciable time dealing
with the question of Ms. Nichols' credibility.  Yes, she did
once say on a Government document that she was older than she
was so that she could get married and get out of the living
circumstances that she described in her direct examination.
Once she said that in order to get married, that birthdate
followed her.  So it isn't a lie that she made in order to get
into the country.  That's just complete nonsense.

And for the Government to say that these consents that
were obtained are voluntary in a contractual sense, knowing the
circumstances under which Mrs. Nichols was then having to live,
strikes us as simply incredible.  Yes, she said over and over,
I just wanted to cooperate, I just wanted to cooperate.  And
she coupled that at every turn with the assertion that if I did
so, maybe they would let me do what I told them I wanted, which
was to go home with my child, and if I couldn't go home to
Kansas, to go find my relatives, in conversations with whom --
and the Government knew this because they were tape recording a
lot of them -- she described herself as being shaken and scared
and alone and not knowing what to do.

Unless the Court has questions, that's all the
rebuttal that we have to offer.  We briefed this about as well
as we could.

THE COURT:  Rather thoroughly, yes.  Thank you.  All
right.  Well, the motion stands submitted.

Now, the -- next is to proceed on the 804(b)(3) issue,
and I guess we have this weighty decision about whether to go
forward with that now or take the break.

Mr. Jones, are you going -- who is going to argue
that?  Mr. Nigh?

MR. NIGH:  I'm going to argue it, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Do you have some estimate of what you
need?  I'm not trying to restrict it, but I'm thinking in terms
of this break.

MR. NIGH:  I think it might be appropriate to go ahead
and take the break now.  I would say 20 minutes.  It could take
a little bit longer.

THE COURT:  Yes.  And I'd rather go right from the
defense to the Government's rejoinder on that so -- and

Mr. Tigar, I don't -- you --

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Judge, we'll have maybe 10 minutes,
15 minutes.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  You don't -- I don't know quite
where your standing is on it, but I'll hear from you on it.

Okay.  Well, let's -- shall we say 1:15 or is that --
okay.  1:15.

PROCEEDINGS
(Reconvened at 1:15 p.m.)

THE COURT:  Please be seated.

Before calling for Mr. Nigh's argument, Mr. Mackey, we
ought to set a time for you to submit those affidavits or
whatever you're going to submit in connection with this Exhibit
W83.  Can you tell me when you'll have those ready?

MR. MACKEY:  What I'm anticipating, Judge, is seeking
affidavits from telephone company representatives themselves.

If I could have a couple weeks, and I'll do it faster assuming
they're available.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. MACKEY:  I've not made those phone calls yet.

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I know you've been here,
so -- but the sooner the better, obviously.

MR. MACKEY:  Understood.

THE COURT:  Okay.

All right, Mr. Nigh.  We're talking about 804(b)(3).
       DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON 804(b)(3) MOTION

MR. NIGH:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.

May it please the Court, this is not simply a question
where it can be said that the Government indicates that the
glass is half empty and on behalf of McVeigh we say that the
glass is half full and that both of us are right.  It is a
factual question that can be resolved by reference to Terry
Nichols' statements that are at issue.

The proof is in the statement itself as identified in
the FBI 302 and in Agent Smith's notes.  And an examination of
the statement, in the context of the narrative in which it was
given, or, in fact, sentence by sentence proves that each and
every part is facially innocent for Terry Nichols.  In fact,
your Honor, it was not even inculpatory enough to change Terry
Nichols' status from that of material witness for a period of
19 days or until May 9 of 1995.

The statement proves that it was designed to shift
responsibility to Tim McVeigh for every action that Terry
Nichols said that he took.  The statement reveals and the
circumstances of the statement show that Terry Nichols had a
reason for every -- absolutely everything that he wanted to
say, or in the words of the Government, he had made a
calculated decision to speak to the FBI.  In the words of Agent
Foley, he had a story to tell.

If light of those facts, your Honor, and in light of
the specifics of the statement, it simply cannot be said that
Terry Nichols perceived the statement to be against his penal
interests.

The Government has characterized portions of the
statement as, quote, core admissions, end quote.  But what the
Government fails to recognize or refuses to recognize is that
Terry Nichols didn't admit anything.  Throughout the course of
the nine-hour interview, he maintained his innocence and he
made sure that if there were any negative inferences to be
drawn, they would be drawn only against Tim McVeigh.

During the course of the statement, your Honor, that
part of the statement that the Government says is admissible
against Mr. McVeigh, Mr. Nichols mentioned Tim McVeigh 68
separate times, or if you calculate it on the basis of time,
about once every seven and a half minutes, and that doesn't
account for the breaks that were taken during the statement.

Viewed in the context of the narrative or as isolated
mini statements, Terry Nichols did not utter one sentence that
he thought was against his penal interest.

I think that everyone would agree, your Honor, that
the Government has two hurdles that it has to surpass in order
to have these hearsay statements admitted against Tim McVeigh.
First is that it must fit the statements into an exception to
the hearsay rule.  And the second, even if they can fit, it
must prove that the statements have inherent reliability or
indicia of reliability.

The Government cannot even meet the first hurdle and
force the statements into the confines of 804(b)(3).  The
reason is that the statements are not the squarely inculpatory
or strongly inculpatory statements that the rule requires and
that the Tenth Circuit in such cases as Earnest vs. Dorcy says
that the rule requires.

THE COURT:  Well, I suppose the strongest statement
that goes towards the -- against penal interest exception is to
put him in Oklahoma City in the company of the arrested suspect
on Easter Sunday.

MR. NIGH:  That is the --

THE COURT:  Now, why would that statement be offered
if it weren't true?

MR. NIGH:  That statement might be offered for several
reasons.  First of all, at the time the statement was made,

Terry Nichols knew that he had an unshakable alibi for
April 19.  He had nothing to fear from being in Oklahoma City
on April 16.

The second reason is that it could be an attempt to
curry favor with law enforcement officials by adopting their
theory concerning the case and attempting to place their
suspect in Oklahoma City three days before the bombing.

And finally, your Honor, it's quite possible that
Terry Nichols wanted law enforcement officers to think that he
was in Oklahoma City when he was somewhere else.

Finally, the problem with that, your Honor, is --

THE COURT:  I hesitate to ask too many questions about
some of these things because of sensitivity of dealing with
evidence before trial; but in the discovery materials, are
there observations from someone that corroborates that meeting
in Oklahoma City as -- on that Sunday as indicated in
Mr. Nichols' statement?

MR. NIGH:  Not one witness that I'm aware of, your
Honor, or not one piece of discovery would indicate that.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. NIGH:  The fourth problem with viewing the
statement like that as an isolated admission that I was in
Oklahoma City on April 16 with Tim McVeigh is that that's not
how the statement was made at all.  Consistently the Government
has tried to characterize this as some kind of a core admission
with a subsequent explanation, but that simply isn't what
happened.  And I think the FBI 302 makes this clear that that's
not what happened.

Terry Nichols went to the Herington Department of
Public Safety with a story to tell, and the story had a
beginning, middle, and an end.  And it was a narrative.  And it
flowed chronologically from beginning to end.  And he started
with events that occurred over two months prior to the time
that he was there.

During the course of that narrative, he said that he
was in Oklahoma City, but he also explained in great detail in
facially innocent terms why he was there.  And he did that from
the outset.  It was not an admission that he subsequently tried
to explain away.  And I think the context of it is critical in
the Court's assessments of the reliability of the evidence.

If I could turn back for a moment, your Honor, to the
provisions of 804(b)(3), the hearsay exception itself, I think
that the Supreme Court case law and the other case law, the
Tenth Circuit case law concerning the point make it clear that
a statement in order to be admissible under 804(b)(3) has to be
strongly inculpatory; and I think that link-in-the-chain-type
evidence -- in other words, the assertion that while it's not
facially incriminating, a statement or an admission that "I was
in Oklahoma City" might be incriminating when coupled with
other evidence -- the courts have consistently ruled that that
is not the kind of against penal interest statement that
804(b)(3) requires.  In fact, in United States vs. Shalin at
footnote 1, the court addresses that very problem and says that
link-in-the-chain type of evidence is insufficient for
804(b)(3) purposes.

The case law concerning 804(b)(3) also makes clear
that in order to be admissible like that, the arguably
inculpatory portion of the statement has to be severable from
the rest of the statement; and what I would cite for that
proposition, your Honor, is a case of United States vs. Lilly,
an Eighth Circuit decision that was cited with approval in
United States vs. Porter.  That case is in our brief.  But it's
at 881 F.2d 878.

Your Honor, the Government has insurmountable problems
in reference to each aspect of 804(b)(3).  First of all, the
Government admits that each of the statements that Terry
Nichols made was facially innocent by itself.  For example, in
the motion in limine and in the brief in support of the motion
in limine, the Government argued that thousands of people were
in the vicinity of the Murrah Building on the days before the
bombing for innocent reasons.

If you look at the cases that have addressed
804(b)(3), you find that the kind of squarely inculpatory
statements that are admissible and even some of the ones that
are not admissible are vastly different from the kinds of
statements that Terry Nichols made here.

For example, in Earnest vs. Dorcy, the kind of
statement there was that the declarant admitted to trying to
cut the victim's throat at a time when the declarant knew that
those wounds were the ones that were thought to have caused the
victim's death.

In Williamson vs. United States, the Supreme Court
described the declarant's statements and said that some of them
would be admissible under 804(b)(3).  Those that were
admissible would be the ones where the declarant said he was --
he knew that there was cocaine in the suitcase.  By virtue of
that statement, he would have forfeited his only defense to a
charge of cocaine possession.

In United States vs. Elkins, a Tenth Circuit decision,
the declarant stated that at the defendant's instruction he
took a shotgun and shoved it into the trunk through a stereo
speaker.  The Tenth Circuit ruled that that was inculpatory,
but the reason was because the declarant was on probation at
the time that he made the statement and by admitting that, he
admitted possession of an illegal firearm.

Perhaps one of the best cases that illustrates the
point is the case of Jennings vs. Mariner.  In that case, the
declarant stated that he specifically had told the defendant
which house to burglarize, had told him what he might find when
he burglarized the house, and he had given him instructions to
facilitate the crime's commission.  Each of those statements
inculpated the declarant as a principal in the crime.

But even those cases, your Honor, that have addressed
hearsay statements that were not admissible are much more
inculpatory than the statements that Terry Nichols made on
April 21 and 22.  For example, in Lee vs. Illinois, the
declarant's statements concerning premeditation to commit a
murder in reference to the defendant and his question to the
defendant whether she wanted to go through with the murder and
her response was that she did was inadmissible because it was
an attempt to shift responsibility.

In Williamson vs. United States, the declarant via the
Supreme Court looked at the other side of the coin and said
that although the declarant's statement that he knew there was
cocaine in the suitcase might be admissible, his additional
statement that he was transporting the cocaine for the
defendant would not be admissible because it was an attempt to
shift blame.

In United States vs. Sherlin, the Tenth Circuit
decision, the defendant -- the declarant's statements that they
were present with the defendant and that the defendant was
extremely intoxicated, thus making it more likely that they
themselves committed the crime, was insufficient for 804(b)(3)
purposes.

The bottom line from all these cases, your Honor, is
there is not one single case in which statements have been
admitted as against penal interest unless the declarant
actually admitted the commission of a crime.

Terry Nichols didn't admit anything, let alone the
commission of a crime.  He didn't admit knowledge of commission
of a crime.

The statements were not inculpatory, they were not
facially incriminating, and they were not severable.

If I could now, your Honor, turn to the liability
inquiry, assuming they could be forced into the provisions of
804(b)(3).  There are general principles that guide the
inquiry.  And I won't spend a lot of time on them, but
statements of this kind are presumptively unreliable; and it is
the Government that bears the burden of overcoming the
presumption through indicia of reliability or particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness.

Another important factor in the reliability
determination is the consideration that adversarial testing
would add little to the statements' reliability.  In other
words, cross-examination wouldn't do any good.

I think in this case it's clear that Timothy McVeigh
would have a very critical interest in cross-examining Terry
Nichols about these statements which concern McVeigh.

Finally, attempts to shift blame to other people are
inherently unreliable, as the court has often found.  Lee is
the best example of that.

In the most recent pleading, the post-hearing
pleading, the Government argues that Mr. Nichols did not
attempt to shift blame to Timothy McVeigh.  It is difficult for
us to understand how such an assertion can be made in light of
the FBI 302 describing the statement.  The statement makes
clear that Mr. Nichols attempted to blame Timothy McVeigh for
absolutely everything that he did.

He attempted to blame Mr. McVeigh for deception to his
wife.

He attempted to blame Mr. McVeigh for Nichols' trip
that he says he took to Oklahoma City.

He attempted to blame Mr. McVeigh for failing to tell
anyone he was going to Oklahoma City.

He attempted to blame McVeigh for knowing how to get
around in Oklahoma City.

He attempted to blame McVeigh for his proximity to the
Murrah Building on April 16.

He attempted to blame McVeigh for his purchase of
diesel fuel for his truck, because McVeigh made him go to
Oklahoma City.

He attempted to blame McVeigh for the use of
Mr. Nichols' truck on April 18, 1995, and he attempted to blame
McVeigh for Mr. Nichols' stated presence in his storage shed on
April 20; and he attempted to blame McVeigh for possessions in
Mr. Nichols' garage.

Now, some of these statements have to be viewed in the
context and the timing in which they were made.  Mr. Nichols
did not say that he had loaned Mr. McVeigh's his pickup truck
on April 18 until after he had been made aware that his pickup
truck was going to be searched.  And by virtue of that
statement, if anything was found, Mr. Nichols could blame it on
Mr. McVeigh.

In reference to the storage shed and his presence in
the storage shed and items that must be found in Mr. Nichols'
garage, he did not make those statements until after he had
been informed at 4:34 p.m. in the afternoon on April 21 that
his garage or his house was going to be searched and he had
signed a consent for that search.

In light of that, he knew that he could blame his own
presence if he was there in a storage shed on April 20 on
Mr. McVeigh and he could blame any item found in his garage on
Mr. McVeigh.

Mr. Nichols' attempts to blame Mr. McVeigh did not
stop on April 21.  The next day he continued to do so; and I
would refer the Court to paragraph 8 of the April 22, 1995 FBI
302, where Nichols continued to blame Mr. McVeigh.  I won't
make a specific reference to it because I don't believe there
has been any evidence about it, but it shows the state of mind
Mr. Nichols had at the time he was making the statements.

I would like to come back, if I can, for a moment to
the Government's assertion that there was some kind of core
admissions.  The problem or one of the problems presented by
the argument in the Government's three identified areas of core
admissions is how the statements can be rewritten in order to
fit into those descriptions.  In the most recent filing, the
Government described the first admission in reference to the
trip to Oklahoma City as, quote, Nichols' admission that he
drove McVeigh from Oklahoma City to Kansas on April 16, 1995.

The obvious question is what are we going to do with
that half of the statement where Mr. Nichols describes how he
got to Oklahoma City in the first place and his rationale for
being there.

We would have to selectively begin in the middle in
order to call this a core admission.  And the problem -- the
context problem that exists by virtue of that is that the
Government says it will not oppose Mr. Nichols' attempts to put
the statements in context.  The Government argues, well, that's
all right because we won't be offering them for the truth of
the matter asserted.

The critical problem is that Mr. Nichols gets to offer
them for the truth of the matter asserted and Mr. McVeigh gets
denied his opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Nichols about them.
And it would be impossible to instruct the jury that some of
the statements are admitted for truth, if they're consistent
with the Government's theory but the rest of the statements are
not admitted for truth, if they're consistent with Mr. Nichols'
interests.  And it would be a practical impossibility to do
that.

The second category the Government describes as
Nichols' admission that he met again with McVeigh on April 18.
That's not what Mr. Nichols said.  What Mr. Nichols said was
that he loaned Mr. McVeigh his truck on April 18 and in the
process of doing that, your Honor, if anything incriminating
was found in it his truck, he could blame it on Mr. McVeigh
but, perhaps equally importantly, establish an alibi for
himself on April 18 by saying that he was at the auction and he
put Mr. McVeigh in his pick up truck alone for a large portion
of the day on April 18.

Pardon me.

Finally, the Government's third core admission is,
quote, "Nichols' admission that he cleaned out a storage locker
for McVeigh on April 20," end quote.  And I would submit, your
Honor, that that is not an admission at all.  That is simply
Terry Nichols' blaming Tim McVeigh for something that Terry
Nichols did and blaming Tim McVeigh for the presence of
particular items in Terry Nichols' home.

Your Honor, there is not one case that can be cited
where statements of this kind have be admitted into evidence as
substantive evidence against a defendant.  The closest the

Government can come is the hypothetical -- the hypothetical
posed by the Supreme Court in dicta in Williamson vs. United 
States, and that is the Sam and Joe hypothetical.  "Sam and I
went to Joe's house" might be against declarant's penal
interest if a reasonable person in the declarant's shoes would
realize that being linked to Joe and Sam would implicate the
declarant in Joe and Sam's conspiracy.

First of all, I point out, your Honor, that those
clearly are not the facts of the Williamson case and is a
hypothetical designed to address some of Judge Kennedy's
concerns.  But furthermore, your Honor, the hypothetical just
doesn't fit the facts of Terry Nichols' statements.  In order
for the hypothetical to fit, we have to rewrite the
hypothetical, as well; and we could do it this way:  We could
say that the declarant knew that Sam and Joe had been charged
with conspiracy to commit a crime and that the declarant went
to the police station voluntarily and told the police, You
know, about three weeks ago, Sam told me to come by his house
and pick up my television set.  Well, the other day I decided
that I'd go do that.  I didn't have a ride, so I called Joe.
Joe gave me a ride over to Sam's house and I picked up my TV.
Now, while I was there, they didn't talk about a crime, I
didn't see any evidence of a crime, they didn't tell me they
were going to commit a crime and I don't know anything about
it.

That is parallel to Terry Nichols' statement, your
Honor, and the Supreme Court would not rule that it's against
penal interest.

In the most recent filing, your Honor, the Government
argues that even if the statements are not strongly inculpatory
against Terry Nichols, neither are they strongly inculpatory
against Tim McVeigh.  Well, whether or not that's true remains
to be seen and I think will be seen at the time of trial.  But
beyond that, it is completely irrelevant for an 804(b)(3)
analysis.  The Court has never ruled that statements are
admissible by virtue of the fact that they implicate the
defendant only a little bit.

It is also an incredible stretch to suggest that the
statements inculpated both defendants equally.  Nichols'
statements always put an innocent spin on the things that he
did while leaving open the door for an improper purpose for the
things that Mr. McVeigh did.

Finally, your Honor -- or perhaps not finally but
almost finally, the Government argues that Terry Nichols tried
to exculpate Timothy McVeigh and they say that Mr. Nichols
provided innocent explanations for the things that Mr. McVeigh
did.  A simple reading of statements, your Honor, proves that
what Mr. Nichols was trying to do was provide an innocent
explanation for everything that he did.  He in no way intended
to benefit Tim McVeigh; and even if he did, I would submit that
Tim McVeigh did not need that kind of help.

Finally, your Honor, in support of the reliability of
the statements, the Government argues that the amount of detail
contained within the statements lends credence to their
reliability.  I would concur that the statements have a great
deal of detail; but I would say that it's equally true that the
first half of the statement has a great degree of detail and if
detail was the question for 804(b)(3) analysis or confrontation
clause analysis, that each and every one of Mr. Nichols'
statements would be admissible, including the entire first half
of the narrative.

Earnest vs. Dorcy simply does not hold that.

Your Honor, I would submit that the proof is in the
statements themselves; and the statements prove that not one
statement did Terry Nichols perceive to be against his penal
interest.  The presumption that these statements are unreliable
remains unrebutted, and the Court should rule that not one of
them is admissible against Tim McVeigh.

Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Thurschwell, you have
here, of course, a different situation as far as admissibility
of these statements -- I mean apart from the suppression as the
statements of Mr. Nichols admissible against him.

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON 085(B)(3) MOTION

MR. THURSCHWELL:  We are, your Honor; and there is no
argument that the statements in question here are admissible
against Mr. McVeigh under the party opponent exception.

THE COURT:  You mean against Mr. Nichols.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Against Mr. Nichols.  I'm sorry.

We are, to respond to your comment before the break --
I think Mr. Nichols has classic Article III standing in the
sense that he has a direct personal stake insofar as the issue
of the controversy concerned here directly impacts his ability
to get the severance that he would be seeking shortly.  We --
given that our position -- if this case -- if this -- sorry.
If Mr. Nichols were taking a position contrary to
Mr. McVeigh's, this would be a different case.  But given the
fact that our position is generally consistent with
Mr. McVeigh's, I think that there is ample reason for the Court
to hear --

THE COURT:  Well, I'll go ahead.  I won't quibble
about your standing to make the argument.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Thank you, your Honor.

I will -- I want to address the merits in a moment;
but initially, there are a couple of considerations that I
think the Court should consider that were not discussed by
Mr. Nigh.  In a real sense, the motion insofar as it seeks
admissibility of these statements, of a ruling admitting these
statements against Mr. McVeigh is premature and hypothetical.
It is premature in that one of the prerequisites for admission
under 804(b)(3) is the unavailability under 804(a) of the
declarant, Mr. Nichols.  And Mr. Nichols has not decided at
this time whether he will, in fact, be unavailable at time of
trial.  Therefore, the --

THE COURT:  Well, we wouldn't know that even if we
were in trial in the Government's case.  There may be an
indication one way or the another, but he doesn't have to make
a decision like that, of course, till the Government has
rested.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  That is correct, your Honor.  While
that -- that is correct and in fact, United States vs. Hill
stands for the proposition that regardless of the consequences
to the Government's case, a defendant may choose even in --
apparently in bad faith to declare that he will be available
before trial, change his mind at trial, and the Government
finds itself in a situation where the conviction can't
established under Bruton.

THE COURT:  So how could it be considered premature
here since, you know, he doesn't have to tell us until the
Government has put on its case?

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, it is premature only
insofar as the Court would rule in favor of the Government.  To
the extent that the Court makes the finding that the other
prerequisites of 804(b)(3) are not met, then the motion can be
denied at that time.

But there is -- there is some dicta in Seventh Circuit
opinion, United States vs. Meyers, to the effect that the
Government, if it can make a sufficient showing during its case
in chief that the defendant will be unavailable, it will be
allowed to admit statements at that time.

That's --

THE COURT:  I mean if I were to exclude it now,
exclude these statements and if we had a joint trial and if
Mr. Nichols testified obviously we'd have a different posture
and they would have rebuttal; so, you know --

MR. THURSCHWELL:  That is correct, your Honor.

Let me move on to the hypothetical aspects of this.
There is -- admitted in evidence at the suppression hearing was
the notes of the statement given by Mr. Nichols and as I
understand the Government's position, it is seeking the
specific and particularized evaluation of the statements it
seeks to admit under Williamson based on those notes of the
Agent Smith.

THE COURT:  And you know, we're going to have to take
that for now, even though the testimony of the agents
concerning the statements would be the evidence that we're
talking about, not what's in the 302; but I think I have to
assume that the testimony would be consistent with the 302 and
that 302's are really submitted as an offer of proof that the
testimony would be as recited there.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  That is correct -- that is the
posture of the case at this time, your Honor.  We would just
point out that Williamson really requires a nuance evaluation
of the statements in question to make the findings that it
requires.  And I will come back to that in a moment when I
discuss the merits.  It is far from clear that that nuanced
evaluation could be made on the basis of abbreviated notes made
by an agent that are not explicated at a minimum by his
testimony explaining exactly what it is that Mr. Nichols said
and is the way that he said it, because those issues are
directly relevant to the Williamson -- the Williamson
evaluation.

THE COURT:  So what would we do?  Make him put on the
actual testimony before trial --

MR. THURSCHWELL:  I believe you could.  Your Honor,
what I expected was some development of that -- of those
specific statements that the Government would seek to admit
which are already in the public record during the suppression
hearing.  It was my understanding that that was part of the
purpose.  The burden is on the Government as the proponent of
the declaration under hearsay exception to demonstrate that all
the requirements of that exception are met.  That was not done
during the suppression hearing.  It could be done in a voir 
dire at trial, immediately before trial.  The point is that on
this record, it's far from clear that the record itself is
clear enough to make the very detailed circumstantial and
specific findings required by Williamson.

That said, let me move on.

THE COURT:  Well, you wouldn't have any problem if I
excluded them on the basis of this proffer, would you?

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, I think you could
exclude them on the basis of the circumstances surrounding the
making of the statement which Williamson makes directly
relevant.  Those were adduced at the hearing.  There is a
sufficient record to find that the circumstances were such that
a reasonable person would not have made these statements,
believing them to be true.

On that basis, there is a basis for -- for not -- for
denying the motion.

So in essence, your Honor, because the Government did
not develop the record, the posture of the case is such that
they are left without the findings, I think -- the ability for
the Court to make the findings necessary to have the exception,
have the statement admitted under the exception.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't know that the Government
should be faulted in some way here.  It's my recollection when
we discussed procedures here that we were going to proceed just
as we did; that the 302's were going to be considered as the
offer and that we wouldn't therefore put into the public record
the actual testimony about the statements since if they were
going to be suppressed, you know, the public and potentially
the jurors would not know of them.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, I don't want to be --

THE COURT:  And that seemed to me to be a reasonable
way for us to proceed to contain and cabin the evidence that
may never see the light of day at trial.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, I don't want to belabor
the point.  My understanding was that -- was that agreement
went to the facts of the statement not previously made public
by the Government's own filings and the specific facts that
they seek to admit are in the public record.  And my
understanding was that they would be elucidated for purposes of
the 804(b)(3) standard.

That said, your Honor, with your permission, I'll move
on to the merits.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  With respect to the merits, it's
important to keep in mind when evaluating admissibility under
the hearsay exception the confrontation clause values that are
served by the exception.  And I think one way of characterizing
the error that the Government makes in its arguments is that it
fails sufficiently to read the hearsay exception in terms of
those confrontation clause values, those values that are best
stated, I think in Idaho vs. Wright, which require sufficient
inherent trustworthiness of the declaration such that
adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.

In other words, there would have to be such inherent
trustworthiness in the statement itself that the hearsay
exception -- under the hearsay exception, the statement carries
its own -- own reliability.

The hearsay exceptions serve that value by setting
forth in a specific and rule-like manner the general situations
in which the general value represented by the confrontation
clause is served.  804(b)(3) serves that value, seeks to serve
that value by relying on the common sense notion that where
statements are sufficiently against the penal interests of the
declarant and genuinely against the penal interests, then such
a statement would not lightly be made because people do not
make statements that can cause them to suffer serious
detrimental consequences.

That is the rationale expressed by Williamson.  I
think there is no debate that that is the value served by the
rule; but what is lost in the Government's understanding is
that this basis for admission implies that the declarant have a
mental state that is conscious -- sufficiently conscious of the
possibility of significant penal consequences that the
statement can be relied upon; that it would not be -- that it
would not be said unless the person believed it to be true at
the time.

And that understanding, as Mr. Nigh points out, was
recently strongly reaffirmed in earnest of the underlying
value.

The consequences for Mr. Nichols' alleged statements
are significant here because they, as Mr. Nigh pointed out, do
not on their face in any way represent the kind of significant
inculpation that individuals making those kinds of statements
would expect to lead to serious detrimental penal consequences.
And that point again has been made by Mr. Nigh.

I would only add -- and I would also add that the
facts at the hearing support the finding that I suggested
before, that in making these statements, Mr. Nichols was not
motivated by a mental state that represents consciousness of
guilt.  His actions, as we discuss in our most recent brief,
were the actions of a person who strongly and genuinely
believed in his own innocence.  A person who strongly and
genuinely believes in their own innocence at the time they are
making the statements sought to be admitted is not a person who
meets the qualifications of a declarant under 804(b)(3).

The Government's response to this is that the Supreme
Court in Williamson recognized that statements that in fact are
facially neutral can suffice under 804(b)(3) for admission if
the circumstances are such that they meet the requirement.  And
the qualification is the critical point with respect to that
Government assertion and it's the point that the Government
tends to lose sight of.

An individual who makes self -- even strongly
self-inculpatory statements may not be motivated by the kind of
consciousness of guilt that is -- serves the value of the
confrontation clause; i.e. he may not be making the statement
out of a sense that he wants to get something off his chest, he
wants to be truthful, he is aware of the penal consequences
that would come down on him as a result of his making that
statement.  And there are circumstances in which even strongly
self-inculpatory statements do not meet the rule.

And this, in fact, is a part of the test under
804(b)(3).  Williamson strongly reaffirms that in the context
of the very statements that the Government points to as
examples of neutral statements, the "Sam and I went to Joe's
house" example.  And the clear import of the Supreme Court's
decision there is that given the correct circumstances, such
neutral statements may be admissible.

What are those circumstances?  Let me just give you a
couple of hypotheticals to explore the Government's position:
The declarant says to a friend, "Sam and I went to Joe's house
that morning, but Joe and Sam were the ones who actually robbed
the bank."  Not entirely clear, but I think there is a
reasonable argument under Williamson that the assertion "Sam
and I went to Joe's house that morning" might very well be
against the penal interest of the declarant such that the
statement could be admitted.

Same statement:  "Sam and I went to Joe's house that
morning but Joe and Sam were the ones who actually robbed the
bank" said to a police officer might be inculpatory under the
rule, might not.  You'd need to know several things.  One of
them is the specific context in the sense that was it said to a
police officer after a custodial arrest, for example, or even a
Terry stop.

THE COURT:  And an allegation of conspiracy.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  And an allegation of conspiracy.
Thank you, your Honor.

An additional point is not just an allegation of
conspiracy, but knowledge on the part of the declarant of the
law of complicity and the law of conspiracy such that he would
be actually aware that these kinds of statements would make him
subject to criminal liability because absent those -- that
condition, that legal knowledge, if you will, the conditions
for the rule aren't met.

Third hypothetical:  Statement said -- the same
statement:  "Sam and I went to Joe's house that morning but Joe
and Sam were the ones who actually robbed the bank," said to a
police officer where the declarant has some knowledge or strong
suspicion that the police are aware of his possible involvement
with Sam and Joe in some illegal activity:  In that case, I
think it's -- the courts -- the cases that have decided these
kinds of issues in other contexts -- would strongly hold that
that is not against his penal interest in the sense that one
cannot be sure that that statement is made with the required
consciousness of guilt and absence of deception for self-
serving purposes.

That is exactly the case here, that third
hypothetical; and I would emphasize, your Honor, that the Court
does not need to find as fact that Mr. Nichols' statements were
unreliable; that he was deliberately placing blame on anyone
else, as Mr. Nigh has suggested.  That is not the rule under
both the confrontation clause and the exception for -- against
penal interest.  The rule is an objective test.  What would a
reasonable person in the particular circumstances of the
declarant be doing.  That's the test of reliability.

But here, the Government's claim stated most
forthrightly in its initial motion in limine is that
Mr. Nichols' statements here inculpate Mr. Nichols by linking
him, in quote -- linking him to Mr. McVeigh.  The whole reason
Mr. Nichols appeared at the station was that he heard reports
on the radio and later on television that linked him to
Mr. McVeigh.  He is in the position of the person in the third
hypothetical.  He does not have -- the reasonable person in his
position would not be -- have -- one cannot be certain that a
reasonable person in his position is making the disclosures
that he is making out of the truthful impulse and awareness
that possible consequences will flow to him because he is
already in the position where those possible consequences could
flow to him whether he makes the statement or not.  The
Government in its briefs recognizes this analysis but thinks
that it's limited to cases in which the declarant is caught
red-handed.  But that is incorrect.  The classic instance of
this situation is where a defendant, as the one in Williamson,
is caught with cocaine in their possession and then implicates
someone else, admitting to involvement with the cocaine that
was already in their possession along the way.  But it's
perfectly clear that the basis for not admitting the additional
statements and even under -- according to four justices in
Williamson not admitting the statement that admits -- admits
possession of the cocaine itself is that those statements do
not inculpate the defendant because a reasonable person in the
declarant's position would not necessarily be making those
statements out of this impulse to truthfulness.

That is the case here; and there is no distinction in
this situation, although it occurs at a far, far lower level of
inculpation than the cocaine possession cases and, of course,
that's an independent ground for dismissing the motion.  The
statements even as alleged do not amount to the kind of
inculpation that the Supreme Court or any of the other courts
that have discussed 804(b)(3) have in mind.

But that is the situation here.

Just very quickly, your Honor, I just raise one more
issue that Mr. Nigh didn't discuss.  The March 15 letter raises
several other bases for admission of the statements against --
it's not entirely clear but against Mr. McVeigh and possibly
Mr. Nichols as well; and I just would point out that not only
are these generally premature but that the Government is
playing fast and loose with a number of the hearsay rules in
them.  Also, in particular, of primary significance, I'd refer
the Judge, you, to page 5 of the March 15 letter at the bottom
of the page in connection with the third statement that the
Government seeks to admit against Mr. Nichols.

THE COURT:  Page 5, did you say?

MR. THURSCHWELL:  Yeah.  Of the letter itself.  The
Government suggests that it would offer a particular statement
made by -- allegedly made by Mr. Nichols under Federal Rule of
Evidence 801(c), assertedly not for the truth of the matter
asserted but to show the state of mind with which he performed
that act.

Your Honor, 801(c) does not cover that case.  This is
a classic instance discussed in the advisory committee note
under 803(3) of a presence -- a present mental state
representing a memory or past recollection.  That evidence
tending to show such a thing is evidence of the truth of the
matter asserted.  There are numerous other instances of that
type here.

I would just alert the Court that the Government --
Government's suggestion should not be followed at this time, at
least without further chance for us to rebut.

THE COURT:  Yes, well, you know, I'm not, in this
motion, considering admissibility against Mr. Nichols of his
own statements and objections that might be made to particular
statements.

MR. THURSCHWELL:  I understand that, your Honor, and
speaking, I suppose, as a friend of the Court in this -- in
this context, the same argument would apply with respect to
Mr. McVeigh as to that 801(c) argument against.

THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Connelly, is this your
area, also?

PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON 804(B)(3) MOTION

MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.

The first question before the Court under Rule 804,
the question conceded by Mr. McVeigh but challenged now by
Mr. Nichols, who again we would urge does not have standing and
who said that I'm just going to make the arguments Mr. McVeigh
makes but went beyond it in this respect because Mr. McVeigh
conceded it, is that the declarant be unavailable.  The
declarant is unavailable under Rule 804(a)(1) --

THE COURT:  I'm not worrying about that.

MR. CONNELLY:  Okay.  So we would submit that that's
clearly been satisfied.

The real question then becomes whether it satisfies
the prerequisites of 804(b)(3) and in the language of that rule
whether it so far tended to be -- to incriminate the declarant
that a reasonable person would not have made it were it not
true.  And I think the Court asked Mr. Nigh at the very outset
of his argument why in the world would Terry Nichols have said,
I was in Oklahoma City three days before the bombing with the
alleged bomber and suspected bomber, the person he knew was
becoming in police custody or FBI custody at that very time --
why would he make that up were it not true?  And I think there
is no answer as -- no credible answer as to why a declarant in
Mr. Nichols' shoes on April 21, being interviewed by the FBI,
would lie about being in Oklahoma City with the person he knew
was being arrested in connection with the bombing.

THE COURT:  But you see, here's a big problem, and
that is the Government believes some of what he says and
strongly disbelieves others.  Take this statement about Easter
Sunday.  It strongly urges he is telling the truth when he says
he was in Oklahoma City, disbelieves why he was there.

MR. CONNELLY:  And I think that's --

THE COURT:  And that presents a problem about the
credibility of the statements which has to be determined, the
statement has to be credible and against penal interest; and of
course whether he answers to what he might be talking about
this is that he has some suspicion that somebody has seen or
that the Government has some information that links him and
that's why his name is on television and so forth.

MR. CONNELLY:  I agree entirely with that, and that
just confirms the truthfulness of it.  Why would he say it if
it weren't true -- or why would he say it?  Because he thinks
perhaps the Government has some surveillance cameras or
witnesses that see him at the time.  I think that --

THE COURT:  And he wants to explain it away on
innocent grounds.

MR. CONNELLY:  And I think to explain it away on
innocent grounds is not credible and is not a declaration
against interest.

THE COURT:  Well, and that's very difficult then to
say, well, pieces of this statement are admissible against
penal interest and pieces aren't because they're lies and
they're exculpatory lies; and I have a lot of trouble with
that.

MR. CONNELLY:  I don't disagree it's difficult, your
Honor.  I think that's the task the Supreme Court has assigned
this court and others in Williamson.  It says you have to look
statement by statement.  And it says one of the most effective
ways to lie is to mix truth with falsehood, and it's for that
reason have you to look statement by statement.

THE COURT:  And Justice Ginsburg herself and three
others say don't admit any of it.

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, I don't know if that's true,
because I think in that --

THE COURT:  Well, that's what she said.

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, no, I think she joined in part
2(b), your Honor.  In Part 2(b) of the opinion where the court
said that one of the most effective ways to lie -- and you have
to go statement by statement and you have to look and determine
whether each statement is against the defendant's interest and
specifically the hypothetical that even statements that are
neutral on their face may be against a defendant's interest --
it's Part 2(b) of the opinion -- Justice Ginsburg and the other
four justices joined in that and formed a majority of six
justices.  And the dissenting judges thought that that reading
was too restrictive.  So all nine justices, I think it's fair
to say, said that you can look statement by statement -- well,
I'm sorry -- six of the justices said you have to look
statement by statement.  Justice Kennedy in his dissent would
have gone further and said if some of it is self-inculpatory,
then you can admit it all under the right circumstances.

And so -- but I think the point is Justice Ginsburg --
I don't think what we're saying is inconsistent with Justice
Ginsburg.  I think the dispute there was on those particular
facts, is a particular statement admissible.  But even Justice
Ginsburg, I think, recognized that even custodial statements
implicating another can under appropriate circumstances be
admissible; and so I don't think anything we're saying is
inconsistent with Justice Ginsburg.  In fact, she joined in the
parts the of the opinion that we are urging upon the Court.

THE COURT:  Well, you agree that we have more to do
here than just look at 804(b)(3); that we do have a Sixth
Amendment and a confrontation clause concern?

MR. CONNELLY:  I agree.  And I think the analysis
under both is very close; and I think the Supreme Court in
Williamson, taking a more restrictive view of 804(b)(3) than
some courts before it had and that Justice Kennedy and the
other two dissenters argued they should do, went a long way to
satisfying that.  I think Justice O'Connor in her
concurrence -- she was also the majority opinion writer for the
court -- said it would go a long way if you apply a careful
statement-by-statement analysis.

But I think -- so I think under 804(b)(3) the question
is and the only question is did this particular statement so
far tend to incriminate the defendant that a reasonable person
would not have made it up.  And I think there is no good
answer, and I appreciate the Court's concern about the gloss he
puts on it after having admitted that yes, I'm in Oklahoma City
with the suspected bomber three days before the bombing.  There
is no answer as to why somebody would falsely make that up --
falsely make it up.  Why he said it is perhaps he thought that,
in fact, there were witnesses that could pin him down there
with that; but there is no good answer as to why he would
falsely make that up.  In no way does that help Mr. Nichols,
having put himself there.

Now, having put himself there certainly does help him
by saying, well, I was there for an innocent reason.  We
weren't there to plan a bombing.  We were there for -- because
Mr. McVeigh had called me up and said, I'm coming across -- I
don't know how much you want to get into this.  I think this is
not really hurtful to the defendants, but I think it's
important to look at the context.

But my point would be that Mr. Nichols' explanation
for why he went there also gave an innocent explanation as to
why Mr. McVeigh was there and in fact said Mr. McVeigh was
heading back East.  On his way from west to east, he broke down
there, had my TV, and wanted to head back East to visit his
relatives.  I think in terms of pinning blame -- and I think
that's a key part of the analysis under the Sixth Amendment and
in Earnest -- is there a reason for this declarant, Mr. Nichols
in this case, to try to curry favor with the authorities or
shift blame.  This is not a case of blame shifting on that
statement in any way.  It's not that he said, well,
Mr. McVeigh, you know, was there to discuss the bombing and I
said I didn't want to do it or it's not that he gave --

THE COURT:  Well, you're going to argue -- if these
statements are in, you're going to argue that the falsity is
evidence of a consciousness of guilt.  Right?

MR. CONNELLY:  Well, I don't think -- I think we're
going to argue that it's false and whether it's not -- we're
going to have to prove it's false; and I think the fact that he
made false statements is only helpful if we can prove it's
false.  I don't think the statements in themselves help prove
they're false; although in a sense, I mean, to the extent
they're incredible on their face, they would lend support for
that.  But yes in terms as to Mr. Nichols.  But in terms of
they don't incriminate Mr. McVeigh, his explanations for
them -- and I think there is -- I understand the Court's
problem --

THE COURT:  Why would he be seeking to exculpate
Mr. McVeigh unless there was some complicity?  I mean, I can
see that argument being made if this is a part of the evidence.

MR. CONNELLY:  Well -- and that may well be the case.
But in terms of an analysis under the Sixth Amendment, was he
trying to shift blame -- and I think that's the question.  It's
not why was he trying to help Mr. McVeigh.  It's was he trying
to blame him.  And I don't think that these statements in any
way are shifting blame to Mr. McVeigh.  And I think that is the
proper Sixth Amendment analysis.  When you go beyond the 804
argument in terms of these statements are against his interest,
then you go broader than that in terms of Sixth Amendment, is
there anything about the circumstances of the interview that
would render them suspect.

In Earnest, the court said that there was nothing,
there was no indication that he was being offered a deal.
Well, in Earnest, in fact, there was indication that the
defendant, the declarant, hoped for a deal.  He said, I was
hoping to obtain a deal; and the court said, well, that's not
enough because they ruled out a deal.

Well, here it's an even stronger case in that
circumstance.  There's no suggestion in the record and any fair
inference in the record that Mr. Nichols was in there saying, I
want to cut a deal and give you up Tim McVeigh.  There was no
blame shifting, no currying favor; and in fact his statements
about Mr. McVeigh are far less prejudicial to McVeigh and far
more exculpatory to McVeigh than the statement in Earnest where
the declarant Bodlin said, I slit the victim's throat but
Earnest shot him.  And that by itself is a powerful -- in fact,
maybe the only real evidence of guilt in Earnest, because
before that statement came in, there was a real question about
sufficiency of evidence.

So in terms of the impact and the threat to Sixth
Amendment values, we would submit that it's far greater in the
Earnest case than it is here.

The real question, I think, has to be twofold; and
first is was this statement so far against his interests that
he wouldn't make it up; and the argument that Mr. Nigh has
advanced here is that, well, not really, because on its face,
it's not -- it really doesn't prove anything.

The Supreme Court's opinion in Williamson is squarely
contrary to that in which they said -- this was Part 2(b), and
it was joined in by six justices, and the three dissenters
would have gone even further, so I think you can take the word
of the nine justices of the Supreme Court -- is that even
statements that are neutral on their face may be against the
declarant's interest if in the circumstance of the case they
would tend to subject him to criminal liability.

And that's where they gave their Joe and Sam
hypothetical, and I think we've repeated that enough in our
briefs.  But I think that is not meaningfully distinguishable
from this case; and I think the point is would Nichols have
recognized on April 21 that being linked to McVeigh in Oklahoma
City three days before the bombing was against his interests
such that he would not lie about it were it not true.  I think
the answer is yes.  And then we come to the next question,
which I think the Court is having the most trouble with, and
that is, well, how can you say that's true, yet say his
explanation for it is not.

And I think that's exactly what -- and I think it is a
difficult job, and I think it is something that the Supreme
Court in Williamson said that trial courts are best suited to
do; that you have to parse through the statement, the overall
statement, and go statement by statement and say is there
reason for believing that he was in Oklahoma City with McVeigh.
And I would say yes because he wouldn't lie about that.

Now, having admitted that, is there a reason to
believe that, you know, I was really there for an innocent
purpose?  Well, that's not self-inculpatory, and so that does
not come in under 804(b)(3).  We have made clear to the Court
and to the defense that we are not trying to keep that part
out.  For context, that can certainly be brought out and they
can argue that, and Mr. McVeigh would have standing to complain
if that somehow prejudiced him.  But it doesn't because, No. 1,
the Government is not introducing it for its truth and will not
argue that that -- those further statements that gloss on the
core admission somehow prove McVeigh's guilt and, No. 2, it
really doesn't prove McVeigh's guilt.  It gives McVeigh an
equally innocent explanation for being there.

So we would submit that under Williamson, it is a
difficult burden, but it is no longer the rule of law that you
can just look at the whole statement and say it all comes in or
it all doesn't come in.  In fact, even prior to Williamson, the
Tenth Circuit in Porter said you have to look at the statement
and put in the disserving parts and throw out the self-serving
parts.

Well, we're not trying to keep out the self-serving
parts, although we're not affirmatively trying to introduce
them.  We're saying it can all come in, but what we're asking
the Court to do is put in the disserving aspects of
Mr. Nichols' statements because there is no reason for
believing that he would have falsely made them up.

There is just one other point on corroboration.  The
Court asked a question is there anything proving that, and I
don't want to get into the evidence; and Mr. Nigh was correct
that there is nothing independently proving he was or -- there
are no witnesses seeing him there, but there is corroboration
there.  There's corroboration that we would be prepared to
offer, if the Court wanted in a 104 hearing, in terms of other
people he made the statements to and --

THE COURT:  I'm talking about visual observations.

MR. CONNELLY:  That is correct, no visual observation.
But the point as a matter of law on that -- and it's recognized
in Earnest and Idaho vs. Wright -- is the analysis has to be on
the statement itself and not external corroboration, whether
it's true or not.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. CONNELLY:  So as a matter of law, it's not
necessary.  But there is corroboration in the sense of him
having made similar statements contemporaneously with some
differences.  And I don't want to go into all that, but there
is in terms of that type of corroboration, although it's not
necessary, we would submit, under the law.

Thank you.

THE COURT:  Mr. Nigh, do you have any --

MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I'm going to close for
Mr. McVeigh.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. JONES:  With the Court's permission.

May it please the Court.

THE COURT:  Mr. Jones.

DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON 804(B)(3) MOTION

MR. JONES:  I think that it's a fair statement that
all of the counsel and parties in this case know that the
Court's central inquiry is on the first of the -- first of the
three so-called core admissions that the Government wishes to
introduce.  The statement that "I loaned Mr. McVeigh my pickup
truck," a statement made after he knew that the Government was
going to search that truck or at least attempting to search
that truck certainly belies any idea that that was an
inculpating statement.  They clearly were self-serving.

And likewise, the statement that "I cleaned out items
at the storage unit at the request of Mr. McVeigh" was made
only after he knew that the Government was interested in
searching this house where those items might be found or at
least he might think they would be found.

And the Court has not raised questions about those, so
I'm not going to address them.  I am going to address,
though -- and I hope show the Court a very good reason,
actually several reasons, why Mr. Nichols would lie about being
in Oklahoma City on April 16; and in doing so, I'm not assuming
the role of a special prosecutor of Mr. Nichols.  It's not my
job to prosecute Mr. Nichols; it's my job to represent
Mr. McVeigh and to bring before the Court all of the relevant
considerations, facts, evidence and case law that I think bear
upon an issue that if the Court decides the wrong way against
us and the Court is in error, it is not harmless error.

And it goes to the very core of the Sixth Amendment
right of confrontation involving an area that our own Tenth
Circuit has said is inherently suspect; that is, to use one
defendant's statement against another defendant where we cannot
cross-examine it.

And the Court knows by now -- and if there is some
doubt about it, I think it will become clear when we submit the
motions for severance -- that there is a deep abiding
consistent permanent and antagonistic approach to this case by
Mr. Tigar on behalf of his client -- properly so -- and myself
on behalf of Mr. McVeigh.  And the Government would like
nothing more than one trial in which we point the finger at
each other.  And we're not going to do that.

But today -- or at least we're going to try to avoid
it, and that's the reason we're here today on this motion.

Mr. Connelly said there is no reason why he would make
that up.  Why would he make up being in Oklahoma City if he
wasn't there?  There is no credible answer.

Well, there is.  First of all -- and it perhaps may be
true that external facts that show that it is not true perhaps
don't weigh heavily; but the Court did ask the question is
there an eye witness that placed Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh or
either one of them in Oklahoma City on Sunday afternoon,
April 16; and the Government said there isn't any.  And there
isn't.

But there is an eyewitness -- actually two -- that
place Mr. McVeigh in Junction City, Kansas, an hour and a half
after.  According to Mr. Nichols, he left Herington to go to
Oklahoma City.  So unless Mr. McVeigh got a direct flight from
Junction City at 4:30 in the afternoon after he left the
Dreamland Motel where he was seen by two people and flew to
Oklahoma City to be there when Mr. Nichols arrived, which is
preposterous on its face, of course the statement is false.

But looking, as if we were literary critics, at the
statement itself, there are at least two hints why it is false.
The first is -- and I don't want to get into the Court's
concern about going too far into this 302.  And may I ask the
Court if it has the 302 in front of it?

THE COURT:  Just a moment.  I will.

Yes.

MR. JONES:  All right, sir.  And I'll try to measure
my words carefully in view of the discretion that I know the
Court will want me to exercise; but could I ask the Court if it
would turn to page 4 of the 302, which is the 302 --

THE COURT:  The four agents.

MR. JONES:  By the four agents.

THE COURT:  Yes, I have it.

MR. JONES:  Are the paragraphs numbered in the Court's
copy?

THE COURT:  They are.  12, 13 and 14.

MR. JONES:  May I ask the Court to go to paragraph 14
and just simply note the second sentence, the one that begins
"Nichols stopped."

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. JONES:  Now, if the Court would then turn over to
page 5 and go to paragraph 18 and look at the fourth sentence,
which says, "They also stopped."

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. JONES:  Okay.  If the Court will just follow me,
what Mr. Nichols is saying in that statement is that before he
went to Oklahoma City, he did something.  When he returned from
Oklahoma City, he did the same thing, because, presumably, that
thing was exhausted.  The indictment in this case alleges that
that thing is one of the components of the bomb; and a
statement that one went to Oklahoma City would explain neatly
why one in less than 12 hours got two of those things.

So while he in the one sense, according to the
Government, is making an inculpating statement, by the same
token, he is also making an explanation for why he has two of
those things in so short a period of time.

Secondly, according to the statement -- and I don't
know whether Terry Nichols said any of those things.  I'm just
relying upon what the Government said he said.  I've never
asked Mr. Nichols, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to do
it; so in making this argument to the court and conscious there
are members of the media here, I don't want it to be said that
I'm conceding Mr. Nichols made those statements.  Let's just
say for purposes of argument that he did.  We know from the
statement that when he received this telephone call which
allegedly took him to Oklahoma City, he lied to his wife and
said he was going to Omaha.

Now, to me, it requires no stretch of the imagination
that if he would lie to the woman he's married to and loves, he
would certainly lie to the FBI as to where he went.  Perhaps he
went to neither and perhaps the explanation to the FBI is just
as much a lie as the explanation was to his wife.  Perhaps he
was doing something else and needed an alibi, a dangerous
alibi, but nevertheless an alibi, for why he had to go and be
gone during that period of time.

But I think that the real key is that while we have
been talking about this so-called "core admission," it is
important to remember precisely what it is that the Government
seeks to introduce.  As I understand it, the statement the
Government seeks to introduce is Nichols' admission that he
drove McVeigh from Oklahoma City to Kansas on April 16, 1995.
Now, that, I submit to the Court, is a subtle difference but an
important one from the question that Mr. Connelly raises, which
is why would he lie about being in Oklahoma City?  That must be
the truth.

Well, Nichols in Oklahoma City is part of it; but what
is the core that is being sought is the admission that he drove
McVeigh from Oklahoma City to Kansas on April 16, 1995.  Now,
to answer the Court's question perhaps, or at least I attempt
to do so, perhaps, in fact, Mr. Nichols was in Oklahoma City on
April 19.  That is not a so-called inculpatory statement that
no reasonable man would make unless it's false.  The
inculpatory statement that is being sought introduced is
Nichols' admission that he drove McVeigh from Oklahoma City to
Kansas on April 16, 1995.  The difference is this:  Mr. Nichols
may have had a reason to be in Oklahoma City that is
incriminating, very incriminating.  He may have been seen, so
he explains that by saying that he was there to drive back
Mr. McVeigh.

And I would simply ask the Court to consider the
following which are in evidence before the Court -- well,
perhaps "evidence" is a poor choice of words.  They are part of
the public pleadings in this file.  It is undisputed, at least
in the record up to this point that Tim McVeigh arrived in
Junction City on Thursday, April 14.  That's 30 miles north of
Herington.  In fact, to go to Oklahoma City, you'd have to
bypass Herington or at least go in the general direction south.

It's undisputed that he registered in a motel under
his own name.

Now, if the Court would turn back to the 302 just one
moment and turn to page 3 at paragraph 9, the third sentence in
the letter --

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. JONES:  And then paragraph 10.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. JONES:  Beginning "during this," which I believe
must be the third --

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. JONES:  -- well, that statement is clearly false.
The person that he is referring to was not going from one point
to another point.  The person he is referring to has been north
of a certain point for several days; and one has to ask the
question if the purpose of going south was to get the thing,
the thing had been available 30 miles north and had been for
four days.  So of course, the statement is false.

Now, the question is why is it false?  Is it false
because he incriminated himself and therefore admissible, or is
it false for a more sinister reason?

To go back to the points that are undisputed that
Mr. McVeigh arrived in Junction City on Thursday, April 14, and
registered in his own name at the Dreamland Motel, the room
incidentally next to the office -- the material that is in the
public record before this court shows that on Saturday morning,
April 15, I believe it is -- I'm sorry -- yes, I believe it
would be the 15th -- a Robert Kling went to Elliott's Body Shop
and paid Mr. Elliott some money, 200-some-odd dollars, to rent
a Ryder truck.  Mr. Elliott is 5' 10".  He described the person
identified as Robert Kling as being 5' 10", 5' 11", weighing
180 to 185 pounds, of medium build.

On that same day, that afternoon, a telephone call was
placed from Room 25 to the Chinese restaurant to order Chinese
food in the name of Robert Kling.  The driver went to the motel
to Room 25 and delivered the Chinese food to a gentleman that
he described as approximately 6' 1" and friendly, but it was
not Tim McVeigh.

On Sunday at the time that Mr. Nichols according to
the FBI said Mr. McVeigh was in Oklahoma City calling him, two
other witnesses say Mr. McVeigh was in Junction City at the
Dreamland Motel at 4:30 in the afternoon.

So did the statement serve two purposes, to exculpate
Mr. Nichols but to incriminate ever so subtly, ever so
slightly, another person?  People who use aliases do not bring
the alias back to their motel room the same day they use it.

The description of Robert Kling is not the description of my
client.  That description is also in public record when he was
booked into the Noble County Jail.  This is a cleverly
constructed statement, as presented.  I know nothing about it,
I wasn't there, I don't know if that's what he said.  But to
say that this statement bears the indicia of reliability is
absurd on its face.

In talking about any statement that the FBI claims
that Mr. Nichols made about Tim McVeigh, to borrow Mr. Tigar's
statement about Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak, I am recalled
the statement of Mary McCarthy about Lillian Hellman, that
every word Lillian Hellman wrote was a lie, including the words
"a," "and," and "the."  That's true about Tim McVeigh and this
statement.  It does not have the indicia of responsibility; it
does not have the indicia of credibility.  And the Government
is asking the Court to do what its own agent said on the stand
could not be done.

During the examination of -- if I might just ask
Mr. Nigh.  Rob, is this Agent Foley?

MR. NIGH:  Jablonski.

MR. JONES:  Question:  And this is one long,
continuous interview stretching over a period of what, eight,
nine hours?

"Answer:  Yes.

"Question:  And it's very hard to pick and choose,

isn't it?

"Answer:  It can be.

"Question:  Events are developed in sequence,
chronologically, geographically by identity of a person, are
they not?

"Answer:  That is correct.

"Question:  If you take one part of it out and you
don't have the rest of it, you can get a false impression from
just reading that part, can't you?

"Answer:  That's possible."

We respectfully ask the Court to rule that this
statement is not admissible against our client.

THE COURT:  Well, I'm taking this motion under
advisement.  I think I have to consider both the suppression
and this together.  Obviously, they're connected.

The issue of compliance with the new legislation for
closed circuit television transmission of trial proceedings to
Oklahoma City is the next issue.  The Government filed its
motion on this.  Defendants filed their respective objections
and the Government reply; so we've got extensive briefing on
this as well.  I indicated that we would give some time for
argument here simply on the question of the constitutionality
of this provision, recognizing, of course, that the actual
application of it requires further consideration and what
conditions and what the methodology is and all that has to be
considered; but we're ready to go on the objections that have
been raised that include the arguments with respect to
separation of powers, bill of attainder, Fifth and Sixth
Amendments, and the like.

I'll hear any supplement to the brief by argument if
you wish to make it.  Mr. Tigar, I see you rising for that
purpose, I presume.

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  I'll not repeat what we
said in the brief about statutory interpretation.

This statute caught us by surprise.  There are those
in New York that Nicholas Pileggi calls "wise guys" who dream
of a racetrack in which the numbers are put on the horses after
the race is run.  We made -- that's how we feel.  We made an
argument to your Honor at the change of venue hearing that was
directed at moving the case to Denver, and in that I
consciously made a decision that we would not seek a change of
venue to places that we thought might be even better for us in
terms of jury selection.  I had already spoken to two district
judges in the Ninth Circuit who had approached me about trying
the case in San Francisco or Seattle -- that was at the Ninth
Circuit judicial conference; but if your Honor will recall, I
was conscious of the fact that a United States attorney was
going to make a presentation about the rights of victims and so
we decided to try to head that off by seeking a venue that, as

I said in argument, was a reasonable short air flight from
Oklahoma City; that is to say, Denver, where the transportation
facilities would accommodate those interests.  And the Court
will recall that the United States Attorney made a tearful and
empassioned speech with respect to victims' rights.

So after we had done that, after we made all our
arguments, after we're committed, the Congress goes and passes
this statute.  Why does this statute violate the Constitution?
First, it violates the equal protection clause as that is
construed in Romer vs. Evans, 116 Supreme Court 1620.  The
wonderful thing about Romer and Justice Kennedy's opinion is
that it tells us that equal protection of the laws is not
achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities;
that the desire to harm an unpopular group cannot constitute a
legitimate governmental suppress.

This statute is like the constitutional provision
declared invalid in Romer; that is to say, it is impossible to
believe that this statute has any purpose other than hostility
to the proclaimed desire of these defendants to have a trial
free from the diversion of television cameras.  This statute,
unless that purpose be the other one, of contradicting what
your Honor had said; that is to say, a resolute desire to
enforce the provisions of Federal Rule 53, which the Tenth
Circuit has just this week told us -- just last week told us
means exactly what it says and what your Honor says it says.

The statute, in addition to having no legitimate
governmental purpose, is utterly irrational.  First, it burdens
the defendant who seeks an interstate change of venue, although
movement from one state to another penalizing that is itself
suspect under the equal protection clause.  It doesn't burden
the defendant who wants a change of venue from Beaumont to El
Paso, a distance of 888 miles.  It doesn't burden a defendant
who wants a change of venue, indeed, within a single district
from Austin to El Paso, 683 miles, San Antonio to El Paso,
560 miles.  It doesn't burden a defendant who wants a change of
venue from Redding, a place for holding court, to Los Angeles,
546; Redding to San Diego, 690.

At the same time, your Honor, by saying that the out
of state must be matched with the 350 miles, of course, had I
known that the cost -- the cost to my client would have been by
seeking a change more than 350 miles -- would have been we had
to have television, well, your Honor, there are some other
venues I could have had out of state.  The last case Mr. Woods
and I tried a verdict was in Tarrant County, your Honor --
that's Fort Worth -- and our client was acquitted.  Senator
Hutchison.  A Terrin County jury would be just fine for us; an
Amarillo jury, your Honor, Judge Mary Lou Robinson; a Lubbock
jury, Judge, Cummings, less than 350 miles, and that's a choice
that we could have made.

But the statute -- see, the statute, first it says out
of state.  Now, the out of state part we show is irrational
because the fact is that within single states, you can have
enormous distances and enormous differences that are based on
those as between east and west Texas.  By putting in the
350 miles, the statute also makes no sense because 350 miles
can be exceeded by an intrastate transfer, and a distance of
350 miles has nothing whatever to do with the relative
convenience of air transport; that is to say it is as
inconvenient to get from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth as it is
to get from Oklahoma City to Denver.

The statute makes no sense.  The classification it
establishes makes no sense.  It denies these defendants,
therefore, the equal protection of the laws.  And what equal
protection means is the protection that Rule 53 was in its
inception and in the consistent course of Judicial Conference
decision designed to confirm.

It is a protection which we cited in our brief to the
Tenth Circuit that was a part of their mandamus decision noting
that Rule 53 has been carried into effect in district after
district, including this one, by an express prohibition not
only upon cameras in the courtroom, but upon the sort of
studied evasion that the press was attempting to do and that
your Honor wisely put a stop to.

So that is the point, your Honor.  We cited Romer vs. 
Evans to the court, and we cited Yik Wo; but Justice Kennedy's
opinion, when read, I think makes our argument more eloquently
than we could in our papers and, certainly, more fully than we
did.

With respect to separation of powers, were the power
of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of
the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control.  That's what
Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 47.  And he cited
Montesquieu's Spirit of the Law, a treatise that was well known
to the framers of the Constitution and which as has indeed, if
Westlaw is correct, been cited some 13 times since 1945 in
Supreme Court opinions dealing with separation of powers.

It is not, however, simply the abstract concern with
separation of powers that motivates our argument.  The fact is
that all defense counsel had said that they did not want to
risk a repeat of some media circus in this case no matter what
the controls; so our position was clear.

Your Honor -- and I can recall it clearly -- had a
shouted question that came at him in the Oklahoma City airport
and had said that Rule 53 would be observed.  A significant
observation.  I don't think a controversial ones.  All courts
that have looked at these matters, even in highly publicized
matters, have said that Rule 53 means what it says.

And so this legislation was designed to tell your
Honor, Judge Matsch, This is the Article I Congress people.
Hello, Article III Judge; this is how you're supposed to decide
the particular issue that is before you.  Oh, and by the way,
Judge Matsch, says the Congress, do that after the defendants
have taken a position in reliance upon the law as it stood.

That, if the Court please, is directly contrary to the
teaching of Plaut, it's directly contrary to the teaching of
Klein.

The Government's response is interesting.  I made the
statutory interpretation argument in part because I believe
that having drafted the statute, the Government has to live by
it.  The thorns which they have reaped are of the tree they
planted; however, I also knew that the Government would come
back and tell your Honor, as it predictably did, don't read the
text of the statute.  The text of the statute is only relevant
when the legislative history is vague.  That's not the way I
learned the rule, but let's take the Government at its word.

The legislative history, say they, was designed to
tell your Honor, and Article III judge, exactly how to rule on
a pending issue in this case.  And so the Government, in
seeking to avoid the thrust of one of our arguments, has
impaled itself upon the other.  That, it seems to me, makes
inescapable the conclusion that this legislation is invalid for
those reasons.

And I turn finally, then, to the due process concern,
which is slightly different from the equal protection concern
but based on the same idea.  All of us in this case have
striven, with a little mutual recrimination, to be sure -- but
all of us have striven in the best way that we can to keep from
making this case into a media circus.  I think that we have
been conscious of our professional obligations, although some
of us have seen fit to do -- to try to discharge them
differently; but the fact is we've all tried to do it.

And what we get for that is a declaration that this
courtroom is to be subject to the paraphernalia of cameras,
something that helps to turn the courtroom into something that
the Supreme Court warned against in Estes vs. Texas and
something that will make it much more difficult to have the
atmosphere of dispassionate judgment that all of us here at one
time or another have at least professed to want.

Moreover, the dangers attendant upon peopling -- or
having the courtroom filled with microphones are ones to which
I need not avert.  They are ones that we averted to in our
filing in the Tenth Circuit with respect to mandamus and which
I think it is clear that the Tenth Circuit, following your
Honor's lead, has already told us are of sufficient weight to
have led that court to deny the mandamus last week and uphold
your Honor's position.

For all of those reasons -- and since your Honor
invited me to talk about the Constitution, I've done it -- but
plus my insistence that the text of this statute means what it
says, as the Supreme Court has often told us.  We ask that the
Government's motion be denied.

THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, are you speaking to this?

DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, your Honor, when
the Constitutional Convention finished its work in Philadelphia
and it required for its labors to bear fruit that nine of the
twelve states must ratify it -- and, of course, we recall that
New York was the pivotal state -- three of the members of the
convention, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay,
wrote a series of essays that we have come to know as The 
Federalist Papers in an attempt to persuade the legislature of
the State of New York to ratify the Constitution.  And the
heart of those Federalist Papers is, of course, No. 10; and in
Federalist Paper No. 10, Madison and Hamilton and Jay set forth
and addressed the principal concern that must have been in the
minds of rural legislators in deciding whether to ratify the
Constitution, and that is just how powerful would the new
Federal Government be.

And they assured their audience that the new
Constitution had within it two basic fundamental principles
that would forever guide the new government and serve as a
protection.  The first of those was the concept of federalism,
divided authority between the federal and state governments;
but the second one is the one that Mr. Tigar references, and
that is the separation of powers.  In fact, Mr. Madison in
writing that particular essay went on to say the very heart of
the machine to preserve liberty is to be found in the
separation of powers.

Now, the issue before the Court cannot be one that the
Court would invite.  We're all familiar, we learned it in the
first week in law school, that courts strive to avoid declaring
an act unconstitutional.  If there is some way to save the
legislation, it is to be saved.  If it is unconstitutional but
its inapplicability can be determined on other grounds, courts
prefer that.  And in some respect, I think that even arguing
with this issue today is a vain and useless thing because from
the state of the technology, I think it is clear that when we
have the hearing -- if, in fact, there is one -- that the
requirements that Congress passed on the security of the signal
will be found wanting.  If hackers can break into computers and
signals of missile ranges and city electrical systems and all
of the other things that we know occur, they can certainly
break into this one.

But that's not the issue before us today.  And this
issue really doesn't affect the guilt or innocence of the
defendants; and it might seem to be a peripheral issue, but it
isn't.  It goes at the very heart of the type of government
that we have.

And we are asking the Court to do something that
probably less than 50 federal judges in the entire history of
this country -- that is, below the Supreme Court level -- have
done, which is to declare an act of the Congress passed almost
2 to 1 and signed into law by the President of the United
States to be unconstitutional.  All the more difficult a
challenge and invitation to this court, because this statute is
aimed at your Honor.  It's not only aimed at your Honor, it's
aimed at a specific act that your Honor undertook on
February 27 when you announced, as Mr. Tigar said, that there
would be no television broadcasting from this courtroom.  And
in April, Congress decided to overrule your Honor.  And if
there is any doubt that they had specifically in mind
overruling your Honor and talked about your Honor's ruling on
the floor of the Congress, it can be found in the daily issues
of The Congressional Record, and I'll be glad to give you the
citation.

That is why we say -- and I am not going to repeat
what's in the brief.  We talk about those lofty principles --
and they are lofty -- bill of attainder and ex post facto and
separation of powers.  But there can be no more clear example
of the interference with the judiciary's independence,
authority, and authority than to take a decision that your
Honor has made and overturn it by legislation.  Not that your
Honor's decision was wrong.  Rule 53 is clear.  Your Honor's
decision was correct.  And we invite the Court to find the
gloss on Rule 53 that Justice Frankfurter found in the

Youngstown Sauer case involving the seizure of the steel mills
by President Truman in 1952; that the Judicial Conference and
the judiciary and Supreme Court have spoken so consistently and
so uniformly in an unbroken record of 60 years that there will
be no broadcasting of criminal federal -- federal criminal
trials; that somewhere along the line that had to pass into an
area uniquely controlled by the judiciary.

And as I have elsewhere, and I say it with all
friendship for Congressman Lucas, a friend of mine -- and I've
contributed to his campaigns and plan to do so again, have
entertained him in my house; but he can no more tell you to put
a television in this courtroom than you can tell him to put a
television in his office.

It surely needs no elaboration.  This is a political
decision made by politicians who sought to seize the moment,
and not even most of the victims asked for it.

So all of those reasons why we don't permit television
cameras which are summarized at 381 U.S. 540 through 551 in
Estes vs. Texas are applicable to the very issue here.  But
specifically, there are four points -- and I'll just mention
them very briefly -- that trouble us about this act as applied
to this case.  I won't go into the one that Mr. Tigar did
except to say that, of course, it does discourage and burden
change of venue motions that defendants must file.  But leaving
that aside, there are four others.

First, of course, there is no provision in this
statute for the public and no provision for the families of the
defendants, who certainly are inconvenienced through no fault
of their own and have a compelling interest in attending this
trial.  But if we read the language of the statute itself, it
does not apply to this case for the reasons initially submitted
by Mr. Tigar, because it only applies where there is an out of
state change in which the case was initially brought -- which
clearly that is satisfied -- more than 350 miles from the
location in which those proceedings originally would have taken
place.

Well, the antecedent for the clause those proceedings
originally would have taken place is the trial.  This trial was
never scheduled for Oklahoma City.  It has been scheduled only
in Lawton, Oklahoma and moved here.  So even if there is a
signal to be sent back, it has to be sent back to Lawton.
There is no court order, no minute, no determination that this
trial would ever be held in Oklahoma City.

Secondly, I adopt the argument Mr. Tigar made in his
brief that under the plain wording of this statute, not even
the 350-mile requirement is met.  This statute requires the
Court already burdened with the motions and the trial
preparation to do three other things that it ordinarily would
not have to do.  Actually, four.  First, the Court must
determine the location.  Secondly, it has to determine those
persons who have a compelling interest in doing so and are
otherwise unable to do so by reason of inconvenience and
expense.  So that's the second and third finding the Court has
to make.

And the Court has a fourth finding, and that is under
paragraph 2, that you must determine for each of those
individuals whether the testimony by that person, if they
testified at trial, would be materially affected if that person
heard other testimony at the trial.

We do not know how many people will seek to avail
themselves of these proceedings; but if the public statements
are correct that just the core, to use an overworked expression
today, victims of 2200 -- let's just say that a fourth of them
sought to avail themselves of this statute, the Court would
have to determine the status of 550 people and the legislation
gives no guidance to the Court whether it's an adversarial
process, whether there is a public hearing, whether we have the
right to challenge any of those people or whether Mr. Nichols
has the right or, for that matter, the Government.

But let us suppose that there are more than 500.
Let's suppose there is 5,000.  We're going to have a Yankee
Stadium setting much like the early days of Fidel Castro's
republic with a giant television screen in which there will be
several thousand, certainly several hundred people that might
want to go there.  And we all know that there are a certain
number of people that follow the firetruck to every fire.
There are large number of people in this case who have sought
to involve themselves in it, inappropriately so.

So how many of them are going to try to take advantage
of this and come down and have their 15 minutes of fame or
7 1/2 minutes of fame to show that they're entitled to watch
this?  Because they have a claim?

And I'm not referring to those people -- I don't call
them victims, I call them survivors.  I think that's what they
are and how they should be addressed who obviously have a very
real and personal interest in attending these proceedings.  But
there is no way to work that to their exclusion -- I mean only
to their inclusion.

Finally, there is another provision in this statute
that is carefully drawn, which is very troublesome and that is
the provision that says nothing in this section shall be
construed -- and then it goes down to the second what I call
double little (i), to provide any person with a defense in any
action in which application of this section is made.

I have read the entire legislative history and could
not find a single word in the Congressional debate or the
conference committee report that interpreted that section; so I
have to take it at its face value.  And plainly what they're
trying to do is to prevent us from raising an Estes vs. Texas
argument on appeal.  Having overruled your Honor and having
told you that you have to do it, if our client or Mr. Tigar's
client is convicted, we can't raise that on appeal and that is
the only issue upon which Mr. Estes got certiorari and got his
conviction overturned.

So we respectfully submit to the Court that although
this statute was introduced, I think, for blatant political
purposes and in this case plays out against those on both sides
and although many of the survivors have a legitimate concern
and interest in this legislation, that in the final analysis,
the truth of the matter is that this bar right here separates
us from the mob.  This side of the bar is the sanctuary in the
jungle that Mr. Tigar talked about at the change of venue
hearing; and anyone who doubts that with the slightest
encouragement or inattention that that bar would be pushed down
and that the vigilante system of justice would pervade this
case simply does not understand what is at issue.

And in the final analysis, the only person, as Learned
Hand says, that protects us in the spirit of liberty is the
trial court.  It's your Honor.  You either shut the door or you
open the door; and in this case, all of us know why this
statute was passed.  All of us know what is the issue here; and
there must be -- and I submit there is in the brief -- adequate
reason to declare it either unconstitutional or inapplicable as
poorly written to the facts of this case.

THE COURT:  Who speaks for the Government on this?

Somebody other than Mr. Connelly.

MS. BEHENNA:  We decided to give him a rest for a
moment.

THE COURT:  All right.

PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MS. BEHENNA:  Thank you, your Honor.

With the Court's ruling earlier, I will not discuss
the implementation problems that Mr. Jones just raised.

THE COURT:  That's right.

MS. BEHENNA:  I will narrow this to the constitutional
challenges raised by the defendants in this case.  Mr. Jones
made a comment that the victims have a legitimate interest in
this case.  I submit to the Court that they have a statutory
right to view these criminal proceedings.  In 1990, Congress
enacted the Victims -- let me get the correct name here -- the
Victims Compensation and Assistance Act.  In that act, Congress
recognized certain rights of victims of crime.  One of those
rights was to declare victims to have the right to view, to be
present at all criminal proceedings in matters.

That interest --

THE COURT:  Well, they have the right to be notified
of them.

MS. BEHENNA:  The statute provides they have the right
to be present, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Well, read that to me.

MS. BEHENNA:  It states specifically at Item No. 4,
rights of victims:  A crime victim has the following
rights . . .  No. 4, the right to be present at all public
court proceedings relating to the offense unless the court
determines that the testimony of a victim would be --" and
that's the 615 issue that the Court has previously raised.

THE COURT:  All right.

MS. BEHENNA:  That was provided for in 1990, long
before the antiterrorism bill that was the subject of Section
235.

The interest that Congress has in providing for rights
of victims was well recognized.  Under an equal protection
challenge, your Honor, the Court must determine, if in fact, it
finds the defendants are part of a suspect group or that
Section 235 of the antiterrorism bill somehow burdens a
fundamental right of the defendants -- the Court must find that
there was no legitimate state interest in providing for the
victims in this case; and I submit to the Court that that is
not true.

Congress has a substantial interest in providing for
the victims which began, as I mentioned earlier, in the 1990
enactment of the Victims Compensation Assistance Act.  That
interest in providing for the rights of victims was continued
in the 1996 legislation providing for closed circuit TV for
victims.  It provides nothing more than expanding this
courtroom in situations where venue is changed outside a state
to a distance of more than 350 miles from the district where
the crime occurred.

As such, your Honor, it no more burdens a fundamental
right of the defendant, nor does it -- nor is it irrationally
related to some legitimate Congressional end.  In fact, as I
mentioned before, in fact, it is rationally related in a
rationale for the previous enactments that Congress has
enacted.

With regard to the separation of powers issue, your
Honor, in Plaut vs. Spendthrift -- I can't even talk --
Spendthrift Farms, the Supreme Court specifically identified
two types of legislation that is -- by Congress that it is an
unlawful intrusion to the judicial branch.  One of those types
is where Congress attempts to tell the Court how to rule in a
case pending before it.  Specifically, the Supreme Court said
it is unlawful for Congress to try and legislate in an area
that annuls a final judgment in a pending case.  I submit to
the Court that there is no final judgment in this case with
regard to the closed circuit TV issue.

In fact, there is no invasion by the enactment of
Section 235.  Congress has always reserved the right to be able
to manage criminal federal trials.  Specifically, they have the
right to legislate rules of evidence, they have the right to
legislate sentencing provisions, and so forth.

The fact that Congress felt it necessary to provide
for closed circuit TV in this situation is no more than
managing a criminal trial, which the Congress already has the
right to do.

The final argument raised by these defendants has to
do with the broadcast and the prohibition under Rule 53.
Continuously, the defendants argue that closed circuit
television is unlawfully intruding into Rule 53 by telling this
court that it has to provide closed circuit TV after -- in
violation of Rule 53, which says that cameras in the courtroom.

Your Honor, I submit to the Court that the private
broadcasts by closed circuit TV to the victims in Oklahoma City
do not come to the level of an Estes vs. Texas public broadcast
of criminal proceedings.  It is to a very limited group for a
very specific purpose.  There is no violation in this case.
There is no concern that somehow there will be a public
broadcast of these proceedings which would interfere with the
defendants' right to a fair trial.  Such being the case, the
analysis under the right to a fair trial, I submit to the
Court, is wanting.

Your Honor, having stated this, Congress does have a
legitimate interest in providing for the rights of victims to
be present during criminal proceedings; and noting that there
is in separation of powers problem because the judicial branch
or the Congress did not try to impermissibly invade the
judicial branch, Section 235 does nothing more than extend this
courtroom to the victims in Oklahoma City, an audience which
Congress has already determined has a right to be present
during the criminal proceedings and to view these proceedings.

Such being the case, your Honor, the constitutional
challenges raised by the defendants to Section 235 are not
real, they're not substantial, and they do not weigh this
statute and make it fail on constitutional grounds.

Any problems with the implementation of this statute
regarding how many cameras, how many microphones, where they
are going to be placed, are all issues that can be decided
amongst the parties with the Court at sometime in the future.
If the statute is constitutional on its face, which it is, your
Honor, the Court must uphold Section 235 and provide closed
circuit TV for viewing of the victims in Oklahoma City.

Thank you.

THE COURT:  Any rebuttal on this?

MR. TIGAR:  Briefly.  Very briefly.

THE COURT:  All right.

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' REBUTTAL ARGUMENT
ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MR. TIGAR:  Very briefly, your Honor.  The argument
that all the statute does is expand the courtroom is the same
argument that Mr. Kelley made on behalf of the press:  All he
wanted to do was expand the courtroom.  The problem is that
this form of expansion is regarded as significant.

With respect to the equal protection challenge, if the
statute's purpose is to protect the rights of victims who would
have difficulty getting to a trial, then it is seriously under-
inclusive for equal protection purposes because the only
criminal trial in the United States that it could possibly
apply to is this one.  It would be hard to name another one
that it could actually now or in the future potentially apply
to.  And it does not apply, which proves its under-
inclusiveness to intrastate changes of venue, which, as I told
the Court, could be more than several hundred miles.

With respect to the Congress' power, we quoted the
language from United States vs. Klein.  Klein is a case in
which there was not a final judgment.  There had been a trial
court judgment.  It was on appeal.  The court said, What is
this but to prescribe a rule for the decision of a cause in a
particular case; i.e. in which a judgment tentatively entered
had not yet become final?

So for all of those reasons, your Honor, we
respectfully suggest that the statute fails as a constitutional
matter.

RULING ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

THE COURT:  Well, on this I'm prepared to rule and do
so.  And of course, my focus at the moment is simply on whether
the statute -- Section 235 is invalid on its face.  And my
ruling is that it is not.

With respect to the particular challenges and my
reasoning in support of this ultimate conclusion, I think it's
an overstatement to say, as the Government has just said, that
the Congress has the power to manage criminal trials.  It
doesn't.  It has the power to prescribe rules that the courts
must apply in criminal trials as well as to prescribe
sentencing and sentencing procedures.

I look at this statute not as requiring television
broadcasting.  That's not the issue.  What it is in my reading
is an amendment to Rule 53 and in a sense a proviso or
exception to the general prohibition of broadcasting contained
in Rule 53.

Now, is it special legislation?  As of the moment of
its enactment, obviously, this is the criminal proceeding that
the Congress had in mind; but it is not, in my judgment,
restricted to this case and might have applicability in the
future.  I don't know.

But Congress does have the power to pass the Rules of
Criminal Procedure as it does to pass rules of evidence.
Generally speaking, it's done in a cooperative way under the
Rules Enabling Act with the participation of the advisory
committees of the Judicial Conference, the Supreme Court, and
then Congress; but this is not the first time that Congress has
exercised its power without going through those other
procedures.  It's done so on several occasions with respect to
rules of evidence and most recently Rule 413, I believe.

Does it violate the separation of powers?  In my
judgment, it does not.  This does not constitute, as I
interpret the statute, an incursion on the judicial power of
this court, nor does it interfere with the decisional authority
of this court with respect to adjudication issues that are, of
course, the responsibility of the trial court.

So this matter is not a part of the adjudicative
process.

With respect to whether it constitutes a bill of
attainder because it impacts particularly on these defendants,
it doesn't fit the definition of bill of attainder that has
been made in the Supreme Court and other courts, because this
is not punishment.  It's referred in the papers here as
subjecting the defendants to the perils and penalties of
telecasting, but this is not going to be telecasting in the
sense of Estes and Chandler.

For the same reason, it's not ex post facto
legislation because it is not prescribing punishment.  And of
course, I intend to see that application of the statute in no
way affects the rights of the defendants in fundamental
fairness.

That gets us to the fifth and Sixth Amendment
arguments, due process under the Fifth, the fundamental fair
trial requirements of the Sixth Amendment; and of course,
counsel for the accused have presented this possible parade of
horribles about what can happen at a trial with television
cameras and microphones and directors and zoom lens and all of
those kinds of things.

Well, it's not going to be like that.  The statute
says very clearly -- and this is also one of the reasons why I
think it doesn't violate separation of powers.  The statute
specifically provides that the signal shall be under the
court's control at all times and shall only be transmitted
subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the court.  And
in this case, there will be certainly a number of those
restrictions.

With respect to the Court's burden to determine who
views or who has the opportunity to view the television
transmission, that is, of course, something that has to be
decided; and the parties have the right to participate in that
process.

Now, the Congressional purpose has the recitation that
this is for victims, but the statute doesn't speak to victims.
It says such persons the Court determines have a compelling
interest in doing so and are otherwise unable to do so by
reason of the inconvenience and expense caused by the change of
convenience.  So compelling purpose is not limited to victims
or survivors.  That's something that needs interpretation.  And
we'll be doing that.

Reception of the signal is to be limited here.  And
the Government in its motion has suggested that it be to a
courtroom configured as a courtroom and subject to monitoring
and controls of a courtroom in the receiving place, just as
with the transmission place, the place of trial.  And that is
what I'm suggesting.

What is the effect on the transmitting court, this
courtroom?  Well, I can tell you that we're -- what I have in
mind.  There would be no visible television camera.  A camera
can be placed in the wall with a port that is not obtrusive;
and also, we don't need a director, a program director because
what the statute speaks to, in my judgment, is to give the
persons at the remote place -- that is, the receiving place --
the same opportunity to see the trial proceedings as the
persons who are present in the courtroom where the trial
proceedings are taking place.  And that, to me, means that they
ought to have something that is the equivalent of a person
seated here in the courtroom in the public area.  So to my
mind, that means a fixed focus, a panoramic view, if you will,
a view of the well of the court, not the jury, probably, and
no -- no movement of the camera, no focusing on speakers or
witnesses or anybody else.  You see the whole scene.  That's
what I call panoramic view.  I don't know what the people in
the business might call it.

With respect to what impact this might have, the
awareness that this television signal transmission is taking
place and it's being viewed by someone else, of course, with
respect to a jury, it would be a subject of voir dire inquiry
as to whether persons who are being considered for service on
this jury would be influenced by that fact.  That can be taken
care of in voir dire.

With respect to its influence on the Court, I'll pass
on that.  I don't believe that's a problem.

With respect to its influence on witnesses and other
participants, counsel, as suggested in some of the papers filed
here, well, it isn't going to be any surprise to anybody
participating in this trial that the proceedings going on here
are receiving and will receive public attention; so I don't
think that there is anything in the possibility -- in the
awareness that some people over in Oklahoma City might be
viewing this that's going to affect in any significant way the
conduct of the proceedings and the participants in it.

On the equal protection arguments that have been made,
I think there is a legitimate Governmental purpose in providing
for an opportunity for those who have compelling reasons to
have this very limited opportunity to see the trial
proceedings -- see and hear, I presume.

And I don't see here any burden on any fundamental
right in the case, particularly in view of the controls that I
intend to exercise.

And I don't see that there is a suspect class or any
invidious discriminatory purpose or any of those things that
are customary in looking at an equal protection analysis; so we
have a rational government purpose being served here.

Other issues that have been suggested here:  A
conflict with Rule 615.  Rule 615 will be applicable in the
receiving courtroom in the same fashion as in the trial
courtroom itself.  I don't intend for persons to view this who
are also going to be witnesses in the case; so it will apply
there as here.

The argument that it doesn't apply by its own terms
because the state line of Colorado is within 300 miles of
Oklahoma City -- I'm not persuaded by that argument.

And the argument also that Lawton is the place, not
Oklahoma City, because the trial was never scheduled for
Oklahoma City -- well, of course, the designation of Lawton was
made at one time by Judge Alley, who found that the place of
trial should be moved, found sua sponte, I guess, under Rule 18
that it should be moved because the selection of a jury in
Oklahoma City would be, I think he said, chancy.  So the -- the
place in which this trial would be conducted, all other things
being equal, would have been Oklahoma City; and I believe the
statute should be interpreted to mean just that; that the
transmission would be to Oklahoma City.

Now, there are a lot of problems, given what I've said
about the terms and conditions and subject to control.  These
problems may be insurmountable.  It has been suggested that
they are.  We have here the affidavit of this Dr. Welch from
southern California, University of Southern California, about
those problems.  Well, we will take a look at that; and I think
that's something we have to hold a hearing on.

It is suggested that it is not possible technically to
make it so that this signal cannot be intercepted.  I don't
know whether that's true or not true.  We'll have to find out;
and so we need a hearing really on who is going to view it, how
we're going to determine that, what monitoring must take place,
what controls must take place.  Certainly, there will be limits
on the numbers of people.  I'm aware, having been there, of
some of the courtrooms in Oklahoma City.  And of course, we'll
be using a courtroom, not an arena; and the seating facility --
the seating capacity there will be limited.  And who is in the
courtroom representing this court is something to be
considered, because I guess as it is an extension of the trial
proceeding, so it is an extension of my authority.

The fact that we start and if in the course of the
proceedings trouble arises, I'll know what to do.  The one
control that certainly is going to be required as a technical
control is an off switch within the reach of this arm, or this
arm, because I believe that the trial judge has to have the
capacity to stop the transmission at any time.  And what we
also need on the technology, the way I have understood it, is
some monitoring of how this signal is proceeding so that there
becomes some immediate awareness if there is a penetration and
a pirating, if those are the words, of the signal.  You may not
be able to prevent that from happening, but you can become
aware when it does happen and then exercise the authority to
stop it.

So the ruling is that the statute is not
unconstitutional on its face.  We'll have to work it out.

Now, that leaves us with the need to conduct that type
of a hearing at some convenient time.  We have other matters
that will have to be set as well in addition to what we already
have set on the severance and a motion to be filed; and we, of
course, have the whole matter of the laboratory and the
forensic evidence.  I don't know.

I know, Ms. Wilkinson, that you're the one who has
previously addressed that, and I presume have been following
it.

Have you any update on your report with respect to
that?

MS. WILKINSON:  I do, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Please tell us.

MS. WILKINSON:  I believe you asked the Government to
check with the Inspector General's office to determine if they
could tell us when they would have the report ready and if they
could not give us a date for the entire report, whether it
would be possible to extract certain portions which would be
relevant to this case.

THE COURT:  That was my request.

MS. WILKINSON:  We did that and heard from the
Inspector General's Office that they do not have a date certain
when they will complete the report.

Their best estimate -- they gave us two different
dates in November and December that they would complete the
report.  I believe that goes to the issue that the Court raised
the last time I spoke about this issue, and that is that they
have a much broader charter to investigate than this court is
considering in this case.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. WILKINSON:  That being said, I thought it might
help if I tell the Court briefly about some of the thing that
they're looking into that don't involve this case directly.
For example, they're investigating lots of other cases, as
Mr. Jones brought to your attention, United States vs. Moody,
which was the killing of the federal judge down in Georgia.
They're looking into that case and other specific cases.

But in addition to those other cases that don't
involve United States vs. McVeigh and Jones, they're also
looking at the general protocol, procedures -- I'm sorry -- did

I say Mr. Jones?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. WILKINSON:  Freudian slip.

MR. JONES:  I take it I'm no longer free to go.

THE COURT:  Do you want a lawyer?

MR. TIGAR:  Could we have judicial notice of what's
just been said here?

MS. WILKINSON:  I apologize, Mr. Jones.

The other thing is the Inspector General is looking
into are the procedures, the protocol and the management of the
laboratory in general and I believe -- although, again, we are
not privy to their final conclusions because they haven't made
any -- they're going to make recommendations in the report
about management of the FBI laboratory as a whole.

That being said, I believe the best way for us to
proceed is to schedule the hearings.  And I say that for two
reasons.  One is because we have provided the underlying data
that the Inspector General is using in his conclusions; that
is, the investigate -- the investigatory reports.  And we are
in the process of providing transcripts when they were taken or
when they were recorded, when the interviews were recorded, to
the defense, that apply in this case.

We also are working with the criminal division, which
is the portion of the department that has direct contact with
the Inspector General's office in terms of the Whitehurst
investigation; and we are also receiving any expert reports
written by the Inspector General's outside panel of experts in
connection with this case or in connection with conduct of
examiners as it relates to this case.

Based on that information and our continuing
obligation that we understand to provide that type of
information to the defendants, they will have access to the
same raw data that the Inspector General will in attacking our
experts.

That is important because we believe that is the
ammunition that the defense will need to challenge the
credibility of the experts and challenge the evidence itself
that we would like to introduce.

The report, the conclusions that the Inspector General
makes, would not, we believe, be admissible in this courtroom,
especially in the preliminary 703 hearings where the Court is
making a determination whether this -- each specific expert
that the defense challenges is admissible for the jury.  Again,
you're not going to make a determination as to the weight of
the evidence.  It's just as to whether this expert is truly
qualified to make the determination that we ask the Court to
introduce.

So for those reasons, we don't believe that the Court
should wait for the report nor that the defense needs that
report to fairly and thoroughly attack the Government's experts
or challenge their credibility or their expertise.

Another reason, your Honor, why we believe we don't
need to wait for the report is over the past year, we have been
providing the laboratory reports to the defense counsel.  They
know in large part who our experts are from the FBI laboratory,
to ensure that they know all of the experts that we're going to
introduce and all of the conclusions that we currently intend
to introduce.  And, of course, we would always inform the
parties and the Court that we reserve the right to introduce
additional expert testimony.  Depending on the challenge of the
defense and depending on the -- how our experts testify at
trial and how the evidence develops, we will provide the Rule
16 material to the defense which would outline each expert's
credentials and outline the general findings that we intend to
affirmatively introduce in court.  We will reference the
laboratory reports that they have so that they'll be able to
easily go back and check that they have the reports and they
have the underlying facts that the expert will testify to.

We told the Court several weeks ago that we would do
that by August 30.  We have reevaluated.  And if the Court is
willing to schedule the hearings at an earlier date, we are
willing to provide that material by -- August 2 is the earliest
date we think we could possibly do it for the defense.  And if
the defense needs several weeks to evaluate that to make the
challenges, they could do that during the month of August.

We believe again, your Honor, that they have had most
of this material for quite some time.  It's not as if we have
not turned over the lab reports throughout the case.  They know
what the major findings are that we intend to introduce.

However, for them to properly evaluate it, we would
recommend that they would have three weeks in August to review
those materials, the Rule 16 material.  Then they would give us
their challenges.  We are not sure at this point whether
they're going to challenge every single expert that the
Government intends to introduce.  As I mentioned before, there
is a fingerprint expert.  I can't imagine under Daubert that
they would challenge the reliability of fingerprint testimony
and I can't imagine that they would challenge the fingerprint
experts in this case based on the Whitehurst materials because
there are no challenges to the fingerprints section in the
laboratory.

And there may be reasons, your Honor, that the defense
does not want to, for tactical reasons, challenge other experts
in a preliminary hearing because they may believe they have
some --

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. WILKINSON:  -- advantage.

We would ask that the Court then schedule the
hearings, giving us just two weeks once we receive the
defense's challenges; and we would present all the experts that
the defense challenges and try and establish their expertise
and credibility.

MR. JONES:  May I respond?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. JONES:  Ms. Wilkinson's suggestion is unacceptable
for the defense, and it represents an attempt to rush to
judgment on the weakest part of their case, which is the
forensic evidence.

I want to go down each one of those points she's made.
The reason they want to rush to this hearing is because the
more we investigate, the more we find out, notwithstanding the
tremendous obstacles placed in our path, the more we know that
the FBI forensic laboratory as it relates to the important
point in this case is the emperor's new clothes.  First of all,
there isn't any reason to wait till August 2 to give us
anything.  We have asked for this material from the FBI
laboratory since November of last year, specific motions served
on them, which they have never responded to.

They give us lab reports in which the person that did
the work is not known to us until, finally, we insisted that we
be given some kind of explanation who this person or persons
is.  It contains absolutely no quantitative data, which is
absolutely essential to determine the credibility.  There is
nothing provided to us that relates to the contamination of the
laboratory.  We have no protocols.  We don't know how the
laboratory does this or that.  And we will shortly, thanks to
the Court's granting certain 848 -- we know a little bit more
about what they've been doing than we knew three weeks ago.

And we are preparing a detailed Rule 16 motion to the
Court to get it all, because our experts, who include some of
the world's most famous, well-recognized law enforcement
people, who are familiar with the laboratory, far more familiar
than I am, have told us how it operates and what we're entitled
to see in order to properly defend our client.

And they will sign affidavits and if necessary come to
this court and tell you why we need that material.  What they
want to give us is the tip of the iceberg.

For example, these transcripts, which they say they
can give us August 2, they have now.  They've had for months.
We have asked for them for months.

What we have received are small snippets which the
Court has under seal relating only to this case.  And they
said, Well, the Moody case doesn't relate to this case.  Of
course the Moody case relates to this case.  If nothing else,
it relates on the basis of contamination, because that is one
of the central criticisms that has been made under seal with
this investigation.  They don't want us to get a copy of the
report of the five experts or the Inspector General, because
the report is going to be devastating to their position.  They
want to single out that part of it and give it to us.

Now, the Court may say that's all we have to get; but
what we want to have the opportunity to do is to tell the Court
and in an adversarial proceeding, if necessary, why we are
entitled to more than what is being offered.  I represent to
the Court, having spent two weeks flying various places, that
what they're willing to give us isn't going to get the job done
and is a carefully controlled selection so that we can't get at
the heart of it; that this forensic heart does not inculpate
our client.

And that's just one of the discovery problems.  We are
still negotiating with the Government.  Two weeks ago we gave
them a 50-page letter -- I say two weeks ago, perhaps two and a
half weeks ago -- so that we don't burden the Court with that;
but this question of the FBI laboratory is critical to the
defense.  And in view of the extraordinary investigation, in
fact, unprecedented investigation going on in the lab in which
you have to bring in outside experts and the Inspector General,
it seems to me that that part is exculpatory.  We're entitled
to it.  It's the cornerstone of our defense, your Honor.

And most importantly, Ms. Wilkinson and some FBI
agents went not too long ago to interview General Bernard
Parton.  General Parton is a retired general of the United
States Army who has written a rather significant report
challenging the basic thesis of the Government's case.  He's
not our expert.  They went to interview him.  We haven't been
able to interview a single FBI agent in that lab despite
repeated written requests.

I think at the appropriate time we're going to ask the
Court -- and in fact, I invite the Court to issue the order
today -- that we be permitted to interview Frederic Whitehurst
forthwith, James Colby forthwith, and every one of those other
FBI agents that are involved in that investigation to find out
what they know about contamination of the lab as it relates to
this case and the works of Martz and Thurman.  There is no
reason why we can't interview those people, and they have
prohibited us from doing so; and yet they come before the Court
and say we're going to give them everything they need.

Well, fine.  We want to interview Special Agent
Whitehurst and these other nine agents.

THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar?

MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, I don't understand the
Government's offer.  If the Government has a proffer of expert
testimony to make, it should make it.  When it has made it, we
will be in a position to tell the Court within a very few days
how much time we reasonably need to respond to it and to
prepare for a hearing.

Ms. Wilkinson's fundamental premise with which she
began is completely in error.  The report of the Inspector
General with respect to the Whitehurst matter under Federal
Rule of Evidence 803(8)(c) would be admissible if we offered it
but not if the Government offered it.  It is a report prepared
under lawful authority, factual findings resulting from an
investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.

The Government can't introduce it, but we can in a
criminal case.  So I fail to see how that could be irrelevant
to us.

We may very well ask the Court when we see this to
wait until that report is available; but I can't tell you right
now.

Another example:  At the last hearing, Ms. Wilkinson
said that the Government had retained an entomologist, and I
thought the only bugs in the case were ones on people's
telephones.  But Mr. Nigh wrote and found out that the
entomologist is examining crank case drippings at the Geary
State Fishing Lake and their impact on insect colonies there,
and that will help them to date things.  I don't know how long
it will take us to find somebody who is equally enthusiastic
about insects or even if the Government intends to introduce
its entomologist.

I would suggest if the Government has its proffer that
it present it; that within a week from that time, we will tell
the Court how much time we reasonably need to get ready for a
hearing.

I will say to the Court that the American Bar
Association meeting is the first week in August.  I don't know
if the Court intends to be there.  I've been invited to give a
talk there, and I intend to do it.

THE COURT:  I don't intend to be there, for your talk
or any other.

MR. TIGAR:  I understand that, your Honor; and I
wanted to warn you just in case you were thinking of going
there.  But it's in Orlando; and my daughter voted that I go
there, and so therefore there will be two Mickey Mouse events,
my talk and then our visit.

And then if the Court please, unless the Department of
Defense decides to enforce the don't-ask/don't-tell policy, I
have a general court marshal for Major Deborah Meeks that
starts the 12th of August, a pro bono case; and I can't escape
that obligation.  But we can get to your Honor promptly some
report on when we'd be ready for a hearing, which will be with
all the speed we can muster.

But I think the first thing Ms. Wilkinson has to do is
to stop describing what they're going to do and then do it, and
then we'll see what our response should be.

THE COURT:  Well, actually, there are some other
things that I want to deal with with counsel on scheduling.
Now, I'm going to do that in chambers.  It's not, Mr. Kelley, a
part of the adjudicative process.  It is by way of doing some
things with respect to planning and scheduling that I think
legitimately are not public at this time.

So what I'm going to do is recess and reconvene at
4:00 in chambers.

Mr. Kelley?

MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, I was not standing to object
to the chambers conference.  Could I be heard for less than a
minute?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. KELLEY:  We would ask your Honor, along with the
other rulings that are under advisement, as soon as possible a
ruling on our motions to unseal exhibits and in particular for
access to the 302, which we believe is Exhibit A1, and Exhibit
72.

THE COURT:  Well, you know, that follows upon the
ruling with respect to whether it will be suppressed.

MR. KELLEY:  Just one thought:  Your Honor's comments
on what the Court would do if the evidence is suppressed didn't
sound good for public access.  There is a growing impression, I
think, that those documents contain something highly
inculpatory which is not known to the general public, which I
think is itself prejudicial misimpression.

THE COURT:  Well, we're not trying this case in the
interests of your clients.

MR. KELLEY:  I understand that.  But as I understand,
as best I can tell, those exhibits contain information that is
central to these hearings but not significantly in excess of
what is already in the public domain.

THE COURT:  You'll get a ruling in the fullness of time.

MR. KELLEY:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. JONES:  Your Honor, did you contemplate the
defendants would be present?

THE COURT:  Yes, I do.

MR. JONES:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  We'll recess, reconvene at 4:00.

(Recess at 3:45 p.m.)

In this May 1, 1996 brief, the government asks that closed-circuit 
television be  
set up for Oklahoma City bombing victims and their family members. 
Lawyers  
argue that the Anti-Terrorism Act requires the closed-circuit televising 
of trial  
proceedings when the venue has been changed to a distant location to 
enable  
victims to view the trial.

Crim. Action No.

MOTION AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF CLOSED-CIRCUIT 
TELEVISING  
OF TRIAL PROCEEDINGS TO OKLAHOMA CITY   
  
  
On April 24, 1996, the President signed into law the Anti-Terrorism 
and Effective Death Penalty Act. A portion of that statute, Section 235 
FN 1, requires the closed-circuit televising of trial proceedings in cases 
in which venue has been changed to a distant location. The purpose of 
the statute is to enable victims of crime who cannot travel to the distant 
venue to view the trial in the district in which the crime occurred. The 
provision applies to this case. Consequently, the United States moves 
this Court to apply Section 235 and provide for the closed-circuit 
televising of the trial proceedings to the United States District Court for 
the Western District of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City. The United States 
offers recommendations for implementing the requirements  
of the statute.   
  
The clear import of Section 235 is to craft a limited exception to the 
general prohibition on the televising of court proceedings in Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 53. Congress has ssentially provided for an 
expansion of the courtroom, by technological means, to enable victims 
of crime who cannot attend the trial to view those proceedings in 
another courtroom. By providing only for closed-circuit television and 
by imposing a number of strict limitations on the procedures to be 
used, Congress has expressed its intent simply to allow more of those 
directly affected by the crimes involved to watch the trial, according to 
the same rules that apply in the courtroom in which the proceedings are 
actually taking place, and under the complete control and supervision 
of the presiding trial judge. The use of closed-circuit television in  
thin case, particularly when carefully limited and controlled by the trial 
court, will not endanger the defendants' right to a fair trial. The strictly 
controlled procedure mandated by this statute carries no risk of leading 
to unlimited media coverage of the type that could deprive the 
defendants of that "judicial serenity and calm to which [they are] 
entitled." Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 536 1965).   
  
  
Section 235 Applies to this Case.  
  
Section 235 provides, in pertinent part:   
  
  
(a) In General. -- Notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure to the contrary, in order to permit victims of 
crime to watch criminal trial proceedings in cases where the venue of 
the trial is changed --   
  
  
(1) out of the State in which the case was initially brought; and   
  
(2) more than 350 miles from the location in which those proceedings 
originally would have taken place;  the trial court shall order closed 
circuit televising of the proceedings to that location, for viewing by 
such persons the court determines have a compelling interest in doing 
so and are otherwise unable to do so by reason of the inconvenience 
and expense caused by the change of venue. FN 2  The offenses 
charged in this case resulted in the deaths of 168 persons and  
injury to hundreds more. While the nation as a whole has a great 
interest in this case, there are certain individuals who have a much 
greater than generalized interest in satisfying themselves that justice is 
served. They are the hundreds of persons who were in the Murrah 
Building at the time of the explosion, and the many more who lost 
loved ones and suffered personal injuries in the bombing.   
  
They were more than merely shocked by the crime. Their lives have 
been deeply and irreparably affected. Part of their recovery depends on 
their seeing -- first hand, if possible -- our system of justice at work. 
These people have "a compelling interest" in attending the trial.   
  
Most of them, however, are "unable to do so by reason of the 
inconvenience and expense caused by the change of venue" to Denver, 
which is "more than 350 miles from" Oklahoma City. The Victim 
Assistance Unit of the United States attorney's Office for the Western 
District of Oklahoma corresponds with more than 1200 people 
identified as victims of the Murrah Building bombing.   
  
These include children who lost parents, parents who lost children, 
scores of men and women who lost spouses, and hundreds of people 
who suffered personal injury as a result of the bombing. As established 
at the venue hearing, virtually all of these victims live in the greater 
Oklahoma City area. Many of them have expressed an interest in 
attending the trial but are unable to travel to Denver for that purpose. 
Many have jobs; others have children in school or at home; some are in 
school themselves. Even if cost were not a consideration, many of 
these victims could not leave their homes overnight to attend the trial.  
Moreover, the seating capacity in the Denver courtroom is limited to 
only about 100, making it impracticable to accommodate more than a 
fraction of the victims in any event.   
  
  
In its order changing the venue of this case to Denver, this Court noted 
its awareness of "the wishes of the victims of the Oklahoma City 
explosion to attend this trial" and the "hardship for those victims to 
travel to Denver." By providing for closed-circuit televising of the 
proceedings in cases such as this, Congress has addressed these types 
of concerns and offered another means of ensuring that victims have 
access to trials. Indeed, because of the one-hour time difference 
between Oklahoma City and Denver, closed circuit television  
broadcast of the trial proceedings to Oklahoma City will virtually 
assure that the vast majority of victims, including those who are 
employed, will have the opportunity to observe at least some portion of 
the proceedings.   
  
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 53 provides that "[t]he taking of  
photographs in the court room during the progress of judicial 
proceedings or radio broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the 
court room shall not be permitted by the court." The Rule has been 
construed to apply to television broadcasting as well. See United States 
v. Hastings, 695 F.2d 1278, 1279 n. 5 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 461 
U.S. 931 (1983).   
  
No case has held that Rule 53 also applies to closed-circuit televising to 
another courtroom; but, even assuming that Rule 53 does apply to 
prohibit closed-circuit televising of court proceedings, Congress 
specifically provided that Section 235(a) controls over "any provision 
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to the contrary[.] FN 3   
  
  
Section 235 Applies Only to Victims of Crime.   
  
  
Only victims should be permitted to view the closed- circuit televising 
of the proceedings in this case. Congress expressed its intent to limit 
access to the closed-circuit viewing to victims when it titled Section 
235 "Closed Circuit Televised Court Proceedings for Victims of 
Crime" and when it declared that the purpose of the provision is "to 
permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings" in certain 
specified classes of cases, where the victims have "a compelling 
interest in doing so and are otherwise unable to do so by reason of  
the inconvenience and expense caused by the change of venue." Thus  
Congress's clear aim was to benefit victims, and the Court should limit 
the expanded access to the trial authorized by this statute to members 
of that group. Other persons including the press, of course, retain their 
right to attend the trial proceedings in Denver.   
 
By limiting access to the closed circuit broadcast in City to victims in 
Oklahoma City, this Court will substantially avoid one of the principal 
disadvantages of allowing cameras in the courtroom -- that is, the 
incentive that a camera provides for an attorney or witness to "play to" 
the television audience. The closed circuit broadcast will not vastly 
expand the trial audience; it will simply extend the courtroom to people 
who would have observed the trial in person had venue not been 
changed. The incentives for the participants in the trial should  
not appreciably change as a result of such an extension.   
  
The determination of which persons qualify as victims who have a 
"compelling need" to view the trial proceedings by closed-circuit 
televisin is a matter entrusted to the Court's discretion (see Sec. 
235(a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2)); the statute is not intended to create a cause of 
action against the United States or any of its officers or employees by 
virtue of the manner in which the Court implements its responsibilities 
under the Act (Sec. 235(e)). The United States suggests that, in  
order to identify those persons who qualify under the statute as having 
a "compelling interest" in viewing the trial and who "are otherwise 
unable to do so," the Court should set up a specific procedure for 
selecting those eligible to view the trial in Oklahoma City. Applications 
to attend the cosed circuit television viewing of the trial could be 
processed through the clerk's office for the United States District Court 
for the Western District of Oklahoma. Ms. Lynn Anderson, Assistant 
United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, and the 
Victim Assistance Unit which she heads, would be available to assist 
the Court in notifying and certifying those who are considered  
"victims" of the Murrah Building bombing, according to criteria 
established by the Court.    
  
Section 235 Requires the Trial Court to Maintain Control over the 
Closed-Circuit Televising.   
  
Section 235(c)(1) of the Act requires that   
  
  
[t]he signal transmitted pursuant to subsection (a) shall be under the 
control of the court at all times and shall only be transmitted subject to 
the terms and conditions imposed by the court. To ensure compliance 
with this provision, we suggest that the signal from this Court be 
transmitted in encrypted form, over a secure, direct line, to the United 
States Courthouse in Oklahoma City, for viewing by persons esignated 
by the trial court in one or more courtrooms; and that the District 
Court's officers and security personnel in Oklahoma City perform the 
same monitoring functions that they would perform in a courtroom  
in which a trial were being held. To guarantee that the signal remains 
"under the control of the court at all times," this Court should direct 
that cameras and all other equipment be purchased with court funds, 
and that court personnel operate the cameras -- in short, that the entire 
operation of the closed-circuit televising remain exclusively a function 
of the court, without the involvement of any private parties or business 
entities.   
  
For the same reason, all costs associated with the closed-circuit 
televising should be borne by the government, not any private parties. 
By deleting a previous provision that would have prohibited the use of 
appropriated funds, FN 4 and requiring the courts to carry out the 
statute's mandate (Sec. 235(a) & (d)), Congress has further indicated its 
intent to have the courts exercise complete control over all aspects of 
the closed-circuit televising. While Congress apparently intended to 
place on the courts themselves the primary responsibility for funding 
the closed-circuit televising required by Section 235, the statute  
provides for the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to 
accept donations "to enable the courts to carry out subsection (a)" (Sec. 
235(d)). Any such donations, however, should be restricted to cash 
only; allowing any private persons or entities to donate equipment or 
services in connection with the closed-circuit televising could 
effectively surrender the court's control over these procedures and 
thereby violate the statute's specific requirement that the signal remain 
under the court's control at all times. The Department of Justice  
will provide, through the Office for Victims of Crime, any necessary 
funding that cannot be met by the resources of the courts or other 
donations.   
  
  
The U. S. Marshal's Service should also be available to the Court to 
assist in carrying out the technical aspects of the required closed-circuit 
televising. A preliminary study conducted by the Department of 
Justice/Executive Office for United States Attorneys Video 
Teleconferencing Laboratory has determined that a secure video/audio 
transmission could be accomplished between the two sites at a 
reasonable cost. Since this would be a one-way transmission only, it is  
recommended that a dedicated T-1 digital line be installed between the 
two points by Sprint, the Network B FTS-2000 network carrier. It has 
been established that this line would travel between Denver and 
Oklahoma City strictly on fiber and would at no time route through any 
other wireless or land connections. The "codec" FN 5 and associated 
broadcast equipment could be located on a cart in a position or location 
designated by the court. It is estimated that the cost of the broadcast 
equipment would not exceed $75,000, with an additional expense of 
approximately $100,000 for adequate monitors in Oklahoma City. Line 
costs are anticipated not to exceed $1500 per month for unlimited use. 
The United States has indicated that it may be able to provide the  
necessary encrypters from its existing inventory. The Executive Office 
for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) currently manages a contract 
under which all of the requisite equipment could be obtained; and at 
the conclusion of the trial all of the necessary equipment could be 
redesignated for videoconferencing purposes.   
  
Section 235 Forbids Any Broadcast or Dissemination of the Closed- 
Circuit Television Signal   
  
  
Section 235(c)(2) of the Act states that   
  
No public broadcast or dissemination shall be made of the signal 
transmitted pursuant to subsection (a). In the event any tapes are 
produced in carrying out subsection (a), such tapes shall be the 
property of the court and kept under seal.   
  
The best way to carry out the intent of this provision is not to make a 
tape in the first place. The signal should be transmitted but not 
videotaped. The statute's preclusion of any "public broadcast or 
dissemination" of the signal, coupled with the requirement  
that "in the event" any tapes are made, "they shall be the property of 
the court and [be] kept under seal," reflects Congress's intent to allow 
closed-circuit television only as a means of allowing more of the 
victims of crimes to view the trial from another location -- not to 
provide for the broadcast of the trial to the general public, and not to 
produce any additional public record of the trial beyond the official 
trial transcript that is normally made. The court can ensure  
that it carries out the statute's mandate not to allow broadcast or 
dissemination of the signal simply by prohibiting the production of any 
videotapes of the televised proceedings.    
  
Section 235 Will Not Affect the Defendants' Right To a Fair Trial.   
  
  
The televising required by Section 235 will not have any adverse 
impact on the rights of the defendants to a fair trial. The television 
cameras can be placed in an unobtrusive location and operated in a 
manner that will not distract the jury or witnesses. FN 6 The 
participants in the trial will have no incentive to conduct themselves in 
any way other than they would in a larger courtroom in Oklahoma  
City. Those viewing the closed-circuit television signal will see no 
more than what the jury and members of the public in the courtroom 
can see. And the statute provides that the Court may exclude from the 
closed-circuit television viewing anyone whose testimony "would be 
materially affected if that person heard other testimony at the trial." 
Sec. 235(b)(2). As long as the Court implements this statute in the very 
limited manner contemplated by Congress, the interests of the victims 
will be substantially furthered while the rights of the defendants remain 
unaffected.   
  
  
ACCORDINGLY, pursuant to Section 235, the Court should provide 
for the closed-circuit televising of the trial proceedings in this case to 
the United States Courthouse in Oklahoma City, according to the 
recommendations outlined above.

FN 1 The full text of Section 235 is attached to this motion.   
  
FN 2 The Act went into effect on April 24, 1996. By its terms, Section 
235 applies only to cases filed after January 1, 1995. The offenses in 
the instant case were committed on April 19, 1995, and the indictment 
was filed on August 10, 1995.

cameras or recording devices . . . in the United States courthouse or 
anywhere that a judicial officer is holding a court proceeding," except 
by "court employees performing official duties." Rule 83.3 is consistent 
with Section 235, which makes closed-circuit televising in these 
circumstances an "official dut[y]."

FN 5 "Codec" is an acronym for COder/DECoder, a video

FN 6 In fact, the Court may wish to consider formulating specific 
guidelines for use of the cameras so as to ensure that they will not 
distract the jury or witnesses or call undue attention to the lawyers. 
Thus, for example, the court could decide that the cameras should only 
view the lawyers during opening statements and closing arguments; 
that the cameras should never show the jury or any juror; that the 
cameras should show the trial judge whenever he is speaking; and that  
during witness testimony, the cameras should show only the witness or 
a relevant trial exhibit being displayed to the jury.

In this June 24, 1996 reply and supplemental memo, defense lawyers argue against closed-circuit TV for victims and their families. They say the section of the Anti-Terrorism Act that provides for closed-circuit television is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers doctrine and it denies Timothy McVeigh equal protection under the laws. They also express concern over how to keep the signal secure as it is transmitted from Denver to Oklahoma City.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO
Chief Judge Richard P. Matsch

Criminal Action No. 96-CR-68-M (formerly No. 95-110 MH
WDOK)

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Plaintiff

v.

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN
NICHOLS Defendants.


REPLY BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IN SUPPORT
OF CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISING OF TRIAL
PROCEEDINGS TO OKLAHOMA CITY

Section 235(a) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 requires "closed-circuit televising" of
this case back to Oklahoma City so that "victims of [the]
crime [may] watch criminal trial proceedings." Defendants
nonetheless advance a number of arguments that, at bottom,
urge this Court to disregard the plain statutory language
and clear congressional intent. They argue that Section
235: does not apply to this case or at most requires
broadcast to Lawton rather than Oklahoma City; violates the
constitutional separation of powers; amounts to an ex post
facto law and bill of attainder; and denies them equal
protection, due process, and the right to a fair trial.

Contrary to defendants' arguments, Section 235 plainly
applies to this case and requires closed-circuit televising
of trial proceedings from Denver to Oklahoma City. There is
nothing unconstitutional about the congressional judgment
that victims should be able to view, without undue
"inconvenience and expense," trial proceedings regarding a
crime that caused them such compelling loss and suffering.


DISCUSSION

I. SECTION 235 PLAINLY REQUIRES CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISING
OF TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE BACK TO OKLAHOMA CITY. 
A. This Court Changed Venue "More Than 350 Miles From The
Location In Which [Trial] Proceedings Originally Would Have
Taken Place."

Section 235(a) applies to "cases where the venue of the
trial is changed (1) out of the State in which the case was
initially brought; and (2) more than 350 miles from the
location in which those proceedings originally would have
taken place." The first prerequisite, an out-of-State
transfer, undeniably is satisfied. See DE 1516 at 2
(deeming it "obvious that in this case the Court has
changed venue from one State to another"). Nichols argues,
however, that Section 235 "does not apply to this case"
because the second prerequisite is not satisfied. Id. at
2-5. This argument is in tension with Nichols' own
alternative argument that "Congress enacted Section 235 to
provide closed-circuit television in this case." Id. at 7.
It is also at odds with McVeigh's position that section
235's "terms are undeniably mandatory: the Court must
permit the closed-circuit broadcast of Mr. McVeigh's
trial...." DE 1526 at 3; but see McVeigh Notice filed
6/19/96 "expressly join[ing]" Nichols' brief in opposition
to closed-circuit televising.

Nichols' argument is that the 350-mile distance must be
measured by two different terms: from the "location" where
trial originally would have been held (which Nichols
concedes was Oklahoma City) to the new "venue" (which
Nichols suggests is the entire District of Colorado rather
than Denver). DE 1516 at 2-4. According to Nichols, there
is no basis for construing the statutory term "venue" as
meaning anything less than "either the 'State' ... or the
'district' in which the crime was allegedly committed." Id.
at 3. Under this construction, the second statutory
prerequisite is not satisfied because "it is [not] more
than 350 miles from Oklahoma City (or Lawton) to the
Colorado state line." Id. at 4.

Nichols' premise that the term "venue" cannot mean anything
less than the entire "State" or "district" (which in this
case are one and the same) is conclusively contradicted by
18 U.S.C. Section 3235. That statute, entitled "Venue in
capital cases," provides: "The trial of offenses punishable
with death shall be had in the county where the offense was
committed, where that can be done without great
inconvenience." (Emphasis added.) It undeniably is more
than 350 miles from Oklahoma County to Denver County.

More generally, Nichols' contention that there invariably
is a legally significant distinction between a trial's
"location" and its "venue" cannot be squared with common
judicial treatment of those terms as synonymous. Indeed,
Fed. R. Crim. P. 18, one of four Federal Rules under the
broad heading of "VENUE," instructs courts to "fix the
place of trial [i.e., the 'location'] within the district
with due regard" to various prescribed factors. Likewise,
the Supreme Court and other federal courts frequently treat
the terms "location" and "venue" as meaning the same thing.
See, e.g., Mercantile National Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S.
555, 565 (1963) (construing provision as "essentially a
venue statute governing the proper location of suits");
United States v. Cofield, 11 F.3d 413, 416 (4th Cir. 1993)
(discussing the proper "venue location" in a criminal
case); United States v. Williams, 897 F.2d 1034, 1037 (10th
Cir. 1990) ("change in venue" not required based on
defendant's claim that "the trial location" was
inconvenient).

Nichols' argument that the changed "venue" in this case
must be the entire State and District rather than Denver is
also at odds with this Court's Order changing venue. The
Court concluded that: "Denver, Colorado meets all of the
criteria that have been cited by past cases as relevant
when selecting an alternative venue." United States v.
McVeigh and Nichols, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1474 (W.D. Okla.
1996). The Court specifically cited and relied on the many
attributes of "Denver," a "large metropolitan community"
that "is readily accessible ... from all relevant cities"
and it stressed that "court facilities in Denver are
well-suited for accommodating the special needs of this
trial." Id. Hence, for reasons unique to the city, this
Court changed venue for this trial to Denver -- not to some
hypothetical site on the Colorado-Oklahoma border.

Nichols' argument that the Court could have held trial
"anywhere in the district if it chose" (DE 1516 at 4 n.1)
proves nothing, as there is no reason to believe that
Congress somehow conditioned section 235 on theoretical
places where trial could have been held. To the contrary,
Congress clearly wrote Section 235 to assist those
individuals who could not attend a trial because it had
been moved a considerable distance away. It does little
good to imagine where this trial could have been held when
it in fact will be held in Denver, and the statute should
be construed to the situations as it exists rather than as
it could have existed.

Finally, even if Nichols' reading of the statute were
plausible, it would collide with the principle that "courts
will adopt a more sensible statutory construction" where a
"literal reading of the statutory language would produce an
absurd result -- particularly one clearly not contemplated
by Congress." United States v. Gonzales, 65 F.3d 814, 819
(10th Cir. 1995) (citing Public Citizen v. United States
Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 454-55 (1989)), cert.
granted on other grounds, 1996 WL 183394 (June 17, 1996).
The legislative history removes any possible doubt that
section 235 was intended to apply to this case. Senator
Hatch, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the
law's chief sponsor, explained that "by providing for
closed-circuit viewing of the Oklahoma City trial by the
bombing's victims and survivors, this bill also will ensure
that these courageous people can observe justice being
done, while still ensuring a fair and just trial for the
accused." 142 Cong. Rec. S3476 (daily ed. April 17, 1996).
Likewise, other remarks on the Senate and House floors
during consideration of the anti-terrorism bill confirmed
that section 235 was intended to apply to this trial. See,
e.g., id. at S3477 (Sen. Nickles) (bill "does allow
closed-circuit TV for families in the Oklahoma City
bombing"); 142 Cong. Rec. H2141 (daily ed. March 13, 1996)
(Rep. Lucas) (urging "[s]upport [of] closed-circuit
broadcasting of the Oklahoma City bombing trial").

B. The Closed-Circuit Broadcast Must Be To Oklahoma City
Rather Than To Lawton.

McVeigh suggests that Section 235 requires closed-circuit
televising to Lawton, Oklahoma, and not to Oklahoma City.
DE 1526 at 43. The statute provides that the trial will be
televised to the location "in which those proceedings
originally would have taken place." Clearly, these
proceedings "originally" would have occurred in Oklahoma
City, the site of the crime. All preliminary proceedings --
pre-indictment litigation, grand jury investigation,
indictments and arraignments, and court proceedings through
this Court's venue change -- took place in Oklahoma City
rather than Lawton. Judge Alley designated Lawton as the
trial site only because he deemed the "United States
Courthouse in Oklahoma City" (the normal location for
criminal trials in the Western District of Oklahoma) "too
close to the bombing target" and believed that "[j]ury
selection from a pool in the Oklahoma City area would be
chancy." DE 311 at 20. These considerations show that the
Lawton designation was the equivalent of a venue change
from the "original" trial location. See 1966 Advisory
Committee Notes to Fed. R. Crim. P. 18 ("the court may, of
course, fix another place of trial within the district (if
there be such) where such prejudice does not exist. Cf.
Rule 21 dealing with transfers between districts"). There
can be no doubt Congress deemed Oklahoma City the "original
location" to which proceedings would be broadcast. See,
e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. H2165 (daily ed. March 13, 1996) (Rep.
Istook) (bill provides for "a closed circuit rebroadcast
back to the original location, to Oklahoma City").


C. The Court Need Not Prematurely Decide Which Victims Will
Be Entitled To View The Broadcast In Order To Decide That
The Statute Applies To This Case.

Nichols next argues that section 235 does not apply in this
case because the government has failed to establish that
victims of the worst act of domestic terrorism in the
history of the United States have a "compelling interest"
in viewing the proceedings, or that they are "unable to do
so by reason of the inconvenience and expense caused by the
change of venue" to Denver. DE 1516 at 5-7. The United
States has no such burden. The statute specifies that "the
court" shall designate "such persons." Nichols is also
wrong to assert that the "compelling interest" standard
established by Section 235 does not provide sufficient
guidelines for the Court to select those individuals who
should be permitted to watch the closed-circuit televised
proceedings. Section 235(a) must be construed in light of
its express purpose of "permit[ting] victims of crime to
watch criminal trial proceedings." This Court too "is
acutely aware of the wishes of the victims of the Oklahoma
City explosion to attend this trial and that it will be a
hardship for those victims to travel to Denver." McVeigh
and Nichols, 918 F. Supp. at 1474. The Court need not
determine which victims ultimately will be allowed to view
the broadcast before it decides if and under what
conditions the broadcast will occur.

Finally, contrary to Nichols' unfounded suggestion, the
Court is not required to hold an "adversary hearing" (DE
1516 at 6) prior to determining which individuals may view
the closed-circuit televised proceedings. Nichols lacks
standing to object to anyone's right to watch those
proceedings, for Section 235 does not provide him with any
enforceable rights. Quite obviously, Nichols is not the
intended beneficiary of the statute. See generally Wilder
v. Virginia Hospital Association, 496 U.S. 498, 509 (1990).

In a related vein, Nichols argues that section 235 violates
Fed. R. Evid. 615 by allowing victims who may testify in
the penalty stage of this proceeding to view the trial
itself. DE 1516 at 12-14. This argument is flawed for
several reasons. First, it is by no means clear that Rule
615 applies to witnesses who will testify only at
sentencing. By requiring the court to "order witnesses
excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other
witnesses," the Rule codifies the common-law tradition of
sequestering witnesses during a trial "as a means of
discouraging and exposing fabrication, inaccuracy, and
collusion." Fed. R. Evid. 615 and 1972 Advisory Committee
Notes; see also United States v. Johnson, 578 F.2d 1352,
1355 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 931 (1978). These
concerns are simply not present where victims will not
testify at trial about facts relevant to guilt, but rather
will offer testimony at sentencing regarding the impact of
the crime on their lives. See generally United States v.
Jackson, 60 F.3d 128, 135 (2d Cir.) (listing factors
relevant to a Rule 615 ruling, including "how critical the
testimony is, that is, whether it will involve controverted
and material facts" and "whether the information is
ordinarily subject to tailoring"), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct.
487 (1995); United States v. De Jongh, 937 F.2d 1, 3 (1st
Cir. 1991) (courts possess "considerable discretion" to
fashion sequestration orders under Rule 615). Moreover,
although Nichols complains that a victim's testimony at
sentencing would be "magnified or otherwise affected" by
watching the trial (DE 1516 at 13), he does not explain how
those proceedings could cause more distress to the victims
than the hundreds of deaths and injuries caused by the
crime itself.

In any event, there is no conflict between Section 235 and
Rule 615. Section 235 explicitly provides that the Court
may exclude anyone from viewing the closed-circuit
televised proceedings who "would be materially affected if
that person heard other testimony at the trial." Even if
this Court ultimately excluded some victims from viewing
the closed-circuit broadcast, there are many others who
would not be so barred.


II. SECTION 235 IS CONSTITUTIONAL.

A. Section 235 Does Not Violate Separation of Powers.

Defendants argue that section 235 violates the separation
of powers. DE 1516 at 7-11; DE 1526 at 6-14. This
constitutional principle "safeguard[s] against the
encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense
of the other." Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 122 (1976). To
prevail on their claims, defendants must show that section
235 "impermissibly threatens the institutional integrity of
the Judicial Branch." CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 851
(1986). The Supreme Court has cautioned that "[w]hen this
Court is asked to invalidate a statutory provision that has
been approved by both Houses of Congress and signed by the
President, particularly an Act of Congress that confronts
a deeply vexing national problem, it should only do so for
the most compelling constitutional reasons." Mistretta v.
United States, 488 U.S. 361, 384 (1989) (internal quotation
marks deleted).

McVeigh repeatedly argues that section 235 violates the
separation of powers because it requires broadcasting "even
if the Court is convinced that Mr. McVeigh's constitutional
rights will be sacrificed" and it thus "leave[s] federal
judges without power to remedy constitutional violations."
DE 1526 at 3, 21; see also, e.g., id. at 4, 13, 16. Not at
all. Section 235 obviously must give way if its application
would violate defendants' constitutional rights. Plaut v.
Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 115 S. Ct. 1447, 1459 (1995)
(reaffirming "'judicial power' to disregard an
unconstitutional statute"; citing Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137, 177 (1803)). McVeigh is not entitled, however,
to attack section 235 as contrary to his own or others'
notions of sound policy. DE 1526 at 7-14 (discussing
various views supporting ban on cameras in courtroom); see
Carlisle v. United States, 116 S. Ct. 1460, 1468 (1996)
("we are not at liberty to ignore the mandate of Rule 29 in
order to obtain 'optimal' policy results"). Congress has
decided that sound policy favors, in these special
circumstances, the closed-circuit broadcast of trial
proceedings to victims. As long as that congressional
judgment does not violate defendants' constitutional rights
(and it does not for reasons discussed below), McVeigh may
not ask a court to second-guess it.

The Supreme Court has "recognized Congress' power to create
the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Rules
Advisory Committees that it oversees, and the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts whose
myriad responsibilities include the administration of the
entire probation service." Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 388-89.
Defendants' separation of power arguments are particularly
unavailing because Congress has almost plenary power to
regulate the manner in which federal trials are conducted.
Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1934) ("Congress
has undoubted power to regulate the practice and procedure
of federal courts"). Although Congress has delegated the
authority to promulgate and amend the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to the Supreme Court, it retains the
power to reject any proposed changes. 28 U.S.C. Sections
2071 et seq.; see also Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 386-88.
Congress may, of course, also directly amend the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure by statute. See, e.g., Pub. L.
99-570, Title X, Section 1009, 100 Stat. 3207-08 (amending
Rule 35).

Defendants' suggestion that Congress cannot
constitutionally amend Rule 53 is also at odds with this
Court's May 29, 1996 opinion, holding that it could not
release audio tapes of court proceedings. The Court
explained that "[i]n providing the statutory authority for
the making of the official record by means of an electronic
sound recording system under 28 U.S.C. Section 753(b),
Congress in effect modified Rule 53." DE 1498 at 6. The
Court's opinion further recognized that the Judicial
Conference -- the very body whose policy views McVeigh
suggests should trump those of Congress in section 235
(e.g., DE 1526 at 12-13) -- operates "under statutory
authority given [by Congress] in 28 U.S.C. Section 753(b)."
DE 1498 at 1.

Congress properly exercised its authority in enacting
section 235 and providing for closed-circuit televising
"[n]otwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to the contrary." Defendants cannot show
that requiring closed-circuit televising of a trial
threatens the institutional integrity of the judiciary any
more than a host of other congressionally prescribed
conditions including: what evidence is admissible, e.g.,
Fed. R. Evid. 802; what number of peremptory challenges
shall be permitted, Fed. R. Crim. P. 24; and what a
defendant's sentence will be. See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at
380.

Lastly, Nichols incorrectly cites the Supreme Court's
decision in Plaut as supporting a claim that section 235
unconstitutionally directs the Court to decide a specific
issue in only this case. DE 1516 at 8. Plaut ruled that a
statute that "retroactively command[ed] the federal courts
to reopen final judgments" violated separation of powers.
115 S. Ct. at 1458. The unconstitutional flaw in Plaut
"consist[ed] not of the Legislature's acting in a
particularized and hence (according to the concurrence)
nonlegislative fashion; but rather of the Legislature's
nullifying prior, authoritative judicial action." d. at
1462-1463. The Plaut majority added that "[e]ven laws that
impose a duty or liability upon a single individual or firm
are not on that account invalid -- or else we would not
have the extensive jurisprudence that we do concerning the
Bill of Attainder Clause, including cases which say that it
requires not merely 'singling out' but also punishment, and
a case which says that Congress may legislate 'a legitimate
class of one.'" Id. at 1463 n.9 (citations omitted).

In any event, section 235 does not, as Nichols claims,
apply only to this case but instead applies by its terms
wherever venue is changed out of the State and more than
350 miles from the location where the crime occurred. That
the plight of the numerous victims in this case prompted
Congress to enact Section 235 does not, of course, limit
its application to this case. Prominent events that
highlight shortcomings in the law often cause Congress to
enact corrective legislation; this process is not
unconstitutional. Through Section 235, Congress has
fashioned a rational procedure by which the victims of
crimes where venue has been changed may view the
proceedings.


B. Section 235 is Not a Bill of Attainder, Nor Does it
Violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

McVeigh argues that section 235 is an unconstitutional bill
of attainder and that it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.
DE 1526 at 16-25. As Section 235 does not prescribe any
"punishment," these claims lack merit. Jones v. Heckler,
774 F.2d 997, 998 (10th Cir. 1985) ("Essential to the
success of [the bill of attainder and ex post facto]
arguments is the validity of characterizing the [complained
condition] as punishment.")

For Section 235 to be a bill of attainder, it must "inflict
punishment on the specified individual or group." Selective
Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group,
468 U.S. 841, 851 (1984). The Supreme Court, "[i]n deciding
whether a statute inflicts forbidden punishment," conducts
"three necessary inquiries: (1) whether the challenged
statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative
punishment; (2) whether the statute, viewed in terms of the
type of severity of burdens imposed, reasonably can be said
to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and (3)
whether the legislative record evinces a congressional
intent to punish." Id. at 852 (internal quotation marks
deleted). Although McVeigh asserts that "[t]he punitive
quality of Section 235 is obvious" (DE 1526 at 21), he
cites no case holding that televising trial proceedings
somehow constitutes punishment. Compare INS v.
Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032 (1984) (deportation not
punishment); Artway v. Attorney General of State of New
Jersey, 81 F.3d 1235, 1267 (3d Cir. 1996) (requirement that
convicted sex offenders register before moving into a
community not punishment). McVeigh further fails to
establish that Congress passed section 235 with the intent
to punish him; to the contrary, he concedes that "the
Anti-Terrorism Act has nonpunitive objectives." DE 1526 at
22.

For the same reason, section 235 also does not violate the
Ex Post Facto Clause, which prohibits statutes that "punish
as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent
when done; [] make more burdensome the punishment for a
crime, after its commission; [or] deprive one charged with
crime of any defense available according to law at the time
the act was committed." Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37,
52 (1990). McVeigh does not explain how the closed-circuit
televising of his trial to a select number of viewers in
Oklahoma City violates any of these prohibitions, nor could
he. Having such a limited audience view his trial can
hardly amount to punishment prohibited by the Constitution;
under McVeigh's logic, he would also be unconstitutionally
punished if his trial were held in a larger courtroom where
more victims could attend. Far from being a vehicle
designed to punish criminal defendants, Section 235
implements Congress' humane desire to permit victims of a
crime to view that trial when venue has been changed to a
distant locale.


C. Section 235 Does Not Deny Defendants Equal Protection Or
Due Process.

There is no basis for defendants' claims (DE 1516 at 11; DE
1526 at 41-42) that section 235 violates the equal
protection component of the Fifth Amendment. To the extent
that McVeigh and Nichols argue that the statute treats them
differently from other criminal defendants, the equal
protection guarantee provides them no relief. A law like
Section 235 that "neither burdens a fundamental right nor
targets a suspect class" does not violate equal protection
"so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate
end." Romer v. Evans, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 1627 (1996). The
statute furthers the legitimate (indeed, compelling)
interest of "permit[ting] victims of crime to watch
criminal trial proceedings," and Congress rationally
determined that closed-circuit broadcasting was necessary
to further this interest in cases where venue of the trial
is changed a great distance.

It is possible to construe defendants' briefs as also
raising an equal protection challenge to the statutory
distinction between victims (who are most likely to have a
compelling interest to view the closed-circuit broadcast in
Oklahoma City) and other members of the general public (who
are less likely to meet the statutory criteria for
closed-circuit viewing). McVeigh and Nichols, however, lack
standing to assert the equal protection rights of the
general public. See Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,
454 U.S. 464, 474 (1982) (litigant "must assert his own
legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to
relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties"
(internal quotation marks deleted)).

There would be no merit to any equal protection challenge
to Section 235 by members of the general public. The
category of people who are not victims does not comprise a
suspect class, nor is the ability to watch televised trial
proceedings a fundamental right. Congress legitimately
tailored Section 235 to victims because they stand on
separate footing from other individuals. Indeed, this Court
has recognized that they are in this case the "members of
the public who have been most directly affected by the
explosion which is the basis for the pending criminal
charges." DE 1625 at 2; cf. The Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491
U.S. 524, 537 (1989) (state's interests in shielding names
of rape victims were "highly significant"). As such,
Congress properly enacted Section 235 to provide only for
victims of a crime, and closed-circuit televising of the
proceedings rationally furthers its goal of permitting them
to watch the trial proceedings.


D. The Presence of Cameras in the Courtroom Does Not
Violate Defendants' Right to a Fair Trial.

McVeigh incorrectly relies on Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532
(1965), to support his argument that televising his
criminal trial would deny him due process and a fair trial.
DE 1526 at 26-29. In Chandler v. Florida, 449 U.S. 560
(1981), the Supreme Court stated "that Estes is not to be
read as announcing a constitutional rule barring still
photographic, radio, and television coverage in all cases
and under all circumstances," id. at 573, and further,
declined to promulgate such a rule. Id. at 579. The Court
noted that "[o]ther courts that have been asked to examine
the impact of television coverage on the participants in
particular trials have concluded that such coverage did not
have an adverse impact on the trial participants sufficient
to constitute a denial of due process." Id. at 579 n.12
(citing Bell v. Patterson, 279 F. Supp. 760 (D. Col.),
aff'd, 402 F.2d 394 (10th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 403
U.S. 955 (1971)). This reasoning applies with even greater
force here because Section 235 only provides for the
closed-circuit broadcast of trial proceedings -- in effect,
an expansion of the courtroom -- not the public broadcast
approved by the Supreme Court in Chandler.

McVeigh objects (DE 1526 at 32-33) that the specter of
public observation brought to the jurors' attention by the
mere presence of cameras in the courtroom will prejudice
his ability to obtain a fair trial. See also DE 1516 at
15-16. He does not explain how the cameras themselves will
result in such prejudice, when the very nature of the trial
itself, including a courtroom and court plaza filled daily
with reporters, will not. In any event, this argument was
rejected by the Court in Chandler. "To demonstrate
prejudice in a specific case a defendant must show
something more than juror awareness that the trial is such
as to attract the attention of broadcasters." Chandler, 449
U.S. at 581 (citing Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 800
(1975)). Indeed, the jurors in this case surely will be
instructed to disregard the presence of the camera(s) in
the courtroom, and to decide the case based only on the
evidence presented in court. See United States v. Lonedog,
929 F.2d 568, 576 (10th Cir.) (jurors presumed to follow
their instructions), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 854 (1991).
Moreover, potential jurors can be asked during voir dire,
as they were in Chandler, "if the presence of the camera[s]
would in any way compromise their ability to consider the
case." Id. at 581.

McVeigh lacks standing to argue (DE 1526 at 31-32) that
section 235 is unconstitutional because it may be applied
in other cases where the presence of cameras would deny
some hypothetical defendant the right to a fair trial. See
County Court of Ulster County, New York v. Allen, 442 U.S.
140, 155 (1979) ("if there is no constitutional defect in
the application of the statute to a litigant, he does not
have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if
applied to third parties in hypothetical situations");
United States v. Mendes, 912 F.2d 434, 439-40 (10th Cir.
1990) (defendant lacks standing to challenge an allegedly
unconstitutional aspect of 21 U.S.C. 841(b) because the
statute was constitutional as applied to him). Because
defendants have not demonstrated that the presence of
cameras in the courtroom would deny them their rights to a
fair trial, Section 235 is constitutional.

CONCLUSION

Section 235 clearly, and constitutionally, applies to this
case. The Court should schedule a hearing to deal with the
technological issues involved in establishing
closed-circuit broadcasting of the trial proceedings back
to Oklahoma City.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO

Chief Judge Richard P. Matsch

Criminal Action No. 96-CR-68-M

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Plaintiff.

vs.

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH
and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS,

Defendants.

SUPPLEMENTAL MEMO OF DEFENDANT TIMOTHY JAMES MCVEIGH
TO GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISING
OF TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

Counsel for Timothy McVeigh files this memorandum with the
Court supplementing his Response to the Government's Motion
For Closed-Circuit Televising of the Trial Proceedings.
Additional authority is given to establish that Section 235
of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act is
unconstitutional because it violates the separation of
powers doctrine and it denies Timothy McVeigh equal
protection of the laws.

The effect of Section 235 is a commandment by Congress that
this Court decide an issue in this case, that is, the issue
of providing closed-circuit television, in a particular
way. As early as 1872 it was decided that if a legislative
act orders a court to decide a pending case in a particular
manner, then this enactment violates the constitutional
doctrine of separation of powers. United States v. Klein,
80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1872).

The plaintiff in Klein sued to obtain the return of his
property based under a statute which gave confederate
landowners the ability to recover their property upon proof
of loyalty to the federal government. Prior decisions by
the Supreme Court held that a presidential pardon was
sufficient proof of loyalty under the statute, so the lower
court held for the plaintiff. The government appealed this
decision and while the case was on appeal, Congress changed
the effect of a presidential pardon by passing a statute
which provided that a presidential pardon was, under most
circumstances, conclusive proof of disloyalty. The Supreme
Court declared this new statute unconstitutional because
Congress had "passed the limit which separates the
legislative from the judicial power" by commanding a court
to decide a pending case in a particular manner. 80 U.S.
(13 Wall.) at 146-147. The Court ruled that Congress could
not prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department
in cases pending before it. Id. at 146. It found that the
statute's "great and controlling purpose [was] to deny to
pardons granted by the President the effect which this
Court had adjudged them to have." Id. at 145 (emphasis
added).

"The great and controlling purpose" of Section 235 is for
this court to disregard, in this case, the rules
prohibiting broadcasts of criminal trials.

The legislative history to Section 235 illustrates that it
was tailor-made for those victims affected by the Oklahoma
City bombing, regardless of whether or not it will actually
apply. In fact, in the initial offering of this amendment
to the House, Representative Frank Lucas said it was
specifically enacted because this Court had ruled that in
this case, cameras would be impermissible in the courtroom.
Representative Lucas said:


I support this amendment because among other things, it
provides for closed-circuit broadcasting of court
proceedings in cases where a trial has been moved out of
State, and more than 350 miles from the location where the
proceedings would have taken place. I appreciate the
chairman and his staff's efforts on this provision.

As the Member of Congress who represents downtown Oklahoma
City, I believe this provision is crucial, especially in
light of the upcoming trial of the suspects in the bombing
of the Alfred P. Murrah building. Recently, this trial was
moved from Oklahoma City to Denver. and the judge ruled
cameras impermissible in the courtroom.

For the victims and survivors of this, the worst terrorist
attack to occur on U.S. soil, the trial and any subsequent
punishment of those who committed this heinous crime are
part of the healing process. For most, this is a time to
rebuilt their lives, therefore the upheaval of going to
Denver to watch the trial seems cruel and unfair.


See Exhibit A (142 Cong. Rec. H 2165-2166 [daily ed. March
13, 1996] [emphasis added]).

Throughout the debates it was argued that the
closed-circuit provision needed to be passed so that the
victims in Oklahoma City could view the trial without
traveling to Denver. Representative Hyde, who originally
sponsored the closed-circuit amendment to the Anti
Terrorism Bill, said this amendment would allow the victims
in Oklahoma City to view the trial in Denver. See Exhibit
A (142 Cong. Rec. H 2165-2166 [daily ed. March 13, 1996]).

Oklahoma Representative Istook further argued in support of
this section: "Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, this portion of
the amendment specifies that [it] shall be a closed-circuit
rebroadcast back to the original location, to Oklahoma
City, for the benefit of those who are victims...." Id.
(emphasis added). Interestingly, Representative Istook
incorrectly stated that "the Judicial Conference of the
United States has endorsed this approach". Id. The Judicial
Conference specifically stated "that Section 235, if
enacted, should be modified to provide that any requirement
that courts order closed-circuit televising of criminal
proceedings should be made discretionary with the judge."
News Release, Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
March 12, 1996 (emphasis added).

Senator Hatch added: "[B]y providing for closed-circuit
viewing of the Oklahoma City trial by the bombing's victims
and survivors, this bill also will ensure that these
courageous people can observe justice being done, while
still ensuring a fair and just trial for the accused." See
Exhibit B (142 Cong. Rec. S 3476-3477 [daily ed. April 17,
1996]). Senator Nichols said,


It does allow closed-circuit TV for families in the
Oklahoma City bombing. Right now the trial, regrettably, is
going to be in Denver. That is over 500 miles from Oklahoma
City. They want to be able to view the trial and not have
to move their families to Denver. We requested assistance
from Justice' but they did not make it happen. We make it
happen in this legislation....


Id. (emphasis added).

In a letter to President Clinton urging that he sign this
legislation, Governor Keating described Section 235 as "a
provision allowing for the closed-circuit viewing of the
trial by families and victims who cannot be accommodated by
the courtroom in Denver". Id. Instead of describing the
bill in its technical terms, Congressman Lucas simply said,
"Support closed-circuit broadcasting of the Oklahoma City
bombing trial for its victims. Support H.R. 2703". See
Exhibit C (142 Cong. Rec. H 2141 [daily ed. March 13,
1996]).

Members of Congress announced publically that Section 235
was enacted to "allow for closed circuit TV so that the
families of the victims won't have to incur the
inconvenience and expense of going all the way to Denver."
See Exhibit D (Oklahoma City media transcript, Channel
KWTV, 4/18/96, 5:00 p.m. & 10:00 p.m. and Oklahoma City
media transcript, Channel KFOR, 4/18/96, 5:00 p.m.).

There is not one element of this section which does not
attempt to fit the specific facts of this case. After it
was reported to Congress that cameras had already been
disallowed in the courtroom in this case, Congress objected
to this perceived legal decision and told this court how to
decide the issue of cameras in the courtroom in this case.
Section 235 does not permit this court to exercise its
constitutional powers of independent adjudication as to
issues pending before it. Congress has passed the limit
which separates legislative duties from judicial duties by
commanding this court to decide this issue in a particular
manner. Congress has impermissibly invaded the province of
the courts and has eroded the institutional integrity of
the judiciary.

Section 235 violates equal protection guarantees, as
incorporated in the due process clause, because its intent
is to favor a certain class of people, that is, victims who
reside in the state of Oklahoma, over a disfavored class,
that is, family members of the defendants who are also
victims of this offense. "Victim" is expansively defined in
42 U.S.C. Sec. 10607(e)(2) as a person who has "suffered
direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as the result
of commission of a crime ...." (emphasis added). One cannot
doubt the fact that regardless of whether Timothy McVeigh
and Terry Nichols are ultimately acquitted, their family
members are actual victims of this offense.

It was an obvious aim of Congress to adversely impact a
disfavored class - family members of the defendants. This
impartiality has always been suspect. Romer v. Evans, 64

(1980) [Stephens, J., concurring]).

Justice Kennedy explained:


A law declaring that in general it shall be more difficult
for one group of citizens than for all others to seek aid
from the government is itself a denial of equal protection

<P>In a June 28 pre-trial hearing, Marife Nichols, the Philippine-born wife of Oklahoma City bombing suspect Terry Nichols, said she is unfamiliar with U.S. customs and was "confused" shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing when the FBI questioned her in a windowless room for nearly six hours. She told the court she felt that she had no choice but to sign consent forms allowing authorities to search her home and a truck. Defense lawyers want evidence obtained in this search thrown out, claiming it was obtained through coercion.</P>

 22                             PROCEEDINGS

 23       (In open court at 9:00 a.m.)

 24            THE COURT:  Please be seated.  Good morning.

 25            MR. HARTZLER:  Good morning.



                                                                  600



  1            MR. TIGAR:  Good morning.

  2            MR. JONES:  Good morning.

  3            THE COURT:  Appearances are the same?

  4            MR. HARTZLER:  That's correct, your Honor.

  5            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.

  6            MR. JONES:  That's correct, your Honor.

  7            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Neureiter, you were

  8   examining our witness and you continue under the oath, of

  9   course, that you took with us yesterday.

 10            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

 11            THE COURT:  You may proceed.

 12                    DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED

 13   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 14   Q.  Good morning, Agent.

 15   A.  Good morning.

 16   Q.  Yesterday, you said you were part of the S.W.A.T. team;

 17   correct?

 18   A.  Yes, sir.

 19   Q.  I asked you if you were in battle attire and you said no.

 20   A.  That's correct.

 21   Q.  You did have your S.W.A.T. gear with you; isn't that right?

 22   A.  We had our S.W.A.T. gear with us when we arrived in Fort

 23   Riley.

 24   Q.  In Fort Riley.  Did you take that S.W.A.T. gear with you to

 25   Herington?



                                                                  601



  1   A.  I would have had some of my equipment -- my personal

  2   equipment because I had my vehicle.  Most of our special

  3   equipment is contained in one vehicle we left in Fort Riley.

  4   Q.  I see.  But you had your own personal equipment with you

  5   when you went to Herington?

  6   A.  Yes, sir.

  7   Q.  And S.W.A.T. stands for?

  8   A.  Special Weapons and Tactics.

  9   Q.  So you had some of those special weapons with you when you

 10   went to Herington?

 11   A.  No.  The weapons would have been secured at Fort Riley,

 12   other than my sidearm.

 13   Q.  All right.  I'd like you to look at some of the photographs

 14   that have been brought to court, Exhibits W66 and 67 in the

 15   second black notebook.  Those would be defense exhibits.  Just

 16   take a look at those.

 17            I'll represent to you that those are photographs that

 18   have been provided to us by the Government, aerial photographs

 19   of the area around 109 South 2nd Street.  Does that area look

 20   familiar to you in either of the two photographs?

 21   A.  Yes, sir.  Both.

 22   Q.  And could you point out for the Court on either 66 or 67

 23   which house indicated in those photographs is Mr. Nichols'

 24   house?

 25   A.  On 66, it's the middle house on the block.  The picture



                                                                  602



  1   would be from the rear of the house.

  2   Q.  And that -- it's the house, then, just to clarify, that has

  3   what appears to be the garage and shed closest to the home,

  4   correct, of the houses along that lot?

  5   A.  Yes, sir.

  6            THE COURT:  Are these stipulated exhibits?  Is there

  7   any objection to these exhibits?

  8            MR. MACKEY:  None at all, your Honor.

  9            THE COURT:  All right.

 10            MR. NIGH:  No objection.

 11            THE COURT:  W66 and W67?

 12            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.

 13            THE COURT:  Received.

 14   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 15   Q.  And there are -- why don't we just look at 67 for a second,

 16   Agent.  You see two houses on either side of the Nichols home;

 17   correct?

 18   A.  Yes, sir.

 19   Q.  And those two houses are physically similar to the Nichols

 20   home, again with the exception of the Nichols home having the

 21   shed or the garage closer to the home; correct?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  They look just about the same from the outside; right?

 24   A.  They are white structures, yes, sir, very similar.

 25   Q.  Okay.  Now, if you could turn to the white book.  I



                                                                  603



  1   apologize for flipping through these different exhibits, but

  2   the white book.  Exhibits 9, 10 and 11.  Now we're down out of

  3   the airplane and we're ground level.  If you could describe

  4   sequentially what the views of 9, 10 and 11 are and whether you

  5   recognize those views.

  6   A.  No. 9 is a view from the street of the Nichols residence,

  7   109 South 2nd.  And I do recognize that.

  8   Q.  That's taken from across South 2nd Street; correct?

  9   A.  Yes, sir.

 10   Q.  Okay.  Exhibit 10?

 11   A.  That would be of the same residence.  This would be taken

 12   from the field behind the Nichols residence.

 13   Q.  And that is the shed or the garage that you see the lower

 14   structure in front of the house from this view; is that

 15   correct?

 16   A.  Yes, sir.

 17   Q.  And Exhibit 11?

 18   A.  11 is also from the back or the west side of the Nichols

 19   residence and to the south, looking at the -- at the shed and

 20   garage to the left and then the house on the right.

 21   Q.  All right.  And just to clarify, the shed is to the left

 22   there, and there are a series of windows there on the wall of

 23   the shed?

 24   A.  Yes, sir.

 25   Q.  And protecting those windows is a wire fence; is that



                                                                  604



  1   right?

  2   A.  Yes, sir.  There was a wire fence between the -- the person

  3   taking this picture and the windows.

  4   Q.  All right.  Let's go back to April 21, 1995.  You arrived

  5   at the Nichols home at what time?

  6   A.  Between 5:30 and 6.

  7   Q.  And from the outside of the house, using these photographs

  8   to refresh your recollection -- and I'm speaking of Exhibits 9,

  9   10, 11 -- there is nothing that distinguished that house from

 10   any of the other houses visually along that street; correct?

 11   A.  The numbers on the front porch.

 12   Q.  That distinguished it.  There was nothing -- well, let's

 13   put it this way, you didn't see a fire coming out of the home;

 14   correct?

 15   A.  No, sir, I did not.

 16   Q.  You didn't see anybody firing a gun from the outside --

 17   from the outside of the home, you didn't see anybody inside the

 18   home firing a gun, did you?

 19            MR. MACKEY:  Objection.  Relevancy.

 20            THE COURT:  I don't understand this question.

 21            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor, the Government has put

 22   forward the theory that Agent Reightler was permitted to walk

 23   onto the premises because of exigent circumstances.

 24            THE COURT:  Well, all right.  But let's get to

 25   something.  These questions are -- you don't have any basis for



                                                                  605



  1   asking that somebody was firing a gun, do you?

  2            MR. NEUREITER:  No, your Honor.

  3            THE COURT:  You're wasting time then.  Get to it.

  4            MR. NEUREITER:  Very well, your Honor.

  5   BY MR. NEUREITER:

  6   Q.  This was just a small house in the middle of a small town

  7   in Kansas; correct?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  And from the time you arrived on the scene at 6:00, you

 10   knew that nobody had entered the property from 3:20 when

 11   surveillance was set up around the home or when security was

 12   first set up around the home; correct?

 13   A.  I was told that no one had gone into the residence, yes.

 14   Q.  All right.  And from 6:00 -- 5:30, 6:00, when you arrived

 15   at the property, to about 8:30 p.m., nothing else had happened

 16   within the home to raise any suspicions in your mind that

 17   something was happening inside the home; correct?

 18   A.  Not that I was aware of.

 19   Q.  By the way, looking at those photographs, Exhibits 9, 10

 20   and 11, do you see small digital numbers in the lower

 21   right-hand corner?  On Exhibit 9, it reads 21-1654?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  And in Exhibit 10, it reads 21-1700?

 24   A.  Yes, sir.

 25   Q.  And in Exhibit 11, it reads 21-1703?



                                                                  606



  1   A.  Yes, sir.

  2   Q.  Those numbers indicate the date and the time that the

  3   photographs were taken, isn't that correct?

  4            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, excuse me.  I'd object to any

  5   further questions about the content of the pictures until they

  6   are in evidence.

  7            THE COURT:  They ought to be in evidence.

  8            MR. MACKEY:  I'd stipulate to their admission.

  9            MR. NEUREITER:  I'm merely inquiring about the

 10   significance of the numbers.

 11            THE COURT:  You're dealing with the content of the

 12   exhibit.  Are you going to offer the exhibits?

 13            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.

 14            THE COURT:  Then do so.

 15            MR. NEUREITER:  I offer 9, 10 and 11, your Honor.

 16            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 17            THE COURT:  All right.  They are received.

 18   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 19   Q.  Those represent the date and time; right?

 20   A.  I believe so, yes, sir.

 21   Q.  Is there anything missing from those photographs that

 22   springs to mind as you look at them now?

 23   A.  I wasn't there at the time indicated on the -- on the film,

 24   so I couldn't comment on what's missing.

 25   Q.  Okay.  Look back at the surveillance log, which is



                                                                  607



  1   Government Exhibit 29 in the white book, please.  Do you see

  2   the entry on page 3, 4:20 p.m.?

  3   A.  Yes, sir.

  4   Q.  Remember yesterday we reviewed that three FBI agents, as is

  5   the policy if the FBI reviewed this activity observed there,

  6   security tape is placed there by officers and Special Agents

  7   Lindsley and Maxwell, and they signed off on that, that that

  8   occurred at 4:20 p.m.?

  9   A.  That's what it indicates, yes, sir.

 10   Q.  And then if you look back at the photographs, Government

 11   Exhibit 9, 10 and 11, the times there were 4:54, 1700 and --

 12   excuse me -- 5:00 in the afternoon and then 5:03 in the

 13   afternoon?

 14   A.  That's what's indicated, yes, sir.

 15   Q.  And is there any security tape around the house in those

 16   photographs?

 17   A.  No, sir.

 18   Q.  So -- please look at Government Exhibit 12 and 13, please.

 19   A.  Yes, sir.

 20   Q.  Are those schematics of the property -- is Government

 21   Exhibit 12 a schematic of the house and the shed with a scale?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  And is Government Exhibit 13 an enlarged schematic of the

 24   garage and the south shed?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  608



  1   Q.  And do those truly and accurately reflect your recollection

  2   of the dimensions of the home and the positioning of the fence

  3   and the shed when you were there on April 21, 1995?

  4   A.  The outside dimensions, I would say yes.  I was never

  5   inside the house.

  6   Q.  You did look inside the garage, though, at one point,

  7   didn't you?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  Okay.  These do truly and accurately reflect your

 10   recollection of the outside of the house and the garage?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12            MR. NEUREITER:  I would offer Government Exhibit 12

 13   and 13 at this time, your Honor.

 14            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 15            THE COURT:  They are received.

 16   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 17   Q.  And from the scale on Exhibit 13, it shows that that fence

 18   is approximately five feet from the shed; is that correct?  The

 19   one that's protecting the windows?

 20   A.  That's what it appears, yes, sir.

 21   Q.  All right.  You eventually entered onto the Nichols

 22   property; is that correct?

 23   A.  Yes, sir.

 24   Q.  And you went onto the Nichols property for the first time

 25   at about 8:30 p.m.?



                                                                  609



  1   A.  No, sir.  It would have been before sundown.  It would have

  2   been about 6 or 6:30.

  3   Q.  You went onto the property around 6 or 6:30 that evening?

  4   A.  Yes, sir.

  5   Q.  Shortly after you arrived then; is that right?

  6   A.  Yes, sir.

  7   Q.  And at the time you went onto the property, you knew that

  8   there had been nonstop surveillance and security on the house

  9   since 3:20 p.m.; is that correct?

 10   A.  I wasn't sure of the time.  I knew agents had been there

 11   for quite some time before I arrived.

 12   Q.  And the evidence log, Exhibit 29, says that at 3 -- on page

 13   2 of 3, says that at 3:20 p.m., Agents Maxwell and Barger

 14   arrived to secure the premises; isn't that right?

 15   A.  Yes, sir.

 16   Q.  So that would indicate that at the time you went on the

 17   property, between -- you said 6:30 that evening, that it was --

 18   about three hours had transpired when nothing had happened and

 19   nobody had gone onto the property; correct?

 20   A.  As far as I knew, yes, sir.

 21   Q.  And you decided to go onto the property and look around

 22   because no other law enforcement officers had gone onto the

 23   property; correct?

 24   A.  At that time, I was going onto the property to look around.

 25   I was moving from the front of the house to the rear of the



                                                                  610



  1   house to contact the other officers and to acquaint myself with

  2   the -- with the property.  I had never been there before, and I

  3   was going to be responsible for securing that throughout the

  4   night.

  5   Q.  So you went onto the property to look around to become

  6   familiar with this house that you were going to be securing; is

  7   that correct?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  Did there come a time when you decided to start looking

 10   into the windows of the home and the garage?

 11   A.  Yes, sir.

 12   Q.  And what time was that?

 13   A.  The first time I looked into the house -- into the window

 14   of the garage or shed area was after dark.  I would estimate

 15   8:30.

 16   Q.  8:30 p.m.?

 17   A.  Yes, sir.

 18   Q.  That's two hours after you'd initially entered onto the

 19   property; is that right?

 20   A.  Yes, sir.

 21   Q.  And had anything transpired in the two hours between when

 22   you first entered onto the property and 8:30 p.m. when you

 23   started to look through the windows of the garage on the

 24   property, itself?

 25   A.  The sun had gone down.



                                                                  611



  1   Q.  Nothing else, though?

  2   A.  No, sir.

  3   Q.  All right.  And the sun had gone down on all the houses

  4   around; right?

  5   A.  Yes, sir.

  6   Q.  Okay.  So it wasn't specific just to that house that the

  7   sun had gone down; correct?

  8   A.  No, sir.

  9   Q.  You started to look in the windows; correct?

 10   A.  I looked in one window, yes, sir.

 11   Q.  You only looked in one window?

 12   A.  Yes, sir.

 13   Q.  You didn't try and look into the windows of the house

 14   itself?

 15   A.  I looked at the windows.  They were -- all had window

 16   coverings over them.

 17   Q.  Did you have a flashlight with you when you looked into the

 18   window of the garage?

 19   A.  Yes, sir, I did.

 20   Q.  Did you shine the flashlight into the window of the garage?

 21   A.  Yes, sir.

 22   Q.  By the way, you didn't believe you were going onto the

 23   property to look into the windows pursuant to a consent signed

 24   by Marife Nichols, did you?

 25   A.  I had been told that the property owners had given us



                                                                  612



  1   consent to search the residence.

  2   Q.  The property owners?

  3   A.  Yes, sir.

  4   Q.  You specifically recall that it was a plural, not a

  5   singular?

  6   A.  No.  I can't recall specifically.  I was told that we had

  7   consent to search the residence.

  8   Q.  In -- what words precisely were you told?

  9   A.  That we had a signed consent to -- I'm not sure if it was

 10   signed.  We had consent from the -- the people at the residence

 11   that we were -- could search it.

 12   Q.  And what time were you told that?

 13   A.  I -- exact time, I can't give you, but when we went to the

 14   residence at approximately 6 p.m., I believe that we had

 15   consent then.

 16   Q.  Okay.  You believe that -- who told you -- where were you

 17   when you were told that you had consent?  Were you back at

 18   Herington or were you back at the Herington Department of

 19   Public Safety or were you on the property?

 20   A.  I believe that we were at the Herington Public Safety

 21   Office.

 22   Q.  And who was it who told you that you had consent to search

 23   the property?

 24   A.  It would either have been our Assistant Special Agent in

 25   Charge Watson or Special Agent Roll.



                                                                  613



  1   Q.  But you decided to go onto the property because no other

  2   law enforcement officers had entered the residence or the

  3   detached garage; correct?

  4   A.  I -- I walked down the sidewalk and crossed the property to

  5   contact agents in the back the first time.

  6   Q.  You looked into the windows of the garage because no other

  7   law enforcement officers had been into the residence or the

  8   garage; correct?

  9   A.  Yes, sir.

 10   Q.  And because you believed you had consent; right?

 11   A.  And I was concerned about a threat inside the garage.

 12   Q.  But there was nothing specifically about the garage, no

 13   movement, no sound, nothing specifically about the garage that

 14   raised any alarm in your mind that had developed between the

 15   time you arrived on the property at 3:20 and the time you

 16   looked in the window; correct?

 17   A.  Correct.

 18   Q.  You saw something inside the garage; correct?

 19   A.  Yes, sir.

 20   Q.  Where were you standing?  And I will refer you now to the

 21   schematics, either Government Exhibit 12 or 13, whichever one

 22   you find more useful, in pointing out where you were.  Where

 23   were you standing when you looked inside the garage?  And you

 24   might want to tell us in your answer which window you looked

 25   through.



                                                                  614



  1   A.  I was standing on the sidewalk.  If you would look at the

  2   Exhibit 13, the schematic of the garage and shed, there's a

  3   sidewalk between the fence and the south shed, and I was

  4   standing on that sidewalk.  And it was -- it would have been

  5   the second window from the -- from the end with the garbage

  6   can.

  7   Q.  Was there a particular reason why you picked that window?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  There was a rip in the window shade; right?

 10   A.  Yes, sir.

 11   Q.  And all the other windows had the window shades down and it

 12   was difficult to see inside; correct?

 13   A.  Yes, sir.

 14   Q.  Does it look like the person who owned that property wanted

 15   to protect the privacy of the things inside?  Correct?

 16            MR. MACKEY:  Objection.

 17            THE COURT:  Sustained.

 18   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 19   Q.  What did you see when you looked inside?

 20   A.  I -- I noticed some hardware and tools that you might

 21   typically expect to find in a garage.  I also noticed some

 22   white plastic barrels; a large number of ammunition cans,

 23   military style; and a couple fuel cans.

 24   Q.  Those would be just gasoline cans; right?

 25   A.  Yes, sir.



                                                                  615



  1   Q.  Like anybody would have gas for their mower in the garage;

  2   right?

  3   A.  Yes, sir.

  4   Q.  You then went back and had a meeting with a number of other

  5   agents; correct?

  6   A.  Later that evening, yes, sir.

  7   Q.  And you told them about seeing what you'd seen, and they

  8   told you some things; correct?

  9   A.  Not -- I did not bring that topic up at that time, no, sir.

 10   Q.  You didn't bring up the topic of -- poorly phrased

 11   question.

 12            You went back and had meetings with other agents;

 13   correct?

 14   A.  Yes, sir.

 15   Q.  What did you learn in those meetings with other agents?

 16   A.  That we would -- we were going to be seeking a search

 17   warrant for the property and that more information was being

 18   developed as we -- as we all hoped at the Oklahoma City bombing

 19   site.

 20   Q.  Did you tell them what you'd seen inside the garage?

 21   A.  Not then.

 22   Q.  When did you tell other agents what you'd seen inside the

 23   garage?

 24   A.  During that briefing, sir, one -- the questions that the

 25   special agent in charge, Mr. Tubbs, asked was if any of us were



                                                                  616



  1   going to be participating in the search the next day and I was

  2   assigned to be there.  He advised us that the bomb technicians

  3   at the bombing site had informed him that the bomb had likely

  4   been contained in white plastic containers with blue lids and

  5   that we should keep our eyes open for those during the search

  6   the next day and if they were observed during the search, to

  7   let them know immediately.

  8   Q.  And you then explained that you had seen precisely such

  9   barrels; correct?

 10   A.  No, sir.

 11   Q.  You did not.  When did you tell someone what you had seen

 12   inside the garage?

 13   A.  I -- I thought that I had seen something like that in the

 14   garage and questioned myself if -- if I looked closely enough

 15   at that -- to determine if it was a threat, if there were wires

 16   coming from it or some kind of timing device.  I went back

 17   to -- to ensure that it was not an obvious bomb or device in

 18   the garage.

 19   Q.  And you went back to the same position where you'd been

 20   before?

 21   A.  Yes, sir.

 22   Q.  And you went back and read some things on the side of the

 23   barrels; is that correct?

 24   A.  Yes, sir.

 25   Q.  And you smelled something that time; correct?



                                                                  617



  1   A.  I smelled an odor throughout that day.

  2   Q.  You smelled an odor throughout that day?

  3   A.  Yes, sir.

  4   Q.  Do you remember writing a 302 of your experiences on

  5   April 21?

  6   A.  Yes, sir.

  7   Q.  Why don't you look at Exhibit B2.

  8   A.  B2?

  9   Q.  Yes.

 10   A.  Is that the -- black book or white book?

 11   Q.  That is in the first black book.

 12   A.  Yes, sir.

 13   Q.  And is this the 302 that you wrote four days or three days

 14   after April 21, 1995?

 15   A.  Yes, sir.

 16   Q.  And on the second page at the bottom of that first

 17   paragraph, you write, While standing near the garage, S. A.

 18   Reightler also noticed a strong ammonia-type odor?

 19   A.  Yes, sir.

 20   Q.  All right.  You hadn't -- and that sentence comes after

 21   your description of arriving on the property and -- arriving at

 22   the property, going into the garage, onto the property the

 23   first time to look into the garage, going and having your

 24   meeting and then returning to the property a second time;

 25   correct?



                                                                  618



  1   A.  Yes, sir.

  2   Q.  All right.  And everything else in this flows in a

  3   chronological order; correct?

  4   A.  Yes, sir.

  5   Q.  So you didn't put that you'd smelled the odor around the

  6   paragraphs that described your first arriving at the property

  7   and first going into the garage; correct?

  8   A.  Correct.

  9   Q.  That comes afterwards; right?

 10   A.  Correct.

 11   Q.  So from reading this, it would suggest that you smelled the

 12   odor the second time that you went on the property; correct?

 13            MR. MACKEY:  Objection.  The document speaks for

 14   itself.

 15            THE COURT:  Sustained.

 16   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 17   Q.  Then what did you do after -- after you -- you read what

 18   was on the barrels, you went back and reported to someone;

 19   isn't that right?

 20   A.  Yes, sir.

 21   Q.  And that person told you to go and report to Mr. Rathbun,

 22   isn't that correct?

 23   A.  Yes, sir.

 24   Q.  He was the United States Attorney for Kansas; correct?

 25   A.  Correct.



                                                                  619



  1   Q.  And Mr. Rathbun -- what did you tell Mr. Rathbun?

  2   A.  I gave him the -- the story of what had -- had eventually

  3   appeared in this 302 of my activities throughout that afternoon

  4   and what I had observed.

  5   Q.  And did you tell him why you had initially gone onto the

  6   property to look into the window of the garage?

  7   A.  Yes, sir.

  8   Q.  Did he ask you about that?

  9   A.  I don't recall if he asked me, but I remember telling him

 10   this is what I did and why I did it.

 11   Q.  You know that white barrels are used in dairies all over

 12   Kansas; isn't that correct?

 13            MR. MACKEY:  Objection.  Lack of foundation.

 14            THE COURT:  Ask him do you know.

 15   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 16   Q.  Do you know that white barrels are used in dairies all over

 17   Kansas?

 18   A.  I'm not real familiar with the dairy business, sir.

 19            MR. NEUREITER:  Thank you, your Honor.

 20   BY MR. NEUREITER:

 21   Q.  Do you know now that white barrels are sold in dairies

 22   around Kansas?

 23   A.  I know that barrels from -- other agents who have been

 24   investigating this have contacted dairies with barrels

 25   throughout Kansas, yes, sir.



                                                                  620



  1   Q.  And have you learned from speaking with those other agents

  2   that those barrels are used in -- as cleaning solvents in

  3   dairies?

  4   A.  Yes, sir.

  5   Q.  And you have learned in speaking with those other agents

  6   that those barrels are then frequently sent to recycling

  7   centers and are resold and distributed throughout Kansas;

  8   correct?

  9   A.  Yes, sir.

 10            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor, we would offer three 302's

 11   which are not on the exhibit list that will be marked at W80,

 12   W81 and W82.  And I have copies for the Court and counsel.

 13            MR. MACKEY:  Judge, if I could have a moment to read

 14   them and --

 15            THE COURT:  Yes, of course.  Are these from this agent

 16   or --

 17            MR. NEUREITER:  No, your Honor, but they confirm what

 18   this agent just testified to.

 19            THE COURT:  I don't think this goes to the witness;

 20   right?

 21            MR. NEUREITER:  No.  Just to your Honor and the clerk.

 22   If I could have --

 23            THE COURT:  Instead of calling witnesses to prove what

 24   you've just been talking about, you're suggesting that we use

 25   these 302's?



                                                                  621



  1            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.  They were provided

  2   to us by the Government.

  3            THE COURT:  Any problem with that?

  4            MR. MACKEY:  My concern is it's obviously not relevant

  5   to the state of information known to this agent.

  6            THE COURT:  Well, I understand that.

  7            MR. MACKEY:  With that noted, we have no objection.

  8            THE COURT:  All right.  I'll receive W80, W81, and

  9   W82.

 10            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.  If I could have just

 11   a moment.

 12            THE COURT:  All right.

 13            MR. NEUREITER:  Pass the witness.

 14            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Mackey, do you have any

 15   questions?

 16            MR. MACKEY:  I do, your Honor.

 17                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

 18   BY MR. MACKEY:

 19   Q.  Agent Reightler tell the Court again, please, when you

 20   first started working for the FBI.

 21   A.  I began working for the FBI in April of 1988.

 22   Q.  That was not your first line of employment, was it?

 23   A.  No, sir.

 24   Q.  What was it?

 25   A.  Following graduation from college, I was -- I worked as a



                                                                  622



  1   conditioning coach for the Old Dominion University in Norfolk,

  2   Virginia, and a YMCA director in Norfolk and Chesapeake,

  3   Virginia.

  4   Q.  Tell the Court a little bit about the nature of your case

  5   work since joining the FBI in 1988.

  6   A.  I've primarily been assigned to drug investigations and

  7   violent crime investigations.

  8   Q.  And in that role, is it your responsibility to gather

  9   information concerning possible violations of federal law --

 10   A.  Yes, sir.

 11   Q.  -- in those matters?

 12            So you are principally a full-time investigator of

 13   federal crime?

 14   A.  Yes, sir.

 15   Q.  Among your other duties, have you been assigned to the

 16   S.W.A.T. team?

 17   A.  Yes, sir.

 18   Q.  When was the first time?

 19   A.  In 1992.

 20   Q.  All right.  And you were a member of the S.W.A.T. team then

 21   in April of 1995?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  Could you acquaint the Court, Agent Reightler, a little bit

 24   about the responsibilities of a S.W.A.T. team member.

 25   A.  Your Honor, the primary role of the S.W.A.T. team member in



                                                                  623



  1   the FBI is as an investigator.  That's their primary job.  The

  2   S.W.A.T. team responsibilities are collateral or extra duties.

  3   We train one to two days a month in the -- in the extra

  4   activities, firearms and tactics that we use.  The -- it is not

  5   a full-time job.  It is called out on specific assignments.  I

  6   typically -- high-risk arrests or service of search warrants in

  7   high-risk situations.

  8   Q.  So it would be fair to say it's a collection of agents with

  9   specialized training for special circumstances?

 10   A.  Yes, sir.

 11   Q.  And those circumstances would be crimes that involved

 12   violence?

 13   A.  Yes, sir.

 14   Q.  Threat of violence; is that correct?

 15   A.  Yes, sir.

 16   Q.  And on April 21, 1995, you were investigating, were you

 17   not, with other FBI agents the bombing -- the violent bombing

 18   of the Murrah Building; correct?

 19   A.  Yes, sir.

 20   Q.  As a S.W.A.T. team, you were dispatched from Kansas City

 21   and drove to Fort Riley?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  Did you leave Fort Riley as a S.W.A.T. team?

 24   A.  We were assigned as investigators to go to Herington.

 25   Q.  So your role had resumed to your full-time job of gathering



                                                                  624



  1   facts to support --

  2            MR. NEUREITER:  Object to leading, your Honor.

  3            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  4   BY MR. MACKEY:

  5   Q.  The several members of the S.W.A.T. team, how did they make

  6   their way from Fort Riley to Herington?

  7   A.  We combined into two vehicles and drove to the Herington

  8   Public Safety Building.

  9   Q.  So you carpooled with your vehicle and the sedan that you

 10   described earlier?

 11   A.  Yes, sir.

 12   Q.  When you got to the police station in Herington, you met

 13   with other representatives from the FBI?

 14   A.  Yes, sir.

 15   Q.  And it was at that time that you learned of your new

 16   assignment to secure the premises --

 17            MR. NEUREITER:  Object to leading, your Honor.

 18            THE COURT:  Well, he's sort of reviewing past

 19   testimony, and I'm not sure we need to do that, either.

 20            MR. MACKEY:  I'll be more direct, your Honor.

 21            THE COURT:  Thank you.

 22   BY MR. MACKEY:

 23   Q.  At that time, Agent Reightler, could you describe what your

 24   understanding was about the consent that had been obtained with

 25   regard to that residence?



                                                                  625



  1   A.  We were -- met -- we met with uniformed officers from

  2   Herington and the county and were briefed by Assistant Special

  3   Agent in Charge Watson.  And included in that briefing was

  4   the -- the idea that our assignment was going to be to secure

  5   the premises throughout the -- the evening and nighttime hours.

  6   There were agents on scene already securing it.  That we had

  7   consent to search the premises but were not going to.  And the

  8   primary reason there was because of fear that there may have

  9   been some other explosive device; also, that it was getting

 10   near dark and that we would not be able to do an adequate and

 11   proper and safe job.

 12   Q.  Did you at that time have firsthand knowledge as to which,

 13   if either, of the property owners had executed consent at that

 14   moment?

 15   A.  No, sir.

 16   Q.  Your understanding was someone had?

 17   A.  Yes, sir.

 18   Q.  And with that understanding, you then went to the

 19   residence?

 20   A.  Yes, sir.

 21   Q.  And tell the Court what you first did when you got there.

 22   A.  Upon arriving at the Herington residence of Mr. Nichols, we

 23   contacted uniformed officers who were on scene and -- and were

 24   advised that there were agents in the back side of the

 25   building.  There was tape -- police line tape going up around



                                                                  626



  1   the house or already in place, barricades going up at the end

  2   of each -- each end of the block of the Nichols residence.  And

  3   there were several uniformed officers as well as media and

  4   neighbors around.

  5   Q.  Agent Reightler, Mr. Neureiter asked you several questions

  6   about the entry in the log, Government Exhibit 289.

  7   A.  Yes, sir.

  8   Q.  Do you remember the reference to 4:20?

  9   A.  Yes, sir.

 10   Q.  Do you know whether that's the time that marked the

 11   beginning of the process of putting up the security tape?

 12   A.  No, sir.  They were -- the tape was up when I arrived.

 13   Q.  By 5:30?

 14   A.  Yes, sir.

 15   Q.  You have no firsthand knowledge as to what problems may

 16   have been encountered beginning at 4:20 with securing tape and

 17   that sort of thing?

 18   A.  No, sir.

 19   Q.  Incidentally, Agent Reightler, your college degree is in

 20   biology?

 21   A.  Yes, sir.

 22   Q.  And based on that experience, were you familiar with the

 23   smells of ammonia compounds?

 24   A.  Yes, sir.

 25   Q.  And had you, prior to April 21, 1995, attended the VA lab



                                                                  627



  1   school?

  2   A.  Yes, sir.

  3   Q.  And between those two experiences, were you acquainted with

  4   the smell of ammonia?

  5   A.  Yes, sir.

  6   Q.  Did you recognize that smell on any occasion that you were

  7   on the premises at 109 South 2nd?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  Describe it.

 10   A.  On walking from the front of the property to the rear, I

 11   noticed a smell of an ammonia-type odor.  The place that I can

 12   recall it being the strongest was in between the house and the

 13   shed.  Why that -- that just was my observation.  The -- I

 14   noted that comment or I made a comment concerning that odor to

 15   other agents.

 16   Q.  And in the course of the evening, did you speak to other

 17   agents who were interviewing neighbors in that same area?

 18   A.  Yes, sir.

 19   Q.  And what information did you learn from them about

 20   activities concerning fertilizer at the 109 property?

 21   A.  One comment that was made more than once by the agents who

 22   had interviewed neighbors was that for the past couple of days,

 23   Mr. Nichols had been seen out in his yard, hand spreading what

 24   they had thought to be fertilizer.

 25   Q.  And so that information was also known to you when you made



                                                                  628



  1   your report to the U.S. Attorney later that evening?

  2   A.  Yes, sir.

  3   Q.  Was the yard at 109 South 2nd one that you would evaluate

  4   to be well maintained or manicured?

  5   A.  No, sir.

  6   Q.  Describe it.

  7   A.  The -- well, one of the comments that the neighbors had

  8   made was Mr. Nichols spent a lot of time working in his yard.

  9   There were several flowers, I believe tulips, planted in -- in

 10   edgings and landscaping.  The lawn itself was -- had very

 11   little grass, primarily weeds and dirt.

 12   Q.  Focussing your attention then on the two occasions

 13   bracketed, I think you said, between 8:30 and 9:30 when you

 14   looked inside the second window being closest to the east side

 15   of the house -- am I right?

 16   A.  Yes, sir.

 17   Q.  And tell the Court again what you saw inside the south

 18   shed.

 19   A.  There were -- again, there were some hardware or tools-type

 20   items that you would commonly expect to find in that area, but

 21   also, the four plastic barrels, the fuel cans and numerous

 22   ammunition -- military-style ammunition cans.

 23   Q.  Agent Reightler, can I ask you to look at Government

 24   Exhibit 17.

 25   A.  Yes, sir.



                                                                  629



  1   Q.  Does the content of Government Exhibit 17 fairly and

  2   accurately represent at least a portion of what you would see

  3   from your vantage point as you described?

  4   A.  Yes, sir.

  5   Q.  What is depicted in the center of Government Exhibit 17?

  6   A.  Several 7.62-millimeter ammunition cans.

  7            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, we would move to admit

  8   Government Exhibit 17.

  9            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor, there is an objection.

 10   This photograph, Government Exhibit 17, was clearly taken

 11   inside of the home by --

 12            THE COURT:  More foundation will be needed, I guess.

 13   BY MR. MACKEY:

 14   Q.  Agent Reightler, the next day, on Saturday April 22, did

 15   you have occasion to be at the doorway of the south shed?

 16   A.  Yes, sir.

 17   Q.  Is that the same structure that you described earlier?

 18   A.  Yes, sir.

 19   Q.  All right.  And were you able from that vantage point to

 20   see from inside or -- excuse me -- at that vantage point what

 21   was inside?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  And how did that observation compare with what you'd seen

 24   the night before from outside the window?

 25   A.  It was a different angle, but it -- as far as the contents



                                                                  630



  1   that I made note of it, it was the same.

  2            MR. MACKEY:  I would a move to admit --

  3            THE COURT:  It's your testimony, is it, that the

  4   photograph, Exhibit 17, shows fairly and accurately what you

  5   saw?

  6            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

  7            MR. NEUREITER:  Well, your Honor, I would object to

  8   the extent it's being offered to show what he saw from the

  9   outside with his flashlight when it was night.  To show that

 10   these were the objects which were eventually found, that's

 11   fine, but not to --

 12            THE COURT:  Well, that's what we're talking about, I

 13   assume.  Right?

 14            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, your Honor.

 15            THE COURT:  17 is received.

 16   BY MR. MACKEY:

 17   Q.  Agent Reightler, when you saw stacks and stacks of

 18   ammunition cans inside the south shed, did you know then

 19   whether they contained anything?

 20   A.  No, sir.

 21   Q.  And if they were loaded with live ammunition, would they

 22   represent a danger --

 23   A.  Yes, sir.

 24   Q.  -- in your judgment?  Direct your attention, Agent

 25   Reightler, to Government Exhibit 16.  And if I ask you the same



                                                                  631



  1   series of questions concerning your opportunity to observe

  2   what's depicted in Government Exhibit 16, as I did with 17,

  3   would your answers be the same?

  4   A.  Yes, sir.

  5   Q.  Does the -- do the items in Exhibit 16 fairly and

  6   accurately represent what you saw both from outside the shed on

  7   April 21 and the next day on April 22?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9            MR. MACKEY:  Move to admit Government Exhibit 16.

 10            THE COURT:  Again, recognizing that it is a different

 11   perspective from what he saw through a window.  All right.  Any

 12   objection with that limitation?

 13            MR. NEUREITER:  No.  With that limitation, your Honor,

 14   there is no objection.

 15            THE COURT:  16 is received.

 16   BY MR. MACKEY:

 17   Q.  Tell the Court what is depicted in Exhibit 16.

 18   A.  That is four -- what appears to be four white plastic

 19   barrels with blue lids.

 20   Q.  And from your vantage point outside the garage, were you

 21   able to ascertain any writing that appears on those same

 22   barrels?

 23   A.  Yes, sir.

 24   Q.  Did you make note of that and record that later in your

 25   302?



                                                                  632



  1   A.  Yes, sir, I did.

  2   Q.  Finally, Agent Reightler, you told the Court that you were

  3   in a position to make that observation from outside the garage

  4   because there was an opening in one of the windows?

  5   A.  Yes, sir.

  6   Q.  Describe that opening.

  7   A.  The second window from the east end of the garage had a

  8   vinyl or plastic blind like some of the other windows appeared

  9   to have, except that window, the blind was torn and there

 10   was -- the upper panes were uncovered.

 11   Q.  So of the series of windows along -- that were part of the

 12   south shed, there was one and only one that had any opening?

 13   A.  Yes, sir.

 14   Q.  And of that window, only the top pane was open?

 15   A.  Yes, sir.

 16   Q.  And that was by virtue of a window covering that was torn?

 17   A.  Yes, sir.

 18   Q.  With the same questions asked earlier, did you have an

 19   opportunity to see that torn window shade in a photograph?

 20   A.  Yes, sir.

 21   Q.  And is that depicted in Government Exhibit 18?

 22   A.  Yes, sir, I believe that is.

 23   Q.  And does that fairly and accurately represent the condition

 24   of the window through which you made your observations on April

 25   21?



                                                                  633



  1   A.  Yes, sir.

  2            MR. MACKEY:  I would move to admit Government Exhibit

  3   18.

  4            MR. NEUREITER:  There is an objection, here, your

  5   Honor.

  6            THE COURT:  There's more in the photo than the window

  7   shade.  Is that it?

  8            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.  I can't tell --

  9            MR. MACKEY:  We'll offer it for the limited purposes

 10   of showing the condition of the window in the upper left-hand

 11   corner, your Honor.

 12            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor, the -- this is clearly a

 13   photograph taken of the license plate and --

 14            THE COURT:  It isn't offered for that, as Counsel has

 15   just said.

 16            MR. NEUREITER:  Again, your Honor, there would be no

 17   objection with the --

 18            THE COURT:  Limited to what it shows regarding the

 19   window shade in the upper left corner.

 20            MR. NEUREITER:  And I would also like it noted for the

 21   record that this was taken from the inside, not from the

 22   outside where Agent Reightler would have been standing.

 23            THE COURT:  That's true.

 24            MR. MACKEY:  We so stipulate.

 25            THE COURT:  All right.  With those limitations, 18



                                                                  634



  1   received.

  2   BY MR. MACKEY:

  3   Q.  Agent Reightler, for you to be in the position that you

  4   were to look inside the south shed, did you have to climb over

  5   a fence?

  6   A.  No, sir.

  7   Q.  Did you have to move anything?

  8   A.  No, sir.

  9   Q.  All right.  Could you simply walk down a sidewalk, concrete

 10   sidewalk that abutted the building?

 11   A.  Yes, sir.

 12   Q.  Agent Reightler, prior to coming to court, did you review

 13   paragraph 19 in the search warrant application?

 14   A.  Yes, sir, I did.

 15   Q.  And did it accurately summarize the report you gave to the

 16   U.S. Attorney that evening?

 17   A.  Yes, sir, it did.

 18            MR. MACKEY:  One moment, your Honor.

 19            Nothing further.

 20            THE COURT:  Any follow-up questions?

 21            MR. NEUREITER:  Just a couple of questions, your

 22   Honor.

 23            THE COURT:  All right.

 24                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION

 25   BY MR. NEUREITER:



                                                                  635



  1   Q.  Agent Reightler, when you went to the Herington Department

  2   of Public Safety, did anybody tell you that Mr. Nichols was a

  3   dealer in military surplus?

  4   A.  No, sir.  I don't recall that.

  5   Q.  Did you learn from the agents that Mr. Nichols had told the

  6   interviewing agents that he had bought the ammo cans and other

  7   surplus items at a Fort Riley auction and had placed them in

  8   his garage?

  9   A.  I remember hearing that information.  As far as the date

 10   and time, I have no idea, sir.

 11   Q.  So it's possible that when you saw those ammo cans on that

 12   day, you had already been told that he had bought those at a

 13   Fort Riley military auction?

 14   A.  That's possible, sir.

 15            MR. NEUREITER:  One moment.

 16            We're through, your Honor.

 17            THE COURT:  All right.

 18            MR. MACKEY:  I'm all finished.

 19            THE COURT:  Excusing the witness?

 20            MR. NEUREITER:  We are, your Honor.

 21            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You're excused now.

 22   Next witness, please.

 23            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Call Special Agent Thomas Price.

 24            THE COURT:  All right.  Thomas Price.  If you'll

 25   please come forward to be sworn.



                                                                  636



  1       (Thomas Price was sworn.)

  2            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please be seated.

  3            Please state your full name and spell your last name

  4   for the record.

  5            THE WITNESS:  Thomas A. Price, P-r-i-c-e.

  6                         DIRECT EXAMINATION

  7   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

  8   Q.  Good morning, Agent Price.  My name Adam Thurschwell, and I

  9   represent Terry Nichols.

 10   A.  Good morning.

 11   Q.  Agent Price, what's your current position with the FBI?

 12   A.  I'm a supervisory special agent of the surveillance squad.

 13   Q.  And what is your office assignment?

 14   A.  Kansas City.

 15   Q.  Okay.  What is your educational background?

 16   A.  I have a four-year business administration degree.

 17   Q.  Okay.  On April 21, 1995, were you then assigned to the

 18   Kansas City office?

 19   A.  Yes, I was.

 20   Q.  And were you then a supervisory special agent?

 21   A.  Yes, I was.

 22   Q.  Okay.  By the way, how many years as a special agent --

 23   sorry.  How many years have you been a supervisory special

 24   agent?

 25   A.  Approximately eight years.



                                                                  637



  1   Q.  Eight years?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  And how many years as a special agent total?

  4   A.  Almost 21 years.

  5   Q.  Okay.  Now, let me -- I want to take you back to April 21,

  6   1995.  When did you -- did you report for work that morning to

  7   the Kansas City office?

  8   A.  No, I did not.

  9   Q.  Okay.  What office did you -- or where did you report for

 10   work?

 11   A.  I was in the Wichita area at the time.

 12   Q.  Okay.  And what office did you report to?

 13   A.  I didn't report to any office that day.

 14   Q.  All right.  When were you first contacted about a work

 15   assignment on the morning of the 21st?

 16   A.  At approximately 12:30 on the morning of the 21st.

 17   Q.  Okay.  So that would be in the a.m., the early morning

 18   hours?

 19   A.  Actually, 12:30 in the afternoon.

 20   Q.  12:30 in the afternoon?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  Okay.  Where were you precisely at that time?

 23   A.  In Wichita, Kansas.

 24   Q.  Okay.  And why were you there?

 25   A.  I was there on another assignment.



                                                                  638



  1   Q.  An assignment unrelated to the Oklahoma City bombing case?

  2   A.  No.

  3   Q.  Okay.  What assignment were you -- what were you

  4   investigating at that point?

  5            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection, your Honor.  Relevance.

  6            THE COURT:  It was in connection with this bombing

  7   case?  Is this your question?

  8            MR. THURSCHWELL:  I think he answered it was in

  9   connection with the bombing.

 10            THE COURT:  Yes.  Is that your answer?

 11            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

 12            THE COURT:  And then he asked specifically --

 13            MR. MENDELOFF:  Yes, your Honor.  The reason I'm

 14   posing a relevance objection, I believe his testimony has to do

 15   with the affairs in Herington, Kansas; and if he's

 16   investigating some other aspect of the case, it's not relevant

 17   to this proceeding.

 18            THE COURT:  Well, I don't know whether it's relevant

 19   or not.  I guess it depends upon the answer.  Do you know the

 20   answer?

 21            MR. MENDELOFF:  I do.

 22            THE COURT:  And is there some reason to protect the

 23   information?

 24            MR. MENDELOFF:  Well, Judge, it is completely separate

 25   and apart.  If your Honor wants to hear the initial portion,



                                                                  639



  1   your Honor can determine for yourself whether or not you think

  2   it's relevant, but --

  3            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, it's difficult to know.

  4   Maybe we could ask in general terms.

  5   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

  6   Q.  What was the nature of your assignment in the Wichita area?

  7   A.  I had completed a surveillance assignment in the Wichita

  8   area the day before.

  9   Q.  Okay.  You are -- your specialty is in surveillance; is

 10   that correct?

 11   A.  Yes.  At this point.

 12   Q.  "At this point," meaning April 21, 1995?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  Okay.  Are you no longer in surveillance?

 15   A.  No.  I am in surveillance at this point.

 16   Q.  Okay.  Now, what -- when you got the call, was it -- how

 17   did you receive word of your new assignment at 12:30 on that

 18   day?  By radio?

 19   A.  No.  By -- I had contacted our Kansas City command post and

 20   talked to them.

 21   Q.  Okay.  You had a cell phone, did you not?

 22   A.  Yes, I did.

 23   Q.  Okay.  Is that what you used?

 24   A.  No, I did not.

 25   Q.  What -- okay.  You used a land line phone?



                                                                  640



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  All right.  Now, who did you speak to in Kansas City?

  3   A.  I initially spoke to ASAC Dale Watson in Kansas City.

  4   Q.  And who else did you speak to?

  5   A.  I thereafter spoke to supervisory special agent Mike Pulice

  6   in Junction City.

  7   Q.  Okay.  And that -- thereafter, is in -- different phone

  8   call, then?

  9   A.  Yes.  I initially talked to ASAC Watson.  He told me to

 10   call.

 11   Q.  Okay.  What did he -- what exactly did he tell you?

 12   A.  That I was to take my squad and proceed to Herington,

 13   Kansas.

 14   Q.  Okay.  Anything else?

 15   A.  And we were to -- Mr. Watson or Mr. Pulice.

 16   Q.  Mr. Watson?

 17   A.  No.  Mr. Watson told me to -- to do that, but he told me to

 18   call Mr. Pulice in Junction City first.

 19   Q.  Okay.  Who was -- who was on your squad at that point?

 20   A.  How many people, or the names?

 21   Q.  Both.

 22   A.  At that time, there were nine people including myself there

 23   from my squad.

 24   Q.  And your entire squad was instructed to proceed to

 25   Herington, Kansas?



                                                                  641



  1   A.  That's correct.

  2   Q.  Okay.  Were you in -- all in separate vehicles?

  3   A.  All of us but one.

  4   Q.  Okay.  Who was the one?

  5   A.  We had an airplane in that -- an individual had an -- took

  6   an airplane.

  7   Q.  Okay.  Now, would those nine people be individuals named

  8   in -- turning to the white notebook on your left -- Government

  9   Exhibit 29, which is the surveillance log for that day?

 10   A.  Those people -- all of those in there are on my squad, plus

 11   there are some others that aren't on my squad.

 12   Q.  Plus -- but was there anyone on your squad whose name is

 13   not mentioned in this list?

 14   A.  No.  I believe everyone on my squad is on that list.

 15   Q.  Okay.  You then called -- I'm sorry.  ASAC Pulice?

 16   A.  No.  Supervisory Special Agent Pulice.

 17   Q.  Okay.

 18   A.  Michael Pulice.

 19   Q.  And he was in the Junction City command post?

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  All right.  What did he tell you?

 22   A.  He told me to proceed to Herington, Kansas, and to

 23   establish a discreet surveillance on the residence of Terry

 24   Nichols.

 25   Q.  Okay.  Now, did he give you a reason for that assignment?



                                                                  642



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  And what was that reason?

  3   A.  The reason was that he had been determined to be an

  4   associate of Timothy McVeigh's, who --

  5   Q.  Now, did -- did he say anything else in that conversation

  6   about the reason for surveilling him?

  7   A.  No.  At that time we were to conduct a discreet

  8   surveillance and await other instructions.

  9   Q.  So were you -- you weren't told that there -- they expected

 10   to arrest Mr. Nichols at some point that day?

 11   A.  No.  I was not told at that point, no.

 12   Q.  You were not told at that time.  So all they told you --

 13   okay.  Strike that.

 14            All right.  Now, what did you do then?  Did you

 15   proceed directly to Herington, Kansas?

 16   A.  Yes, we did.

 17   Q.  Okay.  Where did you go in Herington, Kansas?

 18   A.  We initially stopped about two miles south of town in

 19   Herington, Kansas.

 20   Q.  And what did you do at that point?

 21   A.  We asked one of the agents -- there were some agents

 22   already in Herington from -- that had come down from Junction

 23   City.  We asked one of the agents to come out and brief us

 24   outside of town as to what --

 25   Q.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Who was that agent?



                                                                  643



  1   A.  Mike Gillispie.

  2   Q.  Mike Gillispie.  Okay.

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  What did Mr. Gillispie tell you?

  5   A.  Mr. Gillispie never arrived to our location.

  6   Q.  Okay.  What happened next then?

  7   A.  Well --

  8   Q.  You were waiting for Mr. Gillispie to arrive?

  9   A.  Yes.  And Mr. Nichols came out of his house and started to

 10   leave, so Mr. Gillispie had to turn around at that point.

 11   Q.  Okay.  So Agent Gillispie was conducting surveillance,

 12   direct visual surveillance of the house at that point?

 13   A.  I don't believe so.

 14   Q.  All right.  Who was conducting surveillance of the house,

 15   if you know?

 16   A.  Agent Foley and Smith, I believe, were conducting

 17   surveillance of the house at that time.

 18   Q.  All right.  And where was Agent Gillispie?

 19   A.  Agent Gillispie, I don't know his exact whereabouts in

 20   Herington, where he was.  He was not conducting surveillance of

 21   the house.

 22   Q.  How did you receive word that Mr. Nichols had left his

 23   home?

 24   A.  It was broadcast over the radio.

 25   Q.  Okay.  Who -- who broadcast it?



                                                                  644



  1   A.  I believe it was either Agent Foley or Smith.

  2   Q.  Okay.  And about what time would this be?

  3   A.  About 2:40 p.m.

  4   Q.  All right.  About -- what did you do then?

  5   A.  We proceeded to head into town.  My ground units and our

  6   airplane had already been dispatched to meet with Agents Foley

  7   and Smith and set up an aerial surveillance on Mr. Nichols'

  8   house.

  9   Q.  Okay.  When you say "we," you're -- did your entire squad

 10   go together?

 11   A.  We were on a mud road.  It had rained quite a bit that day,

 12   and so some of the vehicles had trouble getting back on to the

 13   highway, so we were somewhat spread out; but yes, we were

 14   traveling together.

 15   Q.  You were all headed for the same location?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  And what was that location?

 18   A.  Well, the location was just to get into Herington at that

 19   point and listen to our airplane give instructions as to where

 20   Mr. Nichols had headed.

 21   Q.  Okay.  Now -- so what did you hear over the radio as you

 22   were traveling towards Herington?

 23   A.  What was broadcast was the different directions Mr. Nichols

 24   was driving.

 25   Q.  Okay.  Now, there -- did there come a point in time where



                                                                  645



  1   you learned that he had driven his truck to the Department of

  2   Public Safety in Herington?

  3   A.  Yes, I did hear that.

  4   Q.  Okay.  Where were you at that point?

  5   A.  At that point in time, I was in -- just in the neighborhood

  6   in Herington away from the surveillance site.

  7   Q.  Okay.  And was your squad with you at that point?

  8   A.  No.

  9   Q.  What -- had they been dispatched elsewhere?

 10   A.  They were in various points of the City of Herington.

 11   Q.  Okay.

 12   A.  Some of them would have actually followed Mr. Nichols to

 13   the public safety building.

 14   Q.  Okay.  Why were you not -- why were you in a separate

 15   location from your squad?

 16   A.  Because I had decided to move into a different location to

 17   meet with Mr. Gillispie and -- and get a briefing on what new

 18   information he may have that I did not have.

 19   Q.  Okay.  Now, did you -- did you, in fact, get together with

 20   Mr. Gillispie?

 21   A.  Yes, I did.

 22   Q.  And what did he tell you?

 23   A.  He at that time -- Mr. Nichols had arrived at the Public

 24   Safety Building, and we had no -- we were in -- we had no

 25   conversation about anything at that point about an update of



                                                                  646



  1   information.

  2   Q.  There was -- he didn't give you any update.  Did he

  3   mention -- he didn't mention any information he had learned

  4   about the intention to seek an arrest warrant?

  5   A.  No.

  6   Q.  Not -- you hesitated.  Not at that point?

  7   A.  That -- that wouldn't -- he wouldn't have been in a

  8   position to have that information, I don't think.

  9   Q.  Okay.  Now, where -- where did you -- where exactly did you

 10   meet with Agent Gillispie?

 11   A.  I met with him -- it would have been north and east of the

 12   Public Safety Building, of Trapp Street, which there's a water

 13   tower in the city, if you're at all familiar with it.  It was

 14   right by the water tower.

 15   Q.  About how far away is that?

 16   A.  From?

 17   Q.  From -- excuse me.  From the Department of Public Safety.

 18   A.  Probably about four or five blocks.

 19   Q.  Okay.  Nearby.  Now -- and this would be in the 3:00 time

 20   period?

 21   A.  Actually, probably about 10 to 3.

 22   Q.  10 to -- 10 of 3?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  All right.  What did you do after you met with Agent

 25   Gillispie?



                                                                  647



  1   A.  Well --

  2   Q.  I'm sorry.  Strike that.

  3            Before I -- who else was -- who else was with you at

  4   the time?

  5   A.  Just Agent Gillispie and I.

  6   Q.  Okay.  And what did you do next?

  7   A.  I contacted our Kansas City command post.

  8   Q.  All right.  Who did you speak to there?

  9   A.  I spoke to Agent Bob Merideth.

 10   Q.  All right.  What did he tell you?

 11   A.  I told Mr. Merideth about the situation, that -- that Terry

 12   Nichols had arrived at the Herington Public Safety Building.

 13   Q.  Did you -- what were your -- did you say that he had turned

 14   himself in to the Department of Public Safety?

 15   A.  No, I did not.

 16   Q.  You said he had arrived there.  Okay.  What did he tell

 17   you?

 18   A.  I asked him for further instructions as to what our -- our

 19   role was at that time and asked him to ask one of the -- one of

 20   our superiors what we should -- what course of action we should

 21   take.

 22   Q.  And -- and what did he tell you the instructions were?

 23   A.  He had told us our instructions were -- first of all, he

 24   told us that Mr. Nichols might be wired with explosives and to

 25   be cautious.  Based on that statement, I asked him to have



                                                                  648



  1   someone call into the Herington Police Department and ensure

  2   that there was no hostage situation inside.

  3   Q.  Okay.  Now, that -- I'll come back to that phone call in a

  4   moment that you made.  But did he tell you anything else?  Any

  5   further instructions about what to do?

  6   A.  Yes.  He told us that we were to go into the Herington

  7   Police Department and interview Terry Nichols, if he would

  8   agree to an interview, and that if he didn't agree to an

  9   interview, that we were to continue our surveillance.

 10   Q.  Okay.  So he told you that at that point, you were -- you

 11   were not authorized to arrest Mr. Nichols; is that correct?

 12   A.  That's correct.

 13   Q.  Okay.  And that, therefore, he was free to leave if he

 14   wanted to?

 15   A.  That's correct.

 16   Q.  But you were to try to interview him if he would be willing

 17   to be interviewed?

 18   A.  That's correct.

 19   Q.  And the reason that you weren't authorized -- did he tell

 20   you that the reason you weren't authorized was that there was

 21   no arrest warrant yet obtained?

 22   A.  He didn't say yet.  He said there was no arrest warrant for

 23   Mr. Nichols.

 24   Q.  Okay.  So he used the word that -- he used the words in

 25   substance there's no arrest warrant for Mr. Nichols?



                                                                  649



  1   A.  That's correct.

  2   Q.  Okay.  Now, that would be -- what time would that

  3   conversation have occurred?

  4   A.  Sometime between 2:50 and the time I arrived at the

  5   building around 3:10.

  6   Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  You mentioned that you made a phone call

  7   to ascertain whether there was any danger inside the Department

  8   of Public Safety; correct?

  9   A.  I asked the command post in Kansas City to make that phone

 10   call.

 11   Q.  Okay.  You -- in fact, you spoke to Agent Chornyak; is that

 12   right?

 13   A.  I believe I spoke to Agent Merideth.  I think they were in

 14   the same room at that time.

 15   Q.  All right.  You testified that you asked him to make

 16   certain that there was no hostage situation occurring inside of

 17   the --

 18   A.  That's correct.

 19   Q.  -- police station.  Thank you.  Okay.  Now, you entered --

 20   you actually did enter the Department of Public Safety around

 21   3:10; is that correct?

 22   A.  Yes, sir.

 23   Q.  Okay.  Prior to that, did you -- did you meet with Agents

 24   Gillispie, Foley, and Smith?

 25   A.  Yes, I did.



                                                                  650



  1   Q.  All right.  Was there anyone else at the meeting?

  2   A.  No.

  3   Q.  Okay.  And what -- what transpired at the meeting?  What

  4   was the discussion there?

  5   A.  Well, I was -- I had -- Agent Gillispie had been with me

  6   during my entire conversations with Kansas City and now had

  7   gotten into my vehicle, so he was aware of the situation.  I

  8   instructed Agent Smith and Foley just exactly what the command

  9   post had told me.

 10   Q.  Okay.  Exact -- so you -- you told them, in other words,

 11   that -- that they were to attempt to interview Mr. Nichols if

 12   he was willing?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  And that he was -- if he wanted to leave that they should

 15   follow him, keep him under surveillance, but allow him to go?

 16   A.  If he wanted to leave, they should allow him to go.  They

 17   were not on the surveillance team so they would probably not

 18   been part of the surveillance.

 19   Q.  And the reason they were not authorized to stop him or

 20   arrest him at that point, was that there was no arrest warrant?

 21   A.  That's correct.

 22   Q.  Now, you -- so you -- you entered the station at 3:10.

 23   How -- were you there for the entire day on the 21st?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  Okay.  You were physically present in the station or



                                                                  651



  1   nearby?

  2   A.  From 3:10 on, yes.

  3   Q.  What time did you leave?

  4   A.  I believe it was after 1:30.

  5   Q.  1:30 in the morning of April 22?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  Okay.  All right.  Now, you entered the station.  Tell me

  8   what occurs then.

  9   A.  In the station, was met by Chief Kuhn, who I had not met at

 10   that point in time.  And was introduced to Chief Kuhn.

 11   Q.  Okay.  And what did he tell you?

 12   A.  He told us that Mr. Nichols was there and had some

 13   questions for us.

 14   Q.  All right.  Now, were you introduced to Mr. Nichols?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  All right.  You -- you -- what did you -- what did you say

 17   to him and what did he say to you?

 18   A.  I displayed my credentials to him and his wife and told him

 19   who I was and the rest of the people with me were with the FBI

 20   and asked him if he would be willing to answer some questions.

 21   Q.  Okay.  And what did he say?

 22   A.  He stated that he would.

 23   Q.  All right.  Now, did you tell him that he was free to leave

 24   at that point?

 25   A.  No, I did not.



                                                                  652



  1   Q.  Okay.  Did anyone tell you that he was free to leave in

  2   your presence?

  3   A.  They wouldn't tell him that.

  4   Q.  Yeah.

  5   A.  Not to my knowledge, no.

  6   Q.  All right.  Did you -- did you learn subsequently that

  7   anyone had told him that he was free to leave if he wished to?

  8            THE COURT:  I'm confused about your question.  Maybe

  9   the witness is.  Are you talking about at this initial

 10   conversation?

 11            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Sorry, your Honor.

 12   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 13   Q.  That's correct.  The timing I'm asking about, did you

 14   subsequently learn at any point that someone else had informed

 15   him that he was free to go prior to your initial conversation

 16   with him.

 17   A.  No.  I don't recall that.

 18   Q.  Okay.  All right.  So now then eventually -- who --

 19   eventually, he agreed to be interviewed.  Who -- which agents

 20   interviewed him initially?

 21   A.  Agent Smith and Foley.

 22   Q.  All right.  And -- well, prior to that, he was searched;

 23   correct?

 24   A.  There was a patdown search done, yes.

 25   Q.  Did you do that search?



                                                                  653



  1   A.  No, I did not.

  2   Q.  Was it done in your presence?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  Okay.  His wife was searched, also?

  5   A.  That's correct.

  6   Q.  Was that done in your presence?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  Was that done in Mr. Nichols' presence?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  All right.  And his young daughter was searched; is that

 11   correct?

 12   A.  That's correct.

 13   Q.  All right.  And was that done in your presence?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And was it done in Mr. Nichols' presence?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  All right.  Now, immediately thereafter, as I understand,

 18   he's taken into the basement by some of the agents for the

 19   interview; is that correct?

 20   A.  By Agents Foley and Smith, yes.

 21   Q.  Okay.  And where did you go after that?

 22   A.  I stayed in the room with Mrs. Nichols.

 23   Q.  Okay.  Did you have a conversation with Mrs. Nichols?

 24   A.  Yes, I did.

 25   Q.  And what was that conversation?



                                                                  654



  1   A.  I was awaiting the arrival of agents to interview

  2   Mrs. Nichols and I -- I asked Mrs. Nichols if she knew the

  3   whereabouts of James Nichols.

  4   Q.  Okay.  And did she give you an answer?

  5   A.  Yes, she gave me an answer.

  6   Q.  She told you his address; correct?

  7   A.  Yes.  In Decker, Michigan.

  8   Q.  Okay.  And it was an accurate address; is that correct?

  9   A.  I -- I think so.  I don't know.

 10   Q.  Okay.  Now, where did you go after your exchange with

 11   Mrs. Nichols?

 12   A.  After my exchange with her, I went and established a room

 13   for myself in the back eastern part of the Herington police

 14   department.

 15   Q.  Okay.  Would you turn to Government Exhibit 3.  That's in

 16   the white notebook.  That's 3 in the white tab.

 17   A.  That's the book I have.

 18   Q.  And this is a -- do you recognize this as the floor plan of

 19   the Herington Public Safety Building, first floor?

 20   A.  Yes, I do.

 21            MR. THURSCHWELL:  All right.  I think it's been -- I

 22   think it's been entered already.

 23            THE COURT:  Yes.

 24   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 25   Q.  Okay.  Which -- as -- as indicated on this diagram, which



                                                                  655



  1   room did you set up your post in?

  2   A.  In the interrogation in the Kansas Highway Patrol office.

  3   Q.  Okay.  Was there a phone in that room?

  4   A.  I believe there was, yes.

  5   Q.  Was there a fax machine?

  6   A.  No.

  7   Q.  All right.  Did anyone accompany you there -- did any --

  8   strike that.

  9            Did anyone else set up a posting there as their

 10   position for the remainder of the day?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  Who was that?

 13   A.  Agent Gillispie.

 14   Q.  Okay.  Now, during -- were you -- did you -- strike that.

 15            During this initial phase of the interview -- by which

 16   I mean the period prior to the arrival of Agents Crabtree and

 17   Jablonski -- were you kept apprised of what was being said by

 18   Mr. Nichols in the interview room?

 19   A.  No.

 20   Q.  Agents -- Agent Smith never told you what Mr. Nichols was

 21   saying or doing there?

 22   A.  I never saw the agents during that time period.

 23   Q.  Okay.  So there was -- did you -- you never -- did you --

 24   did there come a time when you learned that Mr. Nichols had

 25   refused to sign a waiver of rights form?



                                                                  656



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  How did you come to learn that?

  3   A.  Agent Gillispie advised me.

  4   Q.  Okay.  To your knowledge, had Agent Gillispie spoken to one

  5   of -- either Agent Smith or Foley?

  6   A.  Agent Gillispie had spoken to one of them.  I don't know

  7   which one.

  8   Q.  Okay.  Now, what did Agent Gillispie tell you?

  9   A.  He told me that Mr. Nichols did not wish to sign a consent

 10   form.  However, would agree to an interview.

 11   Q.  Okay.  And why did he tell you that?

 12   A.  Because it had been told to him.

 13   Q.  All right.  Was he concerned that -- about the legality of

 14   the statement under those circumstances?

 15   A.  I don't think so.

 16   Q.  All right.  You called the command post at Kansas City and

 17   reported that information, did you not?

 18   A.  Yes, I did.

 19   Q.  All right.  And why did you -- why did you call that

 20   information in?

 21   A.  To pass that on to the command post to keep them updated on

 22   any information I had at that time.

 23   Q.  You did not -- you were not concerned at that point about

 24   the legality of the statement, given that he had not signed the

 25   form?



                                                                  657



  1   A.  Not if he had agreed to an interview, no.

  2   Q.  Okay.  Did -- who did you speak to -- I'm sorry.  Strike

  3   that.

  4            You spoke to Agent Chornyak at the command post?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Okay.  And you told him that he had agreed to speak but had

  7   refused to sign the form; is that correct?

  8   A.  That's correct.

  9   Q.  All right.  What did Agent Chornyak say?

 10   A.  I don't recall that he said anything other than take any

 11   information.

 12   Q.  Did he tell you he would get back to you with any -- with

 13   legal advice?

 14   A.  I don't recall that.

 15   Q.  Okay.  Did you -- have you spoken to any Government

 16   officials offsite prior to that phone call with Agent Chornyak

 17   while in the -- this station -- while you were in the station?

 18   A.  I would have spoken to the rest of my squad that was

 19   outside the -- the department just to provide them with

 20   instructions.  That would probably have been it.

 21   Q.  Okay.  Now, let's go back to them.  Where were they in this

 22   time frame?  3:10 to 3:15?

 23   A.  3:10 to 3:15.

 24   Q.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Or up to the point where the --

 25   Mr. Nichols has agreed to the interview and gone downstairs



                                                                  658



  1   with the agents.  Where were your squad?

  2   A.  I believe they were partially outside the Herington Public

  3   Safety Building in the parking lot and also, some had been

  4   dispatched over to Terry Nichols' house.

  5   Q.  Okay.  And -- and what were your instructions to them

  6   after -- you said you spoke to them prior to your conversation

  7   with Mr. Chornyak.  What were your instructions to them?

  8   A.  Just to maintain a -- a surveillance on those two -- those

  9   two locations.

 10   Q.  Okay.  The two locations being the Herington -- the 109

 11   South 2nd Street home location?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  And the pickup truck parked outside the station?

 14   A.  That's correct.

 15   Q.  Okay.  Did you tell them to secure those locations?

 16   A.  I told them to maintain a visual observation on them and

 17   not let people into those -- have access to those, yes.

 18   Q.  Okay.  Now, Agents Jablonski and Crabtree arrive around

 19   4:00 that afternoon; is that correct?

 20   A.  I don't recall the exact time they arrived.  I did not see

 21   them when they arrived.

 22   Q.  You did not see them.  Did you speak to them --

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  -- when they arrived?

 25            You had no conversation with them at all?



                                                                  659



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  All right.  I -- who -- were other agents arriving at the

  3   police station after your arrival?  By "arriving," I mean

  4   coming physically into the police station.

  5   A.  Were there other agents?

  6   Q.  Yes.

  7   A.  Around that time, I don't think so.

  8   Q.  Okay.  Were there -- did other agents arrive around the

  9   time that Agents Crabtree and Jablonski arrived, to your

 10   knowledge?

 11   A.  I don't believe so.

 12   Q.  You didn't see any other agents in the station apart from

 13   yourself, Agent Gillispie, Agent Smith and Agent Foley?

 14   A.  Oh, yes.  Two other agents were -- were interviewing

 15   Marife.

 16   Q.  Okay.  Agents Thomeczek and Dobson?

 17   A.  No.

 18   Q.  Who were the agents?

 19   A.  Agents Thomeczek and Army CID Agent White.

 20   Q.  Oh, excuse me.  Okay.  All right.  Now, did there come a

 21   time when you received a phone call from Mr. Chornyak informing

 22   you that a material witness arrest warrant had been issued for

 23   Terry Lynn Nichols?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  All right.  And that would -- what time did that occur?



                                                                  660



  1   A.  I believe it was within 20 minutes of -- of a fax arriving

  2   in that -- of that warrant.  So I would say somewhere 20

  3   minutes before 5:00.

  4   Q.  Okay.

  5   A.  4:40, somewhere in that period.

  6   Q.  All right.  Now, was -- was -- was Agent Gillispie in the

  7   room with you when you received that phone call?

  8   A.  I don't -- I don't know.

  9   Q.  Okay.  Did you -- did you inform anyone else in the station

 10   that a material witness arrest warrant had been issued for

 11   Terry Lynn Nichols after receiving that initial phone call?

 12   A.  The next time I spoke to Agent Gillispie, I would have

 13   informed him.  I don't know if he was in the room at that time

 14   or not.

 15   Q.  Okay.  Did you tell anyone else?

 16   A.  No.

 17   Q.  All right.  Now, you didn't see Agents Foley and Jablonski

 18   emerge from the interview around 10 of 5:00?

 19   A.  No, I did not.

 20   Q.  Okay.  What -- what was your assignment at that point?

 21   What were you doing in the command post there?

 22   A.  Basically tied up on the telephone for quite a lengthy

 23   period of time when I first got there.

 24   Q.  Okay.  And who were you speaking to?

 25   A.  Oklahoma City, Junction City, Kansas City, Washington.



                                                                  661



  1   Q.  All right.  You were in direct telephonic contact with FBI

  2   headquarters in Washington?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  Okay.  Kansas City command post?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Oklahoma City command post?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  Fort Riley command post?

  9   A.  Yes.  And also SA Tubbs and ASAC Watson on their cell

 10   phone.

 11   Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  Now, at 5:00, you've said you received a

 12   fax of the material witness warrant; is that correct?

 13   A.  Yeah, at approximately 5:00.

 14   Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  Would you take a look first at

 15   Government Exhibit 26.  White notebook.  White tab.  Can I ask

 16   you to look at the second page of that exhibit.

 17   A.  Okay.

 18   Q.  Well, let me ask you a preliminary.  Did you read the

 19   warrant when it was faxed to you?

 20   A.  I would have read it at some point after it was faxed to

 21   me.

 22   Q.  Okay.  Do you recall how long after it was faxed to you

 23   that you read it?

 24   A.  No.  I was not receiving the faxes so as they were brought

 25   in to me.  When I had a free moment, I would have read it.  So



                                                                  662



  1   it would have been somewhere shortly after it was received, I'm

  2   sure.

  3   Q.  Okay.  Now, take a look at Exhibit 26.  And if it will fit

  4   on your desk, please open the brown -- the black notebook to

  5   your right to Nichols Exhibit W42.

  6            THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  What was the W reference?

  7            MR. THURSCHWELL:  W42.

  8            THE COURT:  Thank you.

  9            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Which I believe has been entered in

 10   evidence already.

 11            THE COURT:  Is that right?

 12            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  I do not have it.

 13            THE COURT:  I don't show that as being in.

 14            MR. THURSCHWELL:  I'm sorry.

 15            MR. TIGAR:  Go to W54.

 16   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 17   Q.  Agent Price, turn to W54 instead.

 18            MR. THURSCHWELL:  I apologize.  And I believe that one

 19   has been entered.

 20            THE COURT:  Do you have that in?

 21            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  No, I do not.

 22   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 23   Q.  Do you see those two exhibits?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  Now, you will note that they are both warrants for the



                                                                  663



  1   arrest of Terry Lynn Nichols as a material witness; is that

  2   correct?

  3   A.  That's correct.

  4   Q.  Do you recall -- but they are -- they are slightly

  5   different in -- in two respects.  The caption is different,

  6   United States of America versus Terry Lynn Nichols, in

  7   Government Exhibit 26?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  And United States of America versus Timothy James McVeigh

 10   in Nichols W54.  And then the Government 26 "of material

 11   witness" is handwritten in.  Do you see that?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  Do you recall which -- well, do you recognize either of

 14   these as the material witness arrest warrant that you received

 15   on April 21 around 5:00?

 16   A.  I recognized it -- Exhibit 26 Has what appears to be the

 17   same coding on the side as the copy I received.

 18   Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

 19            THE COURT:  Perhaps there's some oversight here.  I

 20   don't show W54 as actually received in evidence.  We've been --

 21            MR. THURSCHWELL:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I would

 22   offer Nichols Exhibit W54 in evidence.

 23            MR. MENDELOFF:  No objection.

 24            THE COURT:  It's received now.

 25            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Thank you, your Honor.



                                                                  664



  1   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

  2   Q.  Okay.  Agent Price, you -- you -- you read the warrant and

  3   it states, does it not, that you are hereby commanded to arrest

  4   Terry Lynn Nichols and bring this witness forthwith before the

  5   federal grand jury at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for the reason

  6   that the witness' testimony is material.  Is that what it says

  7   there?

  8   A.  In part, yes.

  9   Q.  Okay.  Now, you didn't arrest Terry Lynn Nichols, did you?

 10   A.  No, I did not.

 11   Q.  All right.  You didn't bring him before the -- a grand

 12   jury, did you?

 13   A.  No, I did not.

 14   Q.  All right.  You didn't tell -- did you tell anyone to

 15   arrest Terry Lynn Nichols?

 16   A.  No, I did not.

 17   Q.  Okay.  Did you show this warrant to anyone?

 18   A.  At what point in time?

 19   Q.  Well, Agent, you tell me.  Beginning after your receipt of

 20   the fax, who did you show this warrant to?

 21   A.  At some point in time, upon the arrival of SAC Tubbs and

 22   Watson, I would have shown either one of those two that

 23   warrant.

 24   Q.  Okay.

 25   A.  And advised them of it.



                                                                  665



  1   Q.  About what time did they arrive, if you recall?

  2   A.  I believe it was between 4:45 and 5:00.

  3   Q.  So they would have arrived right about the time the warrant

  4   arrived?

  5   A.  That's correct.

  6   Q.  So you would have shown it to them immediately upon its

  7   receipt?

  8   A.  Immediately upon their availability and my availability.

  9   Q.  All right.  Shortly after 5:00?  Fair to say?

 10   A.  It could have been an hour after 5:00.  It depended on if

 11   they were in a closed-door meeting or if I was on the phone or

 12   whatever; but yes, sometime within an hour after 5, I would

 13   say.

 14   Q.  Well, Agent, didn't you think it was worth interrupting a

 15   meeting to inform them that you had received a faxed version of

 16   the arrest warrant for the man you had downstairs?

 17   A.  It was an important issue, yes.

 18   Q.  But not important enough to interrupt a meeting?

 19   A.  Like I said, I'm not sure I read the warrant at 5:00 myself

 20   if I was tied up on the phone or whatever.  Some of the phone

 21   calls were quite lengthy.  Yes.  I would have wanted to inform

 22   them at the earliest possible moment, yes.

 23   Q.  So it was important enough to interrupt a meeting?

 24   A.  It was important enough to let them know as soon as it was

 25   feasibly possible, yes.



                                                                  666



  1   Q.  All right.  Who else -- after that, did you show the

  2   warrant to anyone else?

  3   A.  I don't recall showing it to anyone else, no.

  4   Q.  You didn't show it to Agent Gillispie?

  5   A.  It was there.  Agent Gillispie was in and out of that room.

  6   It would have been there if he wanted to look at it.

  7   Q.  To your knowledge, was he aware of the fact that the

  8   warrant had been faxed?

  9   A.  Well, I had already told Agent Gillispie that I had

 10   received a phone call from Supervisor Chornyak that the warrant

 11   had been issued.

 12   Q.  All right.  And he was -- was he aware that the warrant was

 13   being faxed to the Department of Public Safety?

 14   A.  I believe he would have been aware, yes.

 15   Q.  All right.  Now, did you -- so you did not inform Agents

 16   Smith or Crabtree or Jablonski or Foley about the existence of

 17   this warrant?

 18   A.  No, I did not.

 19   Q.  All right.  You didn't inform Terry Lynn Nichols of the

 20   existence of this warrant; is that correct?

 21   A.  No, I did not.

 22   Q.  All right.  Why not?

 23   A.  No. 1, I wasn't going to interrupt the interview to advise

 24   the agents of that and, No. 2, upon the arrival of ASAC Watson

 25   and SAC Tubbs, they took over the investigative part of the



                                                                  667



  1   case at that time.

  2   Q.  So I -- in your view, it was not your job to execute that

  3   warrant; is that correct?

  4   A.  No.  That's not my answer.

  5   Q.  All right.  Then I -- I guess I don't understand the

  6   significance of the -- of your answer.  I'm sorry.

  7            MR. MENDELOFF:  Judge, objection.  Is that a question?

  8            THE COURT:  Yes.  That's not an appropriate question.

  9            MR. THURSCHWELL:  My apologies, your Honor.  I

 10   withdraw it.

 11   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 12   Q.  Why wouldn't you interrupt the interview of Terry Lynn

 13   Nichols to inform him that an arrest warrant had been issued

 14   for him, commanding you to bring him before the grand jury in

 15   Oklahoma City?

 16   A.  Because I didn't believe it was necessary at that time.

 17   Q.  Let's take another look at the warrant, Agent Price.

 18   A.  Okay.

 19   Q.  Does not this warrant state that you shall bring this

 20   witness forthwith before the federal grand jury at Oklahoma

 21   City?

 22   A.  Yes, it does.

 23   Q.  All right.  Doesn't "forthwith" mean to you as soon as

 24   feasibly possible?

 25   A.  It means as soon as reasonably possible, yes.



                                                                  668



  1   Q.  Okay.  And -- and in -- your understanding of

  2   reasonableness, it was reasonable to allow the agents to

  3   continue questioning Terry Lynn Nichols without informing him

  4   of the existence of this arrest warrant, that that -- that was

  5   a reasonable basis for not bringing him forthwith to the grand

  6   jury?

  7   A.  Could you repeat that?  I'm confused.

  8   Q.  Sure.  Is it your understanding of what constitutes a

  9   reasonable time period to bring someone forthwith before a

 10   judicial body, that factored into that reasonableness is your

 11   need to continue questioning the individual without -- without

 12   his knowledge of the fact that an arrest warrant has been

 13   issued?

 14            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection, your Honor.  Vague.

 15            THE COURT:  Yes.  Sustained.

 16   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 17   Q.  All right.  Didn't you think it would be important to

 18   Mr. Nichols to know that he had -- that an arrest warrant had

 19   been issued?

 20            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection, your Honor, relevance.

 21            THE COURT:  Overruled.

 22            THE WITNESS:  Did I think it was important to

 23   Mr. Nichols?

 24   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 25   Q.  Didn't you think it would be important to him to know that



                                                                  669



  1   an arrest warrant had been issued for him?

  2   A.  At some point in time, yes, he would have needed to know

  3   that.

  4   Q.  Didn't you think it would be important to him to know that

  5   at the time that he was speaking to federal agents?

  6   A.  I was aware that Mr. Nichols was voluntarily speaking to

  7   federal agents, so no, I didn't think it was necessary to

  8   advise him of this warrant.

  9   Q.  You didn't think it would make any difference to him at

 10   all, the fact previously unknown to him that he was now subject

 11   to arrest?

 12   A.  I can't answer for Mr. Nichols.

 13   Q.  Agent Price, had you executed this warrant after receiving

 14   it, you would have had to read Mr. Nichols his rights; correct?

 15   A.  I didn't execute this warrant so --

 16   Q.  Agent Price, I'm asking you based on your knowledge and

 17   experience as a special agent of the FBI.  Upon executing this

 18   arrest warrant, you would have had to read Mr. Nichols his

 19   Miranda rights; is that correct?

 20   A.  Yes, I would have.  Yes.

 21   Q.  And in fact, at that point, he might well have decided he

 22   wished to remain -- exercise those rights and wish to remain

 23   silent?

 24            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection, your Honor.  Calls for

 25   speculation.



                                                                  670



  1            THE COURT:  Sustained.

  2   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

  3   Q.  Now, you testified that you told -- you informed SAC Tubbs

  4   and ASAC Watson of the existence of this warrant?

  5   A.  That's correct.

  6   Q.  Okay.  To your knowledge, did they inform any of the agents

  7   who were interviewing Mr. Nichols?

  8   A.  I don't have any knowledge of that, no.

  9   Q.  All right.  To your knowledge, did anyone -- was anyone

 10   else in the station at the -- at any point in time aware of the

 11   existence of the search -- the arrest warrant?

 12   A.  I don't know that, no.

 13   Q.  You don't know of anyone else for sure who was aware

 14   that -- an arrest warrant had been issued for Mr. Nichols?

 15   A.  Agent Gillispie.

 16   Q.  Agent Gillispie.  ASAC Watson, SAC Tubbs?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  And no one else that you're aware of?

 19   A.  No one that I'm aware of, no.

 20   Q.  All right.  Let me turn, Agent Price, to this search of

 21   Mr. Nichols' truck that was performed around 8:15.

 22            THE COURT:  Since we're going to a new subject, I

 23   think we'll recess at this point.

 24            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Very well, I ask that the witness be

 25   admonished.



                                                                  671



  1            THE COURT:  Yes, please, just a moment.

  2            MR. HARTZLER:  Thank you.

  3            THE COURT:  You understand that under the order that

  4   governs testimony and sequestration of witnesses, you're not to

  5   discuss your testimony with anyone during this break.

  6            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

  7            THE COURT:  Now, Mr. Hartzler.

  8            MR. HARTZLER:  I apologize, your Honor, for

  9   interrupting.  The exhibits that were offered to us by handing

 10   them to Mr. Mackey were already admitted into evidence.  I

 11   wonder if we could just withhold that until we have had an

 12   opportunity to read them more thoroughly.  I'm concerned

 13   about --

 14            THE COURT:  About the dairy practices.

 15            MR. HARTZLER:  I'm concerned about putting discovery

 16   materials putting into the record --

 17            THE COURT:  You may review it, yes.  My understanding

 18   of the offer again was it's in substitution for calling

 19   witnesses to establish the facts that are in these 302's.  But

 20   you may review them, surely.

 21            MR. HARTZLER:  All right.

 22            THE COURT:  If there's some problem with them, you'll

 23   tell me at the -- incoming after the recess.

 24            MR. HARTZLER:  Thank you.

 25            MR. TIGAR:  If Your Honor please, we have prepared now



                                                                  672



  1   a concordance of the exhibits prepared by the Nichols team and

  2   the Government's exhibits with a mark as to which are in and

  3   which are scheduled to be offered.  During the recess, I'll

  4   share that with counsel, but I wanted to let your Honor know

  5   that we're hoping by that means to avoid this confusion because

  6   there are many, many exhibits that are in both sets of exhibit

  7   books.  And we'll have that prepared for your Honor.

  8            THE COURT:  Good.  All right.  20 minutes.

  9       (Recess at 10:24 a.m.)

 10       (Reconvened at 10:43 a.m.)

 11            THE COURT:  Please be seated.

 12            MR. THURSCHWELL:  May I proceed?

 13            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Thurschwell, proceed.

 14   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 15   Q.  Before we get to the search, Agent Price, I'd like to ask

 16   you a couple of follow-up questions.  Did you hear Terry

 17   Nichols ask why his name was on radio and television at the

 18   time that you initially encountered him?

 19   A.  I don't recall that one way or the other, no.

 20   Q.  Now, SAC Tubbs and ASAC Watson were the two -- is it the

 21   case that SAC Tubbs and ASAC Watson were the two highest

 22   ranking officials present in the Department of Public Safety on

 23   that day?

 24   A.  That's correct.

 25   Q.  And SAC Tubbs was directing the investigation from that



                                                                  673



  1   command post?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  Now, did anyone instruct you not to tell Mr. Nichols or

  4   agents about the existence of the material arrest warrant?

  5   A.  Not that I recall, no.

  6   Q.  Okay.  You don't -- are you certain that no one did, or you

  7   simply are not sure?

  8   A.  No one instructed me to do that.

  9   Q.  Now, did -- at any time during the day of April 21, did

 10   anyone tell you that a defense attorney was trying to reach

 11   Terry Nichols?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  Who told you that?

 14   A.  I believe it was Chief Kuhn.

 15   Q.  Now, what -- and what exactly did he tell you?

 16   A.  He told me that a defense attorney had called in or was on

 17   the phone and if Terry Nichols desired counsel, that he would

 18   represent him.

 19   Q.  Okay.  What -- what did you then do with that information?

 20   A.  I told Director Kuhn that if he took that individual's name

 21   and phone number, if Mr. Nichols asked for counsel, we would

 22   provide him with his phone number.

 23   Q.  Okay.  Did you tell anyone -- did you tell the agents

 24   interviewing Mr. Nichols that someone had called in, a defense

 25   lawyer had called in asking to represent Mr. Nichols?



                                                                  674



  1   A.  No, I did not.

  2   Q.  Did you tell anyone else?

  3   A.  I would have probably told Agent Gillispie if he was there

  4   at that time.

  5   Q.  Did you tell SAC Tubbs?

  6   A.  I don't know if SAC Tubbs was there at the time this call

  7   came in or not, the one call I recall.

  8   Q.  You don't recall telling anyone -- telling this fact to

  9   anyone apart from Chief Kuhn to write it down?

 10   A.  That's correct.

 11   Q.  Now, let's turn to the search.  Around 8:15 that evening,

 12   you did a brief cursory search of Mr. Nichols' truck?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  All right.  Now -- and the truck at that time was located

 15   in the garage adjacent to the Department of Public Safety?

 16   A.  That's correct.

 17   Q.  Prior to that, Mr. Nichols' truck had been parked in the

 18   parking lot next -- outdoor parking lot next to the station

 19   house?

 20   A.  That's correct.

 21   Q.  All right.  And would you please take a look at Nichols'

 22   Exhibit W57?

 23   A.  In the white book?

 24   Q.  In the black book.

 25   A.  Okay.



                                                                  675



  1   Q.  All right.  Now, do you recognize that?

  2   A.  I believe that's Mr. Nichols' pickup truck, yes.

  3   Q.  That's a fair and accurate depiction of Mr. Nichols' truck

  4   parked outside of the Department of Public Safety on the

  5   afternoon of April 21?

  6   A.  It appears to be, yes.

  7   Q.  Okay.  This --

  8            MR. THURSCHWELL:  We would offer Exhibit W57.

  9            MR. MENDELOFF:  No objection, your Honor.

 10            THE COURT:  Received.

 11   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:

 12   Q.  Take a look -- take a look at the numbers in the lower

 13   right-hand corner of that exhibit, Agent.

 14   A.  Okay.

 15   Q.  Do those numbers mean 21 is the date, April 21, and 1648,

 16   the time at which the photograph was taken?

 17   A.  I'm not familiar with this type of camera, so I don't want

 18   to be speculating on that.

 19   Q.  Okay.  Now, so before you -- before you searched this

 20   truck, it had been moved into the garage; correct?

 21   A.  I'm sorry?

 22   Q.  Before you searched the truck, someone had moved it into

 23   the garage area?

 24   A.  That's correct.

 25   Q.  And immediately prior to your search of the truck, an Army



                                                                  676



  1   bomb squad had checked it for explosives; is that correct?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  All right.  They used sniffer dogs?

  4   A.  A sniffer dog, yes.

  5   Q.  And they had concluded that there were no explosives

  6   present; correct?

  7   A.  That's correct.

  8   Q.  All right.  Now, you retrieved a car seat and a diaper bag

  9   from the truck?

 10   A.  Yes, I did.

 11   Q.  And these -- what was your authority for this search?

 12   A.  Signed consent, search warrants from both Terry Nichols and

 13   Marife.

 14   Q.  You said search warrants.  Did you mean --

 15   A.  Signed consents to search.

 16   Q.  Now, did you see these consents?

 17   A.  No, I didn't.  I don't believe I did.

 18   Q.  You didn't.  Who told you that there were signed consents

 19   for the search of the truck?

 20   A.  I don't recall.  It would have been someone in Mr. Watson,

 21   Mr. Tubbs' office.

 22   Q.  Did anyone tell you that with regard to Mr. Nichols --

 23   Mr. Nichols' consent, he had conditioned that on the presence

 24   of himself or his wife?

 25   A.  No, they did not.



                                                                  677



  1   Q.  All right.  Now, had Marife Nichols asked for these items

  2   to be retrieved?

  3   A.  That was my understanding, yes.

  4   Q.  Who told you that?

  5   A.  Sheila Dobson.

  6   Q.  Had Sheila Dobson tried to get these items out of the truck

  7   previously?

  8   A.  Not to my knowledge.

  9   Q.  Now, and was Ms. -- Mrs. Nichols' request for these

 10   items -- that was not the consent that you were relying upon?

 11   A.  No, it was not.

 12   Q.  All right.  Now, this was a cursory search of the truck;

 13   correct?

 14   A.  That's correct.

 15   Q.  And it was cursory because you know that the evidence

 16   recovery team would be doing a thorough search of the truck on

 17   the following day?

 18   A.  That's correct.

 19   Q.  All right.  And by a thorough search, you knew that the

 20   evidence recovery team would be looking for fiber samples, for

 21   example?

 22   A.  I don't know that.

 23   Q.  Okay.  Chemical traces?

 24   A.  I don't know if the evidence recovery team is equipped to

 25   do that or not.



                                                                  678



  1   Q.  Okay.  They would be taking -- checking the truck for

  2   secret compartments, taking apart the interior of the truck,

  3   looking for evidence?

  4   A.  They have specialized training which I'm not aware of; so I

  5   don't know exactly what they would be doing.

  6   Q.  You're not familiar -- but you did understand at the time

  7   you conducted your cursory search that a thorough search would

  8   be conducted on the following day?

  9   A.  That's correct.

 10   Q.  So you knew that that truck was not going anywhere that

 11   night?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  Now, who entered the truck to conduct this cursory search?

 14   A.  I'm sorry.  Who entered?

 15   Q.  Who entered the truck to conduct this search?

 16   A.  It would be myself, Agent Gillispie, and Agent Jim Harter.

 17   Q.  And you spent about 15 minutes searching?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  So this was a fairly extensive cursory search?

 20   A.  I don't think so.

 21   Q.  All right.  I won't argue with you, Agent.

 22            What did you find there?

 23   A.  Other than the address book of -- that was laying on the

 24   seat, we found some gunnysacks in the truck and a box of nails

 25   in the back end of the truck.



                                                                  679



  1   Q.  And the gunnysacks were empty?

  2   A.  That's correct.

  3   Q.  And the box of nails was just that, a box of nails?

  4   A.  We didn't open it to see what it was, but that's what I

  5   assume it is.

  6   Q.  Now, when you noticed the address book, was it -- it was

  7   lying on the passenger seat?

  8   A.  That's correct.

  9   Q.  And was it open or closed?

 10   A.  It was closed.

 11   Q.  Okay.  Did you look through it?

 12   A.  Yes, I did.

 13   Q.  And you paged through it page by page?

 14   A.  No.

 15   Q.  Did you go straight to the Ms?

 16   A.  Yes, I did.

 17   Q.  You were looking for an address for Timothy McVeigh?

 18   A.  I was looking to see if the name Timothy McVeigh was in

 19   there.

 20   Q.  And what you found was an address for Timothy McVeigh's

 21   dad; correct?

 22   A.  I believe so, yes.

 23   Q.  Now, you subsequently seized the address book in a -- the

 24   next day; is that correct?

 25   A.  That's correct.



                                                                  680



  1   Q.  And you knew that the address book was there because of

  2   your search on the prior day?

  3   A.  That's correct.

  4   Q.  Now, subsequent -- you subsequently found out that this

  5   address book belonged to Marife Nichols; is that correct?

  6   A.  At some point in time, yes, I believe I did find that out.

  7   Q.  Okay.  After you completed your search on April 21, did you

  8   return to the station house?

  9   A.  Yes, I did.

 10   Q.  Did you then or at any subsequent time see United States

 11   Attorney Rathbun in the station?

 12   A.  I would have seen him in the station if I was out in the

 13   hall and he happened to be out in the hall, yes.

 14   Q.  Did you speak to him?

 15   A.  I don't believe so, other than to say hi, no.

 16   Q.  So you didn't tell him about the existence of the material

 17   witness arrest warrant?

 18   A.  At the point of time that ASAC Watson and SAC Tubbs

 19   arrived, those decisions were in their hands at that point.  I

 20   became pretty much a phone answerer and personnel requisition

 21   person.

 22   Q.  Did you see SAC Tubbs or ASAC Watson speaking to United

 23   States Attorney Rathbun at any time that evening?

 24   A.  I don't recall seeing them.

 25   Q.  You don't recall seeing them together?



                                                                  681



  1   A.  I don't recall seeing them, no.

  2            MR. THURSCHWELL:  One moment, your Honor.

  3            THE COURT:  Yes.

  4            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Pass the witness.

  5            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Mendeloff.

  6                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

  7   BY MR. MENDELOFF:

  8   Q.  Agent Price, just let me ask you -- let me take you back to

  9   the portion of your testimony which related to the

 10   surveillance; and I believe you testified that when you left

 11   Wichita, you left with your surveillance squad and an airplane;

 12   is that correct?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  Can you just describe for the Court what this airplane

 15   looked like?

 16   A.  It was a small, four-seat airplane that you see a lot of

 17   them.

 18   Q.  Two propellers, or a jet?

 19   A.  No.  One propeller.

 20   Q.  One propeller.  And you said you left Wichita with nine

 21   surveillance agents; is that right?

 22   A.  Including the plane, yes, and myself.

 23   Q.  Is that standard for your surveillance agents?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  What is the reason for that large number of agents to be



                                                                  682



  1   used in a surveillance?

  2   A.  To conduct a discreet surveillance, you need to rotate cars

  3   periodically so that the individual you're surveilling does not

  4   notice the same car twice.

  5   Q.  When you say discreet surveillance, what do you mean?

  6   A.  I mean when we're conducting the surveillance, we don't

  7   want the individual we're following to know we're following

  8   them.

  9   Q.  Was the intention, then, to allow Terry Nichols to know you

 10   were there, or to not allow Terry Nichols to know you were

 11   there?

 12   A.  The intention was to not allow him.

 13   Q.  I believe you testified that you got to Herington, you were

 14   on a road outside town, you called Agent Gillispie, and he was

 15   going to come to meet you, and then you got the radio call that

 16   Mr. Nichols was moving; is that correct?

 17   A.  That's correct.

 18   Q.  And it was at that point in time that you and the

 19   surveillance unit scattered somewhat, I believe you testified,

 20   drove into town; is that right?

 21   A.  Yes, that's correct.

 22   Q.  And you drove on what road?

 23   A.  Business Highway 56, we came into town on.

 24   Q.  As you're driving up 56, where were you in the line of

 25   cars?



                                                                  683



  1   A.  I was in the front of the line.

  2   Q.  Did you have occasion to see anybody that you were looking

  3   for on 56?

  4   A.  Yes.  I passed Terry Nichols.

  5   Q.  Where was that?

  6   A.  Just north of Surplus City.

  7   Q.  When you passed him, what did you observe?

  8   A.  Mr. Nichols waved at me.

  9   Q.  What happened then?

 10   A.  Thereafter, he turned into Surplus City.

 11   Q.  What did you do?

 12   A.  I pulled into a lot a few buildings up from Surplus City.

 13   Q.  When you did, did any other agents pull into that lot as

 14   well?

 15   A.  Yes, Agent Gillispie came into that lot.

 16   Q.  Now, as of the time that you were driving on 56 and you

 17   passed Mr. Nichols, was the entire surveillance squad behind

 18   you also on that road?

 19   A.  Yes, they would have been somewhere on that road behind me.

 20   Q.  All right.  Had there been radio communications about

 21   Mr. Nichols' whereabouts?

 22   A.  Yes, there were.

 23   Q.  How did that affect your surveillance location?

 24   A.  Once the plane called out that Mr. Nichols had taken the

 25   bend on Highway 56 or Business 56, the rest of the units



                                                                  684



  1   scattered into different businesses or places where they could

  2   so that they did not also pass Mr. Nichols.

  3   Q.  Now, I think we left the progression of events when you

  4   pulled into the lot and Mr. Nichols had pulled into the Surplus

  5   City lot; is that right?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  And did any other agent pull into the lot?  I'm not sure I

  8   asked you that.

  9   A.  Into the lot I was in?

 10   Q.  Yes.

 11   A.  Yes, Agent Gillispie came into that lot.

 12   Q.  What do you observe at Surplus City at that point in time?

 13   A.  I observe Mr. Nichols get out of his truck to start toward

 14   the front of Surplus City.

 15   Q.  After that, did you see what he was doing?

 16   A.  My view was obstructed at that point.

 17   Q.  Did you receive a radio communication?

 18   A.  Yes, I could hear on the radio.

 19   Q.  What was the radio communication?

 20   A.  The radio communication was that he walked up to the door

 21   and came back to the truck and started to pull back out of the

 22   lot.

 23   Q.  Did you do anything at that point?

 24   A.  I took off from the lot I was in so that he would not pass

 25   me a second time, if he came my direction.



                                                                  685



  1   Q.  Where did you go?

  2   A.  I went past Broadway up into the neighborhood I've

  3   described earlier as by the water tower.

  4            MR. MENDELOFF:  Your Honor, may I approach the

  5   witness?  I want to identify the water tower on the large

  6   photo.

  7            THE COURT:  All right.

  8   BY MR. MENDELOFF:

  9   Q.  For the record, I show you what has been marked

 10   Government's Exhibit 2.

 11            MR. MENDELOFF:  Which I believe has been admitted,

 12   your Honor.

 13            THE COURT:  I don't have it as in.

 14            MR. MENDELOFF:  Then, your Honor, we would offer

 15   Government's Exhibit 2.

 16            THE COURT:  Is there objection to 2?

 17            MR. THURSCHWELL:  No objection, your Honor.

 18            THE COURT:  All right.  It's received.

 19   BY MR. MENDELOFF:

 20   Q.  Will you please look at Government's Exhibit 2 and see if

 21   you can identify for the Court where it is that the water tower

 22   is located.

 23   A.  It's in this area right in here, but I don't see the water

 24   tower on this map.  It must be just barely -- I'm sorry.  Here

 25   it is right here.  It's about -- appears to be about three



                                                                  686



  1   blocks north of the Herington Public Safety Building and on the

  2   back side of it.

  3   Q.  Thank you.

  4            Now, Mr. Price, it was at the water tower that you had

  5   the conversations you did with Special Agent Gillispie?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  And with the command post; is that correct?

  8   A.  That's correct.

  9   Q.  And while you were at the water tower, did you hear what

 10   had happened with respect to Mr. Nichols?

 11   A.  Yes, I did.

 12   Q.  What was that?

 13   A.  That he had entered the Herington Public Safety Building.

 14   Q.  And the conversations that you had with the command post

 15   were the ones that Mr. -- that you went over with

 16   Mr. Thurschwell; is that correct?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  Now, after you received -- had those conversations, I

 19   believe you indicated as part of those conversations that you

 20   had asked for somebody to call in to the Herington Department

 21   of Public Safety building to make sure there wasn't a problem

 22   there.

 23   A.  That's correct.

 24   Q.  Did you ever receive a call back indicating that the coast

 25   was clear?



                                                                  687



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  When was that?

  3   A.  Just prior to us going in.  It would have been between 3

  4   and 3:10.

  5   Q.  After you had your communications with the command post at

  6   the water tower, did you and Agent Gillispie proceed anywhere?

  7   A.  To the Herington Department of Public Safety.

  8   Q.  And once there, you received the communication that the

  9   coast was clear inside the building; is that correct?

 10   A.  That's correct.

 11   Q.  It was in the parking lot that you had the conversation

 12   that you recounted with Agent Foley and Agent Smith about what

 13   was to happen inside the building?

 14   A.  That's correct.

 15            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, I'm going to object to

 16   the leading.  I think many of these questions have been asked

 17   and answered.

 18            MR. MENDELOFF:  The only reason I'm doing this is to

 19   place it in chronological sequence.

 20            THE COURT:  I know, but we're repeating things he's

 21   already testified about.

 22            MR. MENDELOFF:  I will see to it that I don't, your

 23   Honor.

 24            THE COURT:  Thank you.

 25   BY MR. MENDELOFF:



                                                                  688



  1   Q.  After you went into the Herington Department of Public

  2   Safety building and met Mr. Nichols, did you happen -- you then

  3   testified that you patted Mr. Nichols down; is that correct?

  4   A.  Agent Foley patted Mr. Nichols down.

  5   Q.  Prior to that, did you ask Mr. Nichols any questions about

  6   patting him down?

  7   A.  Yes.  I asked him for his safety and our safety if he would

  8   agree to a pat down of himself and his wife.  He replied yes,

  9   he would.

 10   Q.  After the pat-down search, did you leave the room?

 11   A.  Yes, I did.

 12   Q.  Where did you go?

 13   A.  I went with Mr. Kuhn to look for a suitable room to conduct

 14   an interview in.

 15   Q.  Moments later, did you return to the officers' room?

 16   A.  Yes, I did.

 17   Q.  And at that time, did you ask Mr. Nichols any questions

 18   about that interview?

 19   A.  I asked Mr. Nichols if he would be willing to accompany

 20   Agent Smith and Foley to the basement interview room to be

 21   interviewed; and he replied yes, he would.

 22   Q.  At that point, what happened?

 23   A.  At that point, they took him to that interview room -- or

 24   he followed them with the Chief Kuhn to the interview room.

 25   Q.  As of that point in time, how many agents were in the



                                                                  689



  1   building?

  2   A.  At that point in time, there were four FBI agents in the

  3   building.

  4   Q.  At that point, did you ask any agent to do anything?

  5   A.  Yes, I did.

  6   Q.  What did you ask?

  7   A.  I asked Agent Gillispie to go outside and get two agents

  8   who had come down from the Junction City command post to come

  9   inside and interview Mrs. Nichols.

 10   Q.  And after you left, did he return at some point?

 11   A.  Yes, he did.

 12   Q.  And did any other agents return with him?

 13   A.  Yes.  He brought two agents with him.

 14   Q.  And who were they?

 15   A.  Agent Thomeczek and area CID Agent White.

 16   Q.  Was it -- Prior to this time, did you have any kind of

 17   communication with Mrs. Nichols?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  And that's the questions you asked her --

 20   A.  That's correct.

 21   Q.  -- which you've recounted already.

 22            Now, I believe you testified on direct examination

 23   that you had a conversation with Agent Chornyak in the command

 24   center in Kansas City; is that right?

 25   A.  In Kansas City, yes.



                                                                  690



  1   Q.  And I don't think the record includes the time of that

  2   conversation, the original conversation in which he told -- you

  3   told him that Mr. Nichols didn't want to sign the waiver of

  4   right form.

  5   A.  I believe it was approximately between 3:45 and 3:50 p.m.

  6   Q.  Just so we're clear, when you were informed that

  7   Mr. Nichols didn't want to sign a form, what form was it that

  8   he didn't want to sign?

  9   A.  A form called Interrogation, Advice of Rights form.

 10   Q.  Now, after the conversation with Special Agent Chornyak,

 11   did you have a conversation with Special Agent Tubbs?

 12   A.  Yes, I did.

 13   Q.  And where were you when you had this conversation?

 14   A.  I would have been in the rear interview room, which I've

 15   already pointed out in the Herington Public Safety Building.

 16   Q.  Do you know where he was?

 17   A.  He was en route to Herington with ASAC Watson in his

 18   automobile.

 19   Q.  Did he -- did you receive any instructions from him at that

 20   time?

 21   A.  Yes, I did.

 22   Q.  What were they?

 23   A.  That we were to interview Mr. Nichols and if he decided he

 24   wanted to leave the interview, that we were to reinstitute a

 25   very close surveillance on him.



                                                                  691



  1   Q.  Were you to permit him to leave?

  2   A.  We were to permit him to leave and reinstitute

  3   surveillance, yes.

  4   Q.  Now, where did Special Agent Tubbs say he was at that

  5   point?

  6   A.  At that point, Special Agent Tubbs was somewhere between

  7   Topeka, Kansas, and Junction City, Kansas.

  8   Q.  All right.  As of that point in time, had anyone mentioned

  9   a material witness warrant to you?

 10   A.  No.

 11   Q.  At approximately 4:00, I believe you testified that Agents

 12   Crabtree and Jablonski arrived but you did not notice that at

 13   the time.  Can you explain why?

 14   A.  Because I was in this room with the door shut taking these

 15   phone calls and making these phone calls.

 16   Q.  Did there come a time when you first learned that a

 17   material witness warrant was going to be sought?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  And when did that occur?

 20   A.  My best recollection is approximately just prior to 4:30.

 21   Q.  And who informed you of that?

 22   A.  Special Agent Tubbs.

 23   Q.  What did he tell you?

 24   A.  He told me that he had contacted -- I believe the Oklahoma

 25   City division and that they were going to attempt to obtain a



                                                                  692



  1   material witness warrant.

  2   Q.  Within moments of that call, did you have another

  3   conversation with Special Agent Chornyak?

  4   A.  Yes, I did.

  5   Q.  What did he inform you?

  6   A.  He informed me that a material witness warrant had, in

  7   fact, been issued.

  8   Q.  Did he tell you he would send it to you?

  9   A.  Yes, he said he would fax it to me.

 10   Q.  And is that the fax you received about 5:00?

 11   A.  That's correct.

 12   Q.  Now, after Special Agent Tubbs arrived, who took over

 13   supervision of the facility as far as the FBI was concerned?

 14   A.  Special Agent Tubbs.

 15   Q.  And you were in the back room?

 16   A.  That's correct.

 17   Q.  And what were you doing in the back room?

 18   A.  Generally answering phone calls, making phone calls, and

 19   handling manpower requisitions or whatever else ASAC Watson or

 20   Special Agent Tubbs wanted me to do.

 21   Q.  As the evening wore on, what was the intensity of the phone

 22   calls?

 23   A.  The phones were constantly busy.  It got to a point where I

 24   brought my cell phone in from my car just so we had an open

 25   line if we needed one.



                                                                  693



  1   Q.  Were you receiving messages from somebody?

  2   A.  I'm sorry.

  3   Q.  You were receiving messages from somebody in addition to

  4   the calls going right into that room?

  5   A.  Well, we received -- the calls were generally being handled

  6   by the switchboard at the police department, and they would

  7   switch them back to us, and they'd also bring faxes back to us.

  8   Q.  At some point in the early evening, did you have a

  9   discussion with your superiors about Mr. Nichols' truck and

 10   people who had gathered outside?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  What was that?

 13   A.  That there were a lot of people outside around the building

 14   and that also the press was pretty much around the building.

 15   Q.  Who informed you of that?

 16   A.  I saw some of it on my own and other agents.

 17   Q.  Approximately what time was that?

 18   A.  I would say about 6:30 to 7:00.

 19   Q.  And around that same time, did you receive any instructions

 20   from Special Agent Tubbs or ASAC Watson?

 21   A.  ASAC Watson, yes, advised that we -- as soon as the bomb --

 22   or advised us to have the bomb squad check the truck; and as

 23   soon as they checked it, we were to bring it inside the

 24   building.

 25   Q.  What did you do to carry out these instructions?



                                                                  694



  1   A.  I contacted -- initially I contacted the Junction City

  2   command post and asked them to put the bomb squad on alert so

  3   that they could come down and check the truck.

  4   Q.  And did a bomb squad eventually arrive?

  5   A.  Yes, it did.

  6   Q.  Approximately what time?

  7   A.  I believe they arrived somewhere around 7:30.

  8   Q.  Now, prior to the arrival of the bomb squad, did you

  9   receive any further instructions from ASAC Watson or Special

 10   Agent Tubbs?

 11   A.  Yes.  ASAC Watson advised that after the truck was

 12   searched, it was -- or was searched for bombs, it was to be

 13   brought inside and also a cursory search done on it at that

 14   point in time.

 15   Q.  And around this same time, did Ms. Dobson inform you of

 16   anything?

 17   A.  Yes.  She advised me that she needed the car seat and the

 18   diaper bag from the vehicle.

 19   Q.  Now, at about 7:50, did anybody arrive to check over the

 20   truck?

 21   A.  At approximately 7:50, the bomb squad did in fact do a

 22   search of the truck.

 23   Q.  Did you observe this?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  How many members of the bomb squad were there?



                                                                  695



  1   A.  I believe there were four.

  2   Q.  Other than those four men, did you see any other men in

  3   military fatigues in Herington that evening?

  4   A.  No, I did not.

  5   Q.  And when did this bomb unit complete its work?

  6   A.  Just prior to 8:10, I believe.

  7   Q.  After the cursory search was completed -- excuse me.  What

  8   time was the cursory search completed?

  9   A.  It was completed at 8:30.

 10   Q.  After the search was completed, what were your tasks for

 11   the rest of that evening?

 12   A.  Pretty much to answer phones, make phone calls and

 13   requisition people, handle whatever problems were given to me

 14   by ASAC Watson and SAC Tubbs.

 15            MR. MENDELOFF:  One moment, please, your Honor.

 16            THE COURT:  Yes.

 17            MR. MENDELOFF:  Nothing further, your Honor.

 18            THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, do you have some?

 19            MR. JONES:  I have a very few, your Honor, just on a

 20   matter that we're interested in.

 21            THE COURT:  All right.

 22                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

 23   BY MR. JONES:

 24   Q.  Mr. Price, what time did Mr. Tubbs arrive there?

 25   A.  I believe it was around 5 p.m.



                                                                  696



  1   Q.  Until Mr. Tubbs arrived, were you the agent with authority

  2   and responsibility?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  Is it your recollection that Mr. Tubbs arrived after you

  5   were told that a material witness arrest warrant would be

  6   sought for Mr. Nichols?

  7   A.  Mr. Tubbs was the one that advised me of that.

  8   Q.  All right.  Was he there when he advised you of that?

  9   A.  No.  He was in his car.

 10   Q.  All right.  So he hadn't arrived?

 11   A.  No.

 12   Q.  Had he arrived when you were told that the arrest warrant

 13   had been issued?

 14   A.  I don't believe he had arrived yet, no.

 15   Q.  So if your memory is correct, at the time that you learned

 16   that the arrest warrant had been issued, you were the senior

 17   agent on the scene in terms of responsibility and authority?

 18   A.  That's correct.

 19   Q.  So it would have been your responsibility and authority to

 20   decide whom to inform, if anyone, that the warrant had been

 21   issued?

 22   A.  That's correct.

 23   Q.  Who did you tell?

 24   A.  Agent Gillispie.

 25   Q.  All right.  And when did you tell him?



                                                                  697



  1   A.  Sometime shortly after I received the call.  Again, he was

  2   in and out of the room; so when I saw him, I would have told

  3   him.

  4   Q.  Now, was Agent -- did you tell anyone else?

  5   A.  No.  There was no one else to tell.

  6   Q.  What do you mean by that?

  7   A.  There was no other bodies that weren't tied up in

  8   interviews at that time.

  9   Q.  All right.  You could have told the people doing the

 10   interview.  You decided not to.

 11   A.  I could have interrupted the interview and told them, yes.

 12   Q.  Yes.  Now, at the time that they were having this interview

 13   that you did not interrupt, Mr. Nichols had given his consent

 14   to interview.

 15   A.  That's correct.

 16   Q.  That's your position?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  At the time that Mr. Nichols gave his consent to the

 19   interview, no warrant for his arrest had been issued.

 20   A.  That's correct.

 21   Q.  The interview was continuing based upon Mr. Nichols'

 22   consent.

 23   A.  That's my understanding, yes.

 24   Q.  During the course of the interview, the warrant for his

 25   arrest was issued.



                                                                  698



  1   A.  That's correct.

  2   Q.  But he was not told that there had been a change in

  3   circumstances which affected his liberty to leave until later

  4   that evening; is that correct?

  5            MR. MENDELOFF:  Your Honor, objection.  I think we've

  6   covered this several times.

  7            THE COURT:  Yes, we've been over this, Mr. Jones.

  8            MR. JONES:  I understand we have, your Honor; but this

  9   is the agent that had the responsibility to make the decision.

 10            THE COURT:  Well, I know; but we know that there was

 11   no interruption, no one was told.

 12            MR. JONES:  All right.

 13   BY MR. JONES:

 14   Q.  Did anyone advise you or tell you that you should not

 15   inform Mr. Nichols that the arrest warrant had been issued?

 16            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

 17            THE COURT:  Overruled.

 18            THE WITNESS:  No.

 19   BY MR. JONES:

 20   Q.  Did you have an understanding, based upon your experience

 21   has an FBI agent, that you should not inform Mr. Nichols that

 22   the warrant had been issued?

 23   A.  I didn't have an understanding that I should not.  I had

 24   the understanding that I was not required to.

 25   Q.  And what is the basis for the understanding you were not

  1   required to?

  2   A.  That the interview ongoing was a consensual interview and

  3   that Mr. Nichols had been advised of his rights.

  4   Q.  And that understanding you have persists even though there

  5   had been a change in his status?

  7   to terminate the interview.

  8   Q.  Or leave?

  9   A.  Or leave.  Yes.

 10   Q.  Assuming for sake of argument that you knew that the arrest

 13   A.  Which book?

 14   Q.  I'm sorry.  The white book.

 15            Do you believe this chronology is correct?

 16   A.  I was not in that interview.  I don't know the chronology.

 20   A.  No.

 21   Q.  The Herington Department of Public Safety is a very small

  4   A.  I don't recall the time.

  5   Q.  You have no recollection of it?

  7   Q.  Well, I'm sorry.  The public defender that called.

  8   A.  Oh, no.  I have no recollection of when he called.

  9   Q.  Is it your understanding that Mr. Phillips didn't call

 10   until after 5 p.m.?

 11   A.  I don't know what time he called.

 12            MR. JONES:  I believe that's all.  Thank you, your

 13   Honor.

 14            THE COURT:  Do we have anything further?

 15            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Nothing further, your Honor.  The

 16   witness is excused.

 17            MR. MENDELOFF:  Nothing further.

 18            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You're now excused.

 19            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

 20            THE COURT:  Next, please.

 21            MR. WOODS:  Marife Nichols.

 22            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, can I, before we call

 23   Mrs. Nichols?  By stipulation with the Government, we are not

 24   going to call Agents Michael R. Gillispie or James P. Harter;

 25   and in lieu of their testimony, I believe I have the



                                                                  701



  1   Government's agreement that I will introduce Nichols' Exhibit

  2   W21.  The stipulation, as I understand it, being that if called

  3   to testify, Agent Gillispie would testify to the facts stated

  4   in the first 302 included in Nichols' Exhibit W21 and Agent

  5   Harter would testify to the facts stated in the second 302

  6   included in W21.

  7            THE COURT:  Is that the agreement?

  8            MR. MENDELOFF:  Yes, your Honor.

  9            THE COURT:  All right.  Now proceed.  Mrs. Nichols?

 10            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, Ron

 11   Woods for Terry Nichols.

 12            The next witness is the wife of Terry Nichols, Marife

 13   Nichols.  She's represented by counsel.  And as soon as she

 14   comes in with her counsel, I would like to address the Court to

 15   cover an evidentiary issue.

 16            THE COURT:  All right.

 17            MR. HARTZLER:  May I fill the vacuum --

 18            THE COURT:  Well, on Exhibits W80, 81 and 82?

 19            MR. HARTZLER:  As I should have predicted, Mr. Mackey

 20   is correct.  We have no objection.

 21            THE COURT:  All right.  Then they are again received

 22   or reaffirmed received.

 23            Come forward to be sworn, please.

 24            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please stand and raise your

 25   right hand.



                                                                  702



  1       (Marife Torres Nichols was sworn.)

  2            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please be seated.

  3            Please state your name and spell your full name for

  4   the record.

  5            THE WITNESS:  Marife Torres Nichols, M-A-R-I-F-E;

  6   Torres, T-O-R-R-E-S; Nichols, N-I-C-H-O-L-S.

  7            THE COURT:  Now, Mr. Woods, you indicate we have

  8   counsel present.

  9            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  May it please the Court,

 10   Maureen Cain is present, who represents Ms. Nichols.

 11            THE COURT:  Good morning, Ms. Cain.

 12            MS. CAIN:  Good morning, your Honor.

 13            MR. WOODS:  The issue I wanted to address with the

 14   Court:  Mr. Nichols has not waived the marital privilege.

 15   Today with Mrs. Nichols on the witness stand, I will only cover

 16   the incidents that occurred at the Herington police station

 17   from 3:00 on the afternoon of April 21 going forward for the 37

 18   days that she was in custody.

 19            Now, Mrs. Cain has represented to me that she is aware

 20   of the adverse spousal privilege and that they have made the

 21   decision that they will allow Ms. Nichols to testify as to

 22   these events today; and Ms. Cain can address that issue.

 23            THE COURT:  All right.

 24            MS. CAIN:  If it please the Court, Maureen Cain.

 25            It's my understanding that the questions of my clients



                                                                  703



  1   today will address interaction with various government agents

  2   from April 21 on until her release and her return to California

  3   and subsequent to the Philippines.  It will not address any

  4   marital communications nor any actions by her husband.  It will

  5   specifically be her interactions with third parties, and it is

  6   on that basis that she is testifying today.

  7            THE COURT:  All right.

  8            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, I

  9   would like to have for the record that, for the Court's

 10   determination on her voluntary consent, we will go into a

 11   little bit about her background in the Philippines to give the

 12   Court an understanding in order to let the Court make that

 13   decision.

 14            THE COURT:  Well, if you avoid the communications that

 15   are covered by the privilege, we will make sure the

 16   cross-examination is within the scope of the direct.

 17            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

 18            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, if I might address that

 19   matter just very briefly.

 20            THE COURT:  Yes.

 21            MR. MACKEY:  With regard to the question of marital

 22   privilege, two things went on April 21; that is, an interview

 23   of -- by (sic) Mrs. Nichols and an interview of Mr. Nichols.  I

 24   think the law is well established that if each of those spouses

 25   waived the privilege as to the same subject matter, then



                                                                  704



  1   it's -- and there are matters like that.

  2            THE COURT:  If conversation is in the presentation of

  3   other persons, then it's not within the scope of the privilege.

  4            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, your Honor.

  5            THE COURT:  Yes.  All right.

  6            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

  7            THE COURT:  You may proceed.

  8            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

  1   Q.  On your particular two rooms that you live in, Ms. Nichols,

 25   last year.  That's the day that you went to the Herington

  1   police station with your husband Terry and your daughter

  2   Nicole.

  3   A.  Okay.

  5   that time in April of '95.

  6   A.  She's less than two years old.

  7   Q.  She was born in August of '93?

  8   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  Do you recall approximately what time you got to the police

 14   station?

 15   A.  Might be around 1 to 2:00, afternoon.

 16   Q.  And who was with you?

 17   A.  Terry and Nicole.

 18   Q.  Now, I don't want to ask anything that Terry said; but if

 19   you would describe for the Court just what he looked like and

 20   his demeanor at that time as you went to the police station?

 21   A.  Well, he was scared, he was pale and just anxious to know

 22   what's going on, why he's -- his name is on the news.

 23   Q.  When he arrived at the police station, what happened first?

 24   Who did you see and who did you talk to?

 25   A.  The policeman in the Herington -- I forget his name.



                                                                  710



  1   Q.  All right.  It was one of the local police officers and not

  2   the FBI or the United States Army?

  3   A.  Yes.  That's correct.

  4   Q.  And what did -- what conversation did you have with the

  5   local police officers?

  6   A.  I didn't have conversation with them.  Terry did.

  7   Q.  All right.  What did you hear at that time?

  8   A.  Terry said that I'm supposed to be armed and dangerous;

  9   would you like to search me?

 10            And the policeman came no, sir.  You came over here

 11   with your decision, I guess -- not decision but sort of like

 12   that; so we -- we feel that you're okay.

 13   Q.  And did you then wait a few minutes before other people

 14   arrived?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  Approximately how many minutes?

 17   A.  About 25 minutes, I guess.

 18   Q.  How many people arrived at that time, Mrs. Nichols?

 19   A.  There was a lot of them.  I didn't count them.

 20   Q.  Let's start with the people who talked to you.  Do you

 21   remember how many people talked to you when all of these people

 22   arrived?

 23   A.  There was one agent that talked to me first and then he

 24   went out.  About four.

 25   Q.  By "about four," what do you mean by that?  4:00, or four



                                                                  711



  1   agents?

  2   A.  No, about four agents that talked to me.  One is Mr. Tom

  3   White.  He works with the Army.

  4   Q.  And he's with the United States Army?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Did he stay with you for the next six hours?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  Approximately how long did the interview with you last when

  9   you were there in the police station?

 10   A.  I think for the whole afternoon, because I never know it

 11   was already nighttime when we get out.

 12   Q.  Were there any windows in this room that you were kept in?

 13   A.  No.

 14   Q.  If the interview started sometime after 3, do you know

 15   approximately what time you left the police station?

 16   A.  Might be 8 or 9:00 at night.  I'm not sure.

 17   Q.  You were not wearing a watch?

 18   A.  I forgot if I did.

 19   Q.  All right.  Was there a clock in this room with no windows

 20   that you were in?

 21   A.  No.

 22   Q.  All right.  You were interviewed then the whole evening by

 23   the United States Army.  Who else was with you?

 24   A.  Mr. Thomeczek and Ms. Sheila Dobson.

 25   Q.  Was Mrs. Dobson there the whole time, or did she come late?



                                                                  712



  1   A.  She just come in about 45 minutes until we get there.

  2   Q.  For the last 45 minutes of the multihour interview, she was

  3   there?

  4   A.  Uh-huh.

  5   Q.  And who did Mr. Thomeczek work for?

  6   A.  I have no idea.  I didn't ask him.

  7   Q.  Did they show you any identification?

  8   A.  Yeah.  All of them showed their identification card and

  9   badge.

 10   Q.  You recalled earlier that Mr. White worked for the United

 11   States Army.  Do you recall who Mr. Thomeczek worked for?

 12   A.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, he's an FBI.

 13   Q.  Okay.  And what about Mrs. Dobson?

 14   A.  She's an FBI, too.

 15   Q.  Had you ever met an FBI agent before?

 16   A.  No, not in my whole life.

 17   Q.  Did you know who they were in general?  I mean what role

 18   they played in the American police system?

 19   A.  No, I have no idea.

 20   Q.  All right.  Did they begin to ask questions of you,

 21   Ms. Nichols?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  Did any of these people that were questioning you advise

 24   you that night that you had a right not to repeat confidential

 25   communications between you and your husband?



                                                                  713



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  Did anybody advise you that you had a right to talk with a

  3   lawyer if you wanted to?

  4   A.  I don't remember.  I don't think so.

  5   Q.  Okay.  Did they ever tell you that you were a suspect or

  6   that you were going to be arrested?

  7   A.  No.

  8   Q.  Do you recall whether or not during that evening that they

  9   told you that Terry was going to be arrested?

 10   A.  No.

 11   Q.  During the interview, who conducted most of the questions,

 12   Mr. Thomeczek with the FBI, or Mr. White of the United States

 13   Army?

 14   A.  Both of them.

 15   Q.  Okay.  And were the questions concerning your husband,

 16   Terry Nichols?

 17   A.  Yes.  And to Mr. Tim McVeigh, too.

 18   Q.  Did there come a time during that interview where you

 19   requested to be allowed to breast-feed your child?

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  And were you allowed to leave the room to do that?

 22   A.  Yeah.  They said that and just prefer to stay in the same

 23   room.

 24   Q.  And was there a time when you had a conversation with

 25   Mr. White of the United States Army?



                                                                  714



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  And did Mr. White of the United States Army relate to you

  3   that he was married to a lady from Korea?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  Did the two of you then discuss the cultural differences

  6   between Asia and the United States?

  7   A.  That's right.

  8   Q.  What did Mr. White tell you about cultural differences and

  9   anything relating to the laws of the country?

 10   A.  Well, we did not talk about laws.  We just merely talk

 11   about the food that we -- me and his wife would prefer, the

 12   religion and our sort of like pastime.

 13   Q.  Did he discuss with you the changes that you have had to

 14   make coming from Asia to the United States?

 15   A.  Yes.  Most of the women that came from Asia and from other

 16   countries, they always feel homesick, which same as me.

 17   Q.  Did he relate to you anything about what you need to do

 18   with the police officials while you were being interviewed?

 19   A.  Yes.  He told me that I have to tell the truth so that it

 20   will show that I have nothing to hide.  That way, Mr. Thomeczek

 21   would not repeat his question again and again.

 22   Q.  Were you complaining that you were answering the same

 23   questions over and over?

 24   A.  No.  I'm not complaining.  It's just there is a lot of

 25   question that they ask me and I just don't know what to answer



                                                                  715



  1   anymore.

  2   Q.  And had -- in your opinion, had you been telling the truth

  3   the whole evening?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  Did there come a time when you requested some diapers for

  6   your child?

  7   A.  Uh-huh.  That's the time that Sheila Dobson come in.

  8   Q.  And by that time, Ms. Dobson was there?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  All right.  And were diapers retrieved from your car?

 11   A.  No.  I asked if I can come out, I can go out and get the

 12   diapers, but they -- they told me that I can't because there is

 13   a lot of media outside and I have no idea about that.

 14   Q.  Okay.  Were diapers brought to you?

 15   A.  No -- well, Sheila Dobson went to the grocery store and

 16   bought diapers.

 17   Q.  Did any time that evening -- did anybody bring in the baby

 18   seat or the diapers from the car?

 19   A.  I don't remember, no.

 20   Q.  Do you recall seeing that baby seat inside the room where

 21   you were?

 22   A.  No.

 23   Q.  Do you recall seeing the diapers inside the room where you

 24   were that came from your truck?

 25   A.  No.



                                                                  716



  1   Q.  How do you know that Ms. Dobson had to go to the grocery

  2   store to buy the diapers?

  3   A.  She told me that she went to the grocery store.

  4   Q.  Was she -- excuse me.  I'm sorry.  I'm interrupting you.

  5   A.  She is not allowed to come in -- in the truck because they

  6   need to have a bomb squad in the truck before she opened it.

  7   Q.  So even Ms. Dobson was not allowed to go inside the truck?

  8   A.  Yes, that's correct.

  9   Q.  And you never saw a baby seat or diapers brought from that

 10   truck in to you; is that correct?

 11   A.  That's correct.

 12   Q.  Now, before you left, did you request that you be allowed

 13   to return home?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And what did the -- who was with you then as you were

 16   nearing leaving?  Were there three people with you?

 17   A.  I don't remember.  There was a lot of agents there.

 18   Q.  Was Mr. White of the United States Army still there?

 19   A.  No.  I think Mr. Thomeczek was still there and Sheila

 20   Dobson.

 21   Q.  Did Mr. White go with you to Abilene to the motel?  Was he

 22   in the car?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  All right.  Did you request that you be allowed to go down

 25   and speak to your husband?



                                                                  717



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  Had he been separated from you right away as soon as all of

  3   the agents came to the building?  Did they separate the two of

  4   you?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Were you allowed to talk to him during any of these six

  7   hours that you were being questioned?

  8   A.  No.

  9   Q.  Did you request then that you be allowed to go talk to

 10   Mr. Nichols?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  Had the agents told you that he wasn't going home with you?

 13   A.  Yeah.  They told me that.

 14   Q.  All right.  Did they tell you that you were going to be

 15   taken to some city?

 16            MR. MACKEY:  Objection.  Leading.

 17            THE COURT:  Sustained as to leading.

 18            MR. WOODS:  Yes.

 19   BY MR. WOODS:

 20   Q.  You mentioned earlier that the agents said that you

 21   couldn't go to your house.  Is that correct?

 22   A.  Yes.  That's correct.

 23   Q.  What did the agents tell you in relation to where you were

 24   going?

 25   A.  They told me that they were going to take me to Junction



                                                                  718



  1   City.

  2   Q.  All right.  When you went down to speak to Mr. Nichols, was

  3   it downstairs?

  4   A.  Yeah, in the basement.

  5   Q.  And were there other agents in that room?

  6   A.  There was a lot of agents there.

  7   Q.  Okay.  Without going into the discussion you had with

  8   Mr. Nichols, were you given anything by Mr. Nichols?

  9   A.  Pardon?

 10   Q.  Did Mr. Nichols give you any object at that time?

 11   A.  Yes.  He gave me his telephone card.

 12   Q.  All right.  And did you then leave with Nicole, start to

 13   leave the building?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  Did an agent ask to review and take possession of the

 16   telephone card?

 17   A.  Yes.  They had to take Xerox copy out of it.

 18   Q.  Did he ask you for a consent to search; that is, that you

 19   had a right to have papers on your person --

 20            MR. MACKEY:  Judge, I'd like to interpose an objection

 21   as to the leading nature and lack of time.  I've lost track of

 22   time and place.

 23            MR. WOODS:  It's as they're leaving the building and

 24   the agent said they'll need the card from her.

 25            THE COURT:  Well, please don't testify.



                                                                  719



  1            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

  2            THE COURT:  Let's ask her what the agents said.

  3   BY MR. WOODS:

  4   Q.  Did the agent request a consent to search to obtain that

  5   card from you?

  6            MR. MACKEY:  Same objection.

  7            THE WITNESS:  No.

  8            THE COURT:  You're putting it in legal terms.

  9            MR. WOODS:  I apologize, your Honor.

 10   BY MR. WOODS:

 11   Q.  What did the agent say to you when he requested the card?

 12   A.  Can we have a copy of this card?

 13   Q.  And what did you say?

 14   A.  I said okay.

 15   Q.  All right.  Did you feel that had you a choice one way or

 16   the other?

 17   A.  No.

 18   Q.  Where were you taken then?  The agents told you they were

 19   taking you to --

 20   A.  Junction City.

 21   Q.  Because you couldn't go home.  Where were you taken?

 22   A.  To the Abilene.

 23   Q.  Is that Abilene, Kansas?

 24   A.  Yeah.

 25   Q.  And to a hotel, motel, or house, or what?



                                                                  720



  1   A.  Hotel, Best Western Inn.

  2   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you would, pull the microphone toward you

  3   or lean forward so everyone can hear.  Whatever is comfortable

  4   for you.

  5            Who went with you to this motel?

  6   A.  Ms. Sheila Dobson and Mr. Thomeczek, and I think there was

  7   one girl that I forgot her name.  She works with Mr. Tom White.

  8   Q.  With the United States Army?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  Does the name Dawn Grey refresh your memory?

 11   A.  That might be.  I forget.

 12   Q.  All right.  Now, was that your choice to go to Abilene,

 13   Kansas?

 14   A.  No.

 15   Q.  What was your choice?  Where did you want to go?

 16   A.  I want to go home, my house.

 17   Q.  All right.  Let me back up just one minute to the Herington

 18   police station when the officers advised you that Terry wasn't

 19   going with you that night.  Did they tell you during that

 20   evening as to whether or not he was under arrest?

 21   A.  To my understanding, no.

 22   Q.  Did they explain to you why he wasn't going home with you?

 23   A.  Because he is a material witness.

 24   Q.  Okay.  And you -- when did they tell you that?

 25   A.  When we were -- when they question me at the police



                                                                  721



  1   station, before we leave.

  2   Q.  So they told you he wasn't going him with you because he

  3   was a material witness?

  4   A.  Uh-huh.  And that the U.S. marshal would want to take

  5   custody with him, for him -- I don't know how to say it.

  6   Q.  That the U.S. marshal wanted to take custody of him?

  7   A.  Uh-huh.

  8   Q.  And you left the police station.  If the log reflected that

  9   you talked with Mr. Nichols at 9:00, did you leave the police

 10   station right after you talked with Mr. Nichols?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  And Abilene, Kansas, in the motel -- this was Friday night

 13   that you got there?  Do you remember approximately what time

 14   you got there?

 15   A.  I have no idea because I already fall asleep in the van

 16   with Sheila Dobson.

 17   Q.  Did you have any clothes with you or any baby items?

 18   A.  No.  Only diapers and baby wipes.

 19   Q.  In the car, the pickup itself, did you have a diaper bag

 20   where you had baby items and bottles and stuff like that?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  Did the agents ever give that to you from the car?

 23   A.  On that night, no.

 24   Q.  That night?

 25   A.  No.



                                                                  722



  1   Q.  Did they give it to you the next morning?

  2   A.  I don't remember.

  3   Q.  All right.  On Saturday, which would be April 22, were you

  4   in the motel the whole time?

  5   A.  Yeah.  I think we went to buy some clothes and we went to

  6   Pizza Hut.

  7   Q.  But you requested some clothes because you didn't have

  8   anything?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  What else happened on Saturday, the 22nd?

 11   A.  I think we mainly stayed in the hotel after we eat.

 12   Q.  Were you questioned by the agents again concerning --

 13   A.  Yes, they questioned me concerning about when we left the

 14   house in Herington what is Terry's reaction and why did we

 15   pull --

 16   Q.  Let me interrupt just one second, Ms. Nichols.  I don't

 17   want to get into the substance of the questions at this time;

 18   but were you questioned by the agents?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  Now, let me go back to the -- April 21.  I did omit one

 21   thing.  Before you left the police station, did the agents ask

 22   you to sign a consent form to search your house and car?

 23   A.  They did, and I said that you have to get the permission

 24   from Terry, because it's his house.

 25   Q.  What did they say?



                                                                  723



  1   A.  We're going to get that, and we need yours, too.

  2   Q.  If you would, in the black book that's in front of you,

  3   look at Tab No. W14.  The black books, the ones on the right.

  4   Ms. Nichols, the black books.

  5   A.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got confused.  Here.

  6   Q.  Do you see the two exhibits that are at W14?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

  9   would offer into evidence the two consent forms signed that are

 10   Exhibits W14 in the defense exhibits.

 11            MR. MACKEY:  I'd like to hear some foundation from

 12   this witness as to circumstances surrounding execution.

 13            MR. WOODS:  I'll lay some foundation as to these are

 14   the ones she signed.

 15            THE COURT:  All right.

 16   BY MR. WOODS:

 17   Q.  Ms. Nichols, is your signature on both of the documents at

 18   W14?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  Have you seen those documents before?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  Are those the documents that you signed that evening?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 25   would offer the two items under W14 into evidence.



                                                                  724



  1            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.  There is some confusion,

  2   Judge.  There are two consent forms that bear the same exhibit

  3   number.  Maybe we could make a better record as to exactly

  4   which one is which.

  5            THE COURT:  Well, let's make one of them W14A.

  6            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  We'll make the consent

  7   for the house as 14A and the consent for the automobile as 14B.

  8            THE COURT:  All right.

  9   BY MR. WOODS:

 10   Q.  Ms. Nichols, approximately what time in relation to the

 11   time you left the station did they present these two documents

 12   to you?

 13   A.  I think they present these documents when Sheila Dobson

 14   come in.

 15   Q.  So it was approximately 45 minutes before you left?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  Was it just -- right at the time that Ms. Dobson came in,

 18   or was it after she came in and got to know you?

 19   A.  After she came in.

 20   Q.  Had she talked to you for a while before these documents

 21   were presented to you?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23            MR. MACKEY:  Excuse me.

 24            THE COURT:  Let's avoid the leading.

 25            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.



                                                                  725



  1   BY MR. WOODS:

  2   Q.  Then can you make an estimation how many minutes it was

  3   before you left, then, at the time you signed these documents?

  4   A.  I don't know.  I can't figure it out right now.

  5   Q.  All right.  And did the agents explain to you that you had

  6   a choice one way or the other on signing these?

  7            MR. MACKEY:  Judge, I object.

  8            THE COURT:  Why don't you please just ask her what

  9   happened, what was said.

 10            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

 11   BY MR. WOODS:

 12   Q.  What did the agents say to you when they handed you these

 13   two documents?

 14   A.  That they're asking my consent if I will allow them to

 15   search my house.  And I said well, you need to get that from

 16   Terry, because it's his house and that I need to read all of

 17   it, if I do understand all of it.  And I did ask Ms. Dobson

 18   about -- about this words here of my rights to refuse to

 19   consent to such search or by authorize.  And I don't mainly

 20   understand about it.

 21            Ms. Sheila Dobson explained it to me that you have

 22   rights to refuse it.

 23            And I said, well, what happen if I will refuse?

 24            And Mr. Thomeczek told me that they're just going to

 25   have to get search warrant in court, which will take a little



                                                                  726



  1   more time, but they will.

  2   Q.  And what did you say after he told you it would take more

  3   time?

  4   A.  I said okay, I want to cooperate, hoping that they would,

  5   you know, allow me to leave after that.

  6   Q.  You signed it because you hoped they would allow you to

  7   leave?

  8   A.  Yes.  I was cooperating mainly because I want them to know

  9   that I have nothing to hide and that I thought that this was

 10   right.  I never know that, you know, I could refuse it, really.

 11   Q.  Would you look at your signature on those two documents?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  On one of them, did you sign your first name twice?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  Why did you do that, Ms. Nichols?

 16            MR. MACKEY:  Judge, I object.  We need to figure out

 17   which exhibit we're having the witness refer to.

 18            THE COURT:  Let's get them marked now so that we know

 19   what we're dealing with.  Do you want to mark 14A as the house,

 20   did you say?  14A for the house, 14B for the truck.

 21   BY MR. WOODS:

 22   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if I may back up one question, what did

 23   Mr. Thomeczek say to you when you expressed some lack of

 24   understanding?

 25   A.  He told me that eventually, we will get a search warrant in



                                                                  727



  1   the court and that will take us time, but we will, if you don't

  2   sign it.

  3   Q.  Now, were you informed at a later time -- if you would look

  4   at the second page of 14A and 14B.  Both of them have written

  5   across there "no consent search done on this date"?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  Were you informed by the agents that they did not conduct a

  8   search pursuant to these?

  9            MR. MACKEY:  Objection, your Honor.

 10            THE WITNESS:  I don't remember.

 11            THE COURT:  Sustained as to leading.

 12            MR. MACKEY:  Excuse me.  I have another objection.

 13   There is a statement in the record about two signatures on one

 14   of these exhibits, and there is no clarification.  I'm looking

 15   at 14A and 14B.  I can't find it.

 16            THE COURT:  There isn't any statement on the record.

 17   There is a question that was never answered.

 18            MR. MACKEY:  All right.

 19            THE COURT:  I assume --

 20            MR. WOODS:  I'm withdrawing that question, your Honor.

 21            THE COURT:  All right.  I think we had a question that

 22   you're going to rephrase.

 23            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

 24            THE COURT:  All right.

 25   BY MR. WOODS:



                                                                  728



  1   Q.  Concerning the searches that you had given consents to, did

  2   the agents ever tell you anything about those two consents you

  3   had given?

  4   A.  No.

  5            MR. MACKEY:  Objection, Judge.  Lack of foundation.

  6   Are we talking about the same two consents on April 21?

  7            THE COURT:  You're asking about 14A and 14B?

  8            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  The only two consents

  9   that she's given as of this date on April 21.

 10            THE COURT:  Well, I think the record needs to be clear

 11   what we're talking about; and you're talking about 14 -- W14A

 12   and W14B.

 13            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

 14            THE COURT:  All right.

 15            Do you understand?

 16            THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

 17   BY MR. WOODS:

 18   Q.  Did the agents either the following day of April 22 or any

 19   day later inform you what they had done pursuant to those

 20   consents?

 21   A.  No.

 22   Q.  Now, going to Saturday, on the 22nd, you said that you

 23   bought clothes and were fed?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  And that the agents continued to question you?



                                                                  729



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  Now, the next day, Sunday, April 23, where were you at that

  3   time?  What city?

  4   A.  Sunday, I am still at Abilene.

  5   Q.  Did you stay in Abilene that whole day, or did you go

  6   somewhere?

  7   A.  I don't remember.

  8   Q.  Was there an occasion where you happened to go to the

  9   Herington residence on April 23?

 10            MR. MACKEY:  Objection, Judge.

 11            MR. WOODS:  May it please --

 12            THE COURT:  He's just suggesting the possibility.  I

 13   don't see that as an objectionable question.

 14            MR. WOODS:  I apologize to the Court.  There has to be

 15   some leading --

 16            THE COURT:  I just recognized that.

 17            MR. WOODS:  I see.

 18            THE COURT:  Do it.

 19   BY MR. WOODS:

 20   Q.  Was there an occasion when you went to your home on

 21   April 23?

 22   A.  I don't remember.  I think we went another day, Monday.

 23   Q.  If you would, then, look at Tab E1.

 24   A.  Is it still in this --

 25   Q.  Still the same -- no -- yes, same book, in the front of the



                                                                  730



  1   book under E1.

  2            THE COURT:  The clerk will help you there.

  3   BY MR. WOODS:

  4   Q.  If you would look at that document, is your signature on

  5   that document, Mrs. Nichols?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  And is there a date next to your signature?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  And what is the document entitled at the top?

 10   A.  It says a consent to search my residence in Herington,

 11   Kansas, and a vehicle, the truck that we have.

 12   Q.  All right.  And the 23rd is two days after you had gone to

 13   the police station on Friday; is that correct?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  So this is Sunday.  Does that refresh your memory as to

 16   whether or not you went to your house on that day?

 17   A.  Yes, I think we went to our house.

 18   Q.  Okay.  Do you recall approximately what time you went to

 19   the house?

 20   A.  I can't remember.

 21   Q.  Did the agents tell you what the purpose was going to be

 22   for you to go to the house on Sunday?

 23   A.  Yes.  I need to pick up my stuff and that -- so I can get a

 24   ticket and go back to Philippines.

 25   Q.  By your stuff, what do you mean?



                                                                  731



  1   A.  All of my things that I needed, like clothing and for

  2   Nicole's toys and anything that I could find in the house that

  3   I need.

  4   Q.  And so you wanted to go back to the house to pick that up

  5   on Sunday?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  When did they present to you the consent to search form,

  8   which is E1?

  9   A.  I forgot.

 10   Q.  All right.

 11            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court,

 12   before we continue with this, he would like to offer E1 into

 13   evidence.

 14            THE COURT:  I have it as already received.

 15            MR. WOODS:  All right.  Thank you.

 16   BY MR. WOODS:

 17   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you would look at your signature on this

 18   document, which is the one that has your signature twice --

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  Why did you put your first name twice there?

 21   A.  I have no idea.

 22   Q.  What, if anything, did the agents tell you in relation to

 23   this form that they gave you to sign?

 24   A.  Pardon?

 25   Q.  You signed this form on April 23.  Do you recall the



                                                                  732



  1   conversation that you had with the agents when they gave it to

  2   you?

  3            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, if I might ask for

  4   identification of persons, what agents.

  5            THE COURT:  Yes.  We should find out who she's talking

  6   about.

  7   BY MR. WOODS:

  8   Q.  Yes.  On Sunday, April 23, when you went back to your

  9   house, what agents went with you?

 10   A.  Mr. Thomeczek and Sheila Dobson, and there was another

 11   agent that I forgot his name.  We pick him up in Herington.

 12   Q.  And was that just three agents and that's all?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  Was it one of those three who gave you this form to sign?

 15   A.  Yes, Mr. Thomeczek.

 16   Q.  All right.  And what explanation did he give you concerning

 17   this form?

 18   A.  That they need to search the house and that they need to

 19   search the truck, too.

 20   Q.  And what did you say when they explained that to you?

 21   A.  Well, I said that I will sign it, even though I don't

 22   exactly understand what it is.

 23   Q.  Did you feel that you had a choice in not signing it?

 24   A.  No.

 25   Q.  Was this in connection with you getting into your house to



                                                                  733



  1   get your personal items?

  2   A.  Where they went to our house.

  3   Q.  I'm sorry?

  4   A.  And then they give me this and I tell them.

  5   Q.  Did they give this to you at the house as you were inside

  6   the house?

  7   A.  No.  Inside hotel room at somewhere in Fort Riley, Kansas.

  8   Q.  This was before you went to the house?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  And you had already requested to go to the house to pick up

 11   your personal items?

 12   A.  Uh-huh.

 13   Q.  So you went to the house, then, that day?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  What happened when you went inside the house?

 16   A.  Well, Mr. Thomeczek told me that we only have about half an

 17   hour or 45 minutes to be in this house because we need to get

 18   out so quick before the media will find out.

 19   Q.  So what did you do, then, inside the house while you were

 20   there?

 21   A.  I pick up my clothes and Mr. Thomeczek help me and both of

 22   them would not give me out of their sight.  Like Ms. Sheila

 23   Dobson would stay with me all the time in the room.

 24   Q.  And did you pack up some of your items?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  734



  1   Q.  Did you pick up anything else at the house that you noticed

  2   there?

  3   A.  Yeah.  I pick up Terry's -- what do you call that?  Stock

  4   certificate.

  5   Q.  Where was that?

  6   A.  Nearby the dining table or kitchen table, what you call it.

  7   Q.  Was there a document in there that had been left by the

  8   Government?

  9   A.  No.

 10   Q.  Do you recall whether or not you were given an inventory of

 11   the search that had been conducted the prior day?

 12   A.  No.

 13   Q.  What else did you pick up in the house?

 14   A.  I'm sorry.  After we left the house, Mr. Thomeczek gave me

 15   the inventory.

 16   Q.  Oh, okay.  Do you know where he obtained that inventory?

 17   A.  I don't know.

 18   Q.  Did he relate to you where he had gotten the inventory?

 19   A.  I don't remember.

 20   Q.  While you were in the house, did you see the agents do

 21   anything?

 22   A.  No.

 23   Q.  Did they ever explain to you that they were there to

 24   conduct a search?

 25   A.  No.  I know one of the policemen helped Sheila Dobson try



                                                                  735



  1   to find the receipt that we had when we rented some movies.

  2   Q.  Was there anything else that was searched for, to your

  3   knowledge?

  4   A.  No.

  5   Q.  Did the agents tell you to observe them while they

  6   conducted the search for the receipt?

  7   A.  No.

  8   Q.  Now, when you left there and Mr. Thomeczek gave you the

  9   return -- that's a list of items -- did you read the list of

 10   items?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  And what did you notice on this return?

 13   A.  I noticed that they haven't found my money that I put under

 14   the bed, and I did try to ask Mr. Thomeczek if I can get it

 15   myself; and he said no, we can't do that.

 16   Q.  How did you notice that they hadn't found that?

 17   A.  Because it's not in the inventory list.

 18   Q.  Did Mr. Thomeczek know which money you were talking about?

 19   A.  No.

 20   Q.  Had you mentioned this money to him before?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  When?

 23   A.  Before we left, at the police station.

 24   Q.  What did you tell him about the money when you were in the

 25   police station?



                                                                  736



  1   A.  That I have money under the box spring of the bed.  Can I

  2   have the money and the gold coins?  There was gold coins there,

  3   too, that Terry have given to me; and he said well, we're

  4   probably going to give you the money but not the gold coins.

  5   Q.  He told you this at the police station?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  And what conversation did you have with him then in the car

  8   after you had reviewed the log?

  9   A.  I told Mr. Thomeczek that they haven't found my money and

 10   it's not in the inventory, the other list.  Can I have it?  Can

 11   we turn around and get it?  And he said no, we cannot do that.

 12   Q.  What did he next say to you in relation to this money?

 13   A.  Well, he told me that they have to go put it -- I mean give

 14   it to somebody; that they will have a test, like a laboratory

 15   test.  I'm sorry.  And that they have to get some evidence

 16   there if Tim McVeigh has fingerprints on that money.

 17            And I told them no, I don't think Tim has fingerprints

 18   on that.

 19   Q.  Let's back up just one minute, if you would.

 20            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, this is going to be awhile.

 21   Whenever the Court wants to take a break.  I can keep going.

 22            THE COURT:  If this is a good place, let's do it.

 23            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

 24            THE COURT:  We'll break till 1:30.

 25            During this time, you should not talk about your



                                                                  737



  1   testimony with anyone else, except you can consult with your

  2   lawyer, Ms. Cain, if you wish.

  3            MR. JONES:  No, your Honor.  It was Mr. Manspeaker.

  4            THE COURT:  Mr. Woods, you may proceed.

  5            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

  6                    DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED

  7   BY MR. WOODS:

  8   Q.  Ms. Nichols, when we broke for the lunch break, you were

  9   describing the events when you were in the car leaving your

 10   house and Mr. Thomeczek had shown you the inventory of the

 11   items seized in the search warrant the day previously.

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  What did you say to him after reviewing the search warrant

 14   log, the recovery log?

 15   A.  I told him that the money that I put under the bed didn't

 16   found it.

 17   Q.  And what did he say to you?

 18   A.  Well, he didn't say anything, but I asked him if I could --

 19   we could turn around and get my money back, and he said no, we

 20   cannot do that.

 21   Q.  Okay.  And what next happened with Mr. Thomeczek concerning

 22   that money?

 23   A.  Well, when we get to Fort Riley, somewhere in Fort Riley or

 24   Junction City hotel, I did still try to ask him if I could have

 25   that money back.  And he said no, we have to go to laboratory



                                                                  743



  1   and have that test if Tim McVeigh's fingerprints is in that

  2   money.

  3   Q.  All right.  Let me back up just one minute.  If you would,

  4   look at G1 in the black volume.

  5   A.  G1.

  6   Q.  Do you recognize that document, Mrs. Nichols?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  Is that your signature on the document?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  And how is it entitled at the top?

 11   A.  Pardon?

 12   Q.  What's the title on the top of the document?

 13   A.  This is a consent to of Marife Nichols to search this

 14   premises.

 15            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 16   would offer into evidence G1, a consent to search.  That's the

 17   second consent to search signed on April the 23.

 18            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 19            THE COURT:  G1 is received.

 20   BY MR. WOODS:

 21   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you would just look at that a minute for a

 22   note and the time and what you were consenting to.

 23   A.  Okay.

 24   Q.  And then look at the second page.  Have you seen that

 25   document before?



                                                                  744



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  All right.  And does that refresh your memory as to what

  3   happened before you went to Fort Riley, or did this happen

  4   after you got to Fort Riley; that is, signing the consent form?

  5   A.  After.

  6   Q.  All right.  Then when did Mr. Thomeczek present this form

  7   to you to sign?

  8   A.  When we arrive in my hotel.

  9   Q.  All right.  And what explanation did he give to you

 10   concerning the form?

 11   A.  That I need to sign this so that they can get the money out

 12   from the house and so they can take it to the laboratory.

 13   Q.  And was this your money?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And did you con -- consent to get your own money out of

 16   your own house?

 17   A.  By signing this, I guess, yeah.

 18   Q.  And then did you go back to the house with the agents to

 19   obtain this?

 20   A.  No.

 21   Q.  How many visits did you make to the house on that day,

 22   April 23?

 23   A.  Just once.

 24   Q.  If you would, turn to W41, which'll be in the second black

 25   volume.



                                                                  745



  1   A.  Okay.

  2   Q.  I'm sorry.  44.  My apologies.  And if you would, it's a

  3   very short FBI 302.  If you would look at W44 and read that,

  4   and I want to ask you a question since it concerns you.

  5            Now, Ms. Nichols, approximately what time was it on

  6   that day, April 23, Sunday, when you were at your house in

  7   Herington?

  8   A.  Afternoon.  About 1:00 or 2:00.

  9   Q.  All right.  Do you recall when you were at that house

 10   that -- would you repeat to the Court who was there with you?

 11   A.  Mr. Thomeczek, Ms. Sheila Dobson, and there's always been

 12   one guy from Herington police station, which I assume is in

 13   FBI.  I forget his name.

 14   Q.  And were there others there?

 15   A.  No.

 16   Q.  Do you know an FBI agent named Scott Williamson?

 17   A.  That name is familiar.

 18   Q.  Do you recall whether or not he was there that day in the

 19   house with you?

 20   A.  I'm not sure.

 21   Q.  Do you know a female FBI agent, Mary Jasnowski?

 22   A.  That name is familiar, but --

 23   Q.  Do you know whether or not she was in that house that

 24   Sunday afternoon with you?

 25   A.  No.



                                                                  746



  1   Q.  Are you -- are you saying no, you don't know, or no, she

  2   wasn't there?

  3   A.  No, she wasn't there.

  4   Q.  All right.  Also, another female agent, Sonja Hernandez.

  5   A.  She wasn't there.

  6   Q.  And a photographer, Melinda Preston?

  7            MR. MACKEY:  Objection, Judge, unless we establish

  8   foundation how she knows the person to say she's not there.

  9            THE WITNESS:  She wasn't there.

 10            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, it

 11   is -- it is the Government's representation that they conducted

 12   a search the afternoon of April 23 in the presence of Marife

 13   Nichols to satisfy the consent of Terry Nichols conditioned on

 14   his wife being present.  And it is -- what we're trying to

 15   establish is when she was there that one time that afternoon,

 16   there was not a group of people there conducting a search.

 17            THE COURT:  The point of the objection is if she

 18   doesn't know the persons whose names you are giving her, she

 19   cannot be telling us that they were not there.

 20            MR. WOODS:  All right.

 21   BY MR. WOODS:

 22   Q.  Do you know if there were more than three agents there with

 23   you, Ms. Nichols?

 24   A.  No.  There's only three agents there with me.

 25   Q.  All right.  Thank you.  And during that afternoon, did they



                                                                  747



  1   advise you that they were conducting a search?

  2   A.  No.

  3   Q.  How much money, Ms. Nichols, did you personally have in the

  4   bed where you related it was?

  5   A.  $5,000.

  6   Q.  And what did Mr. Thomeczek tell you concerning that money

  7   after it was recovered?

  8   A.  Well, he said they have to send it to the laboratory.  I

  9   didn't ask him if they did already or not.

 10   Q.  Now, if you would, turn to W5 in that first black notebook.

 11   If you would review that document.  Is that your signature at

 12   the bottom?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  And it reflects a date and time?

 15   A.  Okay.

 16            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 17   would move to introduce into evidence W5, a consent signed by

 18   Marife Nichols.

 19            MR. JONES:  The book we have doesn't have the tabs on

 20   the side.  Is there a Bates number?  In other words, I can't

 21   tell which is W5.

 22            MR. WOODS:  554.

 23            MR. JONES:  Thank you.

 24            THE COURT:  Any objection to W5?

 25            MR. MACKEY:  No, your Honor.



                                                                  748



  1            THE COURT:  Received.

  2   BY MR. WOODS:

  3   Q.  Ms. Nichols, after reviewing this document, does that

  4   refresh your memory as to what happened later that night on

  5   Sunday, the 23rd?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  All right.  When were you first given this document, if you

  8   were?

  9   A.  Pardon?

 10   Q.  When did you first see this document, No. W5?  Did someone

 11   give it to you?

 12   A.  Mr. Thomeczek give it to me.

 13   Q.  What did he say when he gave it to you?

 14   A.  That they need to search the garage behind my residence and

 15   they have to get the padlock, which I have no idea which one --

 16   or I don't know if there's any padlock.

 17   Q.  And did you feel that you had a choice one way or the other

 18   to consent to that?

 19   A.  No.

 20   Q.  Now, there's a notation above your signature, "without

 21   prejudice. UCC 1-207."

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  Did you put that on there?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  What do you understand that to mean?



                                                                  749



  1   A.  As far as I understand it from the book and from Terry

  2   Nichols, that if you don't understand what you're signing, you

  3   just put "without prejudice, UCC 1-207."  That protects your

  4   right, I guess.

  5   Q.  All right.  You mentioned that from what you understand

  6   from the book.  Which book are you --

  7   A.  Black's Law Dictionary.

  8   Q.  Did you read this in Black's Law Dictionary?

  9   A.  Before, yes, when we were in Michigan.

 10   Q.  Okay.  What did you think you were doing then by putting

 11   this reservation on your signature?

 12   A.  I don't know.  I was just -- on that time, I was mainly

 13   confused.  I don't even know what to do, and I feel like I've

 14   been abandoned.

 15   Q.  At that time on April the 23rd, that evening at 9:10, where

 16   were you?

 17   A.  Somewhere in Fort Riley or Junction City's hotel.

 18   Q.  Had you moved from Abilene?

 19   A.  Yes.  From Abilene.  Kansas City.

 20   Q.  Was that your choice to go to another city?

 21   A.  No.

 22   Q.  Was that your choice to go to a hotel?

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  On that Sunday, where did you want to go?

 25   A.  I want to go home most of the time.



                                                                  750



  1   Q.  Now, if you'll look at the next page on W5.  Had you seen

  2   that document?  Did they give that to you later?

  3   A.  I'm not sure.  They must have.  I forget.

  4   Q.  Do you recall one way or the other whether or not anything

  5   was found on that search?

  6   A.  I have no idea.

  7   Q.  If you would go to the next document, which is H1.

  8   A.  Yes, I got it.

  9   Q.  And if you would review the bottom of that.  Is that your

 10   signature?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  And what date is next to your signature?

 13   A.  April 24, '95.

 14            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 15   would offer into evidence H1, a consent to search signed on

 16   April the 24th.

 17            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 18            THE COURT:  H1 received.

 19   BY MR. WOODS:

 20   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you would look at the next page of that

 21   document.  I'm sorry.  It's H2.  It would be -- H2 is the next

 22   document.

 23   A.  Okay.

 24   Q.  Does that refresh your memory as to what the subject matter

 25   was on the consent that was signed that day, April 24?



                                                                  751



  1   A.  Yes.

  2            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

  3   would offer into evidence H2, the evidence recovery log for

  4   that consent.

  5            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

  6            THE COURT:  H2 received.

  7   BY MR. WOODS:

  8   Q.  Ms. Nichols, what do you recall about this form that you

  9   signed?  Who presented it to you and what did they say?  That

 10   would be H1.

 11   A.  Yes.  Ms. Sheila Dobson presented -- give it to me and that

 12   she -- she asked me if we -- earlier before, she asked me we

 13   have a vacuum cleaner.  I said we do.  It was in the house.

 14   Now she's referring to a big vacuum cleaner.  I don't know.

 15   Something that you use in a car.  I said I haven't seen any or

 16   we might have, but I just didn't have known about it.  And then

 17   that day, she came over and she want me to sign this so that

 18   she can get the vacuum cleaner.

 19   Q.  All right.  What did she say to you when she gave it to you

 20   to sign?

 21   A.  Well, I think -- I forgot what she said.

 22   Q.  All right.  Can you recall what your response was when it

 23   was given to you?

 24   A.  My response is like I just want to sign it.  I want to

 25   cooperate.



                                                                  752



  1   Q.  Did you feel you had a choice one way or the other?

  2   A.  I feel like it's -- I don't have any choice of it.

  3   Q.  On the 24th, how long had you been with the FBI?

  4   A.  Approximately three days.

  5   Q.  Did you have any money at that time?

  6   A.  Terry gave me money.

  7   Q.  How much did he give to you?

  8   A.  200.

  9   Q.  Okay.  And had you spent some of that money during those

 10   three days?

 11   A.  Yes.  I spent that for my clothes and some of my foods and

 12   Nicole's.

 13   Q.  So you had to buy your clothes while you were kept out of

 14   your house?

 15   A.  Yes.  Sheila Dobson told me that she could pay for it

 16   because she's been instructed to, you know, pay for my meals

 17   and my food, but I preferred to pay for it because I don't want

 18   to be burden to everybody.

 19   Q.  Okay.  On the 24th, where did you want to live at that

 20   time?

 21   A.  All the time, I want to be in my house, but I assumed that

 22   they won't let me.  I did ask, but they won't let me because

 23   the media is going to be around there.  There's going to be a

 24   lot of bills, too, is what they told me.

 25   Q.  All right.  So you can't go home because the media will be



                                                                  753



  1   there and there will be bills?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  Did you have money to pay the bills?

  4   A.  I don't have enough.

  5   Q.  Was that the reason that they gave you why you couldn't go

  6   home?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  If you would go to the next item, which is I-1.

  9   A.  Okay.

 10   Q.  Do you have I-1?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  And is that your signature at the bottom?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  And again, are you saying "without prejudice, UCC 1-207"?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  What is the date on that document?

 17   A.  April 24, '95.

 18   Q.  And does it also give a time?

 19   A.  9:40 p.m.

 20   Q.  All right.

 21            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 22   would offer into evidence I-1, a second consent signed on April

 23   the 24th.

 24            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 25            THE COURT:  All right.  I-1 received.



                                                                  754



  1   BY MR. WOODS:

  2   Q.  If you would, look at I-2.  Is that --

  3   A.  Okay.

  4   Q.  Does that refresh your memory as to what the consent was

  5   signed for?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, may I object?

  8            THE COURT:  Yes.

  9            MR. MACKEY:  We haven't established the witness has

 10   exhausted her memory before --

 11            THE COURT:  That's right.  You should find out if she

 12   has any present recollection.

 13   BY MR. WOODS:

 14   Q.  On this second consent that was signed on April the 24th,

 15   do you recall what they were wanting to seize at that time?

 16   A.  Yes.  They want to get the dishes in the house to see if

 17   there's any fingerprints from Tim McVeigh.

 18   Q.  And was there anything else that they asked you to consent

 19   to?

 20   A.  I don't remember.

 21   Q.  Who presented that form to you?

 22   A.  Mr. Thomeczek.

 23   Q.  And what did he say to you when he asked for your

 24   signature?

 25   A.  He just said, Could you sign this so that we can get the



                                                                  755



  1   dishes in your house and so we can see if there's a -- Tim

  2   McVeigh's fingerprints in it.

  3   Q.  And what did you reply to that?

  4   A.  Well, I think everything is -- you know, everything is not

  5   new to me anymore, so I just signed it right then.

  6   Q.  What did you feel your rights were as to whether or not to

  7   sign it or not?

  8   A.  I told him that time I got used to it.

  9   Q.  And if you would go to J-1.

 10   A.  Okay.

 11   Q.  And have you reviewed that document?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  Is that your signature at the bottom?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And what's the date?

 16   A.  April 25, '95.

 17   Q.  And a time?

 18   A.  3:17 p.m.

 19            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 20   would offer into evidence J1, a consent to search the next day

 21   on April 25.

 22            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 23            THE COURT:  Received.

 24   BY MR. WOODS:

 25   Q.  Do you recall what the subject matter of that consent was,



                                                                  756



  1   Ms. Nichols?

  2   A.  I think Sheila was talking about the TV set that Terry had

  3   to pick in -- Terry had to pick it up.  And they were talking

  4   about it, if there's any -- anything in that TV that Tim

  5   McVeigh might have put in there to -- one of the ingredients of

  6   a bomb, I guess.  I'm not quite sure.

  7   Q.  And what did you say to her about that television?

  8            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, please.  I believe this answer

  9   to this question could impact matters that we discussed on

 10   Wednesday that are under seal.  And if Mr. Wood could advise

 11   us --

 12            MR. WOODS:  It does not impact Mr. Jones.

 13            MR. JONES:  Thank you, sir.

 14            THE COURT:  Thank you.

 15   BY MR. WOODS:

 16   Q.  What did you tell Ms. Dobson about the TV set?

 17   A.  Well, I said I don't think it -- there's any of it, but --

 18   anyhow, I just want to cooperate and go ahead.  Do it.

 19   Q.  Did you tell her whether or not the TV set worked as a TV

 20   set?

 21   A.  Yes.  I told them that it doesn't work because it -- we

 22   don't have a cable at that time when Terry arrived in

 23   Herington.  But since April 20, a guy come over and hook on the

 24   cable, so I think it works.  And we used the VCR for that, too.

 25   Q.  So is your testimony that the television set worked as a



                                                                  757



  1   television set?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  All right.  And what did you tell Mrs. Dobson as to -- when

  4   she wanted the signature on the form?  What did you say to her?

  5   A.  I forgot what I said to her.

  6   Q.  Okay.  Did you feel that you had a right to sign it or not

  7   to sign it?

  8   A.  I feel that I have right not to sign everything, but I just

  9   want to cooperate so that I can go home soon.

 10   Q.  Why were you signing so that you could go home?  Where were

 11   you trying to go?

 12   A.  Philippines.

 13   Q.  How did you feel was your best way or only way to go to the

 14   Philippines?

 15   A.  I think it's my only way to go to Philippines since I

 16   cannot stay in my house in Herington, Kansas.

 17   Q.  And the only way to go to the Philippines is how?

 18   A.  To get my money so I can pay the ticket that I have

 19   reserved so I can go home.

 20   Q.  Concerning your money back on April 23, did you ask

 21   Mr. Thomeczek to -- to give you that money?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  And do you recall whether or not you were crying on that

 24   day?

 25   A.  Yes, I did cry for that, hoping that he would feel like,



                                                                  758



  1   you know, I'm his daughter and this is my money anyway, so

  2   maybe he would give it to me, but no.

  3   Q.  Now, you mentioned feeling like a daughter.  Had that

  4   relationship developed with Mr. Thomeczek?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Was he an older individual?

  7   A.  Yes.  I think he's older than my father.

  8   Q.  Do you know whether or not a TV set was taken from your

  9   house?

 10   A.  I have no idea.  I haven't seen the notes.

 11   Q.  You were not allowed to go back on that search with them?

 12   A.  That's correct.  I'm not allowed.

 13   Q.  Now, I want you to go next to K1.

 14   A.  Okay.

 15   Q.  And if you would, look at the signature on the bottom.

 16   A.  Okay.

 17   Q.  Is that your signature?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  And do you recall -- what date was this signed?

 20   A.  April 26, 1995.

 21   Q.  Do you recall the circumstances of this document being

 22   presented to you?

 23   A.  Yes.  They are recording my phone call from Terry Nichols.

 24   Q.  Had you had a chance to have a phone conversation with

 25   Terry Nichols since you last saw him on April 21?



                                                                  759



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  Had you asked for the opportunity to talk to your husband?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  How many times?

  5   A.  I forgot.

  6   Q.  Was it few or many?

  7   A.  I think many.

  8   Q.  What was your understanding on this form when you signed

  9   it?

 10   A.  That they have to put a recorder on my telephone so that we

 11   can -- they can record my conversation between me and Terry

 12   Nichols.

 13   Q.  Did you have an option to have the phone conversation

 14   without the recording?

 15   A.  I felt that I don't have any options.

 16   Q.  Did you discuss that with them, about having the phone

 17   conversation without it being recorded?

 18   A.  I don't think so.

 19   Q.  Now, if you would, look at K2, which is the transcript --

 20            MR. WOODS:  Excuse me, your Honor.  I'm not sure I

 21   offered K1 into evidence, and I would do so at this time.

 22            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 23            THE COURT:  K1 is received.

 24            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, just a moment.

 25            What is K1?



                                                                  760



  1            MR. WOODS:  K1, it's got a Bate stamp of 562 on the

  2   bottom.  It's a consent report.

  3            MR. JONES:  No objection, your Honor.

  4            THE COURT:  All right.

  5   BY MR. WOODS:

  6   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you would look at K2, which is a transcript

  7   of the conversation.  Have you had an opportunity to examine

  8   this in the past?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  Okay.  I want to call your attention just to two phrases on

 11   page 4.

 12   A.  Okay.

 13   Q.  In the middle of the page.  And if you would just read that

 14   to yourself.

 15   A.  Yes.  "I'm depending on these people here."

 16            THE COURT:  I think he meant just read it to yourself.

 17   BY MR. WOODS:

 18   Q.  Just read to yourself, refresh your memory, both that

 19   statement and the one above it, Mrs. Nichols.

 20   A.  Okay.

 21   Q.  Is that an accurate transcript of the recording of the

 22   conversation as you recall it on that day?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, I

 25   only want to offer these two sentences from this conversation,



                                                                  761



  1   and they are both just her statements.  They are not Terry

  2   Nichols' statements.

  3            MR. MACKEY:  I have no objection to the admission of

  4   the entire document, which I think is the way it should be

  5   done.

  6            MR. JONES:  We object.

  7            MR. WOODS:  The two sentences I'm offering, your

  8   Honor, on page 4, two statements by Ms. Nichols right in the

  9   center of the page.

 10            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, the only basis to my objection

 11   is that if the Court allows that, are we then opening the door

 12   that another portion will be admitted?

 13            THE COURT:  Yes.  I understand.

 14            MR. JONES:  Mr. Mackey was candid enough to say he'd

 15   like the whole document in.  I myself don't have an objection

 16   to the two sentences but for that possibility.

 17            THE COURT:  Well, the way in which this should be

 18   done, in my opinion, is if only those lines which are in the

 19   transcript attributed to this witness are the portions to be

 20   offered, they should be read into the record and not be subject

 21   to an exhibit.

 22            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

 23            THE COURT:  Does the Government oppose that for being

 24   out of context or something?

 25            MR. MACKEY:  I do not, your Honor.



                                                                  762



  1            THE COURT:  All right.  So just read those -- or you

  2   may read them into the record.

  3            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.  I would prefer

  4   that the witness do it since it's her statement, if that's

  5   acceptable with the Court.

  6            THE COURT:  All right.

  7   BY MR. WOODS:

  8   Q.  Ms. Nichols, are you on page 4?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  I'm speaking of the first sentence being the one, "I don't

 11   really want."  Do you see that?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  If you would, just read that one statement in.

 14   A.  "I -- I don't really want to stay here because, you know, I

 15   don't know -- I don't have vehicle.  I can't -- I'm totally

 16   helpless."

 17   Q.  All right.  And if you would, then read your next

 18   statement.

 19   A.  I'm depending on these people here and uh -- I don't

 20   wanta give any hassle to anyone."

 21   Q.  All right.  Thank you.  Now, if you would, go to the next

 22   consent, which is W8.  That would be in the first book.  W8.

 23   A.  Okay.

 24   Q.  There was no -- we were not provided with a form on this

 25   one.  I'll just ask you, do you recall whether or not you had a



                                                                  763



  1   conversation with Terry's father?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  Do you recall whether or not you signed a form for that?

  4   A.  I forgot.  I think I signed one of the consent for that.

  5   Q.  Do you recall whether or not you had the phone conversation

  6   with Terry's father?

  7   A.  Yes, we had a conversation.

  8   Q.  And did the FBI record that conversation?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  Did you feel that you could have that conversation without

 11   it being recorded?

 12   A.  Yes, since he's not -- he's not a witness to the case.

 13   Q.  Okay.  If you would then go to W6.

 14   A.  Okay.

 15   Q.  And is that your signature on that document?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  And is there a date on that document?

 18   A.  May 3, '95.

 19   Q.  Is there a time?

 20   A.  9 -- I'm not sure if it is -- p.m. or a.m.

 21   Q.  Now, there are two documents in W6.  One of them's for the

 22   house and one of them's for the car.  If you would look at both

 23   of them.  And is your signature on both of them?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we



                                                                  764



  1   would designate W6A for the house and W6B for the car.

  2   BY MR. WOODS:

  3   Q.  On May the 3rd, where are you staying?

  4   A.  I think in -- I'm not sure.  Either Manhattan or Junction

  5   City.

  6   Q.  Had you requested to be in Junction City or Manhattan,

  7   either one?

  8   A.  No.

  9   Q.  Were you given a choice as to whether or not to go to

 10   Junction City or Manhattan?

 11   A.  As far as I understood, no.

 12   Q.  Had you requested that you be allowed to return home?

 13   A.  Pardon?

 14   Q.  Had you requested that you be allowed to return home?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  Had you received your money back from the Government by

 17   this time, on May the 3rd?

 18   A.  No.

 19   Q.  Had you asked for your money back?

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  Do you recall who presented these two documents to you, W6A

 22   and B, to sign?

 23   A.  I think Ms. Sheila Dobson.

 24   Q.  What did she say to you when she presented these two

 25   documents?



                                                                  765



  1   A.  They need another consent search for the house and the

  2   pickup truck.

  3   Q.  Okay.  And what did you say to her when she presented those

  4   documents to you?

  5   A.  I forgot what I said, but -- what I said, I always

  6   cooperated with them, so I just signed it right then.

  7   Q.  Did you feel that you had a choice on signing it or not

  8   signing it?

  9   A.  No.

 10   Q.  What was your goal at that time on May the 3rd as to your

 11   situation and your young daughter who was not two years old?

 12   What were you trying to do at that time?

 13   A.  On that time, I was just hoping that they would give me my

 14   money; and I probably did ask on that day, too, what happened

 15   to the money, they did take it to the laboratory already or

 16   not.  I was totally depending on them for everything.

 17   Q.  What would happen if they gave you the money back and said

 18   okay, you don't have to stay with us anymore?

 19   A.  I would be able to get the ticket and go back home to

 20   Philippines.

 21   Q.  Was that your desire at that time on May the 3rd?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  And what were you doing in attempting to obtain that

 24   desire?

 25   A.  Just mainly cooperating with them.  I don't want to give



                                                                  766



  1   them a hassle.

  2   Q.  Did you go to the house on May the 3rd, since you had

  3   consented to the search of your house?

  4   A.  No.

  5   Q.  Now, if you would, go to --

  6            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

  7   would offer into evidence W6A and B, the two consents signed on

  8   May 3.

  9            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 10            THE COURT:  They are received.  W -- is it W8A and B?

 11            MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor.  It's W6.

 12            THE COURT:  W6.

 13            MR. WOODS:  A and B.

 14            THE COURT:  Thank you.  W6A and B received.

 15   BY MR. WOODS:

 16   Q.  And the next exhibit is L1.  L1, which is -- do you have

 17   L1, Ms. Nichols?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  If you would just read that.

 20            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, just a moment.  It's a 302,

 21   and we have not established whether this witness knows from

 22   independent recall --

 23            THE COURT:  Yes.  I think you should ask first whether

 24   she has a present recollection of the events of the day.

 25            MR. WOODS:  Yes.



                                                                  767



  1   BY MR. WOODS:

  2   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, calling your attention to May the 8th, do you

  3   recall where you were that day and what happened that day?

  4   A.  May the 8th?

  5   Q.  Yes.  Without reading that document in front of you, can

  6   you recall?

  7   A.  I think I was in Manhattan, Kansas.

  8   Q.  All right.  Did there come an occasion where the Government

  9   agents asked for a consent to take something from you?

 10   A.  I don't remember.

 11   Q.  Okay.  If you would, then, review L1 to see if that

 12   refreshes your memory.

 13   A.  Yes.  I think we were leaving from Kansas to Oklahoma City.

 14   Q.  By reading that document, does that refresh your memory as

 15   to that day?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  Would you tell us what you did on that day in relation to

 18   your actions with the Government.

 19   A.  Well, I asked them if we can stop over one time in our

 20   house so that I can pick up some stuff that I may have

 21   forgotten or -- I don't know.  But anyway, they did.

 22   Q.  Let me interrupt you just one minute.  When you say if we

 23   can stop over at my house, were they taking you somewhere?

 24   A.  Yes.  They told me that we were going to Oklahoma City that

 25   day.



                                                                  768



  1   Q.  For what purpose?

  2   A.  To be in a grand jury hearing.

  3   Q.  All right.  Had you received a subpoena of that date to

  4   appear at a grand jury on May 8 or 9th?

  5   A.  No.

  6   Q.  All right.  And again, you asked the agents what?

  7   A.  If we can stop over in our house and pick up some stuff

  8   that I may have need -- that -- I don't know.  I just want to

  9   see the house for the last time, because they told me that we

 10   are going to Oklahoma City.  That maybe we can get a ticket

 11   from there to go back home to the Philippines.

 12   Q.  Oh, so that was perhaps the last time you were going to see

 13   that house?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  Did they make you sign a consent form to get into your

 16   house on that day?

 17   A.  I don't remember.

 18   Q.  Did you go into your house with the agents that day?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  Did you pack up or -- excuse me.  What did you do once you

 21   got into the house?

 22   A.  I was just mainly looking around at -- I probably did move

 23   the -- the dresser just to see if I -- I sometimes left some

 24   stuff at the back of the dresser, like a comb or -- just not

 25   important, really.



                                                                  769



  1   Q.  Who was with you when you went into the house on May the

  2   9th -- May 8, I'm sorry?

  3   A.  Mr. Thomeczek and Ms. Sheila Dobson, and there was another

  4   agent from police station.

  5   Q.  What conversation did you have with the agents on that day

  6   while you were in the house?

  7   A.  Well, Sheila reminded me about when she was questioning me.

  8   She reminded me about the mixer that Terry used to grind

  9   ammonium nitrate, the fertilizer.  So I told her that it's

 10   somewhere there in the drawer.  I did try to find it and give

 11   it to her.  She asked if it's okay that we're going to take it.

 12   Q.  I'm sorry.  Would you repeat that?

 13   A.  She asked if it was okay that we're going to take the

 14   mixer.

 15   Q.  And what did you say?

 16   A.  I said it's okay.

 17   Q.  Did she say anything else concerning --

 18   A.  After that she said, Well, what else can we take?  The

 19   stove, the dryer, the washer, what else?  I said, You can take

 20   the whole house as long as you're going to, you know, give me

 21   my money and send me to Philippines.

 22   Q.  Did you mean that, that they could take the whole house?

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  Were you giving consent for them to load up the house on a

 25   trailer and take it away like they -- well, excuse me.



                                                                  770



  1   A.  No.  I was just mainly teasing to them.  You know, I get --

  2   I get close with these people.  I been with them every day.

  3   Q.  Was that your choice, to be with them every day?

  4   A.  No.

  5   Q.  During that period of time, did you discover that you were

  6   pregnant?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  All right.  And how did you discover that you were

  9   pregnant?

 10   A.  I did ask Ms. Sheila Dobson if she can get a pregnancy test

 11   somewhere at drugstore and she -- yeah.  I give her my money to

 12   buy that.  And she did, you know, return and give me the

 13   pregnancy test.

 14   Q.  All right.  And at the same time, you always had Nicole

 15   with you?

 16   A.  Yes.  All the time.

 17   Q.  And do you recall how many cities they moved you to during

 18   that 37-day period?

 19   A.  I think in Wichita.  And after Wichita, Oklahoma City.  And

 20   after Oklahoma City, we -- we probably did stop at Wichita and

 21   then go to Kansas, Missouri.

 22   Q.  Were any of those moves your choice?

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  All right.  After picking up your items at your house on

 25   May 8, did you then go to Oklahoma City?



                                                                  771



  1   A.  Yes.  I think we stopped at Wichita.

  2   Q.  What happened?  This is May the 8th.  Do you recall whether

  3   or not you had a meeting on May the 9th in Oklahoma City?

  4   A.  I forgot.

  5   Q.  All right.

  6   A.  I'm not accurate with dates.

  7   Q.  Do you recall having a meeting in the U.S. Attorney's

  8   office with a number --

  9   A.  When we reached Oklahoma?

 10   Q.  Yes.

 11   A.  Yes, we did have a meeting.

 12   Q.  Can you relate to the Court who was present in that

 13   meeting?

 14   A.  Mr. Mickey Hawkins.  He was an FBI agent.  Arlene Joplins

 15   (sic).  There was one attorney from Janet Reno's office.  I

 16   forget her name.

 17   Q.  Does the name Donna Bucella --

 19   a black guy -- lawyer.

 20   Q.  Does Jerome Holmes --

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  -- refresh your memory?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  And who else is there?

 25   A.  Mr. Thomeczek and Sheila Dobson.



                                                                  772



  1   Q.  And did they question you at that time?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  What was your understanding of the purpose of why you were

  4   in Oklahoma City on that day?

  5   A.  That we were going to be in the grand jury.

  6   Q.  Did any of these lawyers inform you that you had the right

  7   not to go into the grand jury to testify against your husband?

  8   A.  No.

  9   Q.  Did any of the lawyers inform you that you had a privilege

 10   not to repeat the confidential communications between you and

 11   your husband?

 12   A.  No.

 13   Q.  Approximately how long did the interview take place?

 14   A.  I don't know.  I forget.

 15   Q.  Was it --

 16   A.  Probably half day.

 17   Q.  Okay.  And did you go into the grand jury that day?

 18   A.  No.  I did ask if -- that time, I don't want to go to grand

 19   jury.  I did ask am I still going to go to grand jury, and they

 20   said yes.  But they did not take me to a grand jury hearing.

 21   Q.  Did you tell them you weren't going, or what happened

 22   there?  Why did you not go to grand jury that day, or do you

 23   know?

 24   A.  They said that they have to postpone it.

 25   Q.  And do you know when they postponed it to?



                                                                  773



  1   A.  I think they put a date in May 16.

  2   Q.  Were you given a grand jury subpoena on that day?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  And who gave that to you?

  5   A.  Mr. Thomeczek in the parking lot.

  6   Q.  If you would, look at Exhibit No. 74.  That would be W74 in

  7   the second book.

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  Do you recognize that document, Mrs. Nichols?

 10   A.  Yes.  This is the documents that Mr. Thomeczek gave to me.

 11   Q.  And when did he give that to you?

 12   A.  I think May 9 or -- after we talked to the attorney, the

 13   Government's attorney.

 14   Q.  It's the same day that you had the meeting with the

 15   lawyers?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  Okay.  Did you have any discussion in that meeting with the

 18   lawyers about an attorney for yourself?

 19   A.  I think I did ask one time, and they told me that you're

 20   okay as long as you're -- you're telling the truth.  You're not

 21   a suspect, so you don't need a lawyer unless you're not telling

 22   the truth.  Then you need a lawyer.

 23   Q.  Who told you that?

 24   A.  Either Arlene or Donna Bucella.  I forget.

 25   Q.  Who was sort of the leader of the meeting that was doing



                                                                  774



  1   the questioning?

  2   A.  I can't tell.  They are all asking me questions.

  3            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

  4   would offer into evidence W74, the grand jury subpoena.

  5            THE COURT:  We already have that in.

  6            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

  7   BY MR. WOODS:

  8   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you look on that grand jury subpoena on the

  9   right-hand side, about three-quarters of the way down, it gives

 10   the name of a lawyer who typed it up or who issued it.

 11   A.  Yes.  It's Jerome Holmes.

 12   Q.  Was he one of the lawyers in the meeting?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  And again, the day that you're to come back is the 16th?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  All right.  After you left the meeting, where did you go

 17   then on May the 9th?

 18   A.  I think we stopped over in Wichita to meet the people from

 19   the Philippine embassy.

 20   Q.  Had you been in telephone contact with the Philippine

 21   embassy?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  And for what purpose?

 24   A.  They just want to keep in touch with me if I'm okay.

 25   Q.  Did you meet with them in Wichita?



                                                                  775



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  And where were you then taken?

  3   A.  I think there was some FBI office there that I -- I forgot

  4   his name.

  5   Q.  Was this in the city of Wichita?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  Anybody ask you to sign any consent forms on that day?

  8   A.  No.

  9   Q.  Where were you next taken?

 10   A.  To Kansas City, Missouri.

 11   Q.  Was that your choice?

 12   A.  No.

 13   Q.  How long did you stay in Kansas City?

 14   A.  I think we wait -- we wait there until May 15 or 14 so that

 15   we can come back to Oklahoma.  I forgot how many days.

 16   Q.  During this period, which is almost a month a later, did

 17   the Government tell you why you could or could not go back to

 18   your house in Herington?

 19   A.  No, they did not tell me about that.

 20   Q.  Did you ask to go back to the house?

 21   A.  I wanted to go back to the house.  I don't remember if I

 22   did ask, but most of the time, I wanted to go back in the

 23   house.

 24   Q.  Do you recall then going back to Oklahoma City for this

 25   grand jury appearance?



                                                                  776



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  Do you recall what day it was when you went there?

  3   A.  I think it's May 17.

  4   Q.  Even though the grand jury subpoena reflects a date of

  5   May 16, you think it is the 17th?

  6   A.  I don't know.  I forgot what was the reason why we -- we

  7   didn't go on May 16.

  8   Q.  All right.  What happened when you went to the grand

  9   jury -- or the U.S. attorney's office, wherever you went in

 10   Oklahoma City, on May 17?

 11   A.  On May 17, we went to the attorney's office.  And they have

 12   me wait in there for, like, half an hour.  Arlene came out and

 13   said to one of these girls that works with her that if she can

 14   accompany me around the building just to entertain me.  Go look

 15   around.  And that's what we did.  By the time we come back, I

 16   meet Lana Padilla.

 17   Q.  How long did you tour the building?

 18   A.  Say, half an hour or so.

 19   Q.  All right.  What next conversation did you have with any

 20   Government personnel?

 21   A.  On that day?

 22   Q.  Yes.  Either the lawyers or the agents.  Were there any

 23   agents with you?

 24   A.  Yes.  Mr. Thomeczek and Sheila Dobson.

 25   Q.  All right.  And did you have a conversation with the



                                                                  777



  1   lawyers about going to the grand jury?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  All right.  What conversation did you have and with whom?

  4   A.  Well, they -- oh, I did say -- they said that I don't need

  5   to go to the grand jury hearing because they feel that I -- I

  6   have been telling them the truth.

  7   Q.  And was that it?  Was that the end of --

  8   A.  Yes.  And that --

  9   Q.  -- the grand jury appearance?

 10   A.  -- they are going to give me money for coming over.

 11   Q.  How much money did they give you for coming over?

 12   A.  About 120 or 25.  I forgot.

 13   Q.  $125?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  They weren't giving you the money that was yours at that

 16   time; is that correct?

 17   A.  No.  They give me the money as -- I don't know.  They make

 18   me sign all those papers that I'm going to get the money.

 19   Q.  Do you know whether or not that was a witness fee?

 20   A.  I don't know.

 21   Q.  Did you also -- well, skip that question.

 22            I'm going to go to the last consent that you signed,

 23   W11.

 24   A.  Okay.

 25   Q.  Is that your signature at the bottom, Mrs. Nichols?



                                                                  778



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  And again, you have the notation "without prejudice"?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  What date was that signed?

  5   A.  May 19, 1995.

  6   Q.  All right.  And where were you at that time?

  7   A.  Embassy Suites in Oklahoma City.

  8   Q.  Okay.

  9            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

 10   would offer into evidence W11, a consent signed on May the

 11   19th.

 12            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 13            THE COURT:  Receive W11.

 14   BY MR. WOODS:

 15   Q.  Now, do you remember what this consent concerned?

 16   A.  Yes.  They have to pick up the toys of Jason, which I

 17   always asked them about it.  I wanted to go back after that

 18   May 17 meeting from the lawyers, and they would not allow me.

 19   Q.  You wanted to go back where?

 20   A.  Go back to Herington so that --

 21   Q.  What -- excuse me.  I'm sorry.  I interrupted.

 22   A.  So I can pick up the stuff that I want to take with me.

 23   Q.  What reason did they give you that 30 days or 28 days after

 24   they had searched the house -- what reason did they give you

 25   that you couldn't go back to your own house?



                                                                  779



  1   A.  Well, I'm not allowed to go back in my house.

  2   Q.  You just accepted that?

  3   A.  No.  I did try to ask Sheila and Mr. Thomeczek about that,

  4   if I can go back to the house, because in that time, too -- in

  5   between that time, I receive a phone call or I did -- made a

  6   phone call to Joyce Wilt, Terry's mother.  She told me to clean

  7   up the refrigerator because since the house has been left alone

  8   and we need to clean up the refrigerator.

  9   Q.  Did you ask that you be allowed to go back to the house?

 10   A.  Yes.  I asked them, and they won't allow me.

 11   Q.  Did there come a time when you started crying --

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  -- to the agents?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And was Mrs. Dobson crying?

 16   A.  At that time, I forget.  She did cry that time.

 17   Q.  Do you recall whether or not there was an occasion where

 18   Mrs. Dobson was crying, also?

 19   A.  Yeah.  The last day that they stay in Embassy Suites.

 20   Q.  All right.

 21   A.  Finally, Sheila Dobson told me that I think they don't want

 22   you to go home.

 23   Q.  Do you recall what day that was?

 24   A.  I forgot.

 25   Q.  Embassy Suites where?



                                                                  780



  1   A.  In Oklahoma City.

  2   Q.  Okay.  Do you recall the dates that you were at the Embassy

  3   Suites in Oklahoma City?

  4   A.  I think -- I forgot.  Must be the second week of May.

  5   Q.  Was Mrs. Dobson attempting to help you get your money so

  6   you could go back?

  7   A.  That's what I feel.

  8   Q.  What caused her to cry with you?

  9            MR. MACKEY:  Objection.

 10            THE COURT:  Sustained.

 11            THE WITNESS:  I think --

 12            THE COURT:  No.  You shouldn't answer.

 13            THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.

 14            THE COURT:  That's all right.

 15   BY MR. WOODS:

 16   Q.  Did Mrs. Dobson ever explain to you why you could not get

 17   your money back?

 18   A.  No.

 19   Q.  Did she ever explain to you why she was crying?

 20   A.  I forgot if I did ask her.

 21   Q.  All right.  On W11, which is the consent of May 19, had you

 22   requested that since you're not being allowed to go back into

 23   the house that the agents obtain something from the house?

 24   A.  No.  I feel that I'm not allowed to go back in the house.

 25   It's because in that time, it's just too much work for



                                                                  781



  1   Mr. Thomeczek and Mr. -- Ms. Dobson for me.  You know, they

  2   have to go back and take me back here in Oklahoma city, since

  3   they did not give me my money back yet.

  4   Q.  Okay.  What did this consent concern, this one that was

  5   signed on May 19?

  6   A.  That they are allowed to pick up the toys of Jason's that's

  7   in the basement and Nicole's, too.

  8   Q.  So you wanted the toys removed from the house?

  9   A.  Yes.  I wanted to take it with me; but they said well, we

 10   can send it to your parents' house, to your parents' address.

 11   Q.  And you had to sign a consent to get your own toys out of

 12   your house?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  Did you also ask them anything concerning the refrigerator?

 15   A.  Yes, I did ask them about that.  And they said that we can

 16   clean it.

 17   Q.  Okay.  Do you recall when you received your money back that

 18   they had picked up on April 23?

 19   A.  The night after we -- the night after you visited me.  I

 20   forget what was the date of it.

 21   Q.  That was on May the 24th.

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  Was there an occasion earlier when you learned that Terry

 24   Nichols had lawyers appointed for him?

 25   A.  Yes.  I think Mr. Mickey Hawkins or maybe Donna -- I forgot



                                                                  782



  1   which one -- who give me the telephone number of yours and Mr. 

  2   Mike Tiger.

  3   Q.  And did you make a phone call?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  Were you allowed to leave the phone number where you were?

  6   A.  No.

  7   Q.  Why were you not allowed to leave the phone number?

  8   A.  Because the media might found it and it's easy for them to

  9   track me down.

 10   Q.  Who told you that?

 11   A.  Mr. Thomeczek.

 12   Q.  So in all the phone calls that you made during those days

 13   you were with the FBI, were you allowed to leave a return

 14   number where people could call you?

 15   A.  No, but I did somehow leave some to my parents.

 16   Q.  On May the 24th, when I met you, do you recall where you

 17   were?

 18   A.  In Embassy Suites at Oklahoma City.

 19   Q.  And which agent was with you on that day?

 20   A.  Nancy Houston.

 21   Q.  After I talked with you, did you have an occasion to be in

 22   the presence of agents taking notes?

 23   A.  Pardon?

 24   Q.  After I talked with you on the 24th, did you start taking

 25   notes of your meetings with the agents?



                                                                  783



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  And what did the agents say to that?

  3            MR. MACKEY:  Objection without further foundation.

  4   When?  Where?

  5            THE COURT:  All right.  Let's establish a time, place

  6   and presence.

  7            MR. WOODS:  Yes.

  8   BY MR. WOODS:

  9   Q.  I met with you on May the 24th, Ms. Nichols?

 10            MR. MACKEY:  Judge, we'll so stipulate.  It's

 11   testimony, apparently.

 12   BY MR. WOODS:

 13   Q.  After May 24, did you start taking notes with your

 14   conversations with agents?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  What day after May 24 did you start taking notes with your

 17   conversations with agents?

 18   A.  I think after we talked, I start taking notes of all the

 19   questions that they ask me.

 20   Q.  All right.  You said that they gave your money back to you

 21   that evening on May 24th; is that correct?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  And who did that?

 24   A.  Donna Sampson and one of the BATF.  I forgot his name.

 25   Q.  The ATF was also talking to you and interviewing you?



                                                                  784



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  What were they doing?  They just had your money?

  3   A.  Yeah.

  4   Q.  Okay.  So do you recall that name?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Who?

  7   A.  Pardon?

  8   Q.  Do you recall the name of the ATF agent?

  9   A.  I forgot.

 10   Q.  Okay.

 11   A.  I can't remember him.  But --

 12   Q.  How much money did they give back to you, Mrs. Nichols?

 13   A.  About $48,000.

 14   Q.  48,000 or 4800?

 15   A.  48 -- I'm sorry.  4800.

 16   Q.  Okay.  And did they tell you they were keeping some of the

 17   money?

 18   A.  No.  I didn't bother to ask.  I was just too happy to, you

 19   know, receive my money; that I can afford my own plane ticket.

 20   Q.  Okay.  How much money did you have on April the 23rd in

 21   this hidden spot in your bed?

 22   A.  5,000.

 23   Q.  Anything else?

 24   A.  Nine gold coins and three silver coins that Terry had given

 25   me.



                                                                  785



  1   Q.  Did they give those back to you?

  2   A.  No.

  3   Q.  Have you received those to this day?

  4   A.  No.

  5   Q.  The next day, on April (sic) the 25th, did you have a

  6   meeting with the FBI agents?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  And did you take notes when you were meeting with those

  9   agents?

 10   A.  Yes.

 11   Q.  Do you recall who the agents were?

 12   A.  Nancy Houston.

 13   Q.  Was she the only one?

 14   A.  I forgot if Donna Sampson was -- I forget the date; but

 15   there was -- on that time, too, Donna Sampson made a question

 16   for me.  She showed me some pictures.

 17   Q.  Okay.  She showed you pictures?  And then what happened?

 18   A.  After that, I just made -- I just write the questions that

 19   she had.

 20   Q.  All right.  What did she say to that when she saw you were

 21   making notes?

 22   A.  She didn't saw it.  Nancy Houston saw that I was making

 23   notes.

 24   Q.  Okay.  So Donna Sampson did not see it, but Nancy Houston

 25   did.  What was said to you after it was observed that you were



                                                                  786



  1   taking notes with the agents?

  2   A.  Well, they did not say anything until Donna Sampson dropped

  3   me off in some hotel that I preferred to stay because it's

  4   cheaper.  She said that she doesn't want to ask me any question

  5   or she just don't want to be with me anymore, but she can help

  6   me in any way that she can.

  7   Q.  Ma'am, when you say a cheaper hotel, do you recall that

  8   after they gave you your money back, your $4800, you still

  9   haven't gotten the other $200, have you?

 10   A.  That's correct.

 11   Q.  After they gave you the money back, did they tell you that

 12   they were going to continue to pay for your hotel, or not?

 13   A.  They told me that they are not going to pay my bills

 14   anymore since I have my money back.

 15   Q.  All right.  At that time, did you have a plane reservation

 16   to return to the Philippines?

 17   A.  Yes.  But it's from San Francisco to Cebu -- I mean to

 18   Philippines, Manila.

 19   Q.  On what day?  Do you recall?

 20   A.  June 1.

 21   Q.  All right.

 22   A.  Or it might be May 29.

 23   Q.  Do you recall what day the Government told you they are not

 24   going to pay for your bills anymore?

 25   A.  I forgot.  The night -- I think after they drop the money



                                                                  787



  1   in the morning, Donna Sampson told me that they are not paying

  2   the bills anymore.

  3   Q.  So this would be May the 25th?

  4   A.  I guess.

  5   Q.  Did you then attempt to -- to find another hotel?

  6   A.  Yes.  I have to.  I don't want to spend all my money on

  7   hotel.

  8   Q.  All right.  Did you at that time talk to the FBI about

  9   going to the Philippines?

 10   A.  I forgot if we did talk about it, because I already have

 11   plane ticket reservation.

 12   Q.  When was it that you understood you could then leave the

 13   FBI?

 14   A.  When they gave me my money.  After we talked in the

 15   morning -- me and Donna Sampson -- that I have to pay my own

 16   bills now.

 17            I said well, I think I'm free to go.

 18   Q.  What did she say to that?

 19   A.  I don't think I told her that.  I was just thinking myself

 20   I think I'm free to go.

 21   Q.  Did you feel that you were free to go any of the

 22   30-some-odd days prior to that of May the 25th?

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  Did you choose to be moved to each of those eight different

 25   cities during that 37-day period?



                                                                  788



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  All right.  What day did you actually leave Oklahoma City,

  3   Mrs. Nichols?

  4   A.  That would be May 25 or 26.  I took the bus to Fremont,

  5   California.

  6   Q.  Okay.  And at Fremont, California, did you meet a friend of

  7   yours?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  And who was that?

 10   A.  Raymond Boyd.

 11   Q.  All right.  Did he take you to the San Francisco airport

 12   for your June 1 flight?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  Now, during the period of time that you were with the FBI,

 15   did they take your fingerprints?

 16   A.  Yes.  And Nicole's fingerprints, too.

 17   Q.  Took Nicole's fingerprints?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  Did they take hairs from your head?

 20   A.  Yes.  Sheila said that I need to take hair from your --

 21   from you; and I said okay, I'll take it for you.

 22   Q.  Okay.  Did they give you a grand jury subpoena for that?

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  Did they give you a search warrant for the hairs from your

 25   head?



                                                                  789



  1   A.  I don't remember.  I don't think so.

  2   Q.  Do you recall receiving a card from the agents while you

  3   were in their custody, a Mother's Day card?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  If you would look at W9.

  6   A.  Okay.

  7   Q.  Is that a copy of the Mother's Day card?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we'd

 10   offer into evidence W9, the Mother's Day card sent to

 11   Mrs. Nichols.

 12            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.

 13            THE COURT:  W9 received.

 14   BY MR. WOODS:

 15   Q.  Ms. Nichols, if you would, read that short card into the

 16   record.

 17   A.  "We all hope the best for you.  Please don't believe that

 18   the government workers are the bad guys, no matter what anyone

 19   tells you.  We are here to help you.  We have all fallen in

 20   love with Nicole.  We all wish the best for you and your new

 21   baby.  Don't let all this latest news affect you.  We are all

 22   here for you.  If you ever are lonely, if you ever want to

 23   talk, if you ever want to cry, just call us at (816)691-8200.

 24   We'll be here for you.  If you want to call collect, we

 25   definitely want to hear from you when the new baby is born.



                                                                  790



  1   You are very special to us.  You are a young girl caught up in

  2   something you don't deserve to be in.  We're on your side."

  3   Don't think -- "Think only about yourself and your kids.

  4   Becky."

  5   Q.  Who else signed the card?

  6   A.  Amy, Joan, Sheila, Lori.

  7   Q.  Do you know those names?

  8   A.  Yeah.  I met them all.

  9   Q.  Were these all female FBI agents?

 10   A.  Yes.  In Kansas City, Missouri.

 11   Q.  What did you take the meaning to be the first sentence of

 12   "don't believe everything you're -- "you're hearing"; that

 13   we're the good guys and we're here to help you?

 14   A.  Well, I think that -- I believe what they said, mainly.

 15   Q.  That we're from the Government and we're here to help you?

 16   A.  Uh-huh.

 17   Q.  Did you likewise send cards to them after you left?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  Did you also send cards to the Filipino officials in San

 20   Francisco that helped you catch a flight?

 21   A.  Yes.  Except to Mr. Jose Calimlin, because I couldn't find

 22   a card that fits to him.

 23   Q.  Why do you send cards to people like that, Marife --

 24   Mrs. Nichols?

 25   A.  I'm the kind of person, if you do something for me or you



                                                                  791



  1   buy something for me, I always want to say thanks and couldn't

  2   get enough by saying mainly thanks to you, I want to send a

  3   card.

  4   Q.  All right.  Did you call Gene Thomeczek just as you were

  5   leaving, the day or so that you were leaving Oklahoma City?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  Were you -- what was the purpose of that call?

  8   A.  I was mainly upset.

  9            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, W41

 10   is a transcript of this 20-second call that we would offer into

 11   evidence; and we also have the tape present that we would play.

 12   It takes about 20 seconds to play.  We feel it goes to her

 13   state of mind as to her captivity -- not captivity but being in

 14   custody and her consents and the way she was treated by the

 15   Government.

 16            THE COURT:  This is called to a telephone recorder?

 17   Is that --

 18            THE WITNESS:  Voice mail.

 19            MR. WOODS:  It's to the voice mail of Agent Thomeczek,

 20   who was her father figure with the FBI.  It only takes about 20

 21   seconds, your Honor.

 22            MR. MACKEY:  It's less the time than it is the lack of

 23   relevance.  Judge, it's now May 26.  We're talking about

 24   events -- the last search warrant, again, was early in the

 25   month.



                                                                  792



  1            THE COURT:  That objection is overruled.

  2            MR. WOODS:  There were no search warrants.  They were

  3   all consents.

  4            THE COURT:  So you're offering W41 as the transcript,

  5   and you wish to play the actual tape?

  6            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  Yes, your Honor.

  7            THE COURT:  All right.  W41 is received, and you can

  8   play the tape.

  9       (The following is the reporter's transcription of the

 10   playing of Exhibit W41:)

 11            "End of mailbox.  Start of mailbox.  Message 1.  From

 12   an external number.  Received May 26 at 8:14 p.m.  Yes, Gene.

 13   This is Marife Nichols.  I'm still in Oklahoma City and

 14   everything is going bad.  Thanks a lot for putting me --

 15   leaving me here.  I just feel like, you know, this is a great

 16   time, really.  And you really are a nice guy, but I can't

 17   believe these people are doing this to me.  Thanks anyway."

 18            MR. WOODS:  May I have one moment, your Honor?

 19            THE COURT:  Yes.

 20            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.  That's all we

 21   have.  We pass the witness.

 22            THE COURT:  Mr. Mackey.

 23                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

 24   BY MR. MACKEY:

 14   of that, you would be responsible for your own bills; correct?

 20   A.  June 11, 1971.

 21   Q.  Ms. Nichols --

 23   Q.  Well, that's a mistake you've made on more than one

 24   occasion, hasn't it been?

 25   A.  I might.  I don't know.



                                                                  794



  1   Q.  Have you on more than one occasion given a date of birth of

  2   1971?

  5   of birth, have you?

  6   A.  Well, the -- my date of birth of -- on my alien card or --

  7   yeah.  Alien card is 1971.

  8   Q.  That's not true?

  9   A.  I was actually born in 1973.  We have to change my date of

 10   birth because I'm only 17 when I get married with Terry.

 11   Q.  On more than one occasion, the Government officials and

 12   Government forms, both to this country and other countries,

 13   your own, you have lied about your date of birth, have you not?

 24   Q.  Graduated from high school?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  795

  7   Q.  After you graduated from high school, did you get some

  8   college?

 10   Q.  At any point in time since your marriage to Mr. Nichols,

 11   have you sought or obtained college courses?

 12   A.  Yes.  In 1994.  I have one semester.

 13   Q.  Was that at Southwestern University?

 15   Q.  Take a look, please, Mrs. Nichols, in the white binder to

 16   your left, at Government Exhibit 70.

 19   Exhibit Number 70.

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  And you see that in the semester of 1994, '95, with regard

 22   to Southwestern University, a record of your attendance there?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  Is that an accurate record?

 25   A.  I have to read it first.  Excuse me.

  1   Q.  Take your time.  Thank you.

  3   Q.  Have you had an adequate opportunity to review it?  Did you

  4   get a chance to read it thoroughly?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Is it an accurate record of the college courses you took in

  7   the semester of '94, '94?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, we would move to admit

 10   Government Exhibit 70.

 11            MR. WOODS:  May it please the Court, we have no

 12   objection to the school records.  We certainly object to this

 13   National Bureau of Investigation alleged summary to the FBI of

 14   what they know.  It covers --

 15            THE COURT:  There's a letter attached to a transcript

 16   or something.

 17            MR. WOODS:  It's full of unverifiable information.  We

 18   would object to the cover sheet.

 19            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, we would withdraw the cover

 20   sheet on Exhibit 70.

 21            THE COURT:  And then re-mark the next page?

 22            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, your Honor.

 23            THE COURT:  All right.  With that understanding, 70 is

 24   received.

 25            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, your Honor.



                                                                  797



  1   BY MR. MACKEY:

  2   Q.  That was college work you took, Mrs. Nichols, in the

  3   Philippines; correct?

  1   Q.  Was there a reason you did not attend college in the United

  2   States?

  3   A.  I feel that I would lost my way around here.

  4   Q.  Did Mr. Nichols in the course of your marriage discourage

  5   you from attending college?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  Did he --

  8   A.  No.  Excuse me.  Not discourage.  He encouraged me to go to

  9   college.  I'm sorry.

 10   Q.  Did he ever tell you that it was too expensive for you to

 11   attend school?

 12            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we're

 13   starting to get --

 14            THE COURT:  We're getting into an area of privilege.

 15            MR. WOODS:  Yes, and I object to that.  Certainly not

 16   relevant, also.

 17            THE COURT:  Well, I'll sustain the privilege

 18   objection.

  5   A.  Excuse me?

  7   A.  I don't understand the word "extensively."

 24   A.  We stopped -- we stopped at somebody's driveway because

 25   Terry assumed that there was two black cars behind us and



                                                                  802



  1   following us.

  2   Q.  Do you remember leaving your residence with your husband

  3   and child and driving south on Highway 56, pulling over in the

  4   Surplus City parking lot?

  5   A.  I have no idea where we were at in that time.

  6   Q.  Do you remember turning around and going back to the police

  7   station?

  8   A.  Yeah.  We might have turned around, yes.

  9   Q.  At any point in that drive after leaving your home before

 10   arriving at the police station, did you see anyone that you

 11   suspected might be a police officer?

 12   A.  After we drove, we stop at that park -- driveway -- excuse

 13   me -- I seen two black vehicles.  I don't know if it is a

 14   police station -- I mean.  Gosh, I don't even know if it is a

 15   police officer.

 16   Q.  Ms. Nichols, at any point before you and your husband

 17   arrived at the police station, did he give you anything?

 18   A.  No.

 19   Q.  Do you recall Mr. Nichols handing you any money at any

 20   point in time during that drive?

 21   A.  He hand me the money in the house, as far as I can

 22   remember.

 23   Q.  Was that $200?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  Was that immediately before the two of you left your



                                                                  803



  1   residence?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  And would you tell the judge the last time that Terry

  4   Nichols had handed you $200 on one occasion?

  5   A.  It might be in the truck.  I forget.

  6   Q.  But it certainly occurred either in the house or on the

  7   drive right before the two of you went to the police station?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  Did he give you anything else other than money at that

 10   time?

 11   A.  No.

 12   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, did you understand why you were going where

 13   you went that afternoon?

 14   A.  That we were going to see what's going on because Terry

 15   heard in the news that he's --

 16            THE COURT:  Be careful in your answer that you do not

 17   include anything that your husband said to you.

 18            THE WITNESS:  Okay, your Honor.

 19   BY MR. MACKEY:

 20   Q.  Let me ask it this way, Mrs. Nichols:  Before the two of

 21   you left, did you have the TV set on?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  And were you watching broadcasts about the news of the

 24   bombing in Oklahoma City?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  804



  1   Q.  And from that source, had you learned that Tim McVeigh was

  2   a suspect in that case?

  3   A.  I learned that he was -- he has been into prison for

  4   traffic, something like that.

  5   Q.  Before you got to the police station, Mrs. Nichols, had you

  6   heard your husband's name on the radio or TV?

  7   A.  No.

  8   Q.  The only name you had heard that you recognized was Tim

  9   McVeigh?

 10   A.  Tim McVeigh.  That's correct.

 11   Q.  Mr. McVeigh being someone you knew and had known for

 12   several years?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  Totally via your association -- rather your husband's

 15   association with him?

 16   A.  Excuse me?

 17   Q.  It was your husband's friend?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  When you and Mr. Nichols walked into the police station,

 20   did you meet some local officers?

 21   A.  Yes.  Inside the police station.

 22   Q.  And were you in very long before FBI agents came in and

 23   introduced themselves?

 24   A.  Not very long.  I feel it was like 10, 20 minutes.

 25   Q.  Before they arrived, Mrs. Nichols, do you recall the local



                                                                  805



  1   police chief asking for Mr. Nichols to show that he had no

  2   weapon on him?

  3   A.  Excuse me?  The policeman asked Terry?

  4   Q.  Yes.

  5   A.  No.  Terry is the one who asked them.

  6   Q.  Do you remember your husband taking his jacket off?

  7   A.  I think he just put it like that.

  8   Q.  Do you remember whether the jacket was taken off and left

  9   in that room?

 10   A.  Yes.

 11   Q.  And what is its color?

 12   A.  Green.

 13   Q.  Was it a jacket your husband had worn on many days prior to

 14   April 21?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  To your knowledge, were the keys to your pickup truck in

 17   that jacket?

 18            MS. CAIN:  Your Honor, I don't know if I have standing

 19   to object.  I'd object to asking questions that are not

 20   relevant to her consents and the issue of her consents but are

 21   really geared towards testimony against her husband, which is

 22   still a subject matter of her privilege in this case.

 23            THE COURT:  Well, it is; but this, I don't see, as

 24   coming within that privilege.

 25            MS. CAIN:  Okay.  Well, when questions about his



                                                                  806



  1   behavior prior to --

  2            THE COURT:  Well, we're not asking about his behavior

  3   now.  This is in the police station.

  4            MS. CAIN:  Okay.  But I believe, your Honor, the

  5   question was about the --

  6            THE COURT:  Had he worn this jacket before.  I don't

  7   see that's a communications privilege question.

  8            Did you answer the question?

  9            THE WITNESS:  I forgot the question.

 10            THE COURT:  Whether the same jacket or coat that he

 11   took off in the police station, he'd worn often before.

 12            THE WITNESS:  Yes.  He wore that.

 13            THE COURT:  Thank you.

 14   BY MR. MACKEY:

 15   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, at some point in time, you began to have a

 16   conversation with the man first introduced to you by the name

 17   of Gene Thomeczek; correct?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  And he's the same individual you have made reference to in

 20   your testimony this morning, and this afternoon?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  In fact, over the time from April 21 until the end of May,

 23   he and Sheila Dobson were the two representatives of the FBI

 24   with whom you spent the most time?

 25   A.  That's correct.



                                                                  807



  1   Q.  And was it Mr. Thomeczek who explained to you a consent to

  2   search form on that afternoon in the jail?

  3   A.  I told -- they just let me read it and see if I understand

  4   everything out of it.

  5   Q.  Did you read it?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  And did you understand it?

  8   A.  I asked questions of Ms. Sheila Dobson about the phrase

  9   that I can refuse to consent.  And she said that yes, you can

 10   refuse to consent.  And I ask what about if I don't sign.  And

 11   Mr. Thomeczek told me that we're just going to get the paper in

 12   the court so that we can come in your house and search.

 13   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, look in the black binder now, Defendant's

 14   Exhibit W14A.

 15   A.  8?

 16   Q.  A, as in Adam.

 17            MR. NIGH:  Your Honor, our first volume of

 18   Mr. Nichols' exhibits do not have exhibit numbers on it.  If

 19   the Bates number could be given, it would help us locate it

 20   quickly.

 21            MR. MACKEY:  Mr. Nigh, it's also Government Exhibit

 22   49, if that's easier for you to find.

 23            MR. NIGH:  That is easier.

 24            Thank you, your Honor.

 25            THE WITNESS:  W8?



                                                                  808



  1   BY MR. MACKEY:

  2   Q.  W14.  14A.

  3   A.  Okay.

  4   Q.  Did you read that document before you signed it?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  And did you read the language that says, "I," with your

  7   name filled in, "having been informed of my constitutional

  8   right not to have a search made of the premises herein

  9   mentioned without a search warrant and of my right to refuse to

 10   consent to such a search hereby authorize, "and the names

 11   appear, the agents, "to conduct a complete search of my

 12   premises"?  Did you read that on April 21, 1995?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  Did you have any misunderstanding about that language?

 15   A.  Actually, I don't understand all this stuff, why they can

 16   search the house.

 17   Q.  Did Mr. Thomeczek explain to you that they were gathering

 18   information about the Oklahoma City bombing case?

 19   A.  Yes.  They were gathering information, but I don't

 20   understand why they have to search my house.

 21   Q.  Did you tell Mr. Thomeczek?

 22   A.  No.

 23   Q.  Did Mr. Thomeczek explain to you at the time that a

 24   decision as to whether a search warrant would be issued was not

 25   his but belonged to a federal judge?



                                                                  809



  1   A.  To my understanding, yeah.

  2   Q.  He explained that to you at that time?

  3   A.  He said that we're just going to get a search warrant in

  4   the court.

  5   Q.  Did he tell you that a judge would have to approve that

  6   search warrant?

  7   A.  No.

  8   Q.  Mrs. --

  9   A.  I don't understand.

 10   Q.  All right.  Okay.  Mrs. Nichols, did you ask Ms. Dobson any

 11   questions about this same form?

 12   A.  Yes.  I -- I asked her what about if I refuse to sign these

 13   papers, and she did not answer.  Mr. Thomeczek answered me.

 14   Q.  Did you feel like you had understood the full content of

 15   the form at the time you put your signature on it?

 16   A.  No.

 17   Q.  Why did you sign it?

 18   A.  I just want to cooperate with them.

 19   Q.  Why did you want to cooperate?

 20   A.  So that everything will be over soon.

 21   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, at any point in the afternoon on that same

 22   afternoon, did you see your husband?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  Prior to the time that you went downstairs to see him, had

 25   you been refused permission to see him?



                                                                  810



  1   A.  Excuse me?

  2   Q.  Had you been refused permission to see him?

  3   A.  No.

  4   Q.  When you asked to do so --

  5   A.  When I asked --

  6   Q.  -- you were afforded that opportunity; correct?

  7   A.  Yes.  That was prior to our leaving the police station.

  8   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, do you remember approximately what time you

  9   signed the two consent forms, W14A and 14B?

 10   A.  I have no idea what time was that, because I didn't have a

 11   watch on.  I haven't seen any time or -- there's no window in

 12   that room, so I don't know what time.

 13   Q.  Do you not recall that you signed the forms before

 14   Ms. Dobson left to obtain the diapers?

 15   A.  I don't know.  I think I signed the form when Ms. Dobson

 16   was still there.

 17   Q.  She was present.  Her signature is here; correct?  On the

 18   form?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  And after the forms were signed, she then left to go

 21   retrieve diapers at the store?

 22   A.  I forgot.

 23   Q.  Correct?

 24   A.  She may have.  Yes.

 25   Q.  Now, you were not being questioned the entire time that you



                                                                  811



  1   were at the Herington Police Department that afternoon, were

  2   you?

  3   A.  I think I have been questioned entire time.  They stopped

  4   so they have to get information from Terry.

  5   Q.  Were there not large blocks of time, Mrs. Nichols, where

  6   there was no questioning going on; you simply sat there and

  7   waited?

  8   A.  Yeah.  And I was talking to Mr. Tom White.

  9   Q.  At some point in time, it was time to leave; correct?

 10   A.  Yes.

 11   Q.  And before you left, someone had to retrieve the baby seat

 12   from the pickup truck; correct?

 13   A.  That's -- I don't remember that we have the baby seat.

 14   Q.  Do you not recall Nicole being harnessed in the baby seat

 15   on the drive from Herington to Abilene that evening?

 16   A.  I don't remember.

 17   Q.  You went to a motel in Abilene that night, Friday night;

 18   correct?

 19   A.  That's correct.

 20   Q.  And you understood that the reason you could not go back to

 21   your home that evening was that there would be a search going

 22   on at some point in time at that residence?

 23   A.  Yes.  And they did ask me if I wanted to come in in there

 24   because they need to have a bomb squad to come in in there.

 25   Q.  And they explained all that to you?



                                                                  812



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  So you understood why Friday night, it was simply

  3   impossible for you to go back into your home?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  Now, when you arrived at the motel in Abilene, did you have

  6   the phone credit card that you had gotten from your husband

  7   earlier?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  And did you make any phone calls that night before you went

 10   to bed?

 11   A.  Yes.  I did try to make phone calls that night, but they

 12   wouldn't give me my address book which is left in the pickup.

 13   So it was just mainly talking to Information if they can get me

 14   the telephone number.

 15   Q.  But you did begin to make phone calls to family members or

 16   attempt to do so?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  That same night?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  Shortly thereafter, you were able to get a copy of your

 21   phone book back -- did you not -- from Ms. Dobson?

 22   A.  I -- I don't understand.

 23   Q.  Your address book with telephone numbers, did you not get a

 24   copy of that shortly thereafter from Ms. Dobson?

 25   A.  After I have to ask where is their boss, because



                                                                  813



  1   Mr. Thomeczek would not give it to me because he said he's not

  2   allowed to give it to me.  And I even said, Well, you violate

  3   my rights by not letting me have this address book.  But they

  4   said, Well, we have to do some investigation out of this.  And

  5   so I asked, Well, can I talk to your boss?

  6   Q.  And you did?

  7   A.  And he did, and he just want to give me the numbers that I

  8   wanted.

  9   Q.  On more than one occasion in this 30-plus-day period,

 10   Mrs. Nichols, you were not reluctant to insist on talking to

 11   higher ranking officials -- were you not?

 12   A.  I -- reluctant means -- I don't know.

 13   Q.  Did you not insist on talking to James' boss and Sheila's

 14   boss about the money, about the credit cards, about other

 15   matters?

 16   A.  I did insist on that.

 17   Q.  Yes.  On Saturday, the next day, Mrs. Nichols, you were

 18   still at the hotel in Abilene?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  And did you hear that the search was going to take most of

 21   the day?  Did you understand that it would occupy most of the

 22   day?

 23   A.  Yes.  That's what they explained to me.

 24   Q.  And that was the reason then why you had to stay a second

 25   night then in Abilene; correct?



                                                                  814



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  Now, on the next day, on Sunday, April 23, you and

  3   Mr. Thomeczek and Sheila Dobson then drove back down to

  4   Herington; correct?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  And you went first to the Herington Police Department, did

  7   you not?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  And there you met Agent Jablonski, who turned over some

 10   personal items that your husband --

 11   A.  From Terry.

 12   Q.  Do you remember that?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  And you remember signing a receipt showing your receipt of

 15   those items?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  That form is dated approximately 1:15 p.m.; does that

 18   comport with your own memory?

 19   A.  I don't remember what time.

 20   Q.  Do you remember signing a consent with Agent Jablonski

 21   present shortly after getting the materials back?

 22   A.  Right -- yes.

 23   Q.  There in the Herington Police Department?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  Do you remember Agent Jablonski handing his ice cream cone



                                                                  815



  1   to Nicole --

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  -- while you studied the form?  Do you remember on this

  4   second occasion then on Sunday, Mr. Thomeczek going over in

  5   detailed fashion the wording in the consent form that he was

  6   showing you on that day?

  7   A.  I don't remember.

  8   Q.  Look at E1 in the black book, please.  E1.  Government

  9   Exhibit 52.

 10   A.  Okay.

 11   Q.  And is that the form that Agent Jablonski and Agent

 12   Thomeczek showed you in the Herington Police Department Sunday

 13   afternoon?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And did you read that form either out loud or to yourself

 16   before you signed it?

 17   A.  I read it -- yes.

 18   Q.  At that point in time, Mrs. Nichols, no one had taken your

 19   money and kept it from you, had they?

 20   A.  Yes.  They haven't seen my money yet that time.

 21   Q.  So before you signed that form, the FBI did not have

 22   possession of the $5,000 cash and nine coins secreted in your

 23   boxsprings; correct?

 24   A.  On that time, I don't know because they didn't show me any

 25   papers.



                                                                  816



  1   Q.  When you signed this receipt -- excuse me -- consent form,

  2   Mrs. Nichols, you added the terminology "without prejudice."

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  Do you see that?  You had not used that terminology, those

  5   words, on the two consent forms signed on Friday, had you?

  6   A.  That's correct.

  7   Q.  What took place between Friday and Sunday that led you to

  8   add these new words to this consent form?

  9   A.  That's the time I realized and I remembered maybe I can

 10   sign this stuff with UCC 1-207.

 11   Q.  So this was your independent thought that came to you on

 12   Sunday afternoon, April 23?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  And you understood its meaning after having researched it

 15   in Black's Law Dictionary?

 16   A.  Yes.  Back before in Michigan.

 17   Q.  Had you signed a number of documents prior to April of 1995

 18   with that same notation, with those same words?

 19   A.  I don't understand.  Have I signed --

 20   Q.  Excuse me.  On any other document prior to this consent

 21   form, had you ever used the words "without prejudice"?

 22   A.  Prior to this?

 23   Q.  Yes.

 24   A.  I don't think so.

 25   Q.  This is the first and only occasion beginning on April 23



                                                                  817



  1   that you --

  2   A.  As far as I can remember right now, yeah.

  3   Q.  You did not sign it on your driver's license because you

  4   don't have one; is that right?

  5   A.  That's correct.

  6   Q.  Do you remember, Mrs. Nichols, when you added the words

  7   "without prejudice" that Agent Thomeczek asked you about those?

  8   A.  Yes.  And I have no idea what I answered to her.

  9   Q.  Did you give him the same explanation that you've given the

 10   Court about --

 11   A.  No.

 12   Q.   -- your understanding of those terms?

 13   A.  I don't remember.

 14   Q.  Did you tell him that you'd looked them up in the Black's

 15   Law Dictionary?

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  And that you discussed the matter with your husband?

 18   A.  I think Sheila Dobson asked me if Terry is the one who told

 19   you this.  I'm not sure.

 20   Q.  You remember Agent Thomeczek asking you, Well, does this

 21   mean whether you consent or not?

 22   A.  I don't remember.

 23   Q.  Do you remember telling him I'm adding the words but I

 24   still intend to consent?

 25   A.  I might have say that.



                                                                  818



  1   Q.  Now, you and a number of agents then left the Herington

  2   Police Department and drove the short distance over to your

  3   residence on Sunday afternoon, did you not?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  That was after the time you had gotten your property back

  6   from Agent Jablonski, after the time you'd signed this consent

  7   form; correct?

  8   A.  What property?

  9   Q.  The property of your husband.

 10   A.  Okay.

 11   Q.  How did you get into the house, Mrs. Nichols?

 12   A.  Somebody has a key.  I forgot who did.

 13   Q.  Did you go in the front door?

 14   A.  Yes.  In the front door.

 15   Q.  And describe to the Court what you did.

 16   A.  Well, we went -- mainly come in in there, I was looking

 17   inside the house.  I know -- I remember Mr. Thomeczek told me

 18   that the house may be in bad shape because they have to take

 19   fingerprints from the walls and any furniture, which I've seen

 20   is always mess around in our house anyway so I think it was

 21   okay.  But the clothes are all off the -- the closet in the

 22   second bedroom.  But then I only have 30, 45 minutes to pack up

 23   my things so I just hurry up and Mr. Thomeczek helped me, too.

 24   Q.  Did you feel like you had enough time to pick up the

 25   belongings you wanted?



                                                                  819



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  How large a bag did you give, Mrs. Nichols, to put your

  3   belongings in?

  4   A.  Pardon.

  5   Q.  How large a bag did you get to put your belongings in?

  6   A.  I -- might be five feet -- no.  Four feet tall.

  7   Q.  And did you fill it before you left?

  8   A.  Yes.  But it's not real arranged because we're in a hurry.

  9   Q.  I understand.  Did you go to each of the rooms in your

 10   residence on Sunday afternoon?

 11   A.  Each room?

 12   Q.  Yes, ma'am.  Each room.

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  It would be the living room and the --

 15   A.  Living room.  The dining room -- the living room is the

 16   same as dining room.  The kitchen.  Our bedroom, me and

 17   Terry's, Josh's bedroom, the bathroom.  I went downstairs in

 18   the basement, the storage room, and I went to the other

 19   basement, too, under the kitchen.

 20   Q.  And at some point while you were on the property, did you

 21   and Sheila Dobson walk out to the garage?

 22   A.  I forgot.

 23   Q.  Do you remember you and Sheila Dobson walking to the garage

 24   and standing there briefly at the doorway?

 25   A.  We might have.  But I forgot.



                                                                  820



  1   Q.  Do you remember as you stood there seeing other agents in

  2   the garage?

  3   A.  I don't remember.

  4   Q.  During this brief period of time in your home, there were

  5   at least a couple phone calls that you engaged in; correct?

  6   A.  Excuse me?

  7   Q.  Were you on the phone while you were in your house on

  8   Sunday April 23?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  On at least two occasions?

 11   A.  There was a phone call or I made a phone calls?

 12   Q.  Were you on the phone in two different conversations?

 13   A.  I forgot.

 14   Q.  Do you remember having one phone call where you spoke in a

 15   Filipino dialect?

 16   A.  Yes.  My sister or my mother.

 17   Q.  And do you remember speaking in English in a second phone

 18   call?

 19   A.  Yes.  With -- with Lori Lastema and Mr. Richard Gibson.

 20   Q.  So there were two phone calls that you took while you were

 21   in your own home on Sunday afternoon?

 22   A.  That's correct.

 23   Q.  Tell us about the first phone call with your mother.

 24   A.  Well, my mother just wanted to know if I'm okay.  And

 25   what's going on.



                                                                  821



  1   Q.  And what did you tell her?

  2   A.  That I have been -- Terry turned himself in in Herington,

  3   Kansas, police station and that I had been separated by Terry.

  4   And I forgot most of the conversation.

  5   Q.  Did you tell your mother that you were okay and that the

  6   FBI was treating you well?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  In the second phone call on that same day, Mrs. Nichols,

  9   with whom did you speak?

 10   A.  The second phone calls?  My aunt, Lori Lastema.

 11   Q.  Who called who?

 12   A.  I forgot if I called her or she contact me there.

 13   Q.  But you were able to speak to her?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  And tell the Court what that conversation was.

 16   A.  Well, she asked me if I'm okay and I said no, I'm shaken.

 17   I'm scared of this agent because I never been through this

 18   situation before and that I wanted to be with her.  But she had

 19   to ask her boss about that because she doesn't live in her own

 20   house.  She's only a housekeeper.  So I talked to Mr. Richard

 21   Gibson and he was just mainly asking me if I know Terry's

 22   innocent of this case and I said I think he's innocent.

 23   Q.  And this is all in the conversation on Sunday afternoon in

 24   your home?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  822



  1   Q.  You spoke to your mother and to your aunt; is that right?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  And did your aunt offer for you to come stay in California

  4   with her?

  5   A.  I don't think so.  She wanted to know what's the situation.

  6   She have to ask her boss about it.

  7   Q.  Did you ask your aunt --

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  -- can I come stay with you?

 10   A.  Yes, I did.

 11   Q.  And she said?

 12   A.  She need to ask her boss about that.

 13   Q.  Had you talked to any other of your family members before

 14   those phone calls?

 15   A.  I think I talked to my mother.

 16   Q.  On an occasion before Sunday afternoon?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  So at least twice before Sunday, you had been in touch with

 19   your parents?

 20   A.  Yes.  Either my parents or my brother and sister.  I did

 21   call the Philippines.

 22   Q.  Incidentally, Mrs. Nichols, while you were in the phone

 23   call with your mother speaking in the Filipino dialect, did any

 24   agent object to that?

 25   A.  No.



                                                                  823



  1   Q.  Did they say if you're going to speak in our presence, you

  2   must speak in English?

  3   A.  No.

  4            THE COURT:  Is this an interrupting point?

  5            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, your Honor.

  6            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll take the recess at this

  7   time.  20 minutes.

  8       (Recess at 3:24 p.m.)

  9       (Reconvened at 3:44 p.m.)

 10            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.

 11            Continue, Mr. Mackey.

 12            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, your Honor.

 13   BY MR. MACKEY:

 14   Q.  Ms. Nichols, let me go back to Saturday, the first full day

 15   you stayed at the motel in Abilene.

 16   A.  Yes.

 17   Q.  That would be Saturday, April 22.

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  All right.  And one of the things you did in the course of

 20   that day was to go shopping for clothing; correct?

 21   A.  That's correct.

 22   Q.  With Ms. Dobson; correct?

 23   A.  Ms. Dobson and other girl used to work with Tom White.

 24   Q.  Who might be Dawn Grey; correct?

 25   A.  Might be.



                                                                  824



  1   Q.  Okay.

  2   A.  I forget.

  3   Q.  All right.  Isn't it true, Mrs. Nichols, that it was the

  4   FBI that purchased the clothing and other items on Saturday,

  5   April 22?

  6   A.  That purchase?  I don't understand the word "purchase."

  7   Q.  Who paid for the clothes?

  8   A.  I did.

  9   Q.  And how much did you spend?

 10   A.  I forget how much I spent.

 11   Q.  And how much money of the original 200 did you have then at

 12   the end of Saturday, April 22?

 13   A.  I don't remember.

 14   Q.  Let me return your testimony, Mrs. Nichols, to Sunday, the

 15   next day.  You've driven down to Herington, signed the forms,

 16   and then gone into your home.  Do you recall those events?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  Now, in addition to Gene and Sheila -- Dobson and Gene

 19   Thomeczek, do you not also recall Chief Kuhn from the Herington

 20   Police Department being inside your residence?

 21   A.  Yeah.  He was there.

 22   Q.  And you remember, do you not, why he was there?

 23   A.  No.

 24   Q.  Do you recall that there was concern on your part and

 25   others that the media would show up at your house and try to



                                                                  825



  1   get pictures of you?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  And that in fact happened, did it not, on that day?

  4   A.  Yes.

  5   Q.  And the time that it took for you to drive to the police

  6   station, go to your home, gather up your belongings, a large

  7   crowd of media had gathered outside your home; correct?

  8   A.  That's correct.

  9   Q.  You were concerned, were you not, Mrs. Nichols, about

 10   having your picture public?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  You had a young daughter you had to think about, you had

 13   your own safety to think about --

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  -- correct?  And in fact, when you left your residence on

 16   that afternoon, you covered your face in some manner to avoid

 17   being depicted or caught on the cameras?

 18   A.  Mr. Thomeczek and the policeman suggested that I should

 19   cover my face and Nicole's.

 20   Q.  Ms. Nichols, did you not have a great amount of fear that

 21   someone, someone you didn't even know, might attempt to

 22   retaliate against you or your family because of your husband's

 23   connection to that case?

 24   A.  That's correct.

 25   Q.  You had that fear on the same day that you walked into the



                                                                  826



  1   police station on April 21; correct?

  2   A.  No, I didn't have that fear.  The first day?  Not until the

  3   FBI explain it to me.

  4   Q.  What they told you was true, was it not?

  5   A.  That I'm -- I might be in danger for the victims?

  6   Q.  That was your concern as well; correct?

  7   A.  Yes, it was my concern after they explain it to me.

  8   Q.  And Chief Kuhn had told you, I have a little police

  9   department in a little town and I can't promise I can protect

 10   you.  Did he not tell you that?

 11   A.  He can't promise?

 12   Q.  Right.

 13   A.  I don't remember, but he may have say that.

 14   Q.  Do you remember the police chief telling you, Mrs. Nichols,

 15   I wouldn't come back to this house for a while?  Do you

 16   remember him telling you that that Sunday afternoon?

 17   A.  For at least two weeks, until things will settle down.

 18   Q.  As you think about especially what happened to you when you

 19   walked out the door, that was pretty good advice, wasn't it?

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  And you thought so at the time; correct?

 22   A.  That's correct.

 23   Q.  So as a practical matter, going home to Herington was

 24   simply out of the question, was it not?

 25   A.  I don't understand.  What's a practical matter?



                                                                  827



  1   Q.  Well, you followed Chief Kuhn's advice and never came back

  2   to live in Herington, Kansas; correct?

  3   A.  Never?  I don't understand.  Excuse me.

  4   Q.  Did you ever move back in to live at 109 South 2nd Street

  5   in Herington?

  6   A.  No, because they don't allow me.  The FBI don't.

  7   Q.  They didn't put you on the street, did they, Mrs. Nichols?

  8   They provided you a motel room on each and every night between

  9   April 21 and the end of May; correct?

 10   A.  Yes, they have to because they took my money.

 11   Q.  Would you agree it was not in your best interests at least

 12   in the first several days for you not (sic) to be in Herington?

 13   A.  Excuse me?

 14   Q.  Would you agree that it was not -- excuse me.  Wouldn't you

 15   agree that it was in your best interests --

 16   A.  Not to be in Herington the first day?

 17   Q.  Right.

 18   A.  Yes, that's correct.

 19   Q.  And the people who came to your aid, Mrs. Nichols, was the

 20   FBI?

 21   A.  That's correct.

 22   Q.  It was not your family members; correct?

 23   A.  That's correct.  My family members are too far from me.

 24   Q.  Well, how about the family members of Terry Nichols?

 25   A.  They're in Michigan.



                                                                  828



  1   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, about 14 days before the bombing, you had

  2   driven, had you not, with your husband from Kansas to Michigan?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  It's not an impossible drive, is it?

  5   A.  No, it is not.

  6   Q.  And did any Nichols family member get in their car and

  7   drive to Herington and pick you up and bring you into the

  8   sanctuary of their home in Michigan?

  9   A.  I understand in that time because James was held, also; and

 10   they were busy with James.

 11   Q.  There was a crisis in the Nichols family; correct?

 12   A.  Yes.

 13   Q.  And in that crisis, they left you in the hands of the FBI?

 14   A.  That's correct; but they tried to call me most of the time.

 15   Q.  One of those phone calls was with Terry's father,

 16   Mr. Nichols, Robert Nichols?

 17   A.  Yes, and they have to record it.

 18   Q.  Pardon me?

 19   A.  Yes, one of the phone calls is Robert Nichols, and the FBI

 20   had to record it.

 21   Q.  And the recording tells us exactly what you said and what

 22   he said; correct?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  And he wanted to know whether you were okay?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  829



  1   Q.  And you told him the FBI is treating me fine?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  And that was good enough for him; correct?

  4   A.  I guess so.

  5   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, when you walked into your home on Sunday

  6   afternoon, April 23, you had in your mind, did you not, the

  7   money that was stashed in your bed?

  8   A.  When we walk out the first day?

  9   Q.  When you walked into the house with Gene Thomeczek and

 10   Sheila Dobson on Sunday afternoon --

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  -- you were already thinking about the cash in the bed,

 13   were you not?

 14   A.  I was thinking about it.

 15   Q.  It occurred to you, did it not, Mrs. Nichols, that at some

 16   point perhaps you could sneak the cash out without the agents

 17   noticing?

 18   A.  I could, if Sheila is not with me all the time.

 19   Q.  You were afraid that if you tried to do that and got

 20   caught, they wouldn't give the money back; correct?

 21   A.  That's correct.

 22   Q.  And so you didn't say anything to anybody while you were in

 23   the house that Sunday afternoon about the cash you knew was in

 24   your bed?

 25   A.  Well, excuse me.  On that time, too, I have no idea that



                                                                  830



  1   the money was still in there.  They didn't -- they did not give

  2   me the inventory list yet.

  3   Q.  It would not have been impossible, Mrs. Nichols, would it,

  4   for you to say, Mr. Thomeczek, come help me lift the mattress

  5   on my bed?

  6   A.  It wouldn't be impossible if I know that the money was

  7   still in there.

  8   Q.  So the first thing you did was not say anything; correct?

  9   A.  That's correct.

 10   Q.  And the next thing you did was to look at the inventory of

 11   items seized by the FBI from that house; correct?

 12   A.  That's correct.

 13   Q.  And you had the cash and the coins in mind as you studied

 14   that document, did you not?

 15   A.  In my mind?  Yes.

 16   Q.  When you went through this document page by page, you were

 17   looking to see if the FBI had found your money.

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  That's what was on your mind.

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  You could have cared less about anything else listed on

 22   this inventory; correct?

 23   A.  Excuse me?

 24   Q.  Did you care about anything else that had been taken from

 25   your home by the FBI?



                                                                  831



  1   A.  Yes, I care about it; but most of the time priority in my

  2   mind was my money.  That's the only thing that could help me

  3   getting out in this country and go home to Philippines.

  4   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, how many jobs have you had since 1990?

  5   A.  Two.

  6   Q.  One of those was in Las Vegas?

  7   A.  And one in Michigan.  I was babysitting.

  8   Q.  Neither job lasted very long; correct?

  9   A.  That's correct.

 10   Q.  Neither job generated very much money; correct?

 11   A.  That's correct.

 12   Q.  That cash came from Terry Nichols, did it not?

 13   A.  Yes.  He gave it to me.

 14   Q.  When did he give it to you?

 15   A.  When I was in Philippines going to college, some of it; and

 16   some of it is my money that I saved from my work, from my job.

 17   Q.  All right.  What portion, Mrs. Nichols, was your portion

 18   that you had earned as a result of your work?

 19   A.  I forgot.

 20   Q.  Can you express any range, how much of $5,000 in cash came

 21   as a result of your labor?

 22   A.  I have forgotten how much.  It started ever since I was

 23   babysitting, and most of the time I would ask Terry some money

 24   for groceries or stuff like that; and Mrs. Joyce Wilt would

 25   give me some money, too, every time she came over in the



                                                                  832



  1   house -- not every time but sometimes.

  2   Q.  Well, speaking of money from the Nichols, how much did they

  3   give you after April 21, 1995?

  4   A.  After -- I have forgotten.  I never make a list of all the

  5   money that I receive -- received.  I'm sorry.

  6   Q.  Well, did you ever tell Terry Nichols' mother, I need

  7   money?

  8   A.  No.

  9   Q.  To get home to the Philippines?

 10   A.  No.

 11   Q.  Why wouldn't you ask your husband's mother, your daughter's

 12   grandmother, for some financial aid when you were in need?

 13   A.  Excuse me?  I don't understand.

 14   Q.  Let me return, Mrs. Nichols, to the house again on Sunday,

 15   April 23.  While you were there getting your belongings,

 16   thinking about the money, you were also helping them search

 17   your house, were you not?

 18   A.  Well, while I was in Herington?

 19   Q.  Yes, on Sunday, April 23.

 20   A.  I'm helping the FBI to search my house?

 21   Q.  Yes.

 22   A.  I don't understand it that way.

 23   Q.  Let me ask you this:  Do you remember the day before

 24   talking to the agents, cooperating as best you could and

 25   describing what you and your husband had been doing in the



                                                                  833



  1   several days before the bombing?

  2   A.  Yes, that's what Tom White told me.

  3   Q.  And they asked you what did you do, where did you go;

  4   correct?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  And at that time, you were as truthful as you possibly

  7   could be, were you not?

  8   A.  Yes.

  9   Q.  Everything you told the agents that first interview was the

 10   truth as far as you knew it.

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  So you were telling the truth on that day when you said, I

 13   know on Monday, the 17th, we rented videos.

 14   A.  I'm not sure.  I said I'm not sure if we rented on that

 15   date.  I'm not accurate on dates that I have.

 16   Q.  You're right and I'm mistaken, because what you said was,

 17   Let's get the receipt and that will tell us exactly what day it

 18   was that we rented those movies and watched in our residence;

 19   correct?

 20   A.  I didn't say let's get.  If I can get that receipt.

 21   Q.  And that's what you were looking for on Sunday, April 23;

 22   correct?

 23   A.  That's correct.

 24   Q.  You were trying to help the agents find information;

 25   correct?



                                                                  834



  1   A.  Yes.  I want to cooperate with them because they are the

  2   authority.

  3   Q.  And it was just like you said; right?  There was the video

  4   receipt and it showed what you had told them; correct?

  5   A.  That's correct.

  6   Q.  All right.  You willingly, voluntarily turned over that

  7   receipt to the police standing in your house on Sunday

  8   afternoon?

  9   A.  I didn't find it.  They did.

 10   Q.  Before they took it, did you know they found it?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  And you said good?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  When you were describing your activities to the police, you

 15   had talked about the activities the previous weekend on

 16   Saturday, had you not?

 17   A.  Yes.  We talk a lot of things.

 18   Q.  And you told the police that you and your husband had gone

 19   to a Wal-Mart in Manhattan, Kansas, to return an oil filter,

 20   had you not?

 21   A.  Well, aren't we supposed to talk about that?

 22   Q.  You were trying to be truthful and cooperative, were you

 23   not --

 24   A.  Yes, I am trying to be truthful with everyone.  I want to

 25   please with everyone.



                                                                  835



  1   Q.  And that was true, Mrs. Nichols, was it not?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  That on Saturday, April 15, you and your husband and others

  4   went to the Wal-Mart in Manhattan, Kansas?

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  Those are two examples, are they not, Mrs. Nichols, of all

  7   the detail you gave the police early on in this investigation;

  8   correct?

  9   A.  Yes.

 10   Q.  Back to the money, Mrs. Nichols.

 11   A.  Okay.

 12   Q.  You're in Gene Thomeczek's car, you're reading that

 13   inventory and you're finding for the first time that the FBI

 14   missed it; right?

 15   A.  That's correct.

 16   Q.  You find an entry for money; correct?

 17   A.  Excuse me?

 18   Q.  There is an entry on the log that says we took cash from

 19   that house; correct?

 20   A.  There is an entry on that log?

 21   Q.  Did you see some writing on that log?  Do you remember it

 22   said we seized some currency from another part of the house?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  And you brought that to Agent Thomeczek's attention, did

 25   you not?



                                                                  836



  1   A.  Yes.

  2   Q.  And you said that was Terry's money?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  But you missed my money in the bed; correct?

  5   A.  That's correct.

  6   Q.  And you and Mr. Thomeczek, in the privacy of his car

  7   without Sheila Dobson -- correct -- drove on to the motel where

  8   you were staying?

  9   A.  That's correct.

 10   Q.  And you said, Agent Thomeczek, I want my money; correct?

 11   A.  Yes, and I -- I even have to cry for that; but he would not

 12   give me my money because they have to get the test if there is

 13   any fingerprints from Tim McVeigh.

 14   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, it was important to you to get the money

 15   back; right?

 16   A.  Of course.

 17   Q.  It was so important to you that you were prepared to cry?

 18   A.  That's correct.

 19   Q.  In hope that Agent Thomeczek would respond to that emotion

 20   and give you your money; correct?

 21   A.  That's correct.  That's the only thing they can help me get

 22   out in the country as far as I understood.

 23   Q.  You even suggested to Agent Thomeczek, did you not,

 24   Mrs. Nichols, go back, get the money, don't tell anybody, and I

 25   won't, either.



                                                                  837



  1   A.  That's correct.

  2   Q.  And he explained to you, Mrs. Nichols, as an FBI agent, he

  3   simply couldn't do that.

  4   A.  Uh-huh.

  5   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, before you in the white binder should be

  6   Government's Exhibit 65, the white binder to your left, ma'am.

  7   To your left.

  8   A.  65?

  9   Q.  Yes, ma'am.  65, 66, 67.  Take a moment to look at them.

 10   A.  Okay.

 11   Q.  Do you recognize those, Mrs. Nichols, as greeting cards

 12   that you sent to your friends at the FBI?

 13   A.  That's correct.  Yes.  This is my card that I sent to the

 14   FBI.

 15   Q.  And Government's Exhibit 65 is the card that you sent to

 16   Agent Thomeczek, is it not?

 17   A.  Yes.  65?  Yes.

 18            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, I believe the defendant's

 19   versions of these same exhibits are in evidence.

 20            MR. WOODS:  I overlooked offering them, but I

 21   certainly will agree to his offering them, your Honor.

 22            MR. MACKEY:  I would do so at this time.

 23            THE COURT:  65, 66, 67 received.

 24   BY MR. MACKEY:

 25   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, did you write the words that appear on



                                                                  838



  1   Exhibit 65 that say, Me and Nicole will always have a special

  2   thought every day about you?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  We do love you as a parent.

  5   A.  Yes.

  6   Q.  And then you go on, do you not?

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  Did you mean those words, Mrs. Nichols?

  9   A.  On that time, yes.

 10   Q.  Because by June of 1995, the truth be known, you and Agent

 11   Thomeczek and Sheila Dobson truly did have a very trusting

 12   relationship?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  And those are the same individuals, Mrs. Nichols, who

 15   witnessed your signature on virtually every one of the consent

 16   to search forms that you've identified today; is that not true?

 17   A.  That's true.

 18   Q.  And as you sit there now, Mrs. Nichols, you think a parent

 19   would mislead you into signing something you did not want to

 20   sign?

 21   A.  On that time when I made this card, I thought that he is

 22   still my parent.  He treat me as a parent.  Some part of my

 23   mind was thinking that way.

 24   Q.  And that remains true today?

 25   A.  Not any more until I understand all this stuff.  And I even



                                                                  839



  1   remember that I asked Mr. Thomeczek, If I am your daughter,

  2   what would you do?  And he said, You just need to cry.

  3   Q.  Good advice sometimes; right, Mrs. Nichols?

  4   A.  Pardon?

  5   Q.  Good advice sometimes; right?

  6   A.  Yes.

  7   Q.  Did you shed a tear, Mrs. Nichols, when you saw the footage

  8   of the disaster in Oklahoma City?

  9            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, I object to that.

 10            THE COURT:  Sustained.

 11            MR. WOODS:  Totally out of line.

 12            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, they've drawn into question

 13   about why she would have cooperated, why she would have made

 14   the statements.

 15            THE COURT:  I sustained the objection.

 16            MR. MACKEY:  All right.  Thank you, your Honor.

 17   BY MR. MACKEY:

 18   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, in addition to making your plea to the FBI,

 19   Get my money back, you went to representatives from your own

 20   country, did you not?

 21   A.  Pardon?

 22   Q.  Did you not on repeated occasions call the Philippine

 23   embassy?

 24   A.  Yes.

 25   Q.  In the United States?



                                                                  840



  1   A.  Philippine -- yes.

  2   Q.  In Washington, D.C., oftentimes on phone bills being paid

  3   by the FBI; correct?

  4   A.  Some.  I don't know.  I don't remember most of the

  5   telephone calls I made.

  6   Q.  No one from the FBI said don't contact the Filipino

  7   embassy, did they?

  8   A.  Nobody.  Nobody told me about that.

  9   Q.  To the contrary, they helped set up a meeting between you

 10   and representatives from your native country, did they not?

 11   A.  Yes.

 12   Q.  That took place in Wichita, Kansas; correct?

 13   A.  That's correct.

 14   Q.  And you went there and met privately, did you not, with two

 15   representatives from that embassy?

 16   A.  That's correct.

 17   Q.  And that was your opportunity, was it not, to share with

 18   people from your own country what was going on; correct?

 19   A.  That's correct.

 20   Q.  And what you told them, Mrs. Nichols, was I'm being treated

 21   fine by the FBI, did you not?

 22   A.  That's true; but I still have to think that as far as I

 23   understood, the one who pays the ticket and the meals for these

 24   people is the Government, the FBI.

 25   Q.  The problem for you at that point, though, was the FBI



                                                                  841



  1   couldn't let go of your money; right?

  2   A.  Yes.

  3   Q.  So what you did was you went to your embassy and said give

  4   me a ticket?

  5   A.  Uh-huh; but they have to raise a fund for that.

  6   Philippines doesn't have that much money.

  7   Q.  They never gave you a ticket, did they?

  8   A.  They gave me a good rate of ticket.  They gave me like --

  9   Q.  Did they help you get a reduced fair?

 10   A.  Yeah, reduced fair.  That's correct.

 11   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, talking about flying to Philippines, can you

 12   tell me whether you had plans to go home to Manila on April 21,

 13   the day you went to the police station?

 14   A.  Why I planned to go home?

 15   Q.  Did you have plans to go back home on that day?

 16   A.  I was upset on that time.  That's why I reserve the ticket

 17   on May 10.

 18   Q.  You called a travel agency that same day to make plans to

 19   go home?

 20   A.  That's correct, early in the morning -- not early.

 21   Mid-morning.

 22   Q.  None of us want to hear about conversations with

 23   Mr. Nichols; but tell the Court why you wanted to go home on

 24   April 21, 1995, before you ever went to the police station and

 25   met your first FBI agent.



                                                                  842



  1            MR. WOODS:  Well, your Honor, Counsel knows that

  2   that's getting into the facts of the case and it's totally

  3   improper.  I object.

  4            THE COURT:  I don't know how she can separate that

  5   out, but I don't know what the answer is.  But I think it would

  6   be very difficult to separate out, as you've suggested, so I'll

  7   sustain the objection.

  8            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, your Honor.

  9   BY MR. MACKEY:

 10   Q.  Suffice it to say, Mrs. Nichols, that after the meeting

 11   with the Philippine embassy representatives, they turned you

 12   back over to the care and the custody of the FBI; correct?

 13   A.  That's correct.  And they leave me, promising me that

 14   they're going to help me to get the ticket; but I have to pay

 15   it back when FBI returns my money.

 16   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, you talked about two trips that you took to

 17   Oklahoma City?

 18   A.  Yes.

 19   Q.  Each of those occasions you met lawyers for the Government;

 20   correct?

 21   A.  That's correct.

 22   Q.  The first trip you remember there was a long interview

 23   session?

 24   A.  That is correct.

 25   Q.  And they reviewed much of what you had already told the



                                                                  843



  1   FBI; correct?

  2   A.  Uh-huh.

  3   Q.  You had never had a chance before to give the detail to

  4   Government lawyers that you had to the FBI; correct?

  5   A.  Oh, actually, as I understood, they tried to ask question

  6   that the FBI did not ask me.

  7   Q.  They may have come up with even new questions; correct?

  8   A.  That's correct.

  9   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, were those Government lawyers polite to you?

 10   A.  Pardon?

 11   Q.  Were they polite to you?

 12   A.  The Government's lawyers are, but Mickey Hawkins kind of

 13   like a little bit hard on me.  He won't let me read the letters

 14   that Terry sent to Tim or Lana, which is -- they are

 15   questioning me about that letters and I cannot read it.

 16   Q.  That upset you, did it not, Mrs. Nichols?

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  It was the idea that your husband had entrusted --

 19            MR. WOODS:  I object to this, your Honor.  We're

 20   getting into the facts of the case.

 21            THE COURT:  Yes.

 22            MR. WOODS:  That's not the purpose of this hearing.

 23            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, I think Counsel has left a

 24   suggestion that there was some professional mistreatment on

 25   May 9 by Government counsel, and I think the witness can



                                                                  844



  1   explain what upset her.

  2            MR. WOODS:  Not mistreatment, just failure to give her

  3   her rights.

  4            THE COURT:  We're not going to get into this exchange,

  5   Counsel.

  6            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

  7            THE COURT:  But the question does seem to request a

  8   broader answer than what happened on that occasion.

  9            MR. MACKEY:  All right.  I'll withdraw it.  Thank you,

 10   your Honor.

 11            THE COURT:  All right.

 12   BY MR. MACKEY:

 13   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, do you remember last summer coming back to

 14   the United States?  That would be August of 1995.

 15   A.  Yes -- 1995?

 16   Q.  Yes.  Just last summer.

 17   A.  Yes.

 18   Q.  And while you were here, did you meet with representatives

 19   from your husband's defense team, investigators for

 20   Mr. Nichols?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  And did they, in their sessions with you, ask you many of

 23   the questions that had been first asked by the FBI and later by

 24   Government lawyers?

 25   A.  Yes.



                                                                  845



  1   Q.  And wanted to know what you remembered seeing and doing;

  2   correct?

  3   A.  That's correct.

  4   Q.  And they wanted to know what sort of treatment you had

  5   received from Government representatives before you left back

  6   home; correct?

  7   A.  That's correct.

  8   Q.  And you told them outside the presence of the FBI or anyone

  9   from the Government that at no time were you ever threatened

 10   during any interview.

 11   A.  That's correct.

 12   Q.  Because that never happened; right?

 13   A.  It never happened, but just mainly being in FBI scares me

 14   because they're the authority and I have no idea what kind of

 15   trouble I'm in.

 16   Q.  You told them, Mrs. Nichols, that there was never any

 17   direct or indirect threats that the agents would take your

 18   daughter from you if you didn't cooperate.  That never

 19   happened; correct?

 20   A.  Yeah, but it's always been a fear in my mind.

 21   Q.  You told them there was never any threat that any harm

 22   would come to your family in the Philippines, did you not?

 23   A.  That's correct, but I did talk to my mother about that and

 24   I'm scared about that.

 25   Q.  And you told your defense investigators that you never



                                                                  846



  1   worried that you would be abandoned by the FBI if somehow you

  2   quit cooperating.  Never crossed your mind; correct?

  3   A.  He never asked me like that.

  4   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, while you resided in the residence for a

  5   brief period of time from, what, March 17 until the end of

  6   April --

  7   A.  Yes.

  8   Q.  -- did you have occasion to be in all the rooms in the

  9   house?

 10   A.  Pardon?

 11   Q.  Were you always -- excuse me.  Did you have occasion to go

 12   to each one of the rooms at some point in the house?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  Were you down in the basement?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  Did you see tools?

 17   A.  What kind of tools?

 18   Q.  Any kind.

 19   A.  I have no idea of tools.

 20   Q.  If there were tools in the house, they were your husband's

 21   possessions, not yours; correct?

 22   A.  That's correct.

 23   Q.  So at no point in the investigation did you alert the FBI

 24   about tools that may be in your residence; correct?

 25   A.  That's correct.



                                                                  847



  1   Q.  And the truth is you wouldn't know one tool from another;

  2   correct?

  3   A.  Yes.

  4   Q.  Mrs. Nichols -- excuse me.  Go ahead.

  5   A.  That's okay.

  6   Q.  Want a drink?

  7   A.  Thank you.

  8   Q.  All right.  I'm almost done.  Thank you.

  9            Mrs. Nichols, after meeting with Mr. Woods on May 24

 10   or 25, 1995, you started doing something you had not done

 11   before; correct?

 12   A.  That's correct.  That's taking notes of all the questions

 13   that the FBI asked me and the lawyers.

 14   Q.  Was that your idea?

 15   A.  It's my -- Ron's idea -- Mr. Ron Woods' idea.

 16   Q.  And what did you do with those notes, Mrs. Nichols?

 17   A.  I give it to Ron.

 18   Q.  Mrs. Nichols, you've seen, have you not, published reports

 19   of your statements made about what happened to you in April,

 20   May of 1995?

 21   A.  Published report?

 22   Q.  You made the newspapers?

 23   A.  That's not accurate.  I read it.

 24   Q.  Was the portion in these newspaper reports where you say

 25   that the FBI treated me well -- that was accurate, was it not?



                                                                  848



  1   A.  That's accurate.  Easy for me to say.

  2            MR. MACKEY:  One moment, your Honor.

  3            I have no other questions.

  4            THE COURT:  Mr. Woods, do you have any follow-up

  5   questions?

  6            MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor, I don't.  We would ask

  7   that she be excused unless this team needs to question her.

  8            MR. NIGH:  No, your Honor.

  9            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You're now excused.

 10            THE WITNESS:  Thank you, your Honor.

 11            THE COURT:  Next witness?

 12            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  We would call Donna

 13   Bucella.

 14            THE COURT:  Okay.  Please come forward and be sworn.

 15            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please raise your right hand.

 16       (Donna Bucella was sworn.)

 17            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please state your name and

 18   spell your last name for the record.

 19            THE WITNESS:  My name is Donna Bucella, B-U-C-E-L-L-A.

 20                         DIRECT EXAMINATION

 21   BY MR. WOODS:

 22   Q.  Ms. Bucella, my name is Ron Woods.  I represent Terry

 23   Nichols.  You and I met for the first time on May 24 last year;

 24   is that correct?

 25   A.  I believe so.



                                                                  849



  1   Q.  And you were in the U.S. attorney's office at that time

  2   when we met there to discuss the case that Mr. Tigar and I had

  3   just been appointed on.

  4   A.  Yes, sir.

  5   Q.  What is your position with the Department of Justice?

  6   A.  I'm an Assistant United States Attorney from the Southern

  7   District of Florida on loan to the Department of Justice, and

  8   currently I am the principal deputy director of the Executive

  9   Office for United States Attorneys.  In short, basically, I'm

 10   the No. 2 person in charge of overseeing the operations of all

 11   the U.S. Attorneys' offices around the country.

 12   Q.  How long have you been employed at the Department of

 13   Justice, counting Florida and everywhere?

 14   A.  Since 1987.

 15   Q.  Have you ever served as an acting U.S. Attorney?

 16   A.  Of course I did.  I did in 19 -- 1995 from May through

 17   October in the Middle District of Florida, which is the Tampa,

 18   Orlando, Ft. Myers, Jacksonville area.

 19   Q.  So you were the U.S. Attorney for that period of time?

 20   A.  I was interim.  I was filling in while they were on search

 21   for a presidential appointee.

 22   Q.  Have you served in that role in any other offices?

 23   A.  No, sir.

 24   Q.  When were you dispatched by the Department of Justice to

 25   come to Oklahoma City to take part in the investigation of the



                                                                  850



  1   bombing?

  2   A.  I came to Oklahoma on the 20th of April, but I was not --

  3   when I first came, the reason why I was coming to Oklahoma was

  4   to find out if our U.S. Attorney's office was intact, if any of

  5   our assistant United States attorneys and/or support staff --

  6   if everyone was okay; if the building structure was fine.  And

  7   I was asked by the interim U.S. Attorney at that time to please

  8   come and help.  And so that's when I first went to Oklahoma

  9   City.

 10   Q.  During that period from, say, April 20, for the next weeks,

 11   did you ever have contact with the Deputy Attorney General,

 12   Jamie Gorelick?

 13   A.  I'm not sure if I had specific contact with the Deputy

 14   Attorney General, but I certainly will tell you I was in

 15   contact with her principal associate, Merrick Garland --

 16   Merrick had also come to Oklahoma City within a couple of days,

 17   if not two days after I was in Oklahoma City.

 18   Q.  On April 21, Friday, were you in the command post that the

 19   FBI had set up?

 20   A.  Yes.

 21   Q.  Were you the senior Department of Justice lawyer in the

 22   room at that time?

 23   A.  There were a number of Department of Justice lawyers, so

 24   I -- I was the -- I'm stuck on the word "senior."

 25   Q.  Let me clarify:  The others were just line assistants,



                                                                  851



  1   weren't they?  You had a couple of people there, John Lancaster

  2   from Terrorists, the Antiterrorism Division, and someone else

  3   from Antiterrorism Division?

  4   A.  Well, Jim Reynolds who runs it.

  5   Q.  So vis-a-vis and Reynolds, who was the senior Department of

  6   Justice lawyer calling the shots?

  7   A.  We were not calling the shots.  The shots were being called

  8   by Washington.

  9   Q.  Okay.

 10   A.  I mean we were talking, in constant contact with SIOC out

 11   of FBI; and sitting in SIOC at FBI was Howard Shapiro, who is

 12   the deputy -- excuse me -- the general counsel of the FBI.  And

 13   at times, I believe that the Merrick Garland was over there;

 14   and basically Washington was making all final decisions.

 15   Q.  When word would come down from Washington through the

 16   Oklahoma City command post, who was the senior person there

 17   that the word was being relayed to?  Somebody was in charge, I

 18   hope, of the Oklahoma City command post?

 19   A.  The FBI is in charge of the Oklahoma command post.  The

 20   messages would come down to both Jim Reynolds and I.  Jim

 21   Reynolds would get on the telephone and call at that time the

 22   AAG of Criminal, which is the Assistant Attorney General of

 23   Criminal, Jo Ann Harris, and report to her because her next

 24   chain of command is the Deputy Attorney General; and I would

 25   call basically the SIOC.



                                                                  852



  1   Q.  What point in time on the 21st did you first hear the name

  2   Terry Nichols --

  3   A.  At some point during the day --

  4   Q.  Let me back up one second.  You mentioned that there was an

  5   acting U.S. Attorney in Oklahoma City.  The prior U.S. Attorney

  6   had been appointed to the district bench; is that correct?

  7   A.  Yes, sir.

  8   Q.  And Mr. Ryan here had not taken office as of that day on

  9   April 21; is that correct?

 10   A.  Correct, sir.

 11   Q.  So there is no U.S. Attorney there that's the senior law

 12   enforcement officer of that district at the time?

 13   A.  That's incorrect.  The interim U.S. Attorney --

 14   Q.  The interim U.S. Attorney was who?

 15   A.  Was Rozia McKinney-Foster.

 16   Q.  Was she there in the command post?

 17   A.  She was when I had first gotten there.  I believe that

 18   Rozia McKinney-Foster had gone to the command post on the 19th,

 19   probably later in the afternoon, and made an appearance and

 20   introduced herself to the FBI and I believe -- and again, this

 21   is from my conversation with her -- when I arrived in Oklahoma

 22   on the 20th and I first arrived at the office, she mentioned

 23   that she had stayed pretty much at the command post all night

 24   long.

 25   Q.  On April 21, was she in the command post and was she then



                                                                  853



  1   the senior federal law enforcement officer?

  2   A.  She would come back and forth to the command post, but she

  3   had gone back to her office.  She would come, I believe, in the

  4   morning for the briefings and perhaps later on in the afternoon

  5   for the briefings and then go back to the U.S. Attorney's

  6   office.

  7   Q.  Okay.  So the minute-to-minute running of the command post,

  8   if there is a Department of Justice lawyer, it's you and Jim

  9   Reynolds?

 10   A.  Command posts are run by the FBI because it's an

 11   operational activity, but I was in the command post; but I

 12   cannot tell you I was in the command post 24 hours a day on the

 13   20th or the 21st because I had gone back to the U.S. Attorney's

 14   office with Mr. Woods, because we had had a couple of people in

 15   the office who had lost family members and we were trying to

 16   assist the operation of the U.S. Attorney's office.  So I was

 17   trying to arrange for support staff to come from other parts of

 18   the country to help out the Western District of Oklahoma.

 19   Q.  I appreciate that.  I'm just trying to get to the period of

 20   time when the warrants were being drafted up and the FBI was

 21   getting the clearance of the lawyers asking whether or not the

 22   warrants were proper.  Were you there in the afternoon when the

 23   warrants were being drawn up?

 24   A.  There were a number of warrants.  Are you talking about the

 25   search warrants?



                                                                  854



  1   Q.  Well, there were six warrants issued that day, as I

  2   understand; so in a short period of time, from about 3:00 to

  3   about 4:00 or 5:00?

  4   A.  I was in the command post that day.  I'm not sure if I

  5   was -- I was probably there because I remember the magistrate

  6   being in the back part of the command post signing.  I'm not

  7   sure, you know, which warrants, but -- if there were six

  8   warrants that were signed.  I was not, by the way, the final

  9   authority on those warrants.

 10   Q.  All right.  When did you first hear that a material witness

 11   warrant would be sought for Terry Nichols?

 12   A.  I can't give you a specific time since when I was at the

 13   command post, the first few days were kind of -- sort of mesh

 14   into one another, since I was there from early in the morning

 15   till after -- after 12:00.  It would probably -- I don't know.

 16   I can't say with certainty.  I'd be guessing.

 17   Q.  All right.  Was it prior to 3:00 that afternoon?

 18   A.  I can't describe or differentiate between the time I heard

 19   the name "Terry Nichols" and the time that I heard material

 20   witness complaint and "McVeigh."  I remember being in the

 21   command post for the material witness complaint on McVeigh, but

 22   I don't remember and perhaps I didn't -- perhaps I didn't do

 23   the final look-see over the Terry Nichols'.

 24   Q.  I think that the Government just jumped over material

 25   witness and went to defendant for Tim McVeigh.



                                                                  855



  1            MR. HARTZLER:  Judge, could we have testimony from the

  2   witness here?

  3            MR. WOODS:  I'll rephrase that question, your Honor.

  4   BY MR. WOODS:

  5   Q.  Do you recall specifically that there was a material

  6   witness warrant for Tim McVeigh?

  7   A.  Yes, I do.

  8   Q.  And when was that issued?

  9   A.  Sometime during the day.

 10   Q.  Can you give me an approximation of what time that was

 11   issued?

 12   A.  Mr. McVeigh on the 21st was -- we -- I found out that he

 13   had been arrested on a driving charge and was in a state or

 14   local facility.  And it would have to be sometime during the

 15   day.  It would have to be before, like, 5:00 because at 5:00 I

 16   left the command center, or around -- later on that afternoon.

 17   Q.  Okay.  Well, we'll leave that where it is, the material

 18   witness warrant for McVeigh.

 19            I want to concentrate on the material witness warrant

 20   for Terry Nichols.  The Government has represented to us and we

 21   agree that it was signed sometime near 4:45.

 22            MR. WOODS:  Is that -- I lose time here.  Is that

 23   agreed by the Government?

 24            MR. MACKEY:  4:25.

 25   BY MR. WOODS:



                                                                  856



  1   Q.  4:25 in the afternoon, a material witness warrant was

  2   signed for Terry Nichols.  Did you happen to look at that one?

  3   A.  I don't have an independent recollection of looking

  4   specifically at that, at that material witness complaint.  I

  5   may have seen a draft of an affidavit, but I can't delineate

  6   between an affidavit for a search warrant or a material witness

  7   complaint.

  8   Q.  All right.  You're in the command post where constant

  9   communications are ongoing between Oklahoma City, Washington,

 10   Kansas City, Junction City command post, and Herington.

 11   A.  There was -- the room that I was in, there were a bank of

 12   telephones; and, you know, to pick up the telephone and call

 13   Washington or while you're holding on with Washington, you pick

 14   up another phone and dial.  So there was constant communication

 15   all around the country.

 16   Q.  All right.  Through this communication, did you become

 17   aware that Terry Nichols voluntarily appeared at the Herington

 18   police station about 3 p.m. the afternoon of Friday, April 21?

 19   A.  I am -- I am aware that Terry Nichols was in a police

 20   station, but I'm not aware -- at that time, I was not aware of

 21   any of the circumstances around it, because I was focusing on

 22   Mr. McVeigh.

 23   Q.  And you were focusing on Mr. McVeigh to get the material

 24   witness warrant for him?

 25   A.  We were going to go to -- yes.  Yes.



                                                                  857



  1   Q.  All right.  Did you see the final warrant that was issued

  2   for Terry Nichols that afternoon at 4:25 for him to be arrested

  3   as a material witness?

  4   A.  I don't have any independent recollection of reading the

  5   material witness warrant on Nichols or the final on Nichols.

  6   Q.  When you read Tim McVeigh's material witness warrant, did

  7   it state that he was attempting to flee the jurisdiction of the

  8   United States and needed to be arrested because a subpoena

  9   would not suffice?

 10   A.  On Mr. McVeigh?

 11   Q.  Yes.

 12   A.  No.  I don't believe he was fleeing the country.

 13   Q.  Exactly.  On Mr. Nichols, did you happen to read

 14   Mr. Nichols' material witness warrant that day or subsequent

 15   thereto where it said Mr. Nichols was attempting to flee the

 16   jurisdiction of the United States and a subpoena would not

 17   suffice?

 18            MR. HARTZLER:  I object, your Honor.  She said she

 19   didn't see it.  She doesn't recall seeing it.

 20            THE COURT:  She's now being asked if she saw it at a

 21   later time.

 22            MR. HARTZLER:  Very well.

 23            THE WITNESS:  I didn't see the Nichols final material

 24   witness complaint.  I may have -- I may have read all of it,

 25   because as paper was coming in, but I can't say I read it



                                                                  858



  1   beforehand.  Whether or not I read it subsequent, I probably --

  2   I don't know.  Do you have a copy of it?

  3   BY MR. WOODS:

  4   Q.  There is one here, I'm sure, somewhere.

  5            MR. HARTZLER:  Government 22, if I may, in the white

  6   book.

  7            THE COURT:  Government 22?

  8   BY MR. WOODS:

  9   Q.  It's the white book in front of you.  It's --

 10            THE COURT:  22 has been suggested by Mr. Hartzler.

 11            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

 12            THE COURT:  But it may be 26.

 13            MR. HARTZLER:  26 is the faxed warrant.  22 is the

 14   warrant with the affidavit.

 15            THE COURT:  Thank you.  22, yes.

 16            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

 17   BY MR. WOODS:

 18   Q.  If you would go to 26, Ms. Bucella.  26, which has been

 19   admitted into evidence, the cover sheet is a fax cover sheet to

 20   Bill Chornyak.  Do you recall talking to Chornyak in Kansas

 21   City, who was the supervisor in charge of the Kansas City

 22   command post?

 23   A.  As I said, that day I was really focusing on Mr. McVeigh;

 24   and I will tell you, I spoke with hundreds of agents during my

 25   time in Oklahoma, and I don't remember that specific agent.



                                                                  859



  1   Q.  Do you remember Rick Baker there in the command post in

  2   Oklahoma City?

  3            MR. HARTZLER:  If I may, it's Rich Baker, if that

  4   helps.

  5            THE WITNESS:  Baker.  I think I remember an Agent

  6   Baker.

  7   BY MR. WOODS:

  8   Q.  It looks like "R-I-C-A-R-D," but Rich is fine.

  9   A.  I'm not sure, but this looks -- this material witness

 10   warrant, if I saw it, would have been afterwards.

 11   Q.  All right.  You notice that in the front of it -- well, the

 12   title of it is United States of America vs. Terry Lynn Nichols.

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  And it's a warrant for arrest, and there is handwritten in

 15   something material witness?

 16   A.  Yes, I see that.  Something.

 17   Q.  Do you have any recollection of being present when it was

 18   presented to Judge Howland or Judge Russell, either one?

 19   A.  I can tell you I was in the command post and I remember the

 20   magistrate and the district court judge being in the back part

 21   of a room, and they were signing off on things.  But I couldn't

 22   tell you, you know, if it was a search warrant or material

 23   witness.

 24   Q.  You notice that it says --

 25            THE COURT:  Well, if she had nothing to do with it,



                                                                  860



  1   why are we doing this questioning?  I thought she was going to

  2   be called for a different reason.

  3            MR. WOODS:  She is, your Honor.

  4            THE COURT:  Well, let's get to it.

  5            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  May I make one further

  6   question on that one area.

  7            THE COURT:  All right.

  8   BY MR. WOODS:

  9   Q.  Did you play any role in deciding that the warrant needed

 10   to be reissued for Terry Nichols on material witness; that the

 11   first one was incorrect and the second one needed to be

 12   reissued?

 13   A.  Well, now you're telling me it was incorrect, so I can say,

 14   no, I didn't know it was reissued.

 15   Q.  Thank you.  Now, Ms. Bucella, did you stay in Oklahoma City

 16   and continue to work on the investigation?

 17   A.  Yes, I did.  I -- go ahead.  Ask the question.  I'm sorry.

 18   Q.  Were you still in Oklahoma City on or about May 9?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  Were you there when Ms. Marife Nichols was brought into a

 21   meeting where you were present?

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  Do you recall which day that was?

 24   A.  If I had a calendar, she -- I believe she came in -- she

 25   was supposed to come in the day before on the 8th and came --



                                                                  861



  1   and I don't know if she -- if she got off late; but when she

  2   arrived, I did not see her until the morning of the 9th in the

  3   U.S. Attorney's office, not at the command center, which was

  4   several blocks away.  And yes, I do remember because I was

  5   expecting to see her.

  6   Q.  And did you take part in an interview with Mrs. Nichols?

  7   A.  Yes, I spoke with Mrs. Nichols.

  8   Q.  Approximately how long did that interview last?

  9   A.  I would say probably took a couple of hours, but it was not

 10   a couple of hours where we just sat there.  She had her little

 11   daughter with her, who was almost two years old and was a

 12   two-year-old child that just did not want to sit down; so we

 13   took a lot of breaks and at times watched her child run around

 14   the room.

 15   Q.  What was the purpose of her being there to be interviewed

 16   by the lawyers?

 17   A.  There was a decision made to have her initially go before

 18   the grand jury, and that was just sort of a meeting so that the

 19   lawyers -- and I'll tell you it was Arlene Joplin, who was the

 20   criminal chief from the Western District of Oklahoma; Jerome

 21   Holmes, who was a fairly new lawyer in the Western District of

 22   Oklahoma who had a couple of years of experience, I believe,

 23   and myself.  And then we had three agents present, two FBI

 24   agents from -- not from Oklahoma.  And I'm afraid to say if I

 25   say that they're from Kansas and they're from some other place,



                                                                  862



  1   but I believe they were from Kansas.

  2   Q.  During the course of that meeting, did you advise

  3   Ms. Nichols that she had a right to refuse to appear at grand

  4   jury and testify against her husband?

  5   A.  What was the last part of your sentence?

  6   Q.  During that meeting, did you advise Mrs. Nichols that she

  7   had a right to refuse to appear at grand jury and testify

  8   against her husband?

  9   A.  Not -- perhaps if I can explain.  No, I did not.  The

 10   answer to your question in short is no.  But there was some

 11   conversation with her.

 12   Q.  All right.  Did you also -- do you recall advising her that

 13   she had a marital privilege; that is, she could refuse to

 14   discuss the confidential communications between her and her

 15   husband?

 16   A.  No, I did not.  But I did go through with her when she

 17   first came in -- when she first came into the room, we

 18   introduced ourselves to her.  Arlene Joplin was the lead

 19   attorney and --

 20   Q.  Well, you've answered my question.  Perhaps they'll have

 21   some questions for you when they get there.

 22            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, I thought we were going

 23   through this efficiently.  Sure, we can ask the question; but

 24   for efficiency purposes, why don't we let her complete the

 25   answer.



                                                                  863



  1            THE COURT:  It's up to the questioning counsel.

  2   BY MR. WOODS:

  3   Q.  During that meeting, did perhaps Ms. Nichols say she needed

  4   a lawyer to make sure her rights were preserved?

  5   A.  Absolutely not.  She never asked for a lawyer.

  6   Q.  When she left, she was given a subpoena to appear at the

  7   grand jury on May 16.  Did you have any role in seeing that

  8   grand jury subpoena was issued for a subsequent appearance in

  9   front of the grand jury?

 10   A.  I now -- I mean I knew afterwards that a subpoena was given

 11   to her, but I don't remember giving her a subpoena.  It was --

 12   we had to have some discussion amongst the lawyers as to

 13   whether or not we would want to talk to Mrs. Nichols again.

 14   Q.  All right.  She returned, did she not, on May 17, pursuant

 15   to that grand jury subpoena, to go to the grand jury?

 16   A.  She returned to Oklahoma, and we talked to her.  I

 17   subsequently found that we had given her a grand jury subpoena;

 18   but the purpose for her at that point was to talk about her --

 19   where she was going to go, how she was going to get to the

 20   Philippines.  We had to have some discussion with her since she

 21   had requested to go back to the Philippines.  She was never

 22   called before the grand jury after that.

 23   Q.  I'm not sure I'm following you.  The purpose of the grand

 24   jury subpoena to appear on the 16th was to get her back to

 25   discuss her going to the Philippines?



                                                                  864



  1   A.  No.  Purpose for the grand jury subpoena was to have her go

  2   before a grand jury.  What we were doing at the time is since

  3   Oklahoma only had two sitting grand juries, one of the grand

  4   juries could not be seated on this case because they were in

  5   the courthouse when the bomb went off, so we had to have the

  6   other one.

  7            What we were trying to do was to maximum our time with

  8   the grand jury, so we set up a number of witnesses to go before

  9   the grand jury.  If we had given Mrs. Nichols a grand jury

 10   subpoena, it was with the intent that she would go before the

 11   grand jury on the day that the subpoena date requested that she

 12   be there.

 13   Q.  Who made the decision not to put her in front of the grand

 14   jury?

 15   A.  It was a decision that was ultimately made by Washington.

 16   Q.  Who in Washington?

 17   A.  Merrick Garland.

 18   Q.  Did Merrick Garland state -- what did he state as the

 19   reason why she shouldn't go to grand jury?

 20            MR. HARTZLER:  I object, your Honor.  They're asking

 21   now about attorney-to-attorney conversation within the

 22   Government.

 23            THE COURT:  Yes.  I think that's within an executive

 24   privilege.

 25            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.



                                                                  865



  1            I pass the witness, your Honor.

  2            MR. NIGH:  Your Honor, if I may, I have a few

  3   questions that are, I believe, relevant to our motion to

  4   suppress.

  5            THE COURT:  All right.

  6                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

  7   BY MR. NIGH:

  8   Q.  Ms. Bucella, I'm Rob Nigh, one of the lawyers for Tim

  9   McVeigh.  You mentioned during Mr. Woods' questioning that a

 10   material witness warrant was issued for Tim McVeigh?

 11   A.  I believe, or perhaps I misspoke.  It might have been a

 12   complaint.  But it was a document filed for Mr. --

 13   Mr. McVeigh's presence.  It may have been a material -- I'm

 14   getting confused.

 15   Q.  Do you remember more than one document for Mr. McVeigh?

 16   A.  There were search warrants, there were warrants for, I

 17   guess, samples of his hair, his clothing.

 18   Q.  Did you see the warrants for Mr. McVeigh?

 19   A.  Some of them I saw.  I certainly saw all of them at some

 20   point during the time I was in Oklahoma City.

 21   Q.  Referring specifically to the 21st, do you recall seeing a

 22   material witness warrant for Mr. McVeigh?

 23   A.  I believe I did.

 24   Q.  What time of day would that have been?

 25   A.  I have no idea.  I'd be guessing.



                                                                  866



  1   Q.  Would that be the first warrant that you saw in reference

  2   to Mr. McVeigh?

  3   A.  I believe so.

  4   Q.  And did it request his appearance before the grand jury,

  5   or --

  6   A.  Most material witness complaints do say that they want

  7   their appearance before the grand jury.

  8   Q.  Was Mr. McVeigh not a target at that point in time?

  9   A.  I'm having a difficulty in trying to nail down with

 10   certainty the timing.  Mr. McVeigh was already in custody of

 11   the local law enforcement.  I'm not sure as the evidence came

 12   in, as it was coming in quite quickly, what specific evidence

 13   at that moment we had on Mr. McVeigh.  I know that the FBI was

 14   gathering a lot of evidence, but I'm not quite sure if --

 15   specifically at that time when it was being specifically

 16   drafted, if he was a target.  He certainly, I believe, was a

 17   subject.  We had some information.

 18   Q.  Were you able to see the magistrate that was signing the

 19   warrants?

 20   A.  I physically saw the magistrate in the command post.  I did

 21   not and cannot recall if I specifically saw him sign this

 22   specific material witness --

 23   Q.  Do you know that the affidavit in support of the material

 24   witness warrant was presented to the magistrate?

 25   A.  I don't see how the judge would sign a material witness



                                                                  867



  1   without an affidavit; but like I said, I did not sit there with

  2   the judges and watch specifically what they were doing.

  3            There were a number of assistant United States

  4   attorneys as well as John Lancaster and Mr. Reynolds that were

  5   also there presenting this, so I'm not quite sure.  Henry, Hank

  6   Gibbons, was the FBI agent who drafted the affidavit, so I'm

  7   sure he was standing in the back swearing the affidavit.

  8   Q.  And Mr. Gibbons was present at the same time you were

  9   there?

 10   A.  Yes.

 11   Q.  And you believe he was the affiant on a material witness

 12   warrant for Mr. McVeigh?

 13   A.  Mr. Gibbons was the affiant on a lot of the warrants that

 14   were filed.  I'm not sure.  If you can show me, then I can tell

 15   you if he was.

 16   Q.  Well, I'd show you a material witness warrant for

 17   Mr. McVeigh, if I had one.  But you might look at the first tab

 18   in the white book in front of you.  Actually --

 19   A.  This says Terry Nichols' residence.

 20   Q.  Try the third black tab.

 21            THE COURT:  What are you asking?

 22            MR. NIGH:  I'm asking her to look at Government's

 23   Exhibit McVeigh 3.  I can find one, your Honor, that's already

 24   in evidence, which would be the better way to go.

 25            MR. HARTZLER:  Government's Exhibit 23, your Honor.



                                                                  868



  1            THE COURT:  All right.  23, yes.

  2            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

  3            Okay.  It was a criminal complaint, then, if that was

  4   the first document that was filed.  There were a number of

  5   material witness complaints filed on this case.

  6   BY MR. NIGH:

  7   Q.  Is it now your recollection that there was not a material

  8   witness warrant for Mr. McVeigh?

  9   A.  It must have been the criminal complaint.

 10            MR. NIGH:  That's all I have, your Honor.

 11            THE COURT:  All right.

 12            MR. NIGH:  Could I have a moment?

 13            THE COURT:  Yes.

 14            MR. NIGH:  That's all I have, your Honor.

 15            THE COURT:  Mr. Hartzler.

 16                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

 17   BY MR. HARTZLER:

 18   Q.  Ms. Bucella, you testified that all the important decisions

 19   on April 21 at least were reviewed at high levels of the FBI

 20   and the Department of Justice.  Is that right?

 21   A.  Absolutely, yes.

 22   Q.  Can you explain to his Honor why that was?

 23   A.  First of all, this was obviously a very important case and

 24   there were people that were -- there were a lot of lives that

 25   were at stake, and this was not your run-of-the-mill case.  It



                                                                  869



  1   was probably one of the biggest cases that the United States

  2   had had, and the Department of Justice wanted to make sure that

  3   this case was -- was done correctly.  And so there were many

  4   levels of review every step of the way.

  5   Q.  And what would you say the standard of review by those

  6   Government officials was?

  7   A.  Very high.

  8   Q.  You were asked a question about the advice that you gave to

  9   Mrs. Nichols prior to her -- or I shouldn't say prior to her

 10   appearance in the grand jury because I believe you said she

 11   never did appear before the grand jury.

 12   A.  Never appeared before the grand jury.

 13   Q.  You were asked if you advised her about a privilege she had

 14   not to testify against her husband before the grand jury.  You

 15   said you did not.  Correct?

 16   A.  Correct.

 17   Q.  Do you believe you were required by any law, policy, or,

 18   regulation of the Department of Justice to so require that?

 19   A.  Absolutely -- absolutely not.  However, before talking to

 20   Mrs. Nichols, Ms. Joplin and myself -- Ms. Joplin leading --

 21   had sort of set the stage to Mrs. Nichols, describing who we

 22   were, what we were going to be asking her, and if she had any

 23   questions whatsoever or didn't want to answer anything, she

 24   didn't have to, asked her -- I specifically remember asking her

 25   whether she -- anybody threatened her or she was there



                                                                  870



  1   involuntarily and said if she needed to stop or ask any

  2   questions or take a break that she could do so.

  3   Q.  Prior to her appearance in Oklahoma City and her meeting

  4   with you, did you actually research the question of marital

  5   privilege?

  6   A.  Yes, I did.

  7   Q.  And did you come across the case of Trammell vs. United 

  8   States?

  9   A.  Yes, I did.

 10   Q.  And as a result of your research, what conclusion did you

 11   reach?

 12   A.  My conclusion was since she was there voluntarily and she

 13   was -- we were in a conversation mode, she was not testifying,

 14   that I could ask her or any of us could ask her any questions.

 15   If she chose to answer us, she could.  If she refused, then we

 16   probably would have stopped there.  But it was no privilege.

 17   Q.  Ms. Bucella, during your meeting with Mrs. Nichols, did

 18   anyone say to her words to the effect, as long as you're

 19   telling the truth, you don't need an attorney?

 20   A.  Absolutely not.

 21   Q.  Incidentally, did you believe that she was telling the

 22   complete truth?

 23   A.  I didn't think she was being quite forthright, but I needed

 24   to find out a little bit more.  She was very, very articulate

 25   and knew dates, times of where she was and who was with them,



                                                                  871



  1   but then every now and then, her answers just didn't -- either

  2   didn't make sense because maybe that's really what happened or

  3   I just -- I didn't think she was telling us everything.  And so

  4   it was -- I wanted to take a look at and I spoke with

  5   Mr. Garland about her testimony.

  6   Q.  Did you assist her in getting in touch with her husband's

  7   attorneys?

  8   A.  Oh, absolutely -- I will tell you what happened.  There

  9   were two times I spoke with Mrs. Nichols.  The first time we

 10   spoke with her after that meeting, I had called the SAC in

 11   Kansas City and asked if they could just take her home to her

 12   house; and he told me that no, they couldn't because they were

 13   concerned about threats and concerned about safety.

 14            The second time that we met her, before she was -- she

 15   wanted to go back to the Philippines but before she was going

 16   to go anywhere made sure -- and I believe I spoke with Pat Ryan

 17   at the time because by that point, he was the U.S. Attorney and

 18   spoke with Mr. Garland and I believe Mr. Garland and I talked

 19   to Pat and Mr. Garland had me direct Pat to make sure that he

 20   contacted Mr. Nichols' lawyers about -- about Mrs. Nichols'

 21   presence and the fact that she may go back to the Philippines,

 22   to give them an opportunity or Mr. Tigar an opportunity to

 23   speak with her.

 24   Q.  Did they have that opportunity?

 25   A.  I believe they did.



                                                                  872



  1   Q.  Was there anything about anything that Mrs. Nichols said or

  2   did that conveyed to you that she was in custody?

  3   A.  Absolutely not.  Both times that I spoke with her, she

  4   seemed -- it was an awkward situation.  I'm not going to say

  5   that -- that she was -- it took hello to break the ice, but she

  6   seemed pretty much free to go in and out of the room and talk

  7   to the agents and never once said, you know, that she was in

  8   any kind of custody.  The only time she mentioned help to go

  9   anywhere was to go to the Philippines, and there were some

 10   questions about her getting to the Philippines and authority to

 11   allow her to go to the Philippines.

 12            MR. HARTZLER:  One moment?

 13            THE COURT:  Yes.

 14            MR. HARTZLER:  Nothing further.

 15            MR. WOODS:  Just a few follow up, your Honor.

 16            THE COURT:  Yes.

 17                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION

 18   BY MR. WOODS:

 19   Q.  Ms. Bucella, who brought her to that meeting?

 20   A.  The FBI.

 21   Q.  How long had she been in custody of the FBI?

 22   A.  I was not aware.  I knew she was at least with the FBI and

 23   I won't use the word "custody," because they were transporting

 24   her.  She was at least with them from the time, day before I

 25   first met her until -- well, I'm not sure until how long



                                                                  873



  1   because I had left Oklahoma City and so I'm not sure.  Part of

  2   the problem was that Mrs. Nichols did not have any

  3   transportation by herself.  She had no money to get to the

  4   Philippines and we wanted to make sure that Mr. Tigar and

  5   yourself got to talk to her, so that it would not give any kind

  6   of appearance or argument that we were trying to make her

  7   unavailable.  And also, the question as to whether or not --

  8   who would pay for her to go back to the Philippine government.

  9   Q.  On April 21, she was placed in, quote, protective custody,

 10   the way the Government refers to it in the briefs by the FBI,

 11   was she not?

 12   A.  I don't have --

 13            MR. HARTZLER:  Object, your Honor.

 14            THE COURT:  Just a moment before you respond.

 15            I don't recall what's in the brief, but she didn't

 16   write the brief.

 17            MR. WOODS:  I understand, but she states that she does

 18   not want to use the term "custody."

 19            THE COURT:  Yes.

 20            MR. WOODS:  And I would represent to the witness that

 21   the Government uses the term "protective custody."

 22            MR. HARTZLER:  Could we have a cite for that?

 23            THE COURT:  Do you have that?

 24            MR. WOODS:  I'll find it over the break, your Honor.

 25            THE COURT:  Well, we're not taking a break.



                                                                  874



  1            MR. WOODS:  I withdraw -- I withdraw the statement,

  2   then, your Honor.

  3            THE COURT:  All right.

  4   BY MR. WOODS:

  5   Q.  Ms. Bucella, in an investigation like this, how quick are

  6   the leads run?

  7            MR. HARTZLER:  I object, your Honor.  That's beyond

  8   the scope of cross-examination.

  9            MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor, it's not --

 10            THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.

 11            THE WITNESS:  In this investigation, I have never seen

 12   so many leads.

 13   BY MR. WOODS:

 14   Q.  Were the tests on material items, the chemical tests, the

 15   lab tests run immediately?

 16   A.  I can't even -- I can't even speak to that.  I wasn't --

 17   that wasn't an area that I was focusing on or responsible for.

 18   Q.  How long does it take to do a fingerprint test of money?

 19            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, I --

 20            THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection now.

 21   BY MR. WOODS:

 22   Q.  Did you have any role in maintaining Ms. Nichols' presence

 23   here from April 21 up until May 24, when we met with her?

 24   A.  I don't understand -- I don't understand the question.

 25   Q.  Did you have any role in the Department of Justice decision



                                                                  875



  1   to keep Ms. Nichols in custody, protective custody -- whatever

  2   term one wants to use -- from April 21, when she was not

  3   allowed to return to her home, not given her money, until

  4   May 24, when we were first able to meet with her?

  5            MR. HARTZLER:  I object, your Honor.  It assumes facts

  6   that have not been proven.

  7            THE COURT:  Well, I think properly phrased, the

  8   question might be whether this witness had any official role in

  9   whatever arrangements of made for housing and support of

 10   Ms. Nichols during that time.

 11            THE WITNESS:  No, I didn't.  That was the FBI.

 12            MR. HARTZLER:  Thank you.

 13   BY MR. WOODS:

 14   Q.  And Ms. Bucella, you stated under Mr. Hartzler's questions

 15   that you and Merrick Garland and others discussed the fact that

 16   you wanted to make sure that she was made available to

 17   Mr. Nichols' new lawyers before she left the country.  Is that

 18   correct?

 19   A.  Yes, because there was some discussion at that point, since

 20   she couldn't go back to Herington and she had asked to go to

 21   the Philippines -- and I believe the Filipino government was in

 22   touch with her, and I had spoken to our international people in

 23   Washington about how does one make those kind of arrangements;

 24   but before she left, because she was going to the Philippines,

 25   it would be a better idea to have her attorneys -- have



                                                                  876



  1   Mr. Nichols' attorneys talk to her.

  2   Q.  Did you have any role in making a decision to return her

  3   money to her on the 24th after we had a chance to meet with

  4   her?

  5   A.  I had a role and that was first -- I didn't have the

  6   deciding role.  I was repeating some areas of questioning that

  7   concerned me.  One was how she was going to get back to the

  8   Philippines; (2) was there was money seized from the house and

  9   whether or not that money had any evidentiary value and who had

 10   that money.  Those were the only questions I had asked the FBI

 11   to find out.

 12            As to what ultimately happened, to this day, I don't

 13   know.

 14   Q.  Do you know that it was returned on her on May 24, after we

 15   were able to contact her?

 16   A.  (Shakes head.)

 17            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

 18            No further questions, Ms. Bucella.  Thank you for

 19   coming in.

 20            MR. HARTZLER:  Nothing further.

 21            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

 22            THE COURT:  You're excusing this witness?

 23            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

 24            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You're excused.

 25            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, she has clarified the



                                                                  877



  1   questions I had for Mr. Holmes, and so Mr. Holmes is excused,

  2   too.

  3            THE COURT:  All right.

  4            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

  5            THE COURT:  If you can give that information to him.

  6            Where are we on your --

  7            MR. WOODS:  We have other witnesses.  The next witness

  8   would probably -- well, I can take care of Mr. White, your

  9   Honor.  He's from out of town.  I'd like to go ahead and put

 10   him on.  The United States Army agent.  It's all at the

 11   pleasure of the court.  It's going to be relatively short --

 12            THE COURT:  All right.  Let's take him.

 13            MR. WOODS:  Tom White.

 14            THE COURT:  Mr. Kelley?

 15            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, on behalf of the media

 16   representatives, I request about one minute to be heard on

 17   something before we adjourn today.

 18            THE COURT:  All right.

 19            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you.

 20            THE COURT:  We'll take the witness first.

 21            MR. KELLEY:  I understand.

 22            THE COURT:  Mr. White, if you'll come forward to be

 23   sworn.

 24            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please raise your right hand.

 25       (William T. White was sworn.)



                                                                  878



  1            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please have a seat.

  2            Please state your full name and spell your last name

  3   for the record.

  4            THE WITNESS:  William Thomas White, W-H-I-T-E.

  5                         DIRECT EXAMINATION

  6   BY MR. WOODS:

  7   Q.  Mr. White, my name is Ron Woods.  I'm an attorney

  8   representing Terry Nichols.  What is your occupation, sir?

  9   A.  I'm a United States Army CID agent.

 10   Q.  What does CID stand for?

 11   A.  Criminal Investigation Command.

 12   Q.  How long have you been employed in that capacity?

 13   A.  About ten and a half years.

 14   Q.  How were you employed prior to that?

 15   A.  I've been in the Army since 1978.

 16   Q.  What qualifications do you have that qualifies you to be a

 17   CID agent?  Let's start with education, first.

 18   A.  I have a bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland,

 19   an associate's degree from the University of Maryland.  I have

 20   attended the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute.

 21   Q.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.

 22   A.  I've attended -- I've attended the DODPI at Fort McClellan,

 23   Alabama, various military schools.

 24   Q.  What is the duties and functions of a CID agent?

 25   A.  We investigate matters in which the Army may have an



                                                                  879



  1   interest.  Criminal matters.

  2   Q.  It's that broad and wide open?

  3   A.  Yes, sir, it is.

  4   Q.  Isn't there some limit on what you can investigate other

  5   than what you may have an interest in?  Are there statutes that

  6   you investigate, violations of any particular statutes?

  7   A.  Sir, AR 195 -- 195-2 says that we are authorized to

  8   investigate matters in which the Army has an interest.  There

  9   are specific crimes which we do investigate and then there are

 10   other ones which we may investigate if we choose to.

 11   Q.  So it's just the agent's choice?

 12   A.  No, sir.  It's made by management.

 13   Q.  And management chose to investigate the Oklahoma City

 14   bombing case?

 15   A.  No, sir.  The regulation specifically says that we will

 16   investigate acts in which there are military noncombat deaths,

 17   Army personnel and loss of Army equipment, property.

 18   Q.  So your justification is that because there was an office

 19   in that building where the Department of Army had an office,

 20   that you had the ability to conduct the investigation of this

 21   Oklahoma City bombing case?

 22   A.  We had the authority to conduct that investigation.

 23   Q.  As described by who?

 24   A.  Described by Army Regulation 195-2.

 25   Q.  And who in management told you to go to Herington, Kansas,



                                                                  880



  1   and take part in interviews of non-Army personnel but citizens

  2   involved in this investigation?

  3   A.  I don't really know exactly.  I mean, I was not actually

  4   told, sir.

  5   Q.  How did you end up in Herington, Kansas, conducting an

  6   interview of Marife Nichols?

  7   A.  Okay, sir.  On the 20th of April, we were doing

  8   canvasses --

  9   Q.  I'm sorry?

 10   A.  We were doing canvasses, assisting the FBI doing canvasses,

 11   in Junction City, Kansas.  Okay.  We were teamed up with FBI

 12   personnel because the Army did have an interest because we had

 13   a loss of life and because we had a loss of property; and at

 14   the request of the FBI.  And AR195-2 allows us to do that

 15   because --

 16            THE COURT:  I think the question is simply who sent

 17   you to Herington.

 18            MR. WOODS:  Right.  Thank you, your Honor.

 19   BY MR. WOODS:

 20   Q.  Who sent you to Herington, sir?

 21   A.  We were sent as parts of a team.

 22   Q.  What Army personnel sent you?  What area officer or someone

 23   in the United States Army sent you to Herington, Kansas, to

 24   take part in interview?

 25   A.  I was assigned -- okay -- to work with Special Agent



                                                                  881



  1   Thomeczek from the FBI.  Okay.  So I went basically where he

  2   went.

  3   Q.  So you were just present because he was conducting the

  4   interview?

  5   A.  I was representing the Army's interests during that

  6   interview.

  7   Q.  And you took part in conducting the interview, did you not?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  Did you write a report of that?

 10   A.  No, sir.

 11   Q.  You're just conducting investigations and don't write

 12   reports?

 13            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection, your Honor.  Argumentative.

 14            THE COURT:  Sustained.

 15   BY MR. WOODS:

 16   Q.  Did you write any memorandum up of that interview of six

 17   hours with Marife Nichols?

 18            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

 19            THE COURT:  Well, overruled.  The word was "report"

 20   before.  This is "memorandum."

 21   BY MR. WOODS:

 22   Q.  Shall I repeat the question?

 23   A.  Yes, if you could.

 24   Q.  Did you make any memorandum of your interview of Marife

 25   Nichols during that six-hour period on April 21, 1995?



                                                                  882



  1   A.  No.

  2   Q.  Did you ever advise her that she had the right, a marital

  3   privilege, not to repeat the confidential communications that

  4   transpired between her and her husband?

  5   A.  No.

  6   Q.  Did she ever ask for an attorney while she was talking with

  7   you?

  8   A.  No, sir.

  9   Q.  Did you discuss with her the fact that you were familiar

 10   with the Asian culture?

 11   A.  Yes, sir.

 12            MR. MENDELOFF:  Excuse me, Mr. Woods.  Pardon me.

 13            Your Honor, I'm having trouble hearing the witness.

 14            THE COURT:  Please speak up and into the microphone.

 15   BY MR. WOODS:

 16   Q.  What did you discuss with her about the Asian culture?

 17   A.  I don't really recall, sir.

 18   Q.  Was that done in an attempt to get her to talk more

 19   completely?

 20   A.  No.

 21   Q.  Were you selected to take part in that interview because

 22   your wife is from Korea?

 23   A.  No.  I don't believe that any of the agents knew that my

 24   wife was Korean.

 25   Q.  It's just happenstance that you were following along with



                                                                  883



  1   Mr. Thomeczek?

  2   A.  No, sir.

  3   Q.  You have no report of it?

  4            THE WITNESS:  No.

  5            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

  6            THE COURT:  Let's just get on with whatever he knows

  7   so we can get out of here.

  8            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

  9   BY MR. WOODS:

 10   Q.  What time did the interview end and Ms. Nichols leave?

 11            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection.

 12            THE WITNESS:  There are two different times.

 13            MR. MENDELOFF:  Objection.  Compound question, your

 14   Honor.

 15            THE COURT:  Sustained.

 16   BY MR. WOODS:

 17   Q.  What time did Ms. Nichols leave the Herington Department of

 18   Public Safety?

 19   A.  About 9:00.

 20   Q.  And where did she go?

 21   A.  She went to Junction City, Kansas.

 22   Q.  Did you go with her?

 23   A.  I was in another car that was with her, yes.

 24   Q.  And you went -- were you part of the team or the agents

 25   that took her out of Herington, Kansas?



                                                                  884



  1   A.  Yes, sir.

  7   Q.  Did you go to Abilene with her?

  8   A.  Yes, sir.

  9   Q.  How many days did you spend with Mrs. Nichols?

 10   A.  Just that one day.

 11            MR. WOODS:  All Right.

 12            Thank you, your Honor.  Pass the witness.

 13            MR. MENDELOFF:  Thank you, your Honor.

 14            THE COURT:  Do you have any questions, Mr. Mendeloff?

 15            MR. MENDELOFF:  Yes, I do, your Honor.  Thank you.

 16                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

 17   BY MR. MENDELOFF:

 18   Q.  Mr. White, you -- Mr. White, you indicated that there was a

 19   regulation that you cited that was one of the bases for your

 20   participation in connection with this case; is that correct?

 21   A.  Yes.

 22   Q.  Is there another regulation, as well?

 23   A.  Yes.  CID regulation 195-1.

 24   Q.  Mr. White, please lean toward --

 25   A.  CID regulation 195-1.



                                                                  885



  1   Q.  Is there another regulation, as well?  CID.  I'm sorry.

  2   A.  Right.

  3   Q.  What does that regulation state?

  4   A.  It basically reiterates the same thing that's in Army

  5   regulation 195-2.

  6   Q.  And your participation in the interview of Marife Nichols

  7   arose out of your assistance to Special Agent Thomeczek as a

  8   completely separate matter earlier in the day; right?

  9   A.  Correct.

 10   Q.  When you arrived in the interview room, how did the

 11   interview begin with Mrs. Nichols?

 12   A.  Special Agent Thomeczek identified both of us and we both

 13   showed our credentials.

 14   Q.  Then what happened?  What did he tell her?

 15   A.  Special Agent Thomeczek told her that we wanted to talk to

 16   her about her husband's possible involvement in the Oklahoma

 17   City bombing; that she didn't have to answer our questions;

 18   that she had a right to have an attorney present if she wanted

 19   to; that she was free to go at any time.

 20   Q.  Did you and Agent Thomeczek take any steps to insure that

 21   Mrs. Nichols understood your conversation?

 22   A.  Yes.  We also asked her some questions, biographical and

 23   background, where she was from.  She told us that she was from

 24   the Philippines, told us about her daughter's name, how old she

 25   was.  At one point, she told us that her brother or other



                                                                  886



  1   family member had been a police officer in the Philippines.

  2   Q.  Now, during the course of the interview, did Mrs. Nichols

  3   make any remarks concerning things that Mr. Nichols had told

  4   her, without getting into what they were -- things that

  5   Mr. Nichols had told her on the way to the police station?

  6   A.  Yes, sir.

  7   Q.  And with respect to that, did she relate anything having to

  8   do with a drive to Oklahoma City, without getting into what it

  9   was?

 10   A.  Yes.

 11   Q.  During what portion of the interview did this take place?

 12   A.  During the first hour.

 13   Q.  And throughout the interview, did Agent Thomeczek leave the

 14   room on occasion?

 15   A.  Yes.

 16   Q.  Now, by the way, during the course of the interview, were

 17   you wearing a weapon?

 18   A.  Yes, I was.

 19   Q.  Was it visible?

 20   A.  No.

 21   Q.  Was Agent Thomeczek wearing a weapon, if you know?

 22   A.  I believe he was.

 23   Q.  Was that -- was it visible?

 24   A.  No.

 25   Q.  Was the interview conducted in conversational tones?



                                                                  887



  1   A.  Yes, sir, it was.

  2   Q.  Did there come a time when you and Agent Thomeczek -- or

  3   excuse me.  Did there come a time when you and Agent Thomeczek

  4   were joined by another agent in the interview?

  5   A.  Yes.  Special Agent --

  6   Q.  Please lean forward.

  7   A.  Special Agent Sheila Dobson.

  8   Q.  Approximately what time did that occur?

  9   A.  That happened about 5:45.

 10   Q.  And after Agent Dobson joined the interview, did you have

 11   occasion to have a discussion with Ms. Nichols regarding

 12   consent to search forms?

 13   A.  Yes.

 14   Q.  And when did that occur, roughly?

 15   A.  About 6:00.

 16   Q.  All right.  And can you tell the court exactly how this

 17   occurred?

 18   A.  Special Agent Thomeczek informed her that they wanted to

 19   search her house and her truck.  He told her that under the

 20   Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, her rights

 21   against unlawful seizures were protected and that because of

 22   this, there was only two ways that they could conduct a search

 23   of the house and the truck.  One would be through her consent

 24   and the other would be through a search warrant.  He told her

 25   that we were asking for her consent.



                                                                  888



  1   Q.  All right.  Did Ms. Nichols ask anything?

  2   A.  Yes.  She asked several things.

  3   Q.  What did she ask?

  4   A.  One of the things she asked was what would happen if she

  5   did not consent.

  6   Q.  And what did Agent Thomeczek respond?

  7   A.  Agent Thomeczek told her that if she did not consent that

  8   they would have to try to get a search warrant.  In order to do

  9   that, they would have to appear before a judge, explain why

 10   they wanted to get a search warrant and that they may not get

 11   the search warrant.

 12   Q.  All right.  And did she voice any other questions or

 13   concerns?

 14   A.  Yes, she did.

 15   Q.  What was that?

 16   A.  She voiced a concern about the truck, because she said,

 17   first of all, that she didn't have a driver's license; that she

 18   didn't drive the truck and that she believed the truck belonged

 19   to her husband, Terry Nichols, and she did not know if she had

 20   the authority or the power to give consent to search that

 21   truck.

 22   Q.  What did Agent Thomeczek say?

 23   A.  Agent Thomeczek asked her a couple more questions, one that

 24   had to deal with did she have any property in the truck, did

 25   she have access to the truck; and she said yes; in fact, there



                                                                  889



  1   was a diaper bag that she used for Nicole that was in the truck

  2   at the time.

  3            Agent Thomeczek explained to her that since he was

  4   Terry Nichols -- she was Terry Nichols' wife that she had

  5   access to the truck that she maintained property in the truck

  6   that she could give consent.

  7   Q.  What did she respond?

  8   A.  She asked about -- she asked if we were going to ask her

  9   husband about consent.

 10   Q.  And what did Agent Thomeczek say in response to that?

 11   A.  Special Agent Thomeczek said that in all probability, the

 12   agents that were with him would ask but that if she gave

 13   consent they wouldn't require his, they would not need his to

 14   do the search.

 15   Q.  And what did she say?

 16   A.  She said that she understood all that and they went through

 17   the consent form.

 18   Q.  Did she agree to consent orally?

 19   A.  Yes.

 20   Q.  And how did Agent Thomeczek go through the consent forms

 21   with her?

 22   A.  When he went through the concept form with her, he turned

 23   the form so that she could see it, so that she could read it.

 24   He went through the form with her pretty much line by line.

 25   Q.  All right.  And when he was finished, did he ask her any



                                                                  890



  1   questions?

  2   A.  Yes.  He asked her if she understood the consent form.

  3   Q.  All right.

  4   A.  She indicated that she did.

  5   Q.  And what happened?

  6   A.  Then he also asked her if she had any questions.

  7   Q.  Okay.

  8   A.  She told him that she did not.  Then she asked him where

  9   did he want her to sign.

 10   Q.  What did he tell her?  I'm sorry.

 11   A.  He pointed on the form and she signed.

 12   Q.  And did the same thing occur with respect to the truck

 13   consent form?

 14   A.  Yes.

 15   Q.  After this consent occurred, did anyone leave the room?

 16   A.  Yes.  Sheila Dobson left the room.

 17   Q.  All right.

 18   A.  And so did Special Agent Thomeczek.

 19   Q.  Where did Sheila Dobson go?

 20   A.  Sheila Dobson went to go buy diapers for Nicole.

 21   Q.  Now, later in the evening, was there a conversation with

 22   Ms. Nichols concerning her housing for that evening?

 23   A.  Yes.

 24   Q.  And when, roughly, did that occur?

 25   A.  About 7:15 or 7:30.



                                                                  891



  1   Q.  Can you tell the Court who was present for this

  2   conversation?

  3   A.  Myself, Special Agent Thomeczek, Mrs. Nichols.

  4   Q.  Nicole?

  5   A.  And Nicole.

  6   Q.  And where did this occur?

  7   A.  It occurred in the same room at ther -- that the interview

  8   had occurred in -- the same room where the interview had

  9   occurred in.

 10   Q.  And can you tell the Court what happened in this

 11   conversation?

 12   A.  During that conversation, Special Agent Thomeczek informed

 13   her that she would not be able to return to her home tonight

 14   because they wanted to do the search.  Not only that, but there

 15   was a concern that there might be explosives or something like

 16   that in the house.  He asked her if she had anyplace that she

 17   could stay, anybody that she knew that she could stay with; and

 18   she told him that she didn't know anybody in the area and that

 19   she didn't have anyplace to stay.

 20            Special Agent Thomeczek then told her that they would

 21   arrange accommodations for her and for Nicole for the night and

 22   that they would pay for that and if there was any expense for

 23   food, they would also take care of that.

 24   Q.  What did he say?  What happened when the search was

 25   completed?



                                                                  892



  1   A.  He said after the search was completed, she would be able

  2   to return to her home.

  3   Q.  What did she say?  Did she ask any other questions?  Excuse

  4   me?

  5   A.  She had concern about clothes for herself and Nicole

  6   because she just had the clothes they were wearing.  Special

  7   Agent Thomeczek said they wouldn't be able to get into the

  8   house to get clothes that night; that possibly the next day

  9   when the search was completed, they would be able to get

 10   clothes, and if there was anything they needed that night, they

 11   would go ahead and buy that for them.

 12   Q.  Did Ms. Nichols voice any complaint or opposition to this

 13   arrangements?

 14   A.  No.  In fact, Special Agent Thomeczek asked her if there

 15   was anything she needed that night, anything that they actually

 16   had to have and she told him she needed the diaper bag.

 17   Special Agent Thomeczek said that he would try to get that for

 18   her.

 19   Q.  All right.  Now, that evening, I believe you testified on

 20   direct examination that you went with other agents and

 21   Ms. Nichols to Junction City and then to Abilene.

 22   A.  Yes.

 23   Q.  And Ms. Nichols was put up in a hotel that evening?

 24   A.  Yes, sir.

 25   Q.  What agents, if any, stayed at the hotel?



                                                                  893



  1   A.  Special Agent Dobson, Special Agent Dawn Grey from CID, and

  2   I believe that was it.

  3   Q.  All right.  And were any agents in Ms. Nichols' room?

  4   A.  No.

  5   Q.  Were there any agents standing post outside Ms. Nichols'

  6   door?

  7   A.  No.

  8   Q.  What was the purpose of the agents' presentation at the

  9   motel?

 10   A.  The protection of Mrs. Nichols.

 11   Q.  Now, throughout your exposure to Mrs. Nichols, did you ever

 12   observe any evidence that she had any difficulty understanding

 13   what people were saying to her?

 14   A.  No.

 15   Q.  And specifically at the time Ms. Nichols discussed and

 16   signed the consents to search for the home and pickup, did she

 17   provide any indications that she did clearly understand the

 18   consents?

 19   A.  Yes, she did.  The questions that she asked during the time

 20   period told me that she understood every word.

 21   Q.  All right.

 22            MR. MENDELOFF:  Thank you.  Nothing further, your

 23   Honor.

 24            THE COURT:  Any follow-up questions?

 25            MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor.



                                                                  894



  1            THE COURT:  You may --

  2            MR. WOODS:  Could we ask he be excused?

  3            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You're excused.

  4            Well, we're going to recess for the day.

  5            Mr. Hartzler, can you advise us:  Is there any

  6   information that there was at any time a material witness

  7   warrant issued for Timothy James McVeigh?

  8            MR. HARTZLER:  There is no information.

  9            THE COURT:  I think that was just a plain mistake.

 10            Or that one was ever prepared?

 11            MR. HARTZLER:  Correct.  No.  I believe there is no

 12   indication that that ever happened.

 13            THE COURT:  All right.  I assumed that it was an error

 14   and thank you for clearing it up.

 15            Mr. Kelley?

 16            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, a request and briefly some

 17   authority in support of it.  On Monday, we filed ancillary

 18   Civil Action 96-X-121 in which we brief our -- what we believe

 19   is our right to copies of electronic media exhibits offered

 20   into evidence.  I missed the session early afternoon.  I

 21   understand a tape was played in open court.  I also understand

 22   it's not admitted into evidence.

 23            THE COURT:  That's right.  It's not in evidence.

 24            MR. KELLEY:  I'd cite the Court two cases, one that's

 25   in our --



                                                                  895



  1            THE COURT:  Well, are you making a request for the

  2   tape?

  3            MR. KELLEY:  Yes, sir.  We ask that a copy --

  4            THE COURT:  Is there a copy of it?

  5            MR. KELLEY:  We ask that a copy be made at our

  6   expense --

  7            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, we have an extra copy;

  8   however, it would be somewhat inconsistent with our position

  9   that we've taken earlier on audiotapes, but it's at the Court's

 10   discretion, your Honor.

 11            THE COURT:  If it was played in open court, then just

 12   like testimony in open court, they're entitled to it.  Did you

 13   play the tape in its entirety?

 14            MR. WOODS:  I did, your Honor.

 15            THE COURT:  Turn it over to him if this is a copy that

 16   you can release.

 17            MR. WOODS:  It is.  It's been provided to me by the

 18   Government.

 19            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.

 20            MR. MENDELOFF:  Your Honor, one other matter,

 21   housekeeping, I don't know if you want to handle this.  We had

 22   Exhibit 35, which is the transcript.  We've now designated our

 23   portions.

 24            THE COURT:  As Exhibit 72, I thought it was.

 25            MR. MENDELOFF:  No, that's a separate item, your



                                                                  896



  1   Honor, and I also have that here.  72 was --

  2            THE COURT:  We'll deal with it tomorrow.

  3            MR. MENDELOFF:  Thank you.

  4            THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar?

  5            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, we have not been served with

  6   any ancillary civil action; and this is the third action in a

  7   row filed by Mr. Kelley with which we have not been favored.

  8   If we're required to respond to it, I'd like to be served with

  9   these things.

 10            THE COURT:  I haven't issued any order requiring

 11   response, but I thought there was a certificate of service

 12   attached to the filing.

 13            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, it was mailed; and my office

 14   called Mr. Tigar's office to ask if they wanted it faxed.

 15            THE COURT:  Do you have his correct address?

 16            MR. KELLEY:  It's, I believe, 1120 Lincoln.  That's

 17   from memory.

 18            THE COURT:  All right.

 19            MR. TIGAR:  The Supreme Court has judicially noticed

 20   the vagaries of the Postal Service, your Honor.  We'll be

 21   patient.

 22            THE COURT:  Where are we on the case, here -- on the

 23   motion, rather?

 24            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, we have four witnesses whose

 25   testimony will be very brief.  It may be five witnesses.  As



                                                                  897



  1   your Honor can see, we cut more than a dozen last night in an

  2   effort to shorten things; and thus, we almost made my assurance

  3   of yesterday.

  4            THE COURT:  And the Government has several witnesses.

  5            MR. HARTZLER:  Two, I believe, your Honor.

  6            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll -- we'll start up at 9

  7   in the morning.  I've been advised the courthouse will be open

  8   at 8, so that you can enter at that time or any time before 9.

  9            We'll be in recess.  9:00 tomorrow morning.

                             PROCEEDINGS

       (In open court at 9 a.m.)

            THE COURT:  Please be seated.

            We are convened in 96-CR-68, United States against

   Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

            We're here for a hearing of several motions and filed

   Terry Nichols against Janet Reno, Patrick Ryan.

            THE COURT:  Good morning.

            There were proceedings in this case yesterday that

   were not public.  I think some announcement should be made with

   respect to what occurred yesterday.

            I met with counsel for all parties most of the day and

   these proceedings were advisedly nonpublic.  I have previously

   identified in the memorandum opinion and order on media 
motions

   entered on January 24 criteria for sealing documents and for

   conducting proceedings without public access.  And those

   criteria that I identified were in the form of questions:  Does

   the matter involve activity within the tradition of free public

   access to information concerning criminal prosecutions?  Will

   the public access play a significant positive role in the

   activity and in the functioning of the process?  Is there a

   substantial probability that some recognized interest of higher

   value than public access to information will be prejudiced or

   affected adversely by disclosure?  Does the need for protection

   of that interest override the qualified First Amendment right

   of access and is the closure by the court essential to protect

   the interests considering all reasonable alternatives.

            In my opinion, what we did yesterday meets those

   criteria.

            There was, of course, a court reporter present.

   Transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared, but they will

   remain sealed; and of course, copies will be given to counsel,



                                                                           5



   but they're cautioned to have them under certain protective

   orders.

            One of the things that we did yesterday was discuss

   scheduling; and among the things that we discussed was a matter

   of new legislation that was enacted very recently, which has a

   feature in it concerning television transmission of criminal

   proceedings with controlled access.

            There was earlier filed here a motion which, because

   it wasn't filed by any parties to this case, given what we call

   a collateral designation, which is 96-Y-100 and was styled as a

   motion for relief under Victims Rights and Restitution Act of

   1990.  That was filed on March 28 by a Rhonda Bartelbough and

   Dr. Paul Heath.  This new legislation makes that motion moot;

   and it was agreed that today, the Government would be filing a

   position with respect to the applicability of this new

   legislation to this proceeding.

            The defendants in the case were given until June 3 to

   file their responses to the Government's position, and the

   Government has until June 24 to reply.

            The first briefing on this will deal with whether

   there are any suggested infirmities in the legislation and also

   whether it is applicable to this case.  Then it was discussed

   that if the determination is made that it is applicable, the

   manner of implementation would be a matter for discussion and

   possibly hearing at a later time.



                                                                           6



            Also, as a collateral proceeding, we did have filed in

   what has been designated 96-X-89 what was styled as a petition

   of media representatives to permit sound feed to the press room

   in the adjacent building subject to court controlled delay and

   interruption.

            Counsel for Terry Nichols filed an opposition to that

   and also in the same paper moved to stop distribution of audio

   tapes of court proceedings at or near the time of the

   proceeding.

            That motion raises a matter by a party to the case.

   It was discussed somewhat with counsel, and we decided to try

   to hear that issue today; that is both issues, really, (1)

   whether to stop the release of audio tapes of these proceedings

   and also the additional matter of transmission outside of the

   controlled access of a courtroom.

            So Mr. Kelley -- Mr. Kelley -- yes.

            MR. KELLEY:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  What we'd like to do, Mr. Kelley -- and

   we'd invite your participation on this -- we'd like to do that

   this afternoon.  I'd like to proceed with the motions scheduled

   this morning; and if you would be available perhaps at 1:30 or

   sometime near there, assuming that we're completed arguments on

   the motions, we'd take that up.  Is that time agreeable to you?

            MR. KELLEY:  I'll be there whenever the Court sets it.

   If it could be a little later than 1:30, I'd appreciate it; but



                                                                           7



   I can accommodate the Court if 1:30 needs to be the time.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm setting that as sort of a target

   time.  It could be 2:00.  I don't know how long we'll take this

   morning.

            Do you have a conflict with 1:30?

            MR. KELLEY:  Yes.  But it can be set aside.  It's

   something I can do at another time.

            THE COURT:  We'd appreciate if you could be available

   at 1:30.

            MR. KELLEY:  I'll do it.  Thank you, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.

            Now, there was also discussion yesterday generated by

   a motion filed for Mr. Nichols which was described as the

   motion for hearing on violation of protective orders and of

   other obligations.  Counsel for the Government filed a response

   and that generated what I thought was a very frank discussion

   about pretrial publicity in the case and particularly as it

   regards information which was -- which is required to be

   exchanged and which has been exchanged under the rules of

   discovery applicable in this case.

            I did, in the course of these discussions, enter an

   oral order that none of the discovery information made

   available will be disclosed publicly in motions, in briefs and

   in pleadings; and if there is any need in these papers to refer

   to documents in the discovery material or, indeed, information



                                                                           8



   that's within that material, copies will be submitted under

   seal.

            I also provided that by May 17, parties in the case

   will file proposals for orders that may give guidance for the

   future in handling discovery information and will also take

   positions with respect to what inquiries may be appropriate for

   what has happened in the past.

            Those motions will necessarily be submitted under

   seal -- those proposals.  They may be in the form of proposed

   orders.

            I do, of course, intend to proceed here, as I said in

   the memorandum opinion and order in January, that all

   proceedings in this case are presumptively open and that if

   there is any request for an order to conduct any hearings

   without public access or any sealing of other papers, we will

   be following the procedure identified in that order of giving

   notice and an opportunity after notice for a public objection.

            Now, most of the day was spent discussing the matter

   of jury instructions.  And jury instructions, as they relate to

   what are the elements of the offenses charged in the

   indictment; that is, what is necessary for the Government to

   prove on these charges.  That's an unusual procedure at this

   stage of a case.  The normal thing, of course, is that the jury

   instructions are discussed in what's called the charging

   conference attended by counsel and, of course, the Court after



                                                                           9



   the evidence is all in and the case is ready for submission to

   the jury with argument and instructions.  And that still will

   be done, of course.

            The final instructions will be settled after all of

   the evidence is in; but in this case, I determined that because

   of motions that were argued here -- well, actually, they were

   argued in Oklahoma City on February 27, to flesh out, as it

   were, some of the arguments taken there and the positions

   taken, we could best do that by actually discussing proposed

   instructions.  And we did that.  And the discussion was

   lengthy.

            And the reason that that aspect is particularly

   sensitive and must be closed and continued to be sealed is, of

   course, that it was necessary to have kind of an academic

   discussion and it was necessary for me to ask a number of

   questions that I suppose could be characterized as speculation

   and I asked a number of hypothetical questions, hypothetically

   about what the evidence might be in the case and what evidence

   might be offered.

            And so I would ask and did ask counsel to suppose that

   this or that came out in the evidence or this or that was

   proved, what-if type things, and they responded.  And

   obviously, were all of those speculation now to be made public,

   it would create, I think, unwarranted and confusing information

   to the public about what to expect in the way of evidence at



                                                                           10



   the trial; so I did believe and continue to believe that such

   discussions must be off the record, as it were.

            They, again, were recorded by court reporter.  A

   transcript will be sealed.  And even in the normal case, those

   discussions are often held off the record, as it were.  I mean

   there is a record made ultimately before instructions are

   given; but usually, the Court and counsel retire to chambers to

   discuss instructions and not in the courtroom, in the course of

   a trial.

            So I thought this explanation of what we did yesterday

   was appropriate and probably necessary for all those who are

   interested in this proceeding to have some notion of why we

   were behind closed doors.

            Now, today, we have for hearing this morning motions.

   There is in a related civil case that I've already announced,

   96-M-606, filed originally in the Western District of Oklahoma

   as Civil Action 95-1824-W, a lawsuit by Terry Nichols against

   the Attorney General, Janet Reno, and Mr. Ryan, the United

   States Attorney in the Western District of Oklahoma regarding a

   notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the

   criminal case.

            There are also in this criminal proceeding motions

   filed by both defendants, Mr. McVeigh's motion to disqualify

   the Attorney General and other persons in the Department of

   Justice with regard to the issuance of a notice to seek the



                                                                           11



   death penalty; also, motions to strike the death penalty notice

   filed in the case, and Mr. Nichols has likewise filed motions

   to strike.

            I think that perhaps procedurally, we might start with

   the Government's motion to dismiss the civil action, which

   includes an objection to jurisdiction, subject matter

   jurisdiction there and then perhaps in responding to that,

   Mr. Tigar or whoever is going to respond for Mr. Nichols can go

   to the motion to strike because there is, of course, an obvious

   relationship.  And one of the grounds, as I understand it, on

   the motion to dismiss the civil case is there is an adequate

   remedy in the criminal proceeding, which, of course, we will

   deal with here.

            So unless there is some compelling reason to do it

   differently, that's how I'd like to start and call on counsel

   for the Government on the motion to dismiss the civil case.

            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, may I be excused at this

   point?  It's Mr. Kelley.

            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Kelley.  And if you'll come back

   at 1:30, I appreciate whatever rescheduling you have to do.

            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.  No problem.

            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Connelly.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Good morning, your Honor.  My name 
is

   Sean Connelly and I represent the Attorney General and the

   United States Attorney in this civil case.



                                                                           12



            The question presented in this civil case is whether a

   criminal defendant may challenge a filing of a death penalty

   notice by suing the Attorney General and the United States

   Attorney.  Our position is that there is no basis in the law

   for such an end run around the criminal process.  Accordingly,

   we ask this Court to dismiss the civil complaint for lack of

   subject jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and also for

   failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil

   Procedure 12(b)(6).

            Prosecutorial discretion is fundamental not only to

   our system of criminal justice but also to the constitutional

   system of separated powers.  The Supreme Court in Wayte vs. 

   United States emphasized that a prosecutor's decision to charge

   a defendant is incapable and not proper subject of judicial

   review.  The Court in Wayte explained the systemic costs

   entailed by such review of prosecution decisions including

   delay of the criminal process and also chilling potentially law

   enforcement judgments.

            These same principles of prosecutorial discretion

   apply to a charging decision in a capital case.  McCleskey vs. 

   Kemp, 1987 decision of the Supreme Court, emphasized that a

   prosecutor must enjoy wide discretion in deciding whether or

   not to seek a sentence of death.

            Mr. Nichols nonetheless claims that the Administrative

   Procedure Act should be applied by this Court to justify review



                                                                           13



   of the substance and procedure of a charging decision in a

   criminal case.

            There is no support in the Administrative Procedure

   Act in the 50 years of its existence for such an unprecedented

   intrusion into prosecution discretion.  The Administrative

   Procedure Act, by its own terms, precludes judicial review of

   agency action committed by law to agency discretion.

            The classic instance of such discretion is, as the law

   makes clear, the decision whether or not and how strenuously to

   charge a criminal defendant.  There is nothing in the

   Constitution, in the federal statutes, or in the internal

   Department of Justice regulations that authorizes an exception

   to this well-established principle.

            First, as to the Constitution, contrary to

   Mr. Nichols' claims, the Eighth Amendment has never been

   construed as applying to a charging decision.  The Eighth

   Amendment by its own terms limits -- proscribes cruel and

   unusual punishment.  Punishment in a criminal case, the Supreme

   Court has made clear, can only be meted out by a sentencing

   authority -- that is, either a court or a jury -- in this case,

   both.

            Accordingly, in cases such as Gregg vs. Georgia and

   McCleskey vs. Kemp, the Court has emphasized that there is no

   basis for the Eighth Amendment authorizing review of a

   prosecutor's charging decision.



                                                                           14



            What the Constitution does preclude are charging

   decisions based on unconstitutional criteria, such as a

   defendant's race or a defendant's creed.  There is no

   suggestion in this case, nor could there be, that any such

   unconstitutional criteria affected the charging decision.

            Second, there is no basis in any federal statute for

   judicial review of a charging decision.  The federal Death

   Penalty Act of 1994, particularly Section 3593(a), allows for

   the filing of a death penalty notice whenever the attorney for

   the Government, quote, believes that a sentence of death would

   be justified.

            That is clearly discretionary language, and there is

   no basis for reviewing the procedures and substantive decisions

   underlying that filing of a notice.

            Clearly, the filing of a death penalty notice triggers

   procedural rights in a defendant.  And those rights we'll talk

   about, and those are rights that will govern the full conduct

   of this proceeding from here on out.  But there is nothing in

   the filing of a death penalty notice that requires that those

   procedures precede that filing.  On the contrary, the filing is

   totally unregulated and is something that is purely a matter of

   prosecution discretion.

            Specifically, there is no basis for Mr. Nichols' claim

   that this statute requires an on-the-record hearing with rights

   of cross-examination before the filing of notice can even be



                                                                           15



   filed.

            Nichols' claim, therefore, boils down to the argument

   that he is entitled to procedural rights and substantive rights

   as a result of the internal death penalty protocol promulgated

   in the U.S. Attorney's manual.  The U.S. Attorney's manual

   makes clear at the outset that nothing in it is intended to

   vest substantive or procedural rights in a criminal defendant.

   On the contrary, it's an internal process that's designed to

   regulate decision making within the Department of Justice and

   has been applied solely internally and has never been enforced

   by any court.

            In particular, the court in Walker vs. -- Walker and

   Diaz vs. Reno, the Northern District of New York, the most

   analogous challenge such as this -- Judge McAvoy in the

   Northern District of New York held that the death penalty

   protocol did not vest a defendant with any judicially

   enforceable right.

            That holding is fully consistent with the rulings in

   the Tenth Circuit in en banc cases such as Thompson and Fritz,

   in which the court denied defense attempts to enforce the

   provisions of the United States Attorney's manual, so-called

   Petite policy.

            As the Court is aware, the Petite policy is an

   internally developed procedure which limits internally the

   ability of the Department of Justice to file successive



                                                                           16



   prosecutions after a state prosecution has been concluded.

            Specifically, it requires authorization at high levels

   within the Department of Justice before a successive

   prosecution may be filed.  In Thompson and Fritz, it was

   conceded that the U.S. Attorney -- local U.S. Attorney's office

   did not comply with that procedure, and the question presented

   before the Tenth Circuit was whether or not that failure to

   follow the internal procedures is something that the court can

   step in and rectify.

            The Court in both Fritz and in Thompson held that the

   internal procedures of the U.S. Attorney's manuals are not

   enforceable by the criminal defendant as against the express

   wishes of the Attorney General.

            It is our position, your Honor, that those cases are

   controlling and they preclude reliance upon the internal

   procedures of the United States Attorney's manual.

            There is no case to the contrary, and in fact Walker

   relied heavily on that line of cases in holding that the death

   penalty protocol was not enforceable by a criminal defendant.

            For all those reasons, your Honor, we submit that the

   civil complaint should be dismissed and the sole remedies of

   the criminal defendants in this case should be determined

   according to the Criminal (sic) Rules of Criminal Procedure and

   the dictates of the Constitution as applied in the criminal

   case and that they should not be allowed to review the



                                                                           17



   underlying procedures and practices followed leading to the

   decision to file the death penalty notice.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            Mr. Tigar.

            MR. TIGAR:  May it please the Court, we are here

   because on the 20th of October, Mr. McVeigh's counsel and

   ourselves received identical word-for-word notices of intent to

   seek the death penalty as though there were not in the

   proceedings that had led to the issuance of those notices a

   line, a syllable, a phrase, a word, a concept that would have

   distinguished these two defendants one from another.

            That notice was issued to us after we were invited by

   Mr. Ryan -- defendant Ryan, to a conference in which he invited

   us to present evidence to him as to why he should not seek --

   or ask the defendant Reno to issue the notice.

            We went to a hearing.  The circumstances of that

   hearing are laid out in the motion to strike the death penalty

   notice in a criminal case.

            Government counsel has argued for their 12(b)(6)

   motion.  In a little while, they're going to stand up and argue

   that although there is no review in the civil case we have

   filed, that's all right because there isn't any review in a

   criminal case, either.

            At page 9 of their reply brief, to which we have not

   responded but do so in this argument, they say that



                                                                           18



   prosecutorial discretion, quote, "is not subject to judicial

   review."  That's the position that they have taken, and that's

   in both the civil and the criminal case.

            We find that strange, and I am here today to redeem

   the promise solemnly made by defendant Reno on the 17th of

   August, 1994.  In a letter to Congressman Fields, she said that

   there would be an appropriate mechanism for post-trial

   disclosure -- she did say post-trial -- of the department's

   capital prosecution decisions so that the public can review and

   understand the basis for such decisions.

            She promised promulgation of procedures to ensure that

   decisions to seek the death penalty are made in a uniform, fair

   and nondiscriminatory manner so that defendants who commit

   similar acts and who have similar degrees of culpability are

   treated similarly.

            That is what the Attorney General said the procedures

   to be established would amount to, and that is a far cry from

   what her minion tells us today is to occur.

            The Government's position here, your Honor, rests on

   four myths; and because we have briefed them, I'm only going to

   respond to them in the context of the reply brief.

            The first myth is the myth of non-review.  Throughout

   the history of the republic until 1994, it was not possible to

   hold a defendant to answer for a capital crime save by the

   intervention of a grand jury of citizens.



                                                                           19



            In 1994, the Congress purported to withdraw that power

   from the grand jury of citizens and vest it in a bureaucrat.

   We say that that is unconstitutional but at a bare minimum, the

   capital decision -- that is, the decision without which there

   cannot be a death penalty hearing -- should be subject to

   judicial review.

            The Government says no, this is a prosecutorial

   discretion decision; and yet, your Honor, the case law simply

   doesn't support them.  In Marshall vs. Jerrico, which is a

   leading case on prosecutorial discretion, Justice Marshall

   couples his assertion about prosecutorial discretion by citing

   cases in which judicial review is available.

            The first case he cites, your Honor -- the first case

   is Berger vs. United States, Justice Sutherland's magisterial

   language reminding government lawyers that they are not the

   representatives of ordinary parties but rather of a sovereign

   whose right to govern is conditioned upon its observance of its

   obligations to govern fairly.  That bespeaks judicial review,

   says Justice Marshall.

            Similarly in Wayte, the court acknowledges that of

   cases.  In McCleskey in footnote 17, while broad gauge policies

   are not subject to review, specific distinctions are.  And yet,

   the Government wants not only to dismiss the civil suit but to

   block all inquiry into the means by which the decisions are

   made.  How in the world can we tell whether we fall within that



                                                                           20



   classification in which judicial review is available unless

   some minimal inquiry is made as to the basis of the decision, a

   minimal inquiry promised to us by the Attorney General of the

   United States?

            Yet, as we found when we went at each stage of the

   process, it was -- it was like talking to a wall.  We present

   our evidence and nothing came back at us to which we could

   answer.

            THE COURT:  Now, one of the things you asked for in

   this civil case was some discovery.

            MR. TIGAR:  Some limited -- yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I stated that pending the determination of

   this motion.

            MR. TIGAR:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Tell me what it is you expect to discover.

            MR. TIGAR:  We would want, your Honor, Mr. Ryan's

   recommendation to the Attorney General and evidence upon 
which

   it was based.  If that recommendation has in it such things as

   tactics about the prosecution or whatever, that is things that

   are traditional prosecutorial discretion, they can be redacted

   out.  Then we want the evidence upon which that three-person

   committee in the Department of Justice based their

   recommendation to the Attorney General in reviewing Mr. Ryan's

   decision.

            As I said at the argument, it really falls into two



                                                                           21



   categories:  What was there mitigating and what was there

   aggravating, as to both of which categories disclosure is

   already made.

            THE COURT:  Now, let me back up a moment.  The statute

   that requires a notice in the death penalty act, which is now

   at Section 3593 --

            MR. TIGAR:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  -- does say notice by the Government if

   the attorney for the Government believes that the circumstances

   of the offense are such that a sentence of death is justified,

   the attorney shall in reasonable time before trial file with

   the Court and serve on the defendant the notice.

            None of this protocol that has been established by the

   Attorney General is required by statute.  There is no dispute

   about that; right?  I mean, the Congress did not mandate to the

   Attorney General that a protocol be established for this

   decision to file the notice.

            MR. TIGAR:  No, your Honor.  I do not agree with your

   Honor's position.

            THE COURT:  Tell me why, then.

            MR. TIGAR:  First, the statute does not unequivocally

   commit to agency discretion; that is, it says there shall be a

   notice.  The Supreme Court has over and over again held that

   when a bureaucrat is vested with important power over the life,

   liberty or property of persons, Congress is presumed to



                                                                           22



   legislate in the tradition of our adversary system.  In Green 

   vs. McElroy, Chief Justice Warren said that the right of

   confrontation is to be inferred.  In a case --

            THE COURT:  Well, but let's just for the moment stay

   with the language of the statute.  If there is infirmity in it,

   that's a second issue; but the language of the statute as I

   read it simply requires that this notice be submitted by the

   attorney for the Government, which in normal circumstances is

   the United States Attorney in the district in which the

   indictment has been submitted.

            MR. TIGAR:  That's true.  The key statutory words are

   "attorney for the Government" and "believes."  Janet Reno, in

   explaining what those words are going to mean to her, said

   "attorney for the Government" means me and "believes" mean --

   "belief" isn't some matter of faith; that is to say, it is a

   belief to be formed based upon a procedure that I intend to

   enshrine in rules and policies within the Department of

   Justice.

            THE COURT:  Well, let me put it a different way,

   though?  As the legislation was enacted, it would permit, by my

   reading of the language, Mr. Ryan in this case to have filed

   this notice without following any protocol.  I'm not talking

   about what the Attorney General in her power to run the

   Department of Justice has directed.

            Assume that there had been no regulation or ruling or



                                                                           23



   whatever by the Attorney General to do this.  Is there any

   violation of the statutory language itself if Mr. Ryan had

   simply filed the notice?

            MR. TIGAR:  Absolutely, your Honor.

            And I wasn't talking about infirmity of the statute.

   For example, in Kemp vs. Dulles, the secretary of state said I

   can take away Rockwell Kemp's passport on any ground I want

   because the statute doesn't mandate any particular procedures

   or standards.  And the Supreme Court said, You can't read the

   statute that way, Secretary Dulles.  You have to read the

   statute as commanding you to follow procedures that are fair.

            In Gutknecht against United States, General Hershey

   argued to the Supreme Court, Look, the local draft board can

   jerk a defendant's draft card, accelerate him for induction and

   send him to Vietnam, and I don't have to follow any procedures

   about that.

            Justice Douglas said for a unanimous court, General

   Hershey, we don't read the statute that way.  Granted, on its

   face it gives you plenary power; but the interests at stake are

   so important, we have to read that grant of power conformably

   to our tradition of fairness.  And the court said that at a

   time when raising an Army to send to Vietnam was a major

   national concern.  Not one justice dissented.

            THE COURT:  So you're saying I must read these things

   into this language.



                                                                           24



            MR. TIGAR:  That's what the Supreme Court has said,

   your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Now, I note here that the statute also

   talks about the circumstances of the offense and says nothing

   whatever about the defendant.  It does, of course, in terms of

   the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and what

   transpires at a sentencing hearing subsequent to a conviction;

   but with respect to the notice itself, I do not see in the

   statute that the attorney for the Government must take into

   consideration anything other than the circumstances of the

   offense.

            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  We have in our motion

   pointed to that language and said that that is a constitutional

   infirmity because the reasoned moral response called for by the

   Supreme Court deals both with the circumstances of the offense

   and the personal culpability of the offender.

            THE COURT:  But that comes in the hearing before the

   jury.

            MR. TIGAR:  It certainly comes in the hearing before a

   jury, your Honor; however, it -- for example, if a prosecutor

   were to single out a defendant for prosecution because of the

   defendant's race, that would clearly be something that was

   wrong and subject to judicial review, and I don't think the

   Government would disagree with that.

            THE COURT:  Mr. Connelly agreed with that; but that's



                                                                           25



   not raised here, is it?

            MR. TIGAR:  There is not a race issue here.  The

   problem is since we can't find out the basis upon which the

   decision was made, we can't go any further.

            THE COURT:  Well, are you raising any issue about some

   invidious animus or some classification of the defendants here

   that motivated the notice?

            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, at this point, what we know is

   that the Attorney General of the United States had said that

   she was going to grant the right to seek the death penalty

   before any decision is made.  We know that Mr. Hartzler, who we

   did not sue but we put it in our notice, was quoted in a

   national magazine as saying, "We knew these defendants were

   going to hell, he wanted to help them get there quicker."  And

   we know that he did attend the session at which Mr. Ryan gave

   us our hearing and talked a lot, as the transcript will reveal.

   That much, we know.  The rest, we would seek to have revealed

   by discovery.  It's not in the realm of reasonable inference

   that the political views attributed to these defendants would

   have played a role.

            Your Honor, in the search warrant returned out of

   Mr. Nichols' house, his library was characterized by the

   Government as containing antigovernment literature.  And that

   was a basis -- one of the bases upon which Judge Russell denied

   him bail was that he had antigovernment views.



                                                                           26



            Well, I have a few myself, your Honor, and I'm still

   walking around; so it's not beyond the realm of possibility

   that reason -- reasonable possibility that discovery will

   reveal that.

            Our point, your Honor, is that Attorney General Reno

   said that similar degrees of culpability would be considered.

   She did think the statute authorized her, indeed required her

   to consider these personal characteristics even though the

   statute didn't seem to say so.

            THE COURT:  Now, you mentioned the grand jury earlier,

   and I'm not sure what your position is about the grand jury.

   Are you taking a position that the grand jury has a

   constitutional role to play in determining whether the

   defendants should be exposed to the possibility of a death

   penalty?

            MR. TIGAR:  Absolutely, your Honor.  In 1790 -- under

   the Crimes Act of 1790 which gives us what was embodied in 18

   United States Code Section 34 prior to the 1994 amendment, a

   defendant indicted for a capital crime, say murder in a dock

   yard, which was one of the 1790 crimes, would be indicted by

   the grand jury for that capital offense.  The jury -- the trial

   jury would then consider the case; and unless it qualified its

   verdict, the defendant was to be sentenced to death.  And that

   procedure is referred to in that 1948 Supreme Court opinion we

   talk about.



                                                                           27



            So until 199 -- until Furman, really, which

   invalidated the procedure, you couldn't be held to answer for a

   capital crime unless the grand jury decided; and once you were

   indicted for that capital crime, then the petit jury considered

   your culpability.

            In 1994, the Congress just changed that.  They said

   we'll indict you for the predicate offense.  That's it.  The

   predicate offense.  You cannot be made eligible for the death

   penalty unless this notice is issued by the attorney for the

   Government, so that they bifurcated the capital sentencing

   liability decision into two parts.

            Now, that, we say, violates the indictment clause.

   And over and over again in the transcript of this case, I would

   stand up and say, This is not a capital case.  And Judge

   Russell agreed with me at the bail hearing.  No, it's not a

   capital case.  No notice yet.  At the arraignment:  This is not

   a capital case, it's only a possible punishment, haven't issued

   the notice yet.

            It's that division that raises this problem, and

   that's particularly so given what the Supreme Court has said

   and what Rule 7 says; that is, in a capital case, an indictment

   is not waiveable; so yes, your Honor, we briefed that quite

   extensively.  I know it has this patina of the historical

   function of the grand jury which we recognize today given

   prosecutorial discretion is maybe different than it was;



                                                                           28



   it's -- the Supreme Court has over and over again insisted on

   it.

            So yes, your Honor, that's a part of our history.

            Very briefly, this myth of absolute discretion we've

   talked about:  The Government cites the Petite policy case.  We

   know the Supreme Court has said that prosecutors possess an

   unreviewable discretion to prosecute by successive sovereigns.

   A procedure established to regulate an unreviewable discretion

   should itself be unreviewable.

            Should the Attorney General have instituted a

   procedure of using the Petite policy only to go over after

   white defendants in civil rights cases, that surely would be

   subject to judicial review, regardless of the regulations.

            The point is that the fact that some regulations may

   have some unreviewable part doesn't affect our issue, which has

   to do with the very most basic element of administrative

   fairness; that is to say, the reliable decision maker.

            We get our idea of administrative fairness as the

   Supreme Court has often reminded us from Dr. Bonham's case

   decided in 1610 by Lord Cook, and that was an administrative

   proceeding involving the College of Surgeons.

            In sum, your Honor, this notion of unreviewability has

   some surface appeal.  There are two things that made Thomas

   Jefferson angry in his term of president, were decisions by

   Chief Justice Marshall, both of which said that the actions of



                                                                           29



   the executive branch were reviewable if you had a proper

   statute.  The first one was to say why didn't you give Marbury

   his commission; and I wish I had jurisdiction to tell you, but

   that's -- but I don't, but you need to do it in the trial

   court.  And the second was in the Burr case, when he said you

   could get those papers involved in that criminal case.

            This tradition of review is deeply imbedded, your

   Honor, and it really is a matter of indifference to us -- I say

   this -- it is a matter of indifference to us whether the Court

   holds it's available in the civil context or the criminal.  We

   filed the civil case, and we've cited all of those cases about

   federal jurisdiction.  And I won't tax the Court's patience by

   going over what's in our briefs.

            We will pursue the civil case regardless of outcome

   because we don't want to be caught somewhere down the road

   saying you chose the wrong avenue.

            But with respect, your Honor, it's like Elizabeth

   Taylor said to Kim Novak in the movie, "The only two things I

   don't like about you, dear, are your face."

            THE COURT:  What movie was that?

            MR. TIGAR:  That was "The Mirror Cracked," your Honor.

            The point is I don't think it's right for the

   Government to come in and say to us, No review on the civil

   side, your Honor; but be not afraid, there is no review on the

   criminal side, either.



                                                                           30



            We believe this decision should be subject to review

   because it was taken in a fundamentally unfair manner.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Staying with the civil side

   for the moment, Mr. Connelly, do you have some rejoinder?

            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.  Just three points.

   First, the myth of non-review is far from a myth.  It's a

   history of judicial tradition.  There is no case that Mr. Tigar

   can cite in the 50 years since the Administrative Procedure Act

   was passed in 1946 in which a court has applied that law to

   review the substance or procedure of a prosecution decision.

            THE COURT:  Now, I take it your answers are different

   to the questions that I put to Mr. Tigar regarding the language

   of this statute and on the question of whether it would be

   consistent with the statute for the Attorney General never to

   have issued this protocol and simply permitted the United

   States Attorney in the Western District of Oklahoma, here,

   Mr. Ryan, to exercise his own discretion.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely.  I think you have to apply

   the statute as it's written.  And the statute, as the Court

   pointed out, says a notice can be filed whenever the attorney

   for the Government believes that the circumstances of the

   defense -- and I think is also key language the Court has

   seized -- doesn't require any consideration of mitigating

   circumstances.  And I think that's a key point.  Mitigating

   circumstances and all the evidence pro and con in support of



                                                                           31



   the death penalty are matters to be litigated at the second

   stage of the bifurcated trial in this case.

            THE COURT:  And the attorney for the Government would

   normally be the United States Attorney in the particular

   district in which the indictment was returned.

            MR. CONNELLY:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And

   it's important, I think, and I think the key point or one of

   the key points dividing the parties in this case is the notion

   that this filing of a notice somehow takes action against the

   defendant and causes him to be deprived of life or liberty.

            On the contrary, this is just the first step of a

   proceeding leading to a capital punishment proceeding; and this

   notice by itself is not an adjudication, it's not a case of the

   Attorney General acting in a judicial fashion.  The Attorney

   General is the nation's chief law enforcement officer, and she

   has decided that she wants to begin the process leading to the

   imposition of a death sentence.

            That process is regulated by the Court.  Obviously the

   Court's impartiality is beyond reproach.  Obviously the Court

   has to empanel a fair and impartial jury.  All these steps are

   taken to insure that the ultimate process is fair and that the

   result is fair and unimpeachable.

            THE COURT:  So my understanding is this -- and I want

   to make sure that it's not a misunderstanding of the

   Government's position -- is that what the Attorney General did



                                                                           32



   here in the exercise of her supervisory authority over the

   Department of Justice was to require the United States

   Attorneys in the districts in which the matter comes up to go

   through a procedure which would involve ultimately her approval

   or disapproval of seeking the death penalty pursuant to this

   notice.

            MR. CONNELLY:  The Attorney General has centralized

   the decision-making process so that she is personally

   responsible for authorizing every death penalty notice filed in

   the United States District Court throughout the country.

            THE COURT:  And if her procedures are not followed in

   a given case, that is not a matter in which the Court may

   intervene.

            MR. CONNELLY:  That is right.  Our position is the

   United States Attorney manual where these procedures are

   promulgated is not judicially enforceable.

            THE COURT:  In the same fashion as you argue and as

   the Court found in the Walker case as other policies like the

   Petite policy.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Right.  And I think the Walker case was

   based on en banc distinctions of the Tenth Circuit and other

   courts in the Petite cases.  I think the label doesn't matter.

   If it's in the U.S. Attorney's manual, it's promulgated to

   regulate internal decision making and it's not judicially

   enforceable.  The Court can certainly enforce the Constitution



                                                                           33



   if there was any prima facie showing made of any

   unconstitutional criteria being used.  And that I think goes --

   again, the example consistently used is race.

            We would agree if there were any prima facie showing

   made that this decision was based on race, it's a decision that

   the Court would be obligated to enforce and set aside under the

   Constitution.

            But McCleskey makes clear that you cannot just get

   discovery and say, Let me see what happened out there to see if

   anything unconstitutional happened.  Its clear threshold

   showing has to be made to get discovery and to proceed further

   and to ask the Court to look beyond and exercise discretion.

            THE COURT:  What Mr. Tigar has said to that is that he

   suspects that because anti-Government views may have been

   expressed, political views by the defendants, that that was a

   factor; and he doesn't know that if you don't give him the

   discovery that he requested.  What's your response to that?

            MR. CONNELLY:  That's really the same claim.  A

   stronger claim was made in McCleskey where the defendant said,

   I suspect that race is affecting the process throughout the

   entire state of Georgia and I have statistics to show that.

            The court said, That's not sufficient showing to

   require a look beyond the exercise of prosecution discretion.

   The court -- the defendant has the burden of making a clear and

   indisputable threshold showing, prima facie showing of an



                                                                           34



   unconstitutional condition.

            THE COURT:  Well, how might that showing be made in

   the absence of getting information from the Justice Department

   as to what was involved?

            MR. CONNELLY:  It's not often going to be made, your

   Honor; and that is exactly why courts don't often look beyond

   the -- the decision making.  In the Batson case, for example,

   the court restricted peremptory challenges and said it cannot

   be based on race but still it has to be a prima facie showing.

   It doesn't have to be a explanation made unless the defendant

   shows statistically or otherwise that there is some reason for

   the court to infer that the decision is being based on race.

            THE COURT:  But the way in which we've implemented

   that ruling is, you know, when that comes up and a person of a

   different race is removed, different from the defendant, and

   there is a challenge to that, we normally ask whoever made the

   peremptory challenge to explain it --

            MR. CONNELLY:  And --

            THE COURT:  -- on nondiscriminatory ground.

            MR. CONNELLY:  That in effect has happened here by the

   filing of a notice.  The notice explains the specific mental

   state that the Attorney General believes exists, explains the

   specific aggravating factors that the Attorney General believes

   justify the imposition of the death penalty.

            THE COURT:  So we take the notice at face value, is



                                                                           35



   what you're saying.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Unless there is some evidence to show

   that it is not other than what it purports to be.  And in fact,

   there is a clear threshold showing that in fact it's being made

   for reasons other than the fact that all the circumstances --

   aggravating circumstances described in that notice.  That

   notice must be presumed valid on its face.

            There is nothing in the Constitution or in the statute

   that allows the Court to look beyond it unless there is some

   showing made that it was based on an unconstitutional criteria

   such as race, and there is no such showing made in this case;

   and therefore the challenge should be rejected and the civil

   case dismissed.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. CONNELLY:  On the grand jury clause is the

   argument that the grand jury has to vote to, in effect, return

   a capital punishment.  Prior to 1976, many state statutes

   provided for mandatory capital punishment upon a conviction of

   a certain felony.  That's the common law rule if you go back to

   1790.  Conviction of a first-degree murder offense led

   automatically to the death penalty, no questions asked.

            In 1976, the Supreme Court, in Woodson vs. North 

   Carolina and other cases, said that the mandatory death penalty

   is unconstitutional; that it cannot be -- it cannot be based

   solely on the grand jury's finding and a petit jury's



                                                                           36



   conviction; that the petit jury has to then be allowed to

   consider various mitigating factors and all the circumstances

   of the defendant's background and also the circumstances of the

   crime.

            Precisely because the mandatory death penalty statutes

   are unconstitutional cannot be the law that the grand jury has

   to vote on the aggravating factors that justify not only

   conviction of the offense but also the sentence of death.

            It's clear in the Cabana vs. Bullock case, clear in

   Walton vs. Arizona, many other cases that aggravating

   circumstances are not elements in the offense that need to be

   found by the trial jury.  We would submit it's equally clear

   that they are not the circumstances of the offense that need be

   voted on by the grand jury.

            Thank you.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, one of the aspects of

   this matter includes the adequacy of the remedy in the criminal

   proceedings, so I'll reserve on the motion to dismiss and go to

   the motions that have been filed in the criminal proceeding and

   your argument on those.

            Now, both defendants, both Mr. Jones and Mr. Tigar in

   representing their clients, filed motions to strike and

   Mr. Jones also a motion to disqualify the Attorney General.

            I don't know if the two of you discussed the order in

   which you might want to proceed.  Have you?



                                                                           37



            MR. BURR:  Yes, your Honor.  Mr. Jones will respond to

   the issues around the motion to disqualify, and then I'll pick

   up on the motion to strike.

            THE COURT:  Well, I mean as between defendants.

            MR. BURR:  And the agreement with Mr. Tigar was that

   we would take the lead on the motion to strike.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Good.

            All right.  Mr. Jones.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor.

            May it please the Court, the issue this morning is as

   old as the Magna Carta and as recent as the Crimes Act of 1994,

   for the issue before the Court is whether the Government can

   take an action against its citizens except in accordance with

   its own rules and regulations and laws.

            Because the background of this case involves the death

   of 168 individuals and the penalty sought by the Government is

   death itself, then the most awesome questions of consideration

   are before the Court.

            Our position -- and we adopt the arguments made

   insofar as they apply to the motion in the criminal case, the

   motions and arguments made in the civil case by Mr. Tigar and

   also the arguments made in his brief in this case -- is simply

   this: that the Attorney General herself violated her own rules

   and regulations that she established, which she told the

   Congress of the United States that she would establish, and the



                                                                           38



   Congress in partial reliance upon her representation that she

   would create a system that would seek to minimize and avoid

   race as a factor in seeking the death penalty.  And so

   therefore, these procedures do, in fact, have some sort of

   constitutional underpinning because of the history that led to

   them; that in this particular case, those procedures that she

   established and solemnly represented that she would establish

   were violated.

            I believe that it is not questioned by any party to

   this case that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution

   precludes a categorical prejudgment of the death penalty.  And

   that is precisely what happened in this case.

            The factual basis for the motion that we have filed,

   which is not challenged by the Government, is contained

   beginning on page 5 of our motion in which the Attorney General

   herself states in response to a question at a press conference,

   "18 U.S.C. Section 844 relates to those who maliciously damage

   or destroy a federal building.  If there is death, if death

   occurs, the death penalty is available, and we will seek it.  "

            Her statement made on that press conference is

   probably, along with the so-called "Perry courthouse walkout,"

   the most frequently played film clip of any matter relating to

   the criminal investigation of this case.  She made that

   statement on April 19, a full 48 hours before our client was

   arrested.



                                                                           39



            So on that date, she made that categorical prejudgment

   that the Government would seek the death penalty and deny this

   defendant the individualized consideration as a unique human

   being of whether the death penalty was appropriate.  And that,

   we submit, is the teaching of Gregg vs. Georgia.

            Then to continue the factual analogy or the factual

   record, on April 21, shortly after our client was detained, the

   President of the United States, the chief law enforcement

   officer, said, "as I said on Wednesday, justice for these

   killers --" which can only be made as a reference to our

   client "-- will be certain, swift and severe.  We will find

   them, we will convict them, and we will seek the death penalty

   for them."

            And then if there was any question that this was what

   was contemplated, that doubt was removed at the proceedings

   before Magistrate Howland at Tinker Air Force Base, when our

   client made his initial appearance and Ms. Arlene Joplin, the

   Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the criminal

   division, made her announcement which Magistrate Howland

   formalized in the order entered April 26 in which he said, "The

   Assistant United States Attorney Arlene Joplin stated at this

   hearing that the United States Attorney would seek the death

   penalty as prescribed in the charge 18 United States Code

   Section 844(f)."

            So there is no factual dispute there:  They prejudged



                                                                           40



   this matter; nor is there any factual dispute that these rules

   and regulations were in effect at the time that they did this,

   nor is there any dispute that the most important and operative

   word in those regulations is the word "before."  Before any

   death penalty is to be sought, these procedures must be

   followed.  And the second most important word is "in all

   cases."

            Now, unlike the so-called Lucas amendment, which

   purports to create a right for some sort of signal that can be

   relayed in certain cases where there is a change of venue and

   we've carved out an exception, there is no exception.  It

   doesn't say these rules apply except in all cases where federal

   employees are killed or in all cases where there is more than

   ten people that are killed.  It says it applies in all.

            And the Government comes into the court and basically

   takes two positions.  First they say, Well, we went ahead and

   followed the procedures.

            Well, with all due respect to Mr. Ryan and with the

   others in the Department of Justice, he was appointed by the

   President and confirmed by the Senate, and presumably the

   Attorney General had a role in his appointment.  I cannot

   imagine otherwise.

            Mr. Ryan serves at the pleasure of the President and

   upon, undoubtedly, the recommendation of the Attorney General.

   And it simply stretches credulity to the breaking point to



                                                                           41



   believe that in this case his judgment was independent and not

   influenced in any respect by the press public announcement seen

   by millions of people as to what the President and the Attorney

   General in effect said was going to happen.

            Then the Government says, after saying, well, we went

   ahead and went through the procedures anyway, which we have

   characterized as a charade -- they say, Well, okay.  And maybe

   just for sake of argument, conceding that the Attorney General

   made this announcement and made this decision and it looks like

   she prejudged it, you can't review it.  So it's immune from

   anything that you do.  And in that respect, I buy the

   argument -- and offer it again for the Court's consumption --

   that Mr. Tigar made that that simply is not true; that that is

   a myth.

            And it is a myth in this case because all one needs to

   do is to review those decisions of the United States Supreme

   Court in Accardi and Service -- and Mr. Tigar mentioned the

   Rockwell Kemp case -- and the others cited in our brief to

   say -- and it may seem and appear to be a vain and futile thing

   in this case, but I don't really think it is -- if the Supreme

   Court has ruled -- and it has -- that before an alien can be

   deported, that before a passport can be revoked, before a

   foreign service officer can be terminated, that before you can

   revoke a draft deferment, you must follow your own established

   procedures, and if you don't have established procedures, there



                                                                           42



   are certain minimum due process requirements that you must

   follow, how much stronger is the argument that where you are

   seeking to decide who lives and who dies, that you must not

   follow it?  It is incredulous to believe that John Service,

   Mr. Accardi, Mr. Shaugnessy, and Mr. Kemp had greater rights

   than a person facing the death penalty.  It simply is not so.

            I don't want to belabor the point here.  The Court has

   read the briefs.  Everything that we have seen of your Honor

   indicates that you study these matters carefully, you do

   independent reading; and I don't want to rehash what we have

   already said.

            But in full representation of my client, I would like

   to conclude on this point:  Today is May 1.  It is Law Day.  It

   may seem to be in the circumstances of this case with so much

   loss and so much tragedy that it is vain and futile for us to

   hope that the Court will rule that an attorney general who

   violates her own guidelines can be disqualified; but because

   today is Law Day, we think there is no better occasion for this

   court to reaffirm that minimal requirement of due process; that

   the Government cannot simply ignore its own rules when deciding

   who lives and dies.

            For that reason, we ask the Court to sustain the

   motion, to disqualify the Attorney General, to preclude the

   Government from seeking the death penalty until it promulgates

   a rule and regulation that will circumvent the Typhoid Mary --



                                                                           43



   if I may use that expression -- that has infected this process

   by the categorical prejudgment of the appropriateness of the

   death penalty that the Attorney General made without that

   individualized consideration that Gregg vs. Georgia requires.

            THE COURT:  Suppose the motion to disqualify were to

   be granted and the motion -- and the motion to strike the

   existing notice be granted.  What happens then?  What procedure

   would be followed to make this preliminary determination of

   whether to seek the death penalty in this case?

            MR. JONES:  Is your Honor -- may I assume for

   purposes -- and I think it's the assumption you intend me to

   take -- that it's being struck on none of the substantive

   grounds?

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Yes.  We've got still issues here

   about the notice itself.  And we'll get to that.  We're sort of

   in sort of procedural regularity here first dealing with

   whether there is an infirmity in the process itself as compared

   with the notice, which -- that's been attacked, as well.

            But, you know, here we don't have -- in other areas

   like the special counsel proceedings, if the Attorney General

   is removed from this and this court says start over again, who

   does it?

            MR. JONES:  The suggestion made by Mr. Tigar was, I

   believe, if I recall correctly, that the Solicitor General,

   Mr. Drew Days, make that decision on the theory that he is a



                                                                           44



   sort of quasi-judicial officer.  Although he serves in the

   Department of Justice, he has, as all practicing lawyers in

   this room know, quasi-judicial responsibilities.  And, in fact,

   there is a book which has been published entitled The Tenth 

   Justice, referring to the office of Solicitor General.

            I think that would probably be a satisfactory solution

   for us.

            Otherwise, I think that the Court would simply have to

   craft or draft its own proposal.  That's no different than the

   circumstances involving the investigation of President Nixon

   when the Attorney General Elliott Richardson, using his

   inherent powers, appointed a special prosecutor, initially

   Archibald Cox.  Now, recognizing that was the Attorney General,

   but in that case I would point out to the Court and I'm sure

   the Court recalls it that when Mr. Richardson appeared before

   the senate, his confirmation was held hostage until he

   appointed a special prosecutor.

            I suspect that in this case, the death penalty statute

   was held hostage until the Attorney General promised to do the

   things that she did but didn't follow with respect to this

   case; so I would say that the Court or the Solicitor General

   should design the procedure to follow, to determine who that

   neutral officer should be.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor.



                                                                           45



            THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar, I'll hear from you again.

            I'm attempting to separate the procedure that resulted

   in this notice from infirmities that are suggested in the

   notice itself.

            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.

            Very, very briefly, of course, the issuance of the

   death penalty notice makes a huge difference.  Your Honor

   referred in your venue opinion to "death is different."  Well,

   that difference wouldn't have existed had there been no notice.

   The bail status of the defendant changes instantly once the

   notice is issued.  The death qualified jury is mandated once

   the notice is issued, so it makes a difference.

            Of course, the prosecutor is right in saying that the

   states in the wake of Furman and Woodson have devised a 
number

   of procedures about allocating responsibilities.  Under Hurtado 

   vs. California, the states don't have an indictment clause.

   They're not required to have grand juries.  There are limits

   within which federal prosecutorial discretion may be exercised

   under the Bill of Rights; and the Fifth and Sixth Amendment

   grand jury and jury trial requirements make those limits very,

   very different than in the system of state administration of

   the death penalty.

            Now, we point that out in our papers.

            Now, to come to this question of striking the notice,

   if the notice is stricken, it can be done over; and yes, we



                                                                           46



   have suggested that the solicitor general of the United States

   is an appropriate person.  He would have to ask himself, am I

   the appropriate person?  Do I indeed possess the independence

   required by the due process clause?

            But the Court may recall that that historic

   independence of the Solicitor General -- for instance, in

   Peters vs. Hobby, Solicitor General Sobeloff refused to argue

   for the United States, and an Assistant Attorney General named

   Warren Berger took that job.  And he was rewarded by a judicial

   appointment thereafter by then President, earlier Vice

   President, Nixon, who wanted the job done.

            In Gutknecht vs. United States, which was a case -- my

   first argument in the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Griswold

   refused to sign the government's brief mandating that tradition

   of independence.  So Attorney General Mitchell signed it and

   sent Mr. Ruckelshaus to argue.

            It was in that tradition of the Solicitor General of

   the United States that we have suggested that the matter would

   be referred to Mr. Days for his decision.

            Now, if we start back with the recommendation process,

   we've also complained about Mr. Ryan's role; but a substitute

   person could be found.  We felt that it was inappropriate for

   him, in part, because of the effect on the Oklahoma City

   prosecutors and the people who work with them on a regular

   basis -- it was inappropriate to put him in the decisional



                                                                           47



   process.

            So we don't regard these as insurmountable

   difficulties.  We haven't posed the Court the insoluble dilemma

   that no death penalty notice could ever be issued.  We just

   want it to be fairly done.

            I've spoken to all the other issues the Court has

   raised, I think.

            THE COURT:  Well, if I were to say, All right,

   Solicitor General, take over this function, if the Solicitor

   General were to determine to get a recommendation from

   Mr. Ryan, would that -- would I have to intervene and say, No,

   you can't do that; you have to have a local Special Assistant

   Attorney General -- Special Assistant United States Attorney,

   or something?

            MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor were to strike the notice in

   the criminal case, your Honor would have to determine whether

   Mr. Ryan was an appropriate person or whether some other person

   is suitable.

            If your Honor determined to leave that decision in the

   first instance to Mr. Days, given all the evidence, it would be

   a temerarious man, as Justice Frankfurter used to say, who

   would ask Mr. Ryan to do it again.

            If your Honor did it in the civil case, as the judge

   said in Walker and Diaz vs. Reno, if there were an allegation

   that the procedures weren't being followed, I'd have a



                                                                           48



   different view of it.  Then again, your Honor has a choice -- a

   choice of remedies.  You'd have to have some discovery and

   cross-motions for summary judgment, which wouldn't take very

   long.  But the decision as to the form of the order would be up

   to your Honor.

            I think knowing Mr. Days, if your Honor said, You do

   it because I take the point that Ms. Reno is disqualified for

   the following reasons, he'd get the message and that Mr. Ryan

   would not be part of the decisional change upon which he would

   rely.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.

            Mr. Connelly, are you going to respond on this?

            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.  I think the point

   again comes down to the fact that the Eighth Amendment does not

   apply to charging decisions.  The defendants are entitled to

   individualized consideration of all the circumstances of the

   offense, all the aggravating circumstances, all the mitigating

   circumstances that they might offer as way of background; but

   that decision does not happen and does not precede the filing

   of a death penalty notice.  The death penalty notice is a

   triggering event that brings about all those procedural

   protections and all those rights upon the defense.

            So I think it's unfair and inept to analogize this

   case to a deportation case, to a passport case, to another type

   of case where the agency is actually the one taking action



                                                                           49



   again the people in an adjudicatory capacity.

            Attorney General Reno is not an adjudicator in this

   case.  She is not a quasi-judicial officer.  She is the

   nation's chief law enforcement officer.  And on April 19 when

   this nation was confronted with the worst peacetime crime in

   its history and the Attorney General said, We will prosecute

   this case to the fullest extent of the law and that the death

   penalty is available and we will seek it, the Attorney General

   was not acting as a judge.  She was acting as a law enforcement

   officer.  And there is nothing in the law and no case, no

   principle that these defendants can cite that that is

   inappropriate and that she is not allowed as the nation's chief

   law enforcement officer to aggressively and zealously enforce

   the law.

            That's exactly what the Supreme Court has held in

   Jerrico, in emphasizing that a prosecutor is not a judge, a

   prosecutor can be zealous in his or her enforcement of the law;

   and there is nothing in the constitution or in any statute that

   makes that an improper exercise of the Attorney General's

   unreviewable discretion.

            THE COURT:  Now, indulge me in a what-if here: that if

   I were to grant the motion to strike and the motion to

   disqualify, suggestion has been made for the Court to direct

   the Solicitor General to again proceed, as it were, from a

   fresh start.  What's your position on that?



                                                                           50



            MR. CONNELLY:  I think all the what-if questions

   underline and highlight the very reason why this Court cannot

   get involved in second-guessing prosecutorial discretion.

   There is no basis for this Court to hold that the Attorney

   General -- that the authority charged by the law with making

   this decision is rendered unfit and incapable of making a

   decision.  And precisely because there is no authority for

   that, there is no authority provided and no procedure provided

   for what happens in the event that the Court determines that

   the Attorney General should not act.

            Under the Department of Justice regulations, the

   person next in charge is the deputy Attorney General, and there

   is no basis for this Court to get involved in deciding exactly

   who within the Department of Justice should make the decision.

   The statute, as the Court has pointed out, says the attorney

   for the government.  What attorney that is and in what capacity

   that's done is a matter regulated internally by the Department

   of Justice.

            And the procedure has been that Mr. Ryan, the United

   States Attorney, has to make a recommendation and has to go

   through a capital review committee appointed by the Attorney

   General, and that committee makes a recommendation and the

   Attorney General acts on that recommendation.

            THE COURT:  I can't remember whether the incumbent

   Deputy Attorney General, Ms. Gorelick, was in office -- in that



                                                                           51



   office on April 19, 1995.  Was she?

            MR. CONNELLY:  She was.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. CONNELLY:  But precisely for that reason, there is

   no basis for this Court getting involved in the internal

   decision-making process of the United States Department of

   Justice.  The Court's responsibilities are important and

   critical, and that is to make sure that the notice filed by the

   United States in this case satisfies all procedural and

   substantive requirements of the law and satisfies all

   constitutional requirements; and those issues are fully being

   litigated and will be litigated today and throughout the course

   of this case.

            But there is no basis for this Court to get involved

   in the internal decision-making process that underlies that

   notice.  And we would, therefore, submit that this Court should

   deny -- dismiss the civil case and also reject any motions in

   the criminal case that seek to have this Court substitute its

   judgment and its procedures for the procedures that the

   Attorney General properly promulgated and properly followed in

   this case.

            THE COURT:  All right.  What I intend here is that

   we'll take a recess at this time and we'll come back to deal

   with the motions that address not on a procedural ground but on

   the more substantive grounds the existing notice.



                                                                           52



            I think we seem to be having adequate time here; and

   given the numbers of persons here, I think we'll recess for a

   little longer than usual and have a 25-minute recess and then

   come back and address -- it seems to me we'll have plenty of

   time to complete and meet the schedule that I suggested to

   Mr. Kelley for the 1:30 hearing.

            So we'll take a 25-minute recess.

       (Recess at 10:15 a.m.)

       (Reconvened at 10:40 a.m.)

            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.

            All right.  I'll hear argument now on, I suppose, the

   substance of the notice; and Mr. Burr, you're going to argue

   that?

            MR. BURR:  Yes, your Honor.  Richard Burr for

   defendant Mr. McVeigh.

            Your Honor, just -- I'd like to take a couple of

   minutes just to sketch out some of the overarching principles

   and matters that I think will help inform the more specific

   argument that is made.  And I'd like to talk really about the

   six or seven constitutional principles that are primarily at

   issue in examining the death penalty notice and how those

   principles manifest themselves in the statute.

            First of all, the Supreme Court has said since 1976 in

   the five cases that were decided at the end of the term in the

   summer of 1976 and has said ever since that the death penalty



                                                                           53



   process, the sentencing process has to be more reliable than

   any other legal process that we know and are a part of for the

   very -- for the very reason that death is different from any

   other kind of sentence infinitely.  And so our processes have

   to reflect enhanced reliability at every turn.

            That is a principle that finds its application in

   various ways as we will talk about statute and this death

   penalty notice.

            The second principle again derived from the Eighth

   Amendment by the Supreme Court is the notion we touched on

   briefly yesterday that there has to be a kind of threshold

   finding at some point along the way of death eligibility, which

   has to do with mental state with which the person accused

   committed the crime.  And the court has made quite clear in

   cases beginning in Enmund vs. Florida and the more recent Tison 

   vs. Arizona that the killing -- there has to be a killing done

   at least with reckless disregard for human life and a major

   participation in the underlying crime.

            Those death eligibility findings here are set out in

   the statute at 3591(a)(2); and there are four alternative

   findings, all of which reflect a mental state that is

   sufficiently culpable under Supreme Court authority to make the

   defendants death eligible.

            Those are what the Government has referred to as

   "gateway findings"; and that's an appropriate term, I think.



                                                                           54



            The next principle that is found in constitutional

   decisions and reflected in the statute is the principle of

   narrowing.  This has to do with aggravating circumstances.  The

   court has made clear that among all of the people who may be

   convicted of a crime of murder, the death penalty cannot apply

   to all of them.  There has to be a process by which some

   narrower group of those people convicted is selected because

   they or their crimes are worse and that that is what defines

   that group of people as particularly deserving of death.  The

   court has repeatedly referred to that as the narrowing

   function.

            That is done in this statute by the specific statutory

   aggravating circumstances set out at 3592(c).  There are 15

   listed circumstances.  Five of those have been alleged or have

   been set forth in the notice in this case.

            And with respect to that, there are some rules that

   apply to narrowing circumstances that may not apply to others.

            Another constitutional principle that again draws on

   aggravating circumstances but begins to bring in mitigating

   circumstances is the notion of individualized sentencing.  The

   court conceives of the death penalty deliberation process as

   one that initially considers death eligibility, then has a

   narrowing decision, and then has what the courts refer to as an

   individualized sentencing decision; that is, in this case

   looking at all the factors that are appropriate to be looked



                                                                           55



   at, is death or life the appropriate sentence at that stage of

   the deliberative process.

            The court has made clear that non-statutory and

   statutory aggravating circumstances may be taken into account

   as well as mitigating circumstances.  And this statute requires

   at that stage the balancing of mitigation and aggravation and

   at the end of that balancing process, a determination as to

   whether death or life is the appropriate sentence.

            As we go through the notice, I'll be referring back to

   some of these concepts.  I wanted to get those out at the

   beginning, but there are two or three other constitutional

   principles that come into play here as well.

            The court has often intermingled Eighth Amendment

   analysis and due process analysis and principles in describing

   the safeguards that must be inherent in the death sentencing

   process.  One of those is the simple due process notion of

   notice; that there must be adequate notice about aggravating

   circumstances and facts from which the defendant can defend

   himself.

            Another due process principle is the notion of

   vagueness; that there cannot be too much vagueness in

   aggravating circumstances connected again with the notice

   issue.  If it's too vague, you don't know how to defend

   yourself, but, also, if you're a juror and you're being asked

   to take guidance from the aggravating circumstances, which is



                                                                           56



   what their function is in the sentencing process, if there

   is -- if the circumstances are too vague, inadequate guidance

   is given.  So the well-established due process notions of

   adequate notice and avoiding vagueness are inherent in the

   constitutional framework of death sentence processes.

            And finally, unique, I think, to the death penalty is

   a notion that has evolved out of the Eighth Amendment that what

   is at issue ultimately in a death case and in the sentencing

   decision is an assessment of the defendant's moral culpability

   and that the sentencing process itself is a reasoned moral

   response to an assessment of the defendant's moral culpability.

   We'll talk about that in some particularity in relation to one

   of the aggravating circumstances.

            I'd like to turn then to the particular challenges to

   this death penalty notice and to this statute.  At the outset

   of -- we challenge the statute itself in a manner that was

   touched on in the conference yesterday.  It concerns the

   evidence which is allowed into a sentencing proceeding which is

   not called evidence but information, as the Court noted.  And

   the statute specifically says with respect to this at 3593(c),

   at the sentencing hearing information may be presented as to

   any matter relevant to the sentence including any mitigating or

   aggravating factor permitted or required to be considered under

   Section 3592.  And then a little later in this same provision,

   information is admissible regardless of its admissibility under



                                                                           57



   the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials

   except that information may be excluded if its probative value

   is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice,

   confusing the issues or misleading jury.

            And we have specifically challenged that broad

   provision under a concern about hearsay.  And the concern has

   both constitutional roots in the confrontation clause of the

   Sixth Amendment and it has constitutional roots in the Eighth

   Amendment's concern for reliability.

            The Supreme Court in general in the Gregg vs. Georgia

   case in 1976 and others has approved this kind of sentencing

   informational gathering process.  It has said sentencing

   proceedings should be a wide-range probing analysis of

   information and facts and should not be necessarily restricted

   by the rules of evidence.  But the court has only one time been

   called upon to examine questions of hearsay, which is the

   specific evidentiary problem that we have raised for the

   Court's consideration.

            In a case called Green vs. Georgia, which was decided

   in 1979, the defendant in that case tried to bring in hearsay

   to his benefit in mitigation.  The state objected, saying that

   it was hearsay; and ultimately, it was kept out.

            When the case got to the Supreme Court, the Supreme

   Court said the information should have been admitted and went

   on to say that there were a number of guaranties of the



                                                                           58



   reliability of the information, did a kind of analysis that one

   might do under the hearsay rule which allows for admitting

   hearsay if there is a sufficient -- nonspecific hearsay if

   there is a sufficient indicia of reliability.

            THE COURT:  Well, that's the way this has come up in

   those cases, hasn't it?  It's been on the mitigation side, not

   on the aggravation side.

            MR. BURR:  Probably so, but, certainly, this statute

   would allow it to come in either way, interestingly.

            THE COURT:  Well, except that the Court does sit and

   rule, holding a hearing what is going to be admissible.  And

   although the Congress has provided that we don't have to apply

   the Rules of Evidence, essentially Rule 403 is certainly there.

            MR. BURR:  It is, your Honor; but there have been --

            THE COURT:  And I don't -- you know, hearsay could be

   excluded, too, I think, within the authority given to the

   Court.

            MR. BURR:  If the Court takes that view and applies

   that rule of law, we're happy.

            The problem is in some of the other cases under the

   Anti Drug Abuse Act death penalty statute, 28 U.S.C. 848, this

   issue has been raised.  And at least in the Pretlow case out of

   New Jersey, the court did recognize that the 403 protection was

   not the same and not as strong a protection for defendants'

   concerns as the 802 hearsay rule protection.



                                                                           59



            And it's not.  It is substantially outweighed by

   danger of unfair prejudice, may or may not allow a probing

   consideration of the reliability of hearsay.

            The Government certainly has represented to the Court

   that it does not intend to tread close to this line; and if

   that's how the trial turns out and -- that, we certainly

   wouldn't have a problem.  The problem, though, is inherent in

   the statute and at least would call for the Court to exercise

   some additional safeguard discretion.

            Moving to the next concern -- and this begins really a

   walkthrough of each of the aggravating circumstances which I

   will try to do as quickly as possible but we have concerns

   about all of them.

            The first statutory aggravating circumstance is in

   shorthand terms what's called the felony murder aggravating

   circumstance.  It is that the killings in this case occurred

   during the course of the commission of several underlying

   felonies, five to be exact.

            And the problem with this -- there are two problems I

   want to address with respect to this particular aggravating

   circumstance.  The first has to do with a narrowing concern;

   and it's a concern that was initially -- and actually, the only

   case the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed this in was

   Lowenfield vs. Phelps, which was a case out of Louisiana.  Up

   until Lowenfield, the concern that had been expressed in a



                                                                           60



   number of cases was this:  If a person was convicted of a

   felony murder, say, you know, a murder in the course of armed

   robbery, and at the penalty phase of the trial on that capital

   crime, the aggravating circumstance of a robbery committed -- a

   murder committed during the course of a robbery was presented,

   it really gave nothing new to the jury to consider.  It was

   simply a duplication of the element of the offense and, by that

   fact, did nothing to narrow the group of people who were

   convicted of murder.

            That concern was finally taken up by the Supreme Court

   in Lowenfield but under a different statute.

            In Louisiana, second degree murder was defined as

   intent to kill murder or felony murder.

            Capital murder in Louisiana was something different.

   It was an intentional killing; but in the definition of capital

   murder or first degree murder, there was built into what we

   think of conventionally as aggravating circumstances.  For

   example, the particular version of first degree murder that

   Lowenfield was convicted of had -- his crime was defined as

   follows:  "When the offender has a specific intent to kill or

   to inflict great bodily harm upon more than one person."

            And in all of the five ways in which first degree

   murder was defined in Louisiana, there was something built in,

   if you have an aggravating circumstance built in or built on

   top of the traditional definition of first degree murder; that



                                                                           61



   is, an intent to kill.

            The Supreme Court said that in this kind of statute

   upon conviction, because there is an added on aggravating

   circumstance, a constitutionally appropriate narrowing has

   taken place.  And so if that extra aggravating circumstance,

   that is, killing somebody with the intent to kill more than one

   person, is taken into account in the sentencing phase, there is

   nothing inappropriate with that.

            The problem with the first statutory aggravating

   circumstance in our case is that while it has the potential

   problem raised in Lowenfield, it does not have the potential

   savings that the Lowenfield court found.

            Unlike the crimes defined in Louisiana, which added an

   aggravating circumstance to the definition of murder, the

   crimes that are charged against Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols do

   not do that.

            As we discussed yesterday, in the Government's view,

   the crime doesn't even require a killing.  So they're not even

   murders.

            Even in our view, at most, these are felony murders.

   They are peculiar kinds of felony murders.  One is more like an

   arson murder and the other may be more like an aggravated

   assault murder or an arson murder, but they are in essence

   felony murders.

            There is nothing built into the definitions of these



                                                                           62



   crimes that would be akin to an aggravating circumstance.

            THE COURT:  Well, you're talking about the first three

   counts?

            MR. BURR:  That's right.  That's right.

            THE COURT:  We also have murder counts.

            MR. BURR:  As to Counts 4 to 11, ironically, under the

   Government's position, which is that "on account of" is not an

   a part of the definition or an element, or that may be their

   position, if "on account of" is not an element of the murder

   offenses, then those murder offenses are just like the second

   degree murder offenses that the court had in front of it in

   Lowenfield, first degree murder, premeditated murder, or felony

   murder.  And so those offenses would suffer the same problem.

            But this argument is actually directed towards the

   first three counts because these are the underlying felonies

   that are particularly inherent in the first three counts.

            For that reason, we submit that Aggravating

   Circumstance No. 1, except in one respect, has to be stricken.

            The four -- four of the felonies relied on in

   Aggravating Circumstance 1 do nothing more than track the

   elements of the offense.  The four felonies concern destruction

   of a motor vehicle, again by a bomb -- it's clear that it's by

   a bomb in this case; destruction of government property by

   explosives, the 844(f) underlying crime; destruction of

   property affecting interstate commerce by explosives, an 844(i)



                                                                           63



   version of the offense, and use of a weapon of mass

   destruction.

            Those four underlying felonies that are alleged in

   statutory Aggravating Circumstance No. 1 did nothing more than

   duplicate the elements of the offenses, the substantive

   offenses set forth if Counts 2 and 3.

            Now, there is a fifth felony.

            THE COURT:  Well, two of them are really uncharged

   felonies.

            MR. BURR:  They are; but they -- but they track --

   they certainly would be subsumed, I think, in a McCullah sense.

            THE COURT:  In the same conduct.

            MR. BURR:  What happened here was, as we all know, an

   allegation that a bomb went off in a vehicle in front of a

   federal building; and those elemental facts are -- would be the

   elemental facts defining these four offenses:  The destruction

   of a motor vehicle, destruction of government property by

   explosives, destruction of property affecting interstate

   commerce -- the truck -- and use of a weapon of mass

   destruction.

            Now, there is a fifth felony that's alleged in this

   conglomerate Aggravating Circumstance 1, which is an interstate

   commerce felony.  And that is not inherent in counts 1, 2 or 3.

   And that would properly be a narrowing aggravating

   circumstance; so the entire circumstance, No. 1, would not have



                                                                           64



   to be stricken; but the four felonies which simply replicate

   elements of the charged crimes would have to be stricken in our

   view in order for statutory Aggravating Circumstance 1 to be an

   appropriate narrowing circumstance here.

            THE COURT:  Well, in this recent case from the Tenth

   Circuit, this McCullah --

            MR. BURR:  McCullah.

            THE COURT:  Yeah -- I don't remember it that well, but

   it does have in it, doesn't it, the position that you can use

   as an aggravating circumstance, aggravating factor the same

   crime that was charged and on which conviction was contained.

            MR. BURR:  It does, but the crime was different there.

   The crime was under 848, and it was a murder committed to

   further a criminal enterprise.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. BURR:  That, I submit, is a statute that is much

   more like the first degree capital murder statute in Louisiana.

   It is, you know, because it takes a murder, intentional or

   felony murder and it tacks on to it a motive for the murder

   which was to further a criminal -- in furtherance of a criminal

   enterprise.

            So I think the McCullah decision was absolutely

   correct under Lowenfield, because it had a definition of murder

   plus an aggravating circumstance which narrowed it.  And it was

   therefore no constitutional problem to take into account the



                                                                           65



   furtherance of a criminal enterprise factor as an aggravating

   circumstance in the penalty phase because the narrowing had

   happened upon conviction.

            But our statutes are different from that.  They are --

   while they describe events that are certainly anything but

   garden variety, they are as a matter of law garden variety

   felony murders, which they are not different from arson murders

   in the sense that Lowenfield is concerned with.  There is

   nothing built into the definitions of these murders except, as

   I noted with Counts 4 to 11, "on account of," killing on

   account of a federal employee's performance of their work.  If

   that were an element, then that would be akin to adding an

   aggravating circumstance to the definition of murder.

            And as I've also acknowledged with Aggravating

   Circumstance 1, the one felony which says -- alleges

   transportation of explosives in interstate commerce for certain

   purposes:  That would be an appropriate underlying felony for

   statutory aggravating circumstances under 1 because it is not a

   part of the element of the offense and it can perform a

   narrowing function for that reason.

            The second constitutional problem that we submit is

   inherent for Statutory Aggravating Circumstance 1 draws upon

   another part of the McCullah's case's analysis, which is a

   concern about duplication.  And there the court, as you'll

   recall, found that when certain aggravating circumstances



                                                                           66



   overlapped or when one is subsumed in the definition or meaning

   of another, the circumstances have to be collapsed into one.

   They cannot be allowed to be two or more because it gives an

   artificial weight to the number and amount of aggravating

   circumstances that the jury would consider.

            We think that that problem exists inside of statutory

   Aggravating Circumstance 1.  While it is a single aggravating

   circumstance and presumably the finding of only one of these

   underlying felonies would allow the finding of the aggravating

   circumstance, it would be given artificially greater weight if

   all five or four or three or two of the underlying felonies

   would be were allowed to be considered as well and since the

   four which I have delineated overlap with each other with

   respect to this crime, those at least would have to be reduced

   to one, although because of our first argument about this we

   think none of those four should be appropriately a part of this

   aggravating circumstance.

            I'd like to move onto the second statutory aggravating

   circumstance alleged in the death penalty notice and that is

   that in committing this crime, the defendants knowingly created

   a great risk of death to one or more persons in addition to the

   victims of the offense.

            Our primary challenge to this one is a due process

   vagueness challenge.  And it has to do with this:  This

   aggravating circumstance envisions three kinds of victims,



                                                                           67



   three categories of victims.  One is those who were killed, one

   is those who were injured, and then what it really focuses on

   is a third category, because it says, "created grave risk of

   death to one or more persons in addition to the victims of the

   offense."  If the victims are people killed and injured, then

   what this focuses is on is a third category; that is, people

   other than those killed and injured who were put at grave risk,

   knowingly put at grave risk by the use of this explosive

   device.

            It is hard to imagine who would be in that category.

   If one thinks of it as concentric circles, for example, in the

   center circle those who were killed, the next circle around

   that, those who were injured, this circumstance focuses on a

   third circle outside of those: people who were put at grave

   risk of death but who were neither injured nor killed.

            We think that that is extremely vague.  It is vague in

   several ways.  First of all, who is in it?  If you were not

   injured or killed but put at grave risk of death, how were you

   put at grave risk of death?

            THE COURT:  How about firefighters and rescue workers?

            MR. BURR:  They may have been; but -- that's a

   possibility.  But how about people who were downtown and in

   some proximity?  How close did they have to be?  Does it

   include people who -- you know, who were driving in 
automobiles

   and subject to having pieces of buildings fall on them?  It



                                                                           68



   raises a number of questions as to who is in this category and

   what are the limits of it.

            There is certainly -- firefighters are a good example

   of who very well be in the category.  And certainly by looking

   at the addition to 844(f) that we talked about yesterday that

   was added to protect firefighters and rescue workers in the

   wake of an incident like this, that's a good suggestion.  But

   is that the limit?  Is that the only people?  And that's the

   question that the vagueness of this aggravating circumstance

   raises:  Who were the members of the class that are within the

   definition of this aggravating circumstance?

            The Court -- the Court, I submit, could limit it to

   firefighters and rescue workers and that would be appropriate;

   but there at least needs to be that kind of limit so that there

   will be some specificity.

            Moving to the next factor, statutory factor in the

   notice:  Substantial planning and premeditation to cause the

   death of one or more persons and to commit an act of terrorism.

            We had raised a challenge to the vagueness of the word

   "substantial" which the McCullah court has answered, although

   the McCullah court was writing in a context in which there was

   a definition of the word "substantial" given in the district

   court; but the McCullah court went to say that the word

   "substantial" is not inherently ambiguous and vague.

            We may nonetheless ask for a definite -- a clarifying



                                                                           69



   definition of the word "substantial."

            The primary concerns here are twofold beyond that:

   One is there is some vagueness, I submit, as to whether or not

   the phrase "substantial planning and premeditation" modifies

   both the plan to kill people and the plan to commit an act of

   terrorism.  If it modifies both, then that is clear.  If it

   modifies only one or if it's interpretable as modifying only

   one, that creates a vagueness problem.  So we would ask that

   the Court clarify that.

            And the language of the aggravating circumstance

   itself in the statute would appear to have it modify both the

   plan to kill persons and to commit an act of terrorism.

            There is also a McCullah problem here, we submit.

   It's not quite as obvious as the McCullah problem we first

   talked about in relation to the first aggravating factor, but

   we think it is nontheless here.  If one compares the death

   penalty statutory aggravating factor 3, the substantial

   planning and premeditation factor with the previous one, that

   is knowingly creating a grave risk of death to persons in

   addition to the victims, we submit that at the core of both of

   those is an intention, a knowing plan, a knowing intention to

   kill a number of people.

            "Act of terrorism" has been defined in other parts of

   the statute; but I think factually, there is no question that

   under any definition of "act of terrorism," the setting off of



                                                                           70



   a bomb of this size in front of a building at the time of day

   it happened would qualify.

            But how is that different from knowingly intending to

   create a grave risk of death to more people than those actually

   victimized?  We submit that the core of those is similar.

            THE COURT:  Well, I suppose you get into this question

   of motivation, then.

            MR. BURR:  There certainly could be a question of

   motivation.  Whether or not either of these factors evokes that

   is not clear from --

            THE COURT:  Well, we'll hear from the Government on

   that.

            MR. BURR:  But we do think there is at least an

   overlap at the core of that.

            The fourth statutory aggravating factor in the notice

   is that there were certain persons killed here who were

   particularly vulnerable due to their old age, their youth, or

   their infirmity.

            We have -- we have three arguments about this one.

   The first has to do with what I mentioned at the outset, the

   question of moral culpability.

            The Supreme Court, though not terribly explicit, has

   complied through its analysis of moral culpability that having

   some scienter about who is -- about the person being killed is

   essential to being morally culpable.



                                                                           71



            This particular factor does not require on its face

   that the person who committed the crime have any knowledge that

   there were particularly vulnerable people who were victims.

            While Payne vs. Tennessee cited by the Government

   certainly allows the effects on victims to be considered in

   aggravation, Payne does not rule out the notion that there

   is -- has to be some scienter involved in relation to victims.

            The only justice to address this in Payne was Justice

   Souter in his concurrence; and what he noted there was while

   you generally take victims as you find them and if the impact

   on certain victims is greater than others, it is still

   appropriately considered.  What Justice Souter does say is that

   it is at least foreseeable that there will be some kind of

   impact on any victim; that that person is likely to have people

   who love them who will be torn apart by their killing; and so

   there is some notion at least even in Payne vs. Tennessee which

   allows the status and impact on victims to be considered as a

   matter of constitutional law that there still be still at least

   some foreseeability, at least that level of scienter on the

   part of the person who commits the crime.

            THE COURT:  Well, in approaching these, certainly,

   there will be jury instructions with respect to the meaning of

   these factors, whatever factors are ultimately submitted to a

   jury on the basis of the information provided at the hearing;

   and these problems that you're raising can be taken care of by



                                                                           72



   an instruction that includes a scienter element.

            MR. BURR:  No question about that, your Honor.  We

   are -- we feel -- we think we are at least are obliged to raise

   these issues as problems with either the statute or the notice

   on its face.  There certainly may be remedial measures that can

   be taken other than striking them.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. BURR:  But we at least thought this was the time

   to raise these constitutional concerns with the Court.

            THE COURT:  And indeed, there is provision in the

   statute to amend the notice.

            MR. BURR:  Certainly.

            THE COURT:  It doesn't say when amendments can be

   filed, but it's there.  And I don't know if the amendments have

   to go through this same protocol, but there is the -- and

   certainly the court, I think it's recognized -- we'll hear from

   the Government, of course -- recognized that this is a

   notification of what the Government intends to do; but then

   ultimately what's submitted to the jury is up to the Court on

   the basis of whatever the information is both with respect to

   aggravating and mitigating factors, and we get a set of

   instructions, as we do just from -- like an indictment.

            MR. BURR:  And we will certainly pursue these matters

   at that time.

            THE COURT:  Sure.  Yeah.  And if there isn't any



                                                                           73



   reliable information presented in support of any aggravating

   factor as interpreted in light of the constitutional

   requirements, that factor wouldn't go.

            MR. BURR:  Just a couple of other quick observations

   about this particular factor, the particular vulnerability of

   young, old, and infirm people.  In the facts of this case, we

   would suggest that this factor really has no application at

   all.  Because the Congress was very precise in focusing on

   particular vulnerability, while that may make sense in other

   contexts, it makes no rational sense here because no person was

   less or more vulnerable to this event than others.  So we

   suggest that as applied in this case, because of the unique

   facts here, there were no people who were more vulnerable than

   others.  Everybody suffered equal and horrible vulnerability as

   a result of this event.

            The third point to make is this:  That this aggravator

   again like some of the others has a vagueness problem.  It

   is -- there needs to be some definition and some guidance for

   the jury in determining who is old, who is young, and who is

   infirm.  While each of us has our own definitions and own

   understandings about that, the Eighth Amendment requires that

   there be some precise guidance about that; so there would need

   to be some further definition given as well the final statutory

   circumstance alleged in the death penalty notice is that there

   were people who were federal law enforcement officers who were



                                                                           74



   killed either while they were engaged in the performance of

   their duties on account of the performance of their duties or

   because of their status.

            We have two concerns about this.  The first is a

   McCullah concern; and that is that the third category -- that

   is, killed because of their status as federal law enforcement

   officers -- we think subsumes the first and second categories;

   that is, "while engaged in or on account of," because certainly

   one's status as a federal law enforcement officer would

   encompass performance as well as present performance of those

   duties.  So we think that that -- that needs to be collapsed to

   one factual matter.

            And there is as well a lack of fact notice problem

   here.  Let me talk just a minute about the problems with fact

   notice.  We submitted on Monday a notice of supplemental

   authority for our pleading that raises before the Court a

   Supreme Court case that's now pending called Grey vs. 

   Netherland.  It's a federal habeas case involving a death

   sentence out of Virginia.  And the court is likely to decide in

   that case whether or not and how much notice of the underlying

   facts underly aggravating circumstances the Constitution

   requires.

            It arises in a federal habeas jurisprudential context,

   which is not terribly relevant to us; but the underlying issue

   is whether or not Gardner vs. Florida, which is a Supreme Court



                                                                           75



   case in 1977 that required some notice and opportunity to be

   heard on aggravating factors -- whether that case requires in

   advance of trial meaningful fact notice about the underlying

   facts of aggravating circumstances.  The particular one in Gray

   was the aggravating factor was whether the person would be in

   future danger and the underlying facts that he got notice of

   only the night before his sentencing hearing was that he was

   being accused of having committed some unadjudicated murders

   that he had not been given notice of before.

            So we think that case is going to decide at least in

   some respects how much factual notice about the facts

   underlying aggravating circumstances in death cases must be

   given in advance of trial.

            THE COURT:  Normally, it would be.  You know, there

   has got to be enough so that you can be prepared to meet it,

   just as there is with respect to the offenses.

            MR. BURR:  No question I think in that case because

   there was, you know, some actual notice, the question will

   probably turn more on what's meaningful and what is the degree

   of notice that must be given.

            But we have raised that concern in respect to a number

   of the aggravating factors, just so that the Court has a --

            THE COURT:  But again, I think that's a matter for

   management of the case; that the Government can be required to

   disclose what it intends to rely upon in support of that, not



                                                                           76



   by a bill of particulars formally but by just a form of

   discovery.

            MR. BURR:  We have pursued that, I think, in some of

   our discovery.

            THE COURT:  Yes, you have.

            MR. BURR:  And will continue to do that.

            A couple of points about the non-statutory aggravating

   factors, your Honor.

            The first has to do with what we submit is a flaw in

   the statute that precludes the use of non-statutory aggravating

   factors at all and it has to do with this --

            THE COURT:  But McCullah did decide that you could use

   non --

            MR. BURR:  McCullah only decided one aspect of this.

   We argued in our opening papers that there was a delegation

   problem.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. BURR:  And McCullah certainly has decided that

   issue against us.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. BURR:  Though we are not waiving it, we understand

   that the Tenth Circuit decision controls.  But in a challenge

   that was not made in McCullah that has been made in a couple of

   other federal death penalty cases is this:  It has to do with

   the relationship between the ability of a statute or of a death



                                                                           77



   sentencing process to take into account non-statutory

   aggravating factors and whether there is proportionality review

   available on appeal and the connection between those two is

   this:  In Gregg vs. Georgia in 1976, the court was looking at a

   statute that allowed wide-ranging non-statutory aggravating

   factors to be presented.  In fact, as I recall the Georgia

   statute, there were maybe a half a dozen statutory aggravating

   factors and then an open-ended factor that says "any other

   aggravating factor authorized by law."

            And so under that -- that authorization, prosecutors

   brought in many non-statutory aggravating factors.

            Another aspect of the Georgia statute was that on

   appeal, there was mandatory proportionality review and the way

   that worked and the way the Court understood it as a safeguard

   for the Georgia statute was that in conducting proportionality

   review the Georgia Supreme Court looked across cases.  It

   collected a massive body of information about all capital

   murder prosecutions and made a judgment about whether death 
was

   disproportionate in one case compared to similar cases in a

   lateral view.

            The Supreme Court held in Pulley vs. Harris in the

   mid- 80's involving the California statute that proportionality

   review was not a constitutionally necessary requirement.  But

   that statute was a statute that did not allow the consideration

   of non-statutory aggravating factors.  There were specific



                                                                           78



   statutorily enumerated aggravating factors and no more.  There

   was no license to bring in non-statutory factors.

            Now, the reason we think there is this relation is

   this:  In Gregg vs. Georgia and in the subsequent cases

   involving the Georgia statute, Zant vs. Stephens from the

   Supreme Court, the court has continued to talk about the

   importance of proportionality review in a statute where there

   has not been a legislative judgment defining all the

   aggravating circumstances.  Proportionality review is the way

   to safeguard the evenhandedness and even application of

   aggravating circumstances in a statute where prosecutors can

   make up aggravating circumstances.

            Unlike a California type statute where all of the

   aggravating circumstances have a legislative judgment behind

   them, you don't need proportionality review because there has

   been a legislative judgment some uniformity of application.

            So based on that theory which we have outlined in our

   briefs, we argue that this statute, which does not require

   proportionality review on appeal cannot allow the introduction

   of non-statutory aggravating circumstances.

            Now, two other federal district courts have considered

   this issue, the Pitera case out of the Eastern District of

   New York and the Pretlow case out of New Jersey.  Neither --

   both have decided this issue the other way; but we think that

   they bear some analysis because they both have had some



                                                                           79



   thoughtful things to say about this.  We think that the outcome

   that they've reached is wrong for the reasons we've argued; but

   we think that this bears serious consideration and would

   require striking the non-statutory aggravating circumstances

   from the notice if the Court agreed with our position.

            The second point about the non-statutory aggravating

   circumstances again has to do with the notion -- a notion of

   reliability.  The third of the non-statutory aggravating

   circumstances allows the admission of unadjudicated criminal

   offenses referred to as thefts and robberies that were

   conducted to support the effort at the bombing.

            There is some conflicting authority in this circuit

   about it, about this issue.  Hatch vs. Oklahoma, a Tenth

   Circuit case at 58 F.3d 1447 has held that evidence of

   unadjudicated offenses does not create a constitutional

   problem; however, Hatch was not a sentencing before a jury.  It

   was a sentencing before a judge and there was no particular

   allegation of the unreliability of the unadjudicated offense

   information there.

            Contrast a case that Judge Seay has decided in federal

   habeas, Williamson vs. Reynolds, which is cited in our papers,

   in which Judge Seay distinguished Hatch and found that the use

   of introduction of unadjudicated offenses there violated due

   process and the underlying Eighth Amendment concern for

   reliability because those unadjudicated offenses appeared to be



                                                                           80



   unreliable.

            So there is at least some issue here and some reason

   to be concerned about the underlying adjudicated offenses in

   the third non-statutory aggravating circumstance.

            Connected to that are some fact notice problems.

   Which of the unadjudicated offenses alleged here are

   encompassed by this?  There are a number set out in the

   indictment.  Whether or not the Government has limited itself

   to the indictment is a question and notice question that needs

   to be resolved.

            Finally, your Honor, as to the non-statutory

   aggravating circumstances, we think there is a very serious

   McCullah duplication problem among the three of the four

   non-statutory aggravating circumstances that relate to victim

   impact.  As the Court will recall from the death penalty

   notice, the first of the non-statutory aggravating factors

   alleges the death of 169 people.  The second alleges that in

   committing the offenses, the defendant caused serious physical

   and emotional injury including maiming, dismemberment and

   permanent disability to numerous individuals.

            The Government has acknowledged in its response to our

   concern about this that factor No. 2 would be limited to people

   injured to distinguish it from factor -- Non-statutory Factor

   No. 1.

            And then there is the fourth non-statutory aggravating



                                                                           81



   factor, victim impact evidence concerning the effect of the

   defendants' offenses on the victims and the victims' families

   and the extent and scope of injury and loss suffered by the

   victims and the victims' families.  That circumstance, your

   Honor, appears to us to overlap entirely with Non-statutory

   Aggravating Circumstances Nos. 1 and 2.  Indeed, victim impact,

   we submit, is but a single aggravating circumstance.  It has

   several aspects.  It has people who are killed, people who are

   injured, and those living who are affected by the deaths and

   the injuries.  But it is all a singular concept of the impact

   on victims and we submit should not be spread among three

   distinct aggravating circumstances but should be encompassed in

   one in keeping with McCullah's concern that the breaking apart

   of what are truly single aggravating circumstances artificially

   inflates the weight of aggravation in any death case.

            The final concern about McCullah, your Honor, has to

   do with the gateway findings.  The Government has alleged those

   in the conjunctive, rather than the disjunctive.  And we think

   that those gateway findings about intent are not necessarily

   going to be considered as aggravating circumstances.  They will

   be considered by the jury at the outset of their deliberations

   in the penalty phase of this trial, if there is one.

            And we think for that reason, there is a risk, a

   substantial risk that the jury will consider those intent

   factors as aggravating circumstances because they certainly



                                                                           82



   point in the direction of aggravation and not mitigation.

            In the statute looked at in McCullah, which was

   structured somewhat differently -- it was the sentencing

   statute under 848 -- those mental states were set out

   specifically as aggravating factors.  And what the court found

   there was there was a duplication problem among those mental

   states.

            There were two alleged in McCullah; and the court said

   that when you find one of these, you have found the other

   because there is such a substantial overlap.

            We submit that all four of these substantially overlap

   and that the appropriate thing to do is to reduce them to one

   so that there is not a risk of an inflated consideration of

   something that tends to be aggravated, again recognizing that

   they are not explicitly aggravating the factors and the jury

   could be instructed not to consider them so, but there still

   would be a risk that they would.

            Your Honor, with that, I will yield to Mr. Tigar, who

   will come in on some other aspects of the challenges.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  I'm, of course,

   considering these arguments by Mr. Burr being made on behalf of

   both defendants.

            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  I do not intend to

   duplicate what Mr. Burr said.  As Henry VIII said to Ann

   Boleyn, I do not intend to keep you long.



                                                                           83



            I apologize for that, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. TIGAR:  I'm sorry.

            Your Honor, the first point we wish to emphasize is

   that this notice is not a notice of anything.  The statute

   requires in 3593 that the notice tell us what things the

   Government is going to rely upon, and it lists some things

   about detail and relevant facts.  And so the statute then

   provides, as your Honor noticed -- noted that the notice can be

   amended at any time for good cause.

            The model appears to be Rule 7(f) of the Rules of

   Criminal Procedure; and assuming the notice provision is valid,

   which we say it is not, the analogy to Rule 7(f) is rather

   telling, because as the Court will recall, the 1966 amendments

   to Rule 7(f) were designed to provide for great detail for

   bills of particulars and cited with approval Judge, later

   Justice, Whitaker's opinion in United States vs. Smith.

            It is also our contention that there is an extent to

   which instructions can't cure statutory invalidity; that is to

   say, if the statutory definition of an aggravating factor is

   wrong -- and we say it is -- we don't believe instructions can

   cure that.  That's particularly difficult with respect to an

   act of terrorism.  Your Honor raised the question doesn't that

   get into motive.  Well, that leads directly to considerations

   such as Dawson vs. Delaware, the case in which the court said



                                                                           84



   that skinhead evidence wouldn't be relevant or admissible.

            But what I want to focus on, your Honor, is McCullah.

   I want to spend just a few minutes.  And I will make the

   contention that every single principle laid out by the Tenth

   Circuit, Judge Kelly in McCullah, supports the position we have

   taken in this case and points directly to the

   unconstitutionality of this statute and the invalidity of the

   notice.  That's the territory I intend to stake out.

            The Supreme Court of the United States has identified

   the sentencing procedures here under consideration as central

   to this reasoned moral response that the sentencer is supposed

   to reach.  Indeed, the court has rejected the categorical

   imperative of life by saying that children and mentally

   retarded persons can be executed.  It has rejected the

   categorical imperative of death by saying that there is no

   offense, no matter how heinous and no matter how culpable, who

   can be executed save after a hearing at which these mitigating

   and aggravating factors are considered.

            Moreover, the Government has chosen in 3591 a weighing

   statute.  That is significant under Lowenfield vs. Phelps

   terms, because there is substantially less freedom for the

   Government in defining aggravating factors under a weighing

   statute than under a non-weighing statute.

            The third preliminary point:  848 is different from

   3591.



                                                                           85



            And now to McCullah:  In McCullah, the death sentence

   was reversed.  The case is now reported at 76 F.3d 1087.  And

   I'm going to begin my analysis at page 1106:  McCullah was

   convicted, if the Court will recall, of a murder, a homicide,

   committed in furtherance of a drug enterprise.  Thus, as the

   Tenth Circuit noted, the statute itself under which

   Mr. McCullah was indicted specifically narrows the field of

   death eligible defendants.  That's at page 1108.

            Page 1109:  "Thus, contrary to McCullah's assertion,

   only a small subset of potentially death eligible defendants

   are subject to capital punishment under the federal scheme, and

   thus the requisite narrowing is present."

            The sentence immediately above:  "Congress has

   statutorily narrowed the field of death eligible defendants by

   limiting the possibility of capital punishment to homicides --"

   that is, intentional premeditated murders here "-- in

   furtherance of continuing criminal enterprises or other

   specified offenses."

            Now, by contrast, the Government has in its papers

   taken the position that the offense which propels these

   defendants into a sentencing field need not be a homicide at

   all.  We say that violates Coker vs. Georgia; but the point is

   that the Government has elected in this case to proceed under

   that portion of the statute that authorizes the a death penalty

   sentencing hearing when the predicate offense contains no



                                                                           86



   narrowing characteristics whatsoever.  There is no subset of

   criminals, let alone of committers of homicides in furtherance,

   let alone of committers of premeditated homicides that is

   singled out in the guilt portion.  Thus, the Government is

   entitled to none -- none of the deference accorded the capital

   sentencing process in McCullah.

            It is for that reason that we say that McCullah does

   not support the Government and supports us, because such little

   comfort as the Government may purport to derive from Judge

   Kelly's words is based exclusively upon the language that I

   have quoted for the Court.

            Point by point:  First, McCullah does say that the

   power to make non-statutory aggravators may validly be

   delegated to the executive branch.  And why?  Because the

   delegation is, in Justice Cardozo's magisterial words, confined

   within banks to keep it from overflowing.

            But here, there are no banks, there are no levies,

   there are no limits; that is to say, the discretion that the

   Government claims is not a discretion to narrow that which

   Congress has already narrowed by selecting a subset of

   intentional homicide committers, the delegation is broad and

   boundless because the predicate offense is not a homicide

   offense.

            Moreover, your Honor, we have noted that the statute

   itself says that the aggravating factors, the non-statutory



                                                                           87



   aggravators, must be those set forth.  And we have that

   statutory interpretation point which the Government makes light

   of, but it is the text of the statute.

            Second, McCullah then goes on to consider whether or

   not certain aggravating factors are permissible.

            Th Government in its brief, page 43, takes the

   position with respect to one of the factors that once there are

   these aggravating factors that narrow eligibility, then the

   Government is relatively free under a statute or non-statutory

   aggravators to put in anything it wants and to aid the

   sentencer in the exercise of discretion.

            Well, they claim that power under an interpretation of

   Lowenfield, and that's the case that they cite along with Zant

   for that proposition.

            In McCullah, the court of appeals goes along with that

   in McCullah's case; and why?  Because the narrowing has already

   taken place at the level of the offense of which McCullah was

   convicted.  The condition for permitting those things in

   McCullah is, as I say, the offense that propelled McCullah into

   the penalty hearing.

            Now, once I've disposed -- suggested to the Court that

   McCullah disposes of the contentions with respect to

   delegation -- that is, at least leaves us in a position to

   argue them with respect to delegation and disposes utterly of

   the contention with respect to these non-statutory



                                                                           88



   aggravators -- we then move to the part of McCullah that

   unequivocally supports us no matter what statutory scheme we're

   involved in.  I won't repeat what Mr. Burr said about that.

            This duplication that is evident on the face of this

   notice, it seems to us, represents a thumb on the scales of --

   on the scales of justice, as Judge Kelly wrote for the Tenth

   Circuit.

            Thus, your Honor, what the Government has done with

   this notice is to attempt in large measure to replicate the

   allegations of its very broad and sprawling indictment and then

   to couple that with aggravating factors that are either

   terribly vague so that we can't figure out what they're going

   to be or unnecessarily repetitious and duplicative.

            That process that the Government has done that in that

   fashion is not something that can be cured simply with jury

   instructions.  By the time we get to jury instructions, I

   respectfully submit, it's too late.  It's too late because the

   law requires a threshold showing of what the Eighth Amendment

   permits.  It's too late because to have us come to trial and

   say well why don't you just defend against everything and we'll

   see what sticks is a chilling -- it's like the Papal legate at

   the massacre at Beziers in 1109 who said, "Kill them all.  God

   will recognize his own."  It fails to give precision to the

   task that all of us are supposed to conduct at the trial of the

   lawsuit.



                                                                           89



            For that reason and those that are laid out in our

   papers, we respectfully suggest that the notice must be

   stricken and indeed the statute declared unconstitutional.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.

            Mr. Connelly, are you going to take the response to

   this?  Of course, my main interest is in your comments on

   McCullah, because that came after the briefing in the case.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor; and I'll try to go

   slow for Mr. Zuckerman.

            The federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 and the

   prosecution's allegations in the death penalty notice satisfy

   all three of the Eighth Amendment requirements as interpreted

   in McCullah and every Supreme Court case.  And I agree with

   Mr. Burr that essentially there are three requirements.  First

   is proportionality, the second is narrowing, and the third is

   individualized consideration.  Each of these factors may be

   done either at the guilt/innocence stage or in the sentencing

   stage.

            The Supreme Court held in Tison and Enmund that there

   must be some showing of culpable intent, some kind of

   intentional killing; and the federal death penalty act provides

   that for 3591(a)(2) by listing four mental elements that I

   believe it's conceded today satisfy the Eighth Amendment

   standards set forth in Tison.

            These findings need not be made at the guilt/innocence



                                                                           90



   stage.  The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Eighth

   Amendment does not require a different definition of the

   elements of an offense than that which the legislature has set

   forth to determine a verdict of guilt.  The key fact is that

   the intent requirement and those findings must be made by the

   jury at the time of sentencing and as a precondition to

   imposing a sentence of death.  There are alleged -- the

   statutory factors are alleged, the allegations are proper, and

   those findings are properly the subject, the gateway finding

   that need be made at the start of a sentencing proceeding.

            The second factor that must be satisfied under the

   Eighth Amendment is one of narrowing; and again, this narrowing

   factor may be done either in the terms of defining the offense

   or later on in the sentencing proceeding.  And the narrowing

   factor simply means that there must be some basis upon which

   this crime is distinguished from any other murder.  There must

   be something that makes this a more serious type of murder than

   every other murder covered by federal law.  

            McCullah is important in this respect because

   consistent with Lowenfield and other Supreme Court cases in the

   felony murder context -- hold that it is a sufficient

   aggravating factor that an intentional killing or a reckless

   killing was committed during the course of a different felony.

            In this case, consistent with McCullah, the death

   penalty notice alleges that the murders in this case and the



                                                                           91



   killing in this case occurred pursuant to five crimes.  Those

   crimes -- at least two of those crimes repeat the same crime

   that the defendant would have been convicted on.  There is

   nothing the matter with that.  That's exactly what happened in

   Lowenfield, that's exactly what happened in McCullah.

            In McCullah, the aggravating factor was if the killing

   occurred during the course of a continuing criminal enterprise

   offense.  That's sufficient to narrow the killing from any

   other killing, because many killings don't occur pursuant to an

   independent felony.  And the court held that was sufficient,

   and the court held that that finding was made at the guilt

   stage and it could permissibly be made and repeated again at

   the sentencing phase.  That's exactly what the statutory scheme

   in 3591 does -- 3592 -- I'm sorry -- and that's exactly what

   McCullah held was constitutionally permissible consistent with

   Lowenfield.

            The defendants have challenged these five crimes as

   duplicative.  It's important to note, I think, your Honor that

   they have five independent crimes that satisfy the standards of

   Blockburger, even though in this particular case, four of them

   that may have been committed by a single act -- they are not

   necessarily committed in every case by a single act.  And I

   think you have to look at the elements of the approach of

   Blockburger; and they are, in fact, five separate legally

   distinct crimes.  But the Government did not try to multiply



                                                                           92



   them and charge them as five separate aggravators; it charged

   them as one aggravator.  And I think any concern over

   duplication or repetition can be satisfied by the Court

   instructing the jury that this is just one aggravator; and the

   jury, indeed, must unanimously agree on at least one of those

   crimes as having been committed in addition to the intentional

   killing.

            THE COURT:  And there could, of course, be a change in

   the notice here as a result of the jury verdicts on the counts.

   Suppose there were some not guilty verdict, particularly with

   respect to the first three counts -- one or more:  We would

   have to alter the notice and the scope of receipt of

   information.

            Now, on this matter of receipt of information, as

   opposed to the receipt of evidence, I think you've already

   indicated in some of our discussions yesterday that you're

   prepared to live with some restrictions on information; that

   the Court could impose not necessarily the Rules of Evidence as

   such but restricting in some concept of fairness 403 and

   beyond.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.  We're confident

   that's provided for, I think, adequately in the statute; but

   certainly, the Court retains the discretion to insure that any

   evidence the Government offers is reliable and satisfies all

   the evidentiary standards and all the Eighth Amendment



                                                                           93



   standards.  And we're prepared comply with that, certainly; so

   I think in some respects that challenge is premature.

            It's talking about what if the Government introduces

   some kind of hearsay that might not be reliable?  We don't

   intend to introduce unreliable hearsay; but certainly, to the

   extent we ever sought to do that, the Court would be well

   justified in barring that and making sure that it's consistent

   with all standards of due process, the Eighth Amendment, and

   the statute.

            THE COURT:  Now, on the -- I think the thing that

   McCullah raises that is one of the things that's most

   concerning here to me; and that that is the weighing process is

   affected unfairly by stacking, duplicating offenses.  And

   that's something that I take it we would deal with if we got

   that far again in what factors actually get submitted to a jury

   in making the weighing the decision.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely, your Honor.  I think that

   is a teaching of McCullah: that the jury should not be offered

   multiple factors that are really the same thing and that there

   is a risk if there is really only one aggravating factor and

   you say it five different ways that the jury could take that to

   be that there really more aggravating circumstances than there

   really are in the case.

            THE COURT:  Another somewhat disconcerting factor to a

   trial judge in reading McCullah is that the reversal is on the



                                                                           94



   basis of an instruction to which no objection was raised.

            MR. CONNELLY:  That's right; but McCullah is the

   subject of an en banc petition right now, so I don't want to

   say -- and it's the Government's request.  The court has

   already denied the defendant's request for en banc hearing; but

   in any event, I think that's right.  I think that certainly

   there are issues, case-specific issues in McCullah that really

   don't govern this as much as the fundamental principle that you

   should not have duplicative aggravating factors.  Duplicative

   in the sense that they duplicate each other, not that they

   duplicate an element that the jury already found at the guilt

   stage.

            THE COURT:  The error of the duplication is that it

   affects the weighing.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  So duplication has to be measured in terms

   of what the jury gets to consider in weighing aggravating vs.

   mitigating.

            MR. CONNELLY:  And I think it's also to give an

   instruction at that point.  I think the courts have emphasized

   that the weighing should not be a quantitative type weighing.

   We should not be saying, Well, I count three factors on this

   side and five on the other.  It really is a qualitative

   weighing; and I think certainly, the Government is going to

   argue that the qualitative aggravating circumstances in this



                                                                           95



   case, the gross and heinous circumstances of the crime, are

   really the factors that need to be considered, and it's not a

   matter of, Well, if the defendants come up with five mitigating

   factors and we have one or two or three.  But, certainly, I

   think the teaching of McCullah is that you should not have

   duplicative aggravating factors, and I'll be prepared to go

   over the five statutory factors to insure and to argue to the

   Court that they don't duplicate.

            The first factor is that the --

            THE COURT:  Well, let me -- one of the other things

   that I guess is most -- of most concern here is the matter of

   fair notice and what Mr. Burr refers to as "vagueness."  And

   suggestion is made we could look to Rule 7(f) for a bill of

   particulars; but apart from whether a formal bill of

   particulars is required, you would agree, wouldn't you, that

   well in advance of trial, the Government could be required to

   disclose in some discovery fashion what it is you intend to

   rely on if there is a death penalty phase?

            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.  Although I don't agree with the

   notion that these factors somehow are vague or don't provide

   the adequate notice.

            THE COURT:  I know you're not going to concede that;

   but if there were a suggestion that you ought to give more

   detailed notice, you're prepared to do that, I trust.

            MR. CONNELLY:  We'll comply with whatever the Court



                                                                           96



   instructs us to do, obviously.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. CONNELLY:  I think, though, it's important to look

   at the statute and the statute requires the Government to set

   forth the, quote, "aggravating factor or factors"; and

   consistent with Rule 7 and with the principles of an

   indictment, it's sufficient generally to track the elements of

   the statute and --

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't know that the sufficiency

   about the pleading in an indictment controls us when we're

   talking about this notice.  I think, given what we're talking

   about, the nature of the penalty, more could be required.

            MR. CONNELLY:  We'll certainly comply with whatever

   the Court requires in that regard.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. CONNELLY:  But I think that the -- the listing in

   the notice does give fair notice to the defendant of what they

   need to be prepared to meet.  The first one is that the

   felonies were committed.  I think that he -- and again, I think

   it's important to read the notice in conjunction with the

   indictment.  The notice is not in a vacuum.  Notice is really

   based largely on the indictment.  And it's important to stress

   that each of the aggravating factors in this case relate to

   matters that the circumstances of the crime itself.  And we

   don't have, for example, in the pending case cited by Mr. Burr



                                                                           97



   in the Supreme Court -- we don't have an issue where we're

   saying impose an aggravating factor because the defendant is a

   future danger.  Each of the aggravating factors tie to the

   circumstances of the crime and to the effects it caused, and we

   don't have extraneous allegations that are not related in some

   way to the crime.

            The second aggravating factor is that the defendant

   knowingly created a grave risk of death to persons other than

   victims of the crime.

            THE COURT:  So what you're saying is a lot of the

   evidence at the trial on the counts charged would be referred

   to in the penalty phase without more proof.

            MR. CONNELLY:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And I think

   the statute contemplates that, 3593.

            THE COURT:  I think it does, too.

            MR. CONNELLY:  It talks about you can urge the

   transcripts and argue based on the trial evidence, so I don't

   think we're going to redo the entire trial.

            THE COURT:  And that's a lot of what you're relying

   on, as I look to, as you suggested, comparing the notice with

   the indictment.

            MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct, your Honor.  And they

   do tie into it, and it's not going to be a totally separate and

   unrelated proceeding.  Obviously, it builds upon the trial

   proof.  And a lot of it will be rearguing a lot of the same



                                                                           98



   evidence.  And the "knowingly created grave risk of death to

   other persons" I think certainly could be apparent by the

   nature of the bomb and the nature of the explosion.  That's

   substantially identical to the aggravating factors that have

   been upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of Proffitt, a

   Florida case, 428 U.S. at 256, the Tenth Circuit in a similar

   factor in Brecheen vs. Reynolds 41 F.3d at page 1360.

            The next aggravating factor is the defendants

   committed the crime after substantial planning and

   premeditation.  I think McCullah is dispositive of that point.

   McCullah upheld a similar type aggravating factor as one that

   the jury could readily understand with proper instruction.

            The next factor is that victims of the crime were

   particularly vulnerable due to their old age, youth or

   infirmity.  I think that is a proper factor under Payne vs. 

   Tennessee in which the court -- the Supreme Court held that

   victim impact evidence is a permissible consideration in a

   capital sentencing proceeding.

            The -- Mr. Burr made a factual argument that it's hard

   to understand in this case how anybody could have been more

   vulnerable than the next person.  I don't think it needs to be

   reminded that there were 19 babies and children in that

   building that could not have been more vulnerable.  There were

   360 people in the building approximately all told.  Not all of

   them died.  Some of them walked out on their own power.  And 
an



                                                                           99



   infant is incapable of doing that; so I think certainly we will

   be able to prove as a matter of fact that some of the victims

   were more vulnerable and particularly vulnerable than others.

   But that is a fact question; that is not something that causes

   any concern as a matter of law.  That's a proper aggravating

   factor as a matter of law.

            The final statutory aggravating factor is that among

   the victims were law enforcement officers as defined in the

   statute.  That's Section 3592(c) clause 14.  This again is a

   permissible aggravating factor.  It's been upheld by the

   Supreme Court in Roberts vs. Louisiana, 431 U.S. at page 636.

   So as a matter of law, your Honor, each of the statutory

   aggravating factors is proper, it's been properly alleged, and

   it's a factor that Congress could properly establish as an

   aggravating factor consistent with the Eighth Amendment

   jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.

            The final requirement of a capital sentencing

   proceeding is individuality.  The sentencing body must be free

   to consider mitigating circumstances of the crime, and it may

   also consider the Supreme Court has held individualized

   aggravating circumstances of the crime, whether or not they are

   prescribed in statute.  There can be no serious claim that

   non-statutory aggravating factors are permissible at this stage

   of the proceeding; and it's important to stress that the

   non-statutory aggravating factors are alleged not as a means of



                                                                           100



   narrowing the crime but as a means of allowing the

   individuality and the individual consideration of the crime

   that the Supreme Court has held is desirable and in some cases

   mandated.

            Again, McCullah is dispositive of any separation of

   powers challenge to the statute in this case, and McCullah

   clearly held the non-statutory factors may permissibly be

   alleged by the executive branch without running afoul of the

   constitution's separation of powers.

            The -- there is also a claim, I think made by

   Mr. Tigar, and I assume joined in by Mr. Burr, that the statute

   does not allow for aggravating factors to be imposed unless

   they are ones specifically provided for in the statute.

            I think the plain language of the statute rebuts that.

   Section 3592(c) of the statute provides expressly the jury, or

   if there is no jury, the court, may consider whether any

   aggravating factor for which notice has been given exists; so

   the key factor is just that notice be given.  And then notice

   was given, and we prescribed four non-statutory aggravating

   factors.  And again, the purpose of that is that is not to

   narrow the offense.  The narrowing is done by 3592(c) by

   Congress' listing of 15 factors and our listing of 5 factors

   from among those; but these non-statutory factors allow the

   jury to give individualized attention to the offense the same

   way that they'll be able to consider mitigating factors the



                                                                           101



   defense might offer whether or not prescribed by statute.

            The final argument is made -- I'm not sure it's the

   final argument, but the last argument I'll address, unless the

   Court has further questions, is that proportionality review is

   required.  And this argument is based on the notion that

   because the statute authorized non-statutory factors, it's

   somehow unconstitutional because it doesn't require an appeals

   court to consider whether or not the circumstances of offense

   are such compared with other killings that the death penalty

   should result.

            There is a dispositive legal answer to defendants'

   claim in Pulley vs. Harris.  The Supreme Court held that the

   Eighth Amendment does not require proportionality review.  But

   I think it's also important to step back a little bit and away

   from the legalistic notion and look at the common sense of the

   argument.  Proportionality review would require an appellate

   court to determine whether a death sentence is out of line with

   the sentences imposed in other similar cases.

            The perpetrators of this crime caused unprecedented

   death and carnage, the mass slaughter of 19 children and babies

   and killing of 149 others.  There simply is no other crime that

   a court could look to and say, Is this proportionality; would

   it be proportionate to impose a death penalty here as opposed

   to this other crime?  There is -- proportionality review is not

   only not required as a matter of law, it's really an



                                                                           102



   impossibility in this case as a matter fact.  If the death

   penalty would not be appropriate in this case, it's hard to

   imagine a case in which it said be.

            So for all those reasons, we would urge the Court to

   deny any motions to strike the death penalty notice and allow

   this case to proceed to a capital sentencing proceeding,

   assuming that guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt at

   trial.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Burr, do you have any --

            MR. BURR:  One brief response.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. BURR:  The notion that Mr. Connelly just

   addressed, I think, distorts our argument to a certain extent;

   and I think it's important to understand that.

            Our argument is not that a proportionality review on

   an appeal would come to a certain result and, therefore, it's

   required.  Our argument is that where there is no Congressional

   or legislative guidance given to the creation of non-statutory

   aggravating circumstances, which is what non-statutory

   aggravating circumstances are, then the Supreme Court, we

   submit, in the difference between Pulley and the California

   statute and Gregg and the Georgia statute has said there must

   be proportionality review as a safeguard against prosecutorial

   discretion to create non-statutory aggravating circumstances.

   It is a defect in the statute that we submit requires that the



                                                                           103



   non-statutory aggravators be stricken.

            It is not -- we do not rely on what would happen if

   there were a proportionality review on a subsequent appeal

   after a death sentence might be imposed in a case like this.

   That has nothing to do with our argument.

            THE COURT:  It's a structural argument that you're

   making?

            MR. BURR:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            Mr. Tigar.

            MR. TIGAR:  Two brief points, your Honor:  Our

   adversary used the terms "gross" and "heinous" in his argument,

   I think the transcript will reflect.

            Now, those are terms quite similar to those struck

   down as unconstitutionally vague in Godfrey vs. Georgia.  I

   point this out simply to underscore the need for a notice that

   is precise and narrow going into the proceeding so that all of

   the parties understand how narrowly focused the inquiry must

   be.

            But our principal point is this:  The Government does

   not yet seem to acknowledge that Lowenfield on which it relies

   involved a non-weighing statute.  We note that in McCullah, the

   offense charged against McCullah itself narrowed the class of

   death eligible persons.  The Government has told the Court, We

   don't have that here, but, all right, we'll narrow in the death



                                                                           104



   phase.

            They we get to the death phase, and the Government

   says, When we challenge them on these aggravating factors, We

   don't have to narrow in the death phase, either.  And I'm not

   mischaracterizing their claim.  At page 43 of their brief, they

   distinguish between statutory aggravating factors that narrow

   death eligibility -- I'm quoting -- and non-statutory

   aggravating factors that aid the sentencer -- i.e., that don't

   narrow -- and then go on for a page and tell us that these

   non-statutory aggravators don't need to narrow.

            The first problem with that as we point is that it

   violates the Supreme Court's guidance in Stringer about

   weighing statutes.  The second thing it does is it violates the

   express terms of this statute.

            This statute says that the jury is to make its

   decision based upon a review of all of the aggravating factors

   for which notice has been given; that is, every time a statute

   in 3592 and '93 talks about what the jury is supposed to do,

   they speak of aggravating factors.  The common sense meaning of

   aggravating is that it makes something worse than it would

   otherwise be.  It is impossible as a matter of simple English

   to understand, to think of an aggravating factor that doesn't

   narrow eligibilities.

            So the Government's argument as to the existence of

   these factors fails both as a constitutional matter because



                                                                           105



   they failed to grasp the Stringer imperative of a weighing

   statute and as a matter of statutory interpretation.

            THE COURT:  Well, these motions stand submitted.

   We'll recess till 1:30.

       (Recess at 12:03 p.m.)

            THE COURT:  Please be seated.

            We're ready to proceed on this petition of media

   representatives to permit sound feed to the courthouse

   pressroom to which Mr. Nichols filed an opposition, together

   with a motion to stop distribution of audio tapes and to which

   those petitioners filed a reply.

            And as I indicated earlier today, this was originally

   marked as a collateral proceeding.  But now, given Mr. Nichols'

   motion, we'll take it up in -- in connection with the criminal

   proceeding.

            And, Mr. Kelley, you represent these petitioners.  And

   I'd like you to begin and explain, maybe for some of us who are

   not technologically knowledgeable, about such things, what it

   is you contemplate here in the petition.  We do have a

   pressroom in a different building.  We do have a sound feed to

   another courtroom, which is, of course, subject to the controls

   of that courtroom.  The pressroom is not.  You're offering some

   kind of controlled delay here, and I'm not sure what it has in

   mind.

            One of the things -- and I'll just state this so that



                                                                           106



   you'll understand -- why I didn't establish this sound feed in

   the beginning is if we had it going to a courtroom, then we

   have the same containment as we do in this courtroom.  And that

   prevents someone from coming in, taping the tape -- I mean,

   taping the audio, or even doing what I think is now called

   real-time court reporting off of it, so that the concern that I

   have and the reason that I didn't set it up that way in the

   beginning is to prevent somebody from doing a contemporaneous

   radio broadcast of the proceedings.

            So tell me what it is you have in mind.

            MR. KELLEY:  Well, your Honor, what we have in mind,

   it assumes that the Court feels all right about the practice

   currently in effect.  Or that was in -- in effect until this

   morning.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, that's a different issue, and

   we'll address that, of course.

            MR. KELLEY:  And I don't want to go blathering on

   about that too much until I know how the Court feels about

   that.

            THE COURT:  I'm going to call on other parties about

   that, too, because we heard from Mr. Nichols and he was --

   counsel has filed on that, but we haven't formally taken a

   position -- had the other parties take positions.  So with

   respect to stopping what we were doing, I'll come back to you

   on that.  I would like to have you, though, lead off here as to



                                                                           107



   what this petition seeks.

            MR. KELLEY:  Well, the net, if you will, goal is

   simply to expedite and simplify the process of producing those

   tapes.  It is not -- and I emphasize this -- it is not to

   permit any kind of simultaneous broadcast of the proceedings

   from the pressroom.  And just so that your Honor understands,

   we're all playing by the same rules.  Had that been the intent,

   I would have said so.

            Obviously, that would be very different than anything

   that's currently in place.  But the idea is to eliminate some

   of the confusion and delay and -- and I hate to use the word

   "clamoring," but, naturally, there are a number of people

   interested in obtaining copies of these tapes quickly once they

   become available.

            And the idea is simply to permit the Court to utilize

   the expertise of the media who can take the sound feed in the

   pressroom and dub tapes for everyone very quickly and out of

   the way.  And in the process, that would also free up some of

   the seats taken in the auxiliary courtroom.  People can just

   sit down there and listen and do what they have to do.

            As far as broadcasting, we would be dealing with

   essentially the same procedure.  Nothing happens to the tapes

   until some -- someone takes them out of the courthouse

   building -- and by that, I mean the building next door as well,

   the pressroom -- and does whatever they would do with it, the



                                                                           108



   same way as though it were a tape issued by the clerk.

            And the only difference between that and the current

   process is that the media would be making the tapes with their

   dubbing machine.  I mentioned in a footnote -- and I assume

   this is not a big problem -- our goal is not to invade the fee

   schedule --

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't think that's --

            MR. KELLEY:  I didn't think --

            THE COURT:  -- a significant item.  We're not in the

   business of selling tapes to make a profit.

            MR. KELLEY:  That's -- it's something that's changing

   in state court.  I'm glad to hear it's not changing here.

            THE COURT:  It may in some years future.  I don't

   know.  But we do have appropriated funds to operate the courts

   right now.

            MR. KELLEY:  There are -- up on the hill in Denver,

   they are cutting back on those funds is the problem.

            The technology is something I'm a little bit more

   familiar with than the average person just from conversations

   I've had in the last few days.  I did not bring a technician as

   a witness, but I am told that they can rig the wire -- and I

   think it would be a single wire -- that would go to the

   pressroom so that this court can interrupt that signal at any

   time, and the signal can be delayed a matter of seconds or a

   matter of minutes, whatever the time the Court might think it



                                                                           109



   would need to -- to collect its thoughts to -- to press such a

   button.

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't know what's -- under what

   circumstances would that be utilized?  I'm not thinking what

   the practicality of that is.

            MR. KELLEY:  Well, let's just speak in terms of

   practicality.

            THE COURT:  I've got things to do other than throwing

   switches here.

            MR. KELLEY:  I've watched your Honor operate the sound

   system here and I -- I've been impressed over the years.  Your

   Honor, the kind of thing that I'm talking about would be, for

   example, in a hypothetical case, the Court suppresses from

   evidence a confession and in one of the pretrial hearings or

   even at trial, some witness blurts out something about a

   confession.  That is the -- the kind of thing which at least,

   potentially, the Court might want to use that device to prevent

   from further dissemination.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  So what I hear you saying is there

   are controls that could be utilized to prevent what would --

   what would otherwise be a contemporaneous radio or television

   broadcast --

            MR. KELLEY:  Well --

            THE COURT:  -- of the audio.

            MR. KELLEY:  Again, it is not a broadcast



                                                                           110



   contemporaneous.  They do have to receive it in the pressroom,

   run copies -- dub the tapes, as would happen in the courtroom

   and in the clerk's office, remove those from the building, take

   them back to the studio or -- or wherever they go in order to

   produce their broadcast.  I know of no one who plans on running

   a gavel-to-gavel coverage of the trial that way and -- frankly,

   the audio just doesn't carry that kind of interest.

            I don't know -- I remember listening to the "Maltese

   Falcon" radio version once and wasn't able to get past the

   first few minutes.  As a practical matter, what happens is it

   goes back to the studio --

            THE COURT:  Well, you're pretty young.  Doubtless, you

   can remember radio before television.

            MR. KELLEY:  I want to make it clear, I'm not old

   enough to have heard that during this time.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. KELLEY:  But to go back to the studio and as -- as

   counsel has pointed out in his declaration, sometimes they are

   aired briefly on the radio.  Sometimes they are aired briefly

   on the television with the sketch artist rendition of the

   speaker.  Obviously, that's not going to happen more than a few

   seconds, so even the picture of your Honor is not going to

   appear for any great length of time as part of a telecast when

   it's a nonmoving picture.

            THE COURT:  Quickly lose the audience, I'm sure.



                                                                           111



   Well, one of the objections being made here -- and it goes to

   the motion to stop the Court's provision of tapes -- is, I

   guess, the practice of what's come to be called sound bites

   where particularly interesting segments of someone's statement

   gets used to color and maybe misinform people of what's being

   done in court.

            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, if the --

            THE COURT:  Isn't that what they call it now, sound

   bites, at least in political circles?

            MR. KELLEY:  I think that's right.  But every time

   I've tried for a sound bite in here, the Court has interrupted

   me without any real -- your Honor, if there are no tape

   recordings available, the press are going to be free and are

   going to feel obligated to report some of the key remarks made

   in these proceedings, and I've given an example of sometimes

   how that is done.  Prosecutor So-and-So told the Court today in

   court, and I quote.  And the difference qualitatively between

   that and release of the actual statement is -- is virtually

   nil, your Honor, and certainly not the kind of difference that

   would meet the standard required before your Honor can keep a

   court record -- and I understand this to be a court record.  If

   I'm wrong, the Court will straighten me out.

            THE COURT:  Well, what we have here, the official

   court record is the transcript produced from the court

   reporter.  The ECR, as we call it, the electronic record, is,



                                                                           112



   in these proceedings, simply ancillary.  It is not the official

   record.

            Now, this differs from my practice -- the routine

   practice that you know that I've followed in other cases in a

   different courtroom where that sound record is the record and

   the tape is the official record.  So I wanted to make that

   clear, because I thought you might be thinking of what I do in

   other cases.

            MR. KELLEY:  Well --

            THE COURT:  And this is different in that the

   transcript is the official record.

            MR. KELLEY:  Be that as it may, this is a -- a record

   made by the Court.  And I presume one of the reasons it's made

   is if there is a question about the transcript, the tape can be

   used to resolve that question.  And that goes really to the key

   reason why this particular record is important in terms of

   public access.

            It is the most accurate record of the proceedings

   available.  It provides through the tone of voice and

   inflections and so forth more information than the cold, hard

   transcript.  And I would offer to cite to the Court a number of

   cases that recognize that distinction from an information

   standpoint.  So we are talking about information here that's

   not available from a transcript.

            We also have a problem of timing.  The Court has



                                                                           113



   already noted that timing issues are important in terms of the

   First Amendment right to observe these proceedings from the

   standpoint of the needs of the Court and the Government and the

   parties.  But it's also important from the public's point of

   view.  Contemporaneous reporting is the only thing the public

   is really interested in.  And it's what the public has a right

   to as I read the First Amendment cases.  And this is the only

   record that is available quickly.

            Transcripts can be ordered.  But when they come out of

   that machine the first time around, they are rarely anywhere

   nearly as accurate.  I think the interests of timeliness and

   accuracy in this case clearly outweigh any concerns about

   voices versus words.  And that's simply the only issue that's

   been raised as far as the release of this form of the record.

   I guess --

            THE COURT:  Well, I'll come back to you.  We'll call

   on other parties to state their positions.  Come back to you.

            MR. KELLEY:  Does your Honor have any questions at

   this point or should I --

            THE COURT:  No.

            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  I'll undoubtedly have some after I hear

   other voices.

            So who's arguing -- Mr. Neureiter, are you going to?

            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.  Reid Neureiter for



                                                                           114



   Mr. Terry Nichols.  Our view, your Honor, is that the audio

   feed to the courtroom -- or to the pressroom next door and the

   distribution of audio tapes are part and parcel of the same

   problem.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. NEUREITER:  So if you would like, I'd like to

   address both of those --

            THE COURT:  Yes, please.  Go ahead and do so.

            MR. NEUREITER:  -- at the same time.  First off, I

   would like to say it's with no small degree of trepidation that

   I approach your Honor for the first time officially in this

   court and ask that you stop a practice that you've been doing

   for ten years.  But as your Honor has stated more than once, a

   lot of things about this case are unusual.

            And your Honor's duty here is outlined in Nebraska 

   Press Association.  As quoted in Sheppard vs. Maxwell -- as

   quoting Sheppard vs. Maxwell, due process requires that the

   accused receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside

   influences.  Given the pervasiveness of modern communications

   and the difficulty of erasing prejudicial publicity from the

   minds of jurors, the trial courts must take strong measures to

   ensure that the balance is never weighed against the accused.

            So it's a balancing that the Court has to do, but that

   balancing is informed by the teachings of Sheppard and Estes

   and Chandler vs. Florida.  That -- especially in the high-



                                                                           115



   profile case, the notorious case, the case where press interest

   is great, there are extra dangers posed by excessive publicity.

            And so the Court in such cases must be extra careful

   and take extra measures to ensure that there is a fair trial

   had by the defendants.  And in this case, your Honor, I think

   that the Government shares many of the concerns that we share

   so -- a fair trial for all participants in this trial.

            Broadcasting of these proceedings is what bothers us.

   And the fact that there will be some delay if there is live

   audio feed as the technicians quickly dub it and run it across

   the street to the mobile studio or run it to another building,

   it is essentially the same thing.

            Whether it's a tape delay of several minutes or a tape

   delay of the afternoon before your Honor distributes -- or the

   clerk distributes the audio tapes of the -- audio tapes that

   are done in here of the proceedings, the proceedings will be

   broadcast.

            And the Supreme Court's teaching, as informed, I

   think, by recent judicial history in this country, whether it

   be the O.J. Simpson case or the Menendez case, shows

   broadcasting of the actual voices of the participants in a

   trial, be it witnesses or counsel, (1) distorts the behavior

   side and (2) poisons the atmosphere outside.  So it's a

   weighing that has to take place, and your Honor needs to

   recognize -- and I think your Honor has -- that this is an



                                                                           116



   unusual case of great notoriety.

            Let's get to the interests that need to be weighed,

   and I'll address the interests raised by the media petition

   first.  They mention in passing some constitutional concerns.

   Well, the Supreme Court has said repeatedly, most especially in

   Nixon vs. Warner Communications, that there is no right to

   broadcast court proceedings.

            The criminal rules say that there is no right to take

   court proceedings -- that there is no right to radio broadcast

   proceedings.  The rule is written before there was television.

   I'm sure had it existed when it was written, it would have said

   there is no right to televised proceedings.  And the rules of

   almost every federal district court prevents people in the

   audience from taping the proceedings, as does the rule in this

   court.

            The Fifth Circuit in deciding that the trial of

   Governor Edwards of Louisiana should not be broadcast and the

   Eleventh Circuit in deciding that the trial of Elsie Hastings,

   the former federal judge, should not be broadcast also say

   there are no constitutional considerations here.  There is no

   right of the press to broadcast proceedings or to tape

   proceedings.  What they do have the right to do and what the

   public has the right to do is come into court and listen and

   report.  And that's what they have been doing for 200 years in

   this country.  They are very good at it.  They write words down



                                                                           117



   very well.  And so they are fully capable of reporting

   accurately.  There is no constitutional consideration here.

            The second issue is -- I think your Honor addressed it

   already -- these are not the official records of this

   proceeding, so the cases cited by the petitioners talking about

   access to official court records isn't at issue here, because,

   as your Honor stated, the official record is the transcript,

   and that will be available to the media as soon as it's

   presented and as soon as they pay the money to get that

   transcript, so there's no official access problem here.

            And that would be similar to other district courts

   around the country where the court reporter has a tape

   recording.  The court reporter keeps that.  Nobody has access

   to it because it's not the official record, but the court

   reporter uses that to verify the accuracy of the official

   transcript.  And that's done in courts around the country, and

   I don't think anybody has raised a constitutional challenge to

   their inability to get at the court reporter's personal tape.

   So that was the other issue that they raised.

            Next was what Mr. Hartzler called the detrimental

   reliance argument.  You promised us, your Honor, we'll all be

   geared up and ready to go, and now you're changing the rules in

   midstream.  Well, we brought this motion because there's only

   been one hearing so far, and we've only seen once the

   effects -- the potential effects that broadcasting the actual



                                                                           118



   voices of counsel can have.  It's bound to get worse.  And we

   thought this was the appropriate time to raise this issue.  We

   did it as soon as it was apparent to us.

            So respectfully, I do not think that the detrimental

   reliance argument carries much weight at all, particularly when

   there are constitutional considerations for the defendants on

   the other side.

            One last issue is the right of contemporaneous access.

   And they cite the case of In re Oliver, taking out of context

   one little sentence that uses the words "contemporaneous

   access."  In re Oliver isn't a First Amendment case.  It was a

   case where a gentleman was tried in secret for contempt in the

   state of Michigan, and the court said it's a Sixth Amendment

   public trial question and the defendant has a right to a public

   trial.

            That right to a public trial does mesh in some ways

   with the First Amendment in the present public's right to

   attend a trial, but that is being adequately fulfilled and met

   in this case because the press is allowed into this courtroom

   and allowed into the courtroom next door and they are

   transcribing and writing the words of Professor Tigar and

   Mr. Jones and the other counsel here.  So that is not a

   problem.

            So that -- those are the interests that the media

   raises.  And then there's one that isn't stated very well, but



                                                                           119



   I think it's implicit in what they are saying, the

   entertainment value of having the actual words of counsel.

   It's great.  It fills a vacuum.  The media likes to report

   things.  And television needs pictures and television needs

   sounds and radio needs sounds.  And it's much better to have

   the eloquent words of counsel in this proceeding replayed over

   and over again than having the local television reporter

   telling people what happened -- what happened over and over

   again.

            Petitioners say there is really no difference between

   voice and words.  They are right in one respect and wrong in

   two respects.  They are right in the respect that there's no

   news difference in terms of voices being broadcast and the

   words being read by somebody else being broadcast.

            The information gets out.  And that's the First

   Amendment consideration, is the public being informed of what's

   going on.  The answer to that question is yes.  They are wrong

   in the respect of entertainment value.  It's a lot more

   entertaining, more people will watch it, they will put it on

   more times if they have the actual actors, the participants in

   this grand theater.

            They have those words.  Boy, they are going to play

   that many more times than they would if they had their local

   television reporter repeating what's said.  And so when I talk

   about fanning the flames of publicity without any informational



                                                                           120



   benefit, that's what happens when you actually have the voices

   of counsel being repeated over and over again.

            And then the third -- the second reason of why they

   are wrong about voices being different from words is the effect

   on the participants.  Estes says expressly and Chandler says it

   again, that there are immeasurable, incalculable, but

   nonetheless significant distortions in the behavior of people

   if they know that their voices are being broadcast or their

   images are being broadcast.

            I'm not sure if Coors Field has a Jumbotron but Camden

   Yards in Baltimore does, and you can look up and see people

   talking with one another.  And as soon as they recognize they

   are on camera, they start acting crazy.  I'm not sure that's

   necessarily going to happen in this case.

            THE COURT:  No, there's a modulating influence.

            MR. NEUREITER:  There certainly is, your Honor.  But

   I -- I attempted, your Honor, to persuade a rather famous court

   reporter to take the stand at this hearing because Chandler vs. 

   Florida says we're entitled to make a showing there would be a

   prejudicial effect, and she declined respectfully, saying she

   didn't think she would be able to cover this case anymore.

            But she has spoken publicly about her observations of

   different trials, and she compared the O.J. Simpson case and

   the first Menendez case with the trial of Susan Smith in South

   Carolina; the John Salvi trial, the fellow who was tried for



                                                                           121



   the abortion clinic shootings; and the second Menendez case.

   And her feeling was -- and she's -- she gave a lecture on this

   at Vail is my understanding -- is that there was demonstrable

   difference in the behavior of counsel.

            And one shouldn't forget, your Honor, that there will

   not just be counsel here talking, but, eventually, there will

   be witnesses at trial, people who will be intimidated enough by

   the -- the prospect of speaking in front of a full room, a

   federal courtroom of several hundred people, but the knowledge

   that their words will be transmitted, if not immediately at

   least, perhaps 10 minutes or 30 minutes late, to millions of

   people could have an intimidating and distorting effect.

            Now, we don't know what that effect is, but Estes and

   Chandler tell us that it is a distorting influence nonetheless.

   And in Chandler, the court says, quote, Yet it leaves no

   evidence of how the trial's fairness was affected.  And in --

   let me see.  In Estes, there's a great line.  Courtroom

   television -- but we would suggest that broadcasting of any

   nature is the equivalent of television -- introduces into the

   conduct of a criminal trial the element of professional

   showmanship.  An extraneous influence whose subtle capacities

   for serious mischief in a case of this sort, speaking of a

   notorious case, will not be underestimated by any lawyer

   experienced in the elusive imponderables of the trial arena.

            So the Supreme Court has recognized recent -- I think



                                                                           122



   the Court can take judicial notice of cases like the O.J. 

   Simpson case where it was a media circus outside, in part

   generated by the atmosphere inside, because of the knowledge of

   the participants that their words and actions would be

   broadcast on the outside.

            So your Honor has a decision to make at this point

   which will have an effect on the publicity in the case, the

   coverage of the case.  And we respectfully suggest following

   Justice Black's admonition in In re Murchison, our system of

   law has always endeavored to prevent the probability of

   unfairness.  Given two choices -- one, no distribution of

   tapes, something that's been done for many, many -- the

   standard practice in the federal system for many, many years,

   no distribution of tapes which will prevent broadcasting --

   that that is a safe path compared with the other path of

   distributing the tapes which will potentially fan the flames of

   publicity, potentially impact and distort the behavior of

   witnesses or counsel at trial; that given the imponderables

   here, the court should take the safer path.

            And in particular, we ask that because of the

   difficult prospect of the fairness hearing that Chandler says

   we would be entitled to at some point if we really did feel

   that we were being unfairly -- that Mr. Nichols was being dealt

   unfairly because of the broadcasting.  Chandler recognizes that

   it leaves no telltale signs.  It's very difficult to put your



                                                                           123



   finger on it, and yet the defendant is entitled to make a

   showing that he somehow got a -- a -- did not receive a fair

   trial because of the broadcasting.

            It is very difficult to do.  We may at some point, if

   your Honor decides to distribute the tapes, be forced to have

   that kind of a hearing, but it will make our job that much more

   difficult.

            So given the choice between risk, no risk, and no real

   countervailing -- no real countervailing interests on the other

   side -- because the reporters will be in every one of these

   public proceedings -- they will run out and they will report

   what happened, and they will have access to the official

   transcript within the day or the next day in order to ensure

   the accuracy of the reporting.  The countervailing interests

   are very small.  The potential for distortion and unfairness is

   great.  It seems to me, your Honor, we respectfully suggest

   that the choice is clear.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            Mr. Jones, do you or anyone on your team --

            MR. JONES:  Well, your Honor, I think the Government's

   position is aligned with Mr. Tigar's, at least if I read their

   papers correctly.  So I think it would be more appropriate that

   they would go next.

            THE COURT:  All right.  I'll ask for the Government's

   position.  Mr. Hartzler, are you going to address this?



                                                                           124



            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes, I will, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. HARTZLER:  As I told Mr. Neureiter yesterday, it's

   tempting for us to let the Nichols team take the heat on this

   one, but I do think that our position is important and perhaps

   slightly, but only slightly, different than theirs.

            It's very tempting for us to support the feed to the

   pressroom because, as you know, that might well open up more

   seats for the victims, which is what our interest has been from

   the very beginning when we started talking about seating.

            But I think the discussion of whether or not the

   pressroom can get an audio feed is really driven by what

   constitutes the official record.  I say that only because I

   can't see how we get past Rule 53 unless, as is your practice,

   the tape recording is the official record which is authorized

   by the Court.  If there's no official -- if the tape recording

   is not the official record and it's the court reporter's notes

   and ultimately the transcription, then it's somewhat of a

   fiction to send an audio feed into another room and somehow

   suggest that that's consistent with Rule 53, which flatly

   prohibits radio broadcasting from the courtroom.  I mean,

   indeed, it's radio broadcasting potentially from another room

   outside of the courtroom just because it's being fed from the

   courtroom.

            So I don't see any way around Rule 53 unless you're



                                                                           125



   able to overcome that by declaring the tape recording is the

   official record.  I understand that's not in the declaration,

   nor do I believe it should be.  As I speak to you, with the

   microphone in front of me, my voice is recorded both on a tape

   recorder and taken down by an associate of Mr. Zuckerman, who

   is generating stenographic paper tapes which I believe are part

   of the public record and to which the press and other members

   of the public would have access.  But, of course, no one is

   interested in that chicken scratch.  I mean, they want

   something that has substantially more pizazz.

            But I do think it's important to address exactly what

   we're talking about.  The tape recording does not become

   available until break and until they're duplicated.  In my

   conversations with Mr. Zuckerman, the official transcript is

   made available within a matter of hours after we appear in

   court.  It takes some certification, verification, and work

   behind the scenes, but it really is within a matter of hours.

   So we're not talking about any substantial delay in providing

   the record to the public.

            I also think, your Honor, that on behalf of the

   Government, we are very interested in maintaining the dignity

   and decorum of this proceeding, both inside and outside the

   courtroom.  Mr. Neureiter cites you examples including the O.J. 

   Simpson case which is reflected to myself and colleagues on

   behalf of the Government virtually every time we -- we make it



                                                                           126



   known to some new person, some stranger, that we're involved in

   the Oklahoma City bombing case.

            I -- I'm frequently asked, Oh, this is not going to be

   televised?  This isn't going to be a repeat of the O.J. Simpson

   case?  And of course, because you have already declared that

   no, there won't be any television cameras in the courtroom,

   I've always been able to say, No, don't worry, this is not

   going to be on Court TV.

            This last weekend I was in church here in Denver and

   exactly the same question which always comes up whenever I talk

   about this case, people would ask me, This is not going to be

   on television, is it?  And I -- I was able to, of course, once

   again, to say, No, it's not going to be on Court TV.  But I had

   to give the caveat and say it might be on court radio.  But I'm

   heartened to know now that there's not going to be any

   simultaneous radio broadcasts and that's not anticipated.

            But it's certainly that prospect that we could -- we

   would have concerns about if we were -- if we were to have the

   simultaneous feed into another room in which marshals were not

   present, in which your Honor was not present, which is not what

   we have if you have the simultaneous feed into an auxiliary

   courtroom, which is not what we have if you were to approve our

   motion for closed-circuit TV back to Oklahoma City.

            We're not asking you to have closed-circuit TV, nor

   would it be authorized, I believe, to send the closed-circuit



                                                                           127



   TV back into some pressroom in Oklahoma City.  It's going to be

   in a courtroom where the dignity and the decorum for the

   proceeding will be maintained.  That's our primary interest.

            As much as we would like to open up additional seating

   for the victims, I think that the American public is interested

   in seeing justice at work in a dignified setting.  And the

   concern we have is that that prospect is somehow defeated, as

   Mr. Neureiter suggested, by having the simultaneous broadcast,

   simultaneous feed, and then the rebroadcast.  And the reason

   the decorum and dignity is somehow affected is in part because,

   as he has suggested, the effect that it has on the

   participants.  Certainly, you can control counsel.  Hopefully,

   we can all control the witnesses.  But there is concern that

   with the prospect of the enormous hidden audience out there, it

   does have effect on people.

            There's another concern, which, of course, is Rule

   615, rule of federal -- Federal Rule of Evidence 615 regarding

   the exclusion of evidence which prohibits witnesses from

   hearing the testimony of others.  Now, I think that we will be

   able to propose controls so that should it become a problem if

   there is a closed-circuit TV feed into an Oklahoma City

   courtroom, I think we can -- we can address that issue.  But I

   don't know how we address it if there is a rebroadcast or a

   broadcast of these tape recordings to the nation.

            We all know that witnesses in every case can read



                                                                           128



   magazines and newspaper accounts, watch television and listen

   to radio.  But they don't hear the actual words of another

   witness.  And I'm concerned.  I do not know how we overcome

   that problem if the tapes are sold as they have been in the

   past in this case.

            Finally, I would refer you to the motion we filed this

   morning in support of closed-circuit television; in particular,

   the second paragraph.  If you wouldn't mind my reading it, it

   says, The clear import of Section 235 -- this is of the

   anti-terrorist act, the new one -- crafts a limited exception

   to the general prohibition on the televising -- and I would add

   broadcasting in general -- of court proceedings in Federal Rule

   of Criminal Proceedure 53.  Congress has essentially provided

   for an expansion of the courtroom by technological means to

   enable victims of crime who cannot attend the trial to view

   those proceedings in another courtroom by providing only for

   closed-circuit television.  And by imposing a number of strict

   limitations on the procedures to be used, Congress has

   expressed its intent simply to allow more of those directly

   affected by the crime involved to watch the trial.

            Well, if that is indeed the intent of Congress, then I

   don't know how we can disregard that by allowing the radio

   broadcast or the broadcast by means of any electronic media,

   television or radio, of these tape recordings.

            So it is our position, consistent with that of



                                                                           129



   Mr. Nichols, that you not authorize feed into the courtroom --

   into the pressroom, pardon me, unless it is clear it can't be

   taped and rebroadcast.  And I did not hear this afternoon that

   that -- that the media has any interest in it.  They want to be

   able to rebroadcast that.  I don't think they will be willing

   to accept that limitation.

            And beyond that, even if you were to -- that would

   eliminate the Rule 53 problem.  If you were to rule that the

   feed can go into the pressroom but it can't be taped, can't be

   rebroadcast, I think that we would be able to overcome the Rule

   53 problem and, potentially, the Rule 615 rule of evidence

   problem.  That's not -- you know, they are not interested in

   that.  They might as well get the written transcript, which I

   think is the official record, which I think should satisfy the

   media.

            THE COURT:  And you're also joining in the motion that

   the Court not release the audio cassette tapes?

            MR. HARTZLER:  We are.  With all due respect, your

   Honor, I would ask that we might at some point discuss

   eliminating the tape recording.  I understand that

   Mr. Zuckerman is not relying on the tape recordings and that

   perhaps is not a backup for his process.  You know the NFL

   eliminated its rule of the instant replay and is relying on the

   referee.  And I would say -- you saw this morning how

   Mr. Zuckerman serves in part as an adjunct, your Honor, in



                                                                           130



   terms of enforcing decorum when he told Mr. Connelly to slow

   down.  So I --

            THE COURT:  But I didn't join him in that request.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Well, my point is, though, you don't

   need to slow down when you have a tape recording.  The parties

   can talk on top of themselves under a tape recording.  You can

   still sort of discern it.  But there is some additional decorum

   in having the court reporter in the courtroom to have to tell

   people to slow down and not talk on one another.  I think there

   is value in the mere fact that we're using the court reporter.

            THE COURT:  So you want me to stop using the tape

   recorder entirely?

            MR. HARTZLER:  I'm asking if it is necessary.  I do

   not know.  I understand it is not necessary for generation of

   the official record.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I'll hear from counsel

   for Mr. McVeigh.

            MR. JONES:  Might I have just a word with my counsel?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, I neglected to --

   Mr. Jones, pardon me.  Could I make one other final point?

   There is a difference between the notes that Mr. Zuckerman

   takes and the tape recording.  And it occurred this morning

   when Ms. Wilkinson made a remark to me about I was wearing 
my

   power tie and I made a smart-aleck remark to her about I was



                                                                           131



   wearing a power something else.  Then the deputy came over and

   he said, Your microphone is on already.  There is a difference

   between what is in the official record and what these -- these

   tape recordings pick up, and I will --

            THE COURT:  There is an inhibiting force in knowing

   that everything you say will be --

            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes.  Yes.  And I will, of course,

   conduct myself differently in the future.  But I do bring to

   the Court's attention that we are at somewhat of a disadvantage

   here with this extra microphone.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Jones, are you going to

   speak to this?

            MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, the reason that I

   asked to speak last is that we honestly are in balance on our

   side -- that is, the McVeigh defense.  And I wanted to hear --

   although we are adversaries professionally, and I hope not

   personally -- I wanted to hear what Mr. Nichols' counsel and

   what counsel for the Government said, because I thought that it

   might influence our thinking on the matter; and in fact, it

   has.

            So I would like, since we are in balance, simply to

   tell you what the countervailing thoughts are in our mind.  I

   think the two strongest arguments made -- and they are

   compelling and persuasive in large part -- to not making the

   tapes available, either by commercial means or by an audio



                                                                           132



   feed, is first the question of the exclusion of the witnesses

   and the possibility that a witness that will testify later

   might hear something.  Of course, the witness could also read

   it in the newspaper.

            And I don't know whether these tapes have actually

   been broadcast and how many people would listen to them, but I

   can recall a precedent during the Watergate hearing -- and the

   Court will recall -- that the President released transcripts of

   his tape recordings, later challenged by the special

   prosecutor, Mr. Jaworski.

            But I remember that one of the networks did a

   dramatization in which they took the words of the transcripts

   released by the President and had those words spoken by actors

   and attempted to re-create the scene.  So I can envision that

   something like that might happen here, although the public

   interest in it would perhaps be small.  But the interests of

   particular witnesses might be great, so I think that

   Mr. Hartzler makes a strong argument in that respect.

            I think the second argument which is equally

   compelling and is upon us soon is the motion to suppress or

   actually motions to suppress in which the Court will be asked

   to rule on whether certain statements allegedly made should or

   should not be admitted into evidence and whether their

   admission might require a separate trial which will be heard in

   August.  And then there may be some questions concerning the



                                                                           133



   admissibility of certain physical evidence.

            And the broadcasting to the community at large --

   again, recognizing it still appears in print -- might impact

   adversely the right of the defendant where the Court had kept

   something out but the public was aware of it anyway through the

   broadcasting.  To me, those are the two strongest arguments,

   and I think they are, indeed, strong not to have the tape.

            On the other side, there are some arguments that I

   think are strong, but they don't have the immediate impact that

   the first two arguments have because they are less direct and

   they involve interests beyond just the interests of this

   particular trial.

            And I want to first start by saying that I think

   Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous statement that a good catchword

   can escape analysis for 50 years is particularly appropriate to

   the catchword "media circus" and the constant invocation of the

   O.J. Simpson case.  I don't think that's a valid consideration

   here.

            The O.J. Simpson case was a case involving a prominent

   entertainment sports personality who allegedly led the Los

   Angeles Police Department on a race across the freeways before

   he was surrendered, involved the death of his wife and the

   death of another young man.  And it being California, it had

   all of the elements that make for any daytime soap opera.

            None of those elements are present in this case.  This



                                                                           134



   is a state trial about a terrorist event which has political

   connotations.  I don't think anybody listens to this case for

   entertainment, nor do I think it is entertaining.  It is

   interesting, it is informative, and it serves the public good

   and the public's strength and knowledge by being that.  But I

   don't think it's entertainment.  And to that extent, I would

   disagree with my colleague.

            Now, it is true that the press and the radio and

   television are commercial enterprises and they always have or

   should have -- if you were a shareholder, you would want them

   to have -- an interest in the bottom line.  But such is the

   requirement for public knowledge.  PBS has fewer viewers than

   ABC, CNN and so forth, but it is an important case.  And there

   is a need and curiosity and desire of the public to learn what

   happened, if in fact this case will show what happened, and to

   be able to understand an unprecedented event in our history.

   And to that extent, I don't think it's a media circus at all.

            Now, candor compels me -- and I'm sure it comes as no

   surprise to the Court -- that, of course, each of the three of

   us are viewing this from our strategic interests.  I don't want

   to speak for Mr. Nichols, but it would seem to me from my

   perception of their strategic interest, the less said about

   their client, the less publicity, the better, because public

   focus hasn't been on Mr. Nichols.  If I were sitting in their

   place, that's what I would want to do.



                                                                           135



            The Government's position -- and again, I'm critical

   of it, and we'll address that at another time.  But just to

   give a sense to it, I would define as well the public attitude

   is that my client is guilty, and so let's just stop now.  We

   don't want to go any further or do anything to disturb that.

            From our standpoint, our strategic interest is that

   the more the public has an interest in this, the more the

   public asks questions about it, the more the public is

   skeptical, our client's immediate interests are served.  And

   respectfully, we submit the larger public interest is served to

   that extent.  Having these tapes released serves our purposes.

            Now, there -- it also disserves some of our purposes;

   for example, motions to suppress and other matters.  So at that

   point, we're in perhaps balance.  There are, of course, crucial

   differences between reading something in print and hearing it,

   and that's an argument that cuts both ways.

            But I think the bottom line is this:  Not necessarily

   this is the turning point, because I think Mr. Hartzler has a

   good point as to whether the Federal Rules would even permit

   this, but I think there's two considerations to keep in mind.

   Television coverage and radio broadcasting of the O.J. Simpson

   trial did not prevent his acquittal.  Television broadcasting

   and radio broadcasting of the Menendez trial did not prevent

   their conviction.  Television broadcasting and radio

   broadcasting of Klaus von Bulow's trial did not prevent his



                                                                           136



   conviction in the first trial or his acquittal in the second

   trial.

            So I dare say that the record is, at best, mixed on

   the ultimate impact of television and radio broadcasting on

   whether it casts an improper and prejudicial influence in the

   broadcasting of trials as opposed to that which leads up to it.

            And the last point -- and I've been criticized for it

   and that's all right and my shoulders are broad -- but I am

   disturbed at what I see as a growing pattern in this case to

   elevate the rights, feelings and emotions of what may be called

   the official victims -- in the sense that there is an official

   list -- above the rights of the rest of the citizens of the

   United States.  Private prosecutions have not been permitted

   since the statute of Edward I.  Ultimately, in this crime --

   because I don't think there's any dispute that it's a crime --

   the victims are the people of the United States.  Now, there

   are -- there is a class of people who suffer great physical and

   emotional loss and I don't in any way deprecate that, but if we

   are to understand what this is about and where guilt or lack of

   guilt belongs, then the true constituency here is the nation as

   a whole.  And I think that some respect has to be paid for that

   in this determination.

            So I leave the Court with that.  I don't know whether

   that's helpful or not.  Probably not, but I'm not charged with

   the responsibility of making the decision; your Honor is.



                                                                           137



            I would say there could be a couple of guidelines.

   I'm not really impressed with the argument that we might ham it

   up for the microphones.  I don't know that there could be any

   more hamming than what there is.  But we have had this for one

   day and I didn't see that the world collapsed because it was

   broadcast that night.  They gave a sound bite of Ms. Wilkinson

   and a sound bite of me and I think that most television, radio,

   and newspaper people are pretty fair about giving opposite

   views.  So that doesn't trouble me.

            We're here today.  I didn't notice any great public

   outcry.  I don't think the Court was flooded with messages and

   telegrams saying, Oh, no, don't broadcast this.  Perhaps the

   Court could try it experimentally and see how it goes.  Perhaps

   we could wait until the trial and then do it then.  I think

   that there are a number of variations here.

            I -- I would without any problem agree with

   Mr. Hartzler that I'm not comfortable with a feed to the

   pressroom that can be recorded.  I think if there's going to be

   a recording, it should be from the court's recording and I

   think we should continue the tapes.

            On the other hand, there is an argument to be made

   that since press seating is limited and there's more reporters

   interested than there is space available, that there is some

   advantage to letting them listen in the pressroom.

            Now, again, that doesn't prevent them from taping,



                                                                           138



   except that there is security arrangements in and out of there

   and so I suspect the risk is very small.  And perhaps that's an

   option that the Court could consider.

            THE COURT:  Mr. Hartzler raised something that I want

   to come back to, I guess, you, Mr. Neureiter, on and that is

   the suggestion that we not have the court's tape recording

   being done.  Do you have any --

            MR. NEUREITER:  No, your Honor.  We concur that

   that -- since it is not necessary and in other words --

   surplussage is in use in other contexts before your Honor -- I

   think it is, indeed, surplussage.

            THE COURT:  There's also a redundancy, however, which

   in other redundancy failsafe programs, we always have

   protection against the possibility of human failure.  And that,

   frankly, is the reason that I've done it this way.  Because

   I -- with all respect to court reporters, they are subject to

   sudden illness and a lot of other things that all of us are and

   there's always the possibility of something being lost.

            MR. NEUREITER:  That -- and there may be good reasons

   for it, your Honor.  Our main concern is that the tapes would

   be distributed and rebroadcast and so whether they are kept as

   a redundant feature or eliminated entirely, our main concern is

   that they not be distributed to be rebroadcast.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, Mr. Kelley, I told you I'd

   give you a chance to respond here.



                                                                           139



            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.  And it's the

   first time I've ever had half of the defense support on my

   side.

            Dealing briefly with the Court's suggestion that maybe

   the recording system ought to be eliminated from these

   proceedings --

            THE COURT:  Well, it wasn't my suggestion.  It was

   Mr. Hartzler's suggestion.

            MR. KELLEY:  I guess I was disturbed at how interested

   the Court was.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm interested in what the lawyers

   tell me all the time.  You know, he's speaking from a position

   here of -- that I respect, an interest in the case.

            MR. KELLEY:  Well, I have an interest in the case.  I

   am looking forward with great pride to the trial of this case,

   particularly after what is referred to as the Simpson

   spectacle, but I feel reluctant to interject my thoughts on an

   issue of maintaining the backup system.  But I would suggest

   that in most trials that I've seen, there is always some

   problem with the transcript.  Maybe it's not a big problem.

   But with all due respect to this reporter who -- who I know

   very well, that always comes up.  And airplanes have redundant

   systems.

            I should think this trial would be important enough

   that the Court would want to have a redundant system in place.



                                                                           140



   In any event, I would hope that the Court wouldn't curtail the

   redundant system simply to end a form of public access to this

   trial, which I submit is working.

            And I have not heard anything that I find

   convincing -- granted, I'm biased -- that says that there's

   anything wrong with the kind of coverage that has occurred as a

   result of the press having these tapes.  If anything, it has

   contributed to the accuracy of the reporting and possibly the

   interest in the reporting, which in a case like this, I submit

   is a good thing.

            The Government, your Honor, mentioned the act of

   Congress.  I don't really see what that has to do with this,

   but I would point out that Congress is not always attentive to

   the public's First Amendment rights.  It's a majoritarian

   institution.  And this court needs to be a little bit skeptical

   of what Congress does in that regard, particularly from the

   First Amendment standpoint.  Without casting any aspersions on

   this particular Congress, that's just the nature of the

   relationship between courts and Congress under the First

   Amendment.

            Concerning the Rule 16 -- 615 issues, your Honor, the

   availability of tapes, unless there's going to be some

   deliberate breaching of this court's instructions, is not going

   to make any difference.  The kind of reporting you get as a

   result of a media having these tapes is going to be less



                                                                           141



   detailed than the reporting you normally see in the print media

   with or without tapes.  If a witness is determined to listen to

   a tape, the witness is going to find some other way to breach

   this court's rules -- this court's instructions, which I assume

   is not going to occur, but it's certainly not going to be

   facilitated by the press having these tapes to use in doing

   their reporting.

            Mr. Jones mentioned the problem of suppression of

   evidence.  If there are suppression hearings, this court has to

   deal with those issues hearing by hearing.  If there is a cat

   getting out of the bag problem, the issue is whether the press

   should be here at all.  And I hope you'll give me a chance to

   argue those issues.  But --

            THE COURT:  Well, I -- you know, that's what I said in

   the opinion and order and I would --

            MR. KELLEY:  But if the problem is the cat getting out

   of the bag, the problem is not access to the court's tapes.

            Your Honor, we submit that if the court maintains this

   system for redundancy purposes, although it may not be dubbed

   the official record, it is something that is there for

   reference, for accuracy purposes; and for that reason, our

   position is it is a record of the Court.  And the Court ought

   to apply the appropriate test before denying public access to

   that record, just as it would any other record it maintains as

   part of its proceedings.



                                                                           142



            Dealing with the concerns about decorum, obviously,

   it's not going to make any difference inside the courtroom.

   The courtroom is going to look exactly as it did today or as it

   did the last hearing.  The recording device is in place and

   it's not visible to anyone.  Just in terms of the physical

   effect upon the courtroom, there is none.

            In terms of effect upon the trial participants, your

   Honor, there are -- there's considerable debate right now about

   whether cameras in a courtroom really have any effect upon

   trial participants.  I've spoken to California lawyers that

   think Johnny Cochran was better behaved as a result of cameras

   being in the courtroom.  I don't know if that's true or not.

            But I submit, your Honor, that the behavior of counsel

   and witnesses in a courtroom is not a function of someone's

   knowledge that there's a recording system in place and some of

   the words that are said might be broadcast.  It's a function of

   the court's control over the proceedings.

            And unfortunately, that -- the Simpson case was not a

   good example, but I've tried cases in front of your Honor.  And

   I just don't think the Court is going to find that there are

   going to be behavior problems on the part of counsel or

   witnesses in this courtroom as a result of the recording system

   being there.  And I think your Honor can probably discern that

   from your own experience better than my argument is going to

   inform you, so I'll just leave it to that.



                                                                           143



            As far as what happens outside the courtroom, again,

   the difference we're talking about here is strictly between

   voices which are played as part of a newscast and an anchor

   perhaps repeating exactly the same words, as the anchor would

   have the right to do.  I submit that the distinction between

   those two means of reporting only enhance the public's

   perception of the decorum in this courtroom, only enhance the

   public interest and only enhance the accuracy that -- of the

   reporting that the public receives.

            The proposal that transcripts be prepared simply

   doesn't work in terms of what the public expects in the way of

   reporting on these proceedings.  The transcript cannot be

   prepared in time for the broadcast which the public expects at

   the close of the day and in the evening.

            Does the Court have any questions?

            THE COURT:  Well, I have them, but I'll ask myself

   those questions, I think.  I think you've helped -- all counsel

   have -- to articulate the balance here, as Mr. Jones refers to

   it.

            MR. KELLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.

            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Mr. Neureiter.

            MR. NEUREITER:  After conferring with co-counsel and

   Mr. Nichols, we concur with your Honor's feeling that a

   redundant system being in existence -- that, in other words,



                                                                           144



   having the tapes is a good idea, but distributing them is not a

   good idea.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. HARTZLER:  May I comment on that?

            THE COURT:  You may.

            MR. HARTZLER:  I'm familiar with the redundant system.

   I don't know whether your court reporter keeps a tape

   recording.  I think we were assuming that that is the case,

   which I believe is a common practice, but I don't see a small

   tape recorder that is customary so maybe there is no tape

   recording.

            THE COURT:  Well, not only that, this is a track

   system so it's not as simple as just a tape recorder.  Under

   this system, we know what microphone is activated and who's

   speaking.  And it's much more accurate than just a sound

   recording.  So it is different.  All right.  This matter stands

   submitted, too, and I'll deal with it.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor --

            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr.

            MR. JONES:  I would like to ask if the Court would

   consider an in camera session with respect to a matter that

   arose yesterday which I have some information on that I believe

   may be of interest to the Court and other parties.

            THE COURT:  All the parties?

            MR. JONES:  Yes.



                                                                           145



            THE COURT:  All right.  We can do that in, what, 15

   minutes?  In the chambers that you were in when we started

   yesterday.

            MR. TIGAR:  May I inquire through the Court to

   Mr. Jones whether this in camera is one which under Rule 43,

   the defendants' presence is required?

            MR. JONES:  I wouldn't think so.

            THE COURT:  The answer is no from Mr. Jones.  We'll

   have the -- Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols available.

            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you, very much.

            THE COURT:  So in the event it is necessary, they will

   be able to attend.

            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll see counsel then in 15

   minutes.  Court is in recess.

            (Recess at 2:33 p.m.)

            (The Court reconvened in chambers, in camera, at 2:47

   p.m.  Those proceedings are not herein transcribed, pursuant to

   Court order.)

 PROCEEDINGS

               THE COURT:  Please be seated.

               We're convened in No. 96-CR-68, United States vs.

      Timothy James McVeigh and Terry Lynn Nichols, for the purpose

      of hearing a number of motions.

               I think we should begin with the entry of appearances

      of those counsel who are going to participate.

      for Terry Lynn Nichols.  Mr. Nichols is present in court.

               THE COURT:  Mr. Nichols.

               MR. WOODS:  Ron Woods.



                                                                 



             MR. THURSCHWELL:  Adam Thurschwell.

             MR. NEUREITER:  Reid Neureiter.

             MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, Mr. Neureiter is a new member

    of our team from the firm of Williams & Connolly in Washington,

    D.C., that your Honor signed the order for.

             THE COURT:  Mr. Neureiter.

             I have, I think, a matter of old business, in that

    when we were last together on February 28, and in connection

    with defense motions regarding grand jury matters, at that

      time, the Government submitted under seal some transcripts, and

      then it was agreed that additional material would be submitted,

      and it was on March 11.  And I have reviewed, as we agreed that

      I would, the transcript of the empaneling of the subject grand

      jury by Judge Thompson on January 3 of 1995.  Also a transcript

      of Judge Cauthron's instructions to the grand jury at the

      Tinker Air Force Base on April 25, 1995, which included an

      additional voir dire of grand jurors regarding the events of

      April 19 and following.

               Also, I have reviewed the motion and order to extend

      the term of the grand jury, an order signed by Judge Russell.

               Also, a partial transcript, at least of testimony of

      Jennifer McVeigh, transcripts dealing with procedures and

      questions -- well, procedures dealing with questioning by grand

      jurors themselves and a couple of transcripts where there were

      questions, and then material dealing with the grand juror,



                                                                 



    Mr. Heidelberg.

             I think that the best procedure for us to follow on

    that probably is for me to do a written order making my

    determinations on the basis of what I reviewed.

             I would say simply preliminarily that I do not think

    that further proceedings are necessary with respect to those

    motions, and they will be disposed of on the basis of the

    information that has been made available; and that is, of

    course, I'm operating on the assumption that Government counsel

      have provided to me all that is pertinent.

               I think, Mr. Mackey, you undertook to do that.  Wasn't

      it you who had that?

               MR. MACKEY:  Actually, Judge, in conjunction with

      Mr. Hartzler.

               THE COURT:  And Mr. Hartzler.

               So you're confirming, I take it, on this record that

      you've provided the things that were pertinent to the motions

      as agreed.

               MR. HARTZLER:  That is correct.  We reviewed all of

      the transcripts of conversations with grand jurors when there

      was not a witness present and gave to you, I believe, the

      portions of all transcripts that referred to any questions or

      procedures for questioning by the grand jurors.

               THE COURT:  Yes.  And then the Heidelberg matter

      included a declaration of someone with knowledge, and I have



                                                                 



    that.

             MR. HARTZLER:  Right.

             THE COURT:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'll follow this up

    with an order that I think makes the recitals that I feel

    appropriate to make and still comply with the provisions of

    Rule 6 regarding grand jury secrecy.  I simply wanted to make

    that a matter of record and follow up to where we were on

    February 28 when these matters were before us.

             Now, we have today discovery issues and motions

      dealing with the matter of Brady against Maryland, and also

      there are these possible issues under the Classified

      Information Procedures Act, CIPA.

               I have -- I guess the most recent filing was the

      filing yesterday by Mr. Jones, designated defendant McVeigh's

      proposed procedure for the April 1996 hearing.

               In reviewing that, I find that there is, I think,

      something of a combination of things.  Mr. Jones has asked that

      I follow a procedure taking item by item; and I think this

      tracks with the December 21 material for discovery but now

      asking for specific ruling on a number of items.

               In reviewing them, Mr. Jones, it seems to me that we

      have a combination of things, some Rule 16 matters.  Some, I

      suppose, are Brady matters.  And in thinking about where we

      are -- and there has been an exchange back and forth here about

      the compliance or lack thereof with respect to the agreements



                                                                 



    on discovery -- and this refers back to an agreed order that

    was entered earlier by Judge Alley -- it appears that the --

    not unexpectedly, I suppose -- that agreement has broken down

    and that we don't -- we're not now in full agreement.

             And as I've thought about the areas of disagreement

    insofar as they're revealed in the papers filed, I think we

    should break these areas down.  I think that we should talk

    about Rule 16 discovery and where we are with respect to that.

    And that, I suggest, is the first order of business here.

               And then the second thing is these differing views

      about Brady.  And of course, the problem with Brady vs. 

      Maryland and the following cases is that they're all

      retrospective cases.  They're all cases that identify what the

      Government should have done in hindsight after the trial; and

      it is very difficult to deal with that kind of problem

      prospectively before trial, because the Court is not in a

      position to be fully informed with respect to what the evidence

      is or what the information is, whether it's evidence or not

      that might be a part of the Government's obligations.

               So to the extent that there may be some dispute about

      the law governing what the obligation of the Government is

      under the Constitution, I suppose that can be discussed; but I

      don't know how a court is in a position to say that this should

      be disclosed or this area should be inquired into and the like.

               Then we will address this matter of CIPA, also; but



                                                                 



    here again, we have the unusual posture of -- The normal thing,

    of course, is that the Government comes forward and asks for

    the Classified Information Procedures Act procedures to be

    implemented because there is a matter either because the

    Government is going to use it or the defense has given notice

    that it intends to use classified information, whereupon there

    has to be a determination should it be declassified, redacted

    or whatever.  We're in an unusual posture here in that the

    defense is suggesting that classified information be produced

      for the defense in preparation of a defense; so that's another

      area of some discussion.

               But in my note, in my sense of orderly procedure, I

      think we ought to start with Rule 16 and see where we are on

      that.

               So, Mr. Jones, you seem trying to proceed.  You may.

               MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, your Honor, at

      the time that we filed the motion about which your Honor is

      addressing -- the lengthy one -- we were not certain at that

      time how far our agreement with the Government would go or

      whether we could reach an agreement, not certain about how the

      case would unfold in terms of time; and so as your Honor has

      correctly noted, we included a number of Rule 16 items in the

      motion.

               However, the Court has subsequently entered an order

      granting us until April 21 to file a Rule 16 motion; and we



                                                                 



    will file such a motion.  And I --

             THE COURT:  I think what I said was until April 9 or

    thereafter as necessary.

             MR. JONES:  Right.  Well, we will file the Rule 16

    motion.

             I would like to --

             THE COURT:  By what date?

             MR. JONES:  Well, I thought we had one date, but

    Mr. Wyatt --

               THE COURT:  Well, we can set a date today.  I mean

      that's --

               MR. JONES:  I thought it was the 21st, but Mr. Wyatt

      is more knowledgeable about it than I am.  But in any event, we

      are filing a Rule 21 -- I'm sorry -- Rule 16 motion, and I

      would like to ask the Court to consider whether it might be an

      expeditious saving of time to defer those matters that are

      addressed in that motion, Rule 16, until the Court hears the

      Rule 16 motion because they will be included in that motion.

               The reason for the delay in filing the Rule 16 motion

      is that the method of production of discovery to us by the

      Government -- and I don't mean to be critical in saying this,

      but it has been in a fashion that it is difficult to track what

      has been given and whether it is complete.  And we brought with

      us this morning the book that contains all the inventories, and

      we are attempting -- I'm not sure how successfully -- but we



                                                                 



    are nevertheless attempting to determine before we file the

    motion what has already been produced so we don't have to

    relitigate or repurchase the same real estate twice.

             So I would like to ask the Court this morning simply

    to exclude the Rule 16 matters until that motion is filed.

    They'll be included in that motion, and then all the Rule 16

    matters will be before the Court, and we could then proceed

    only on those matters that we classify as Brady or exculpatory.

             THE COURT:  Well, your proposed procedure for today's

      hearing and the hundred-and-some items include Rule 16 matters.

               MR. JONES:  It does, your Honor.  And I'll be glad to

      discuss those today if the Court would like to do that, because

      they clearly are Rule 16.  I was just simply trying to --

               THE COURT:  Well, that's fine with me.  I was just

      following up on what you filed yesterday, land I thought what

      you were suggesting is that we go through each of these

      matters, item by item, which seems very tedious and probably

      unnecessary.

               MR. JONES:  I agree with your Honor.  We did submit

      that yesterday; and then in the process of thinking about it

      further overnight and knowing the number of issues that the

      Court had today, we just thought that it might be a better

      savings of time to put all the Rule 16 material together.

               THE COURT:  All right.  So what you're now suggesting

      is that by the 21st of this month you would be seeking,



                                                                 



    actually, like a motion to compel --

             MR. JONES:  Exactly.

             THE COURT:  -- under Rule 16.

             MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

             THE COURT:  Now, Mr. Tigar, are you -- where are you

    on Rule 16?

             MR. TIGAR:  Mr. Woods, your Honor.

             THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Woods.

             MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we

      have not filed a Rule 16 motion.  We have not filed any motion

      to go through various items.  As I represented to the Court

      back in January, it was my feeling that the Government was

      going to produce the discovery.  They have done that.  We have

      over 20,000 witness statements.  We have over 5,000 items of

      physical evidence in our possession, and it's going to take a

      lengthy time to digest all of that to figure out what we don't

      have, if there is anything that we don't have.

               But as Mr. Jones represented to the Court, the way

      this has been produced to us is just in one huge mass volume,

      and it's not a matter of we can go right to one point and say

      yeah, here this is.  We have the 20,000 witness statements in a

      numerical order.  They're not even in alphabetical order.

      They're in numerical order as they were filed into the FBI file

      over the past year.  And so it's just a matter of having to

      read and digest all of that.



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  Well, I thought there were some matters

    that are indexed from what I got from Mr. Jones' papers.

             MR. WOODS:  They're broad categories that the

    Government classifies as Brady, where they list various

    witnesses in these broad categories.

             THE COURT:  Well, isn't there an index to the --

             MR. WOODS:  There is an index with names, your Honor.

             THE COURT:  To the 302's.

             MR. WOODS:  There is an index, but they're filed in a

      box in numerical order.  We do have an alphabetical index, yes;

      but my point to the Court is it's going to take us some length

      of time to digest all of this before we can address a discovery

      motion pointing out what, if anything, has not been given to

      us.  And so basically, my position is I don't have a complaint

      on discovery at this time until I can digest everything that

      I've been provided by the Government.

               THE COURT:  Do you have an expected date by which you

      might be able to have that all sorted out?

               MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor, because it's going

      exceedingly slow.  We have a number of investigators and

      lawyers working on it, but I think we're only through 4,000 of

      the 20,000 witness statements, and we've been at it a couple of

      months.  It's -- it is very fact-intensive.

               THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, all right.

               We have Ms. Wilkinson.



                                                                 



             MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, perhaps it would benefit

    all of us if we could go over what we have in fact provided to

    the defense.  I believe that although you want to deal with

    Rule 16 and Brady separately, which we believe is advisable, I

    think some of these issues overlap.  And if I could just give

    an outline for the Court of what we've provided so far.

             THE COURT:  All right.

             MS. WILKINSON:  We have provided 13,640 FBI 302's,

    which as you know are some list of witness statements when the

      FBI interviews potential witnesses and follows other

      investigatory leads in this case.

               We have also provided 7,429 FBI inserts, which are

      similar to 302's, although they normally report negative

      information.  That's a total of 21,069 potential witness

      statements.

               We have provided --

               THE COURT:  If I may interrupt a moment.  The inserts

      are contacts but not productive?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Normally, your Honor, they're not

      productive.  We can't represent that a hundred percent because

      some other field offices have in fact used an insert the way we

      would use a 302, but normally that's the division.

               THE COURT:  Thank you.

               MS. WILKINSON:  We have provided two master indices

      for these FBI 302's.  One is by witness name.  The other is by



                                                                 



    serial number.  All of the 302's and the inserts are marked by

    serial number, and that way we can determine that we have, in

    fact, produced those 302's from 1 to 13,640 and that we're not

    missing any of those.

             THE COURT:  What does serial number mean?

             MS. WILKINSON:  That is the number we use when the

    document comes in from our investigator.  It's a way of us

    keeping track of all the reports that come in from around the

    country in connection with this case.

               THE COURT:  So at the -- just a numerical sequence.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  And we're providing those

      reports to the defense in that sequence so that we can insure

      that we are providing all of the reports.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Those indices are printed out for them

      in hard copy.  They're also provided on a disc so that they can

      conduct searches, you know, if they're looking for certain

      names or certain serial number.  So they have the hard copies

      of those reports.  We also have provided 2 CD-ROM discs which

      we are in the process of updating, which have the 302's on the

      disc so that they will be able to search those CD-ROM discs for

      the actual material that is on the hard copy of the 302.

               THE COURT:  And the search is through the serial

      number?

               MS. WILKINSON:  No, it's through the actual -- it's



                                                                 



    like a NEXIS search or Westlaw search.  You have the CD -- say

    Strassmeir, I know someone Mr. Jones is interested in.  You

    find the 302, and the whole report which discusses

    Mr. Strassmeir or anyone who has had contact with him.

    Wherever his name would come up, that report would come up.

             THE COURT:  And if there were multiple 302's relating

    to him, they would all --

             MS. WILKINSON:  The search would provide that just

    like when you search for cases and --

               THE COURT:  Well, don't presume too much.  I don't do

      those searches.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Perhaps when your clerk searches --

               THE COURT:  Yes.  All right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  -- Brady cases.

               We have, as you know, thousands of pieces of physical

      evidence.  The defense, both teams, have reviewed over

      93 percent of that evidence.  I believe Mr. Tigar's team has

      reviewed 95 percent and Mr. Jones' team has reviewed 93 percent

      that includes virtually all of the crime scene evidence.  We

      have another meeting with them at the end of this week where

      they will be reviewing most of the other evidence that they

      haven't seen.

               We have provided them with over 10,000 photographs,

      400 videotapes.  We have provided them with copies of all of

      the physical evidence that we have requested, and we are up to



                                                                 



    date with those copies.

             We have also provided a inventory of that physical

    evidence.  We call that physical evidence 1B, bulky evidence.

    That's how the FBI marks it.  And we have approximately 4,037

    separate items which can include hundreds of pages.  That is on

    an inventory on a disc and on a hard copy.  Same thing:  The

    defense can search that disc to look for specific physical

    evidence.

             We've provided them an inventory for 1A and 1C, which

      are other types of paper evidence that sometimes come into the

      case but which the Government doesn't intend to introduce at

      trial.

               THE COURT:  Yes.  So when you're using the word

      "evidence" here as in physical evidence, you're talking about

      what you're now expecting to use at trial?

               MS. WILKINSON:  On the 1B list is -- it's what we

      could use, your Honor.  I wouldn't say we intend to use all of

      that physical evidence; but compared to the 1C and the 1A,

      which are generally not going to be used as evidence, these are

      the more likely ones.

               THE COURT:  These are things that are expected to have

      some probative force.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

               On the 1A inventory, there is approximately 6,550

      items.  Only 125 of those are potential government exhibits,



                                                                 



    and we have taken and copied all of those and provided them to

    defense counsel as well as the inventory of the complete 6,550

    items.

             The 1C has only 530 items, and we've provided that

    inventory.

             We've also provided 1,305 hotel and motel records,

    which include 44 registration cards by the defendants McVeigh

    and Nichols.  We have also provided printouts of the guest

    registration lists of those hotels where the defendants stayed,

      which includes 70,286 different guests.  So if they're looking

      for witnesses to interview about these events, obviously they

      have a voluminous list of people that they can contact.

               We have provided telephone records including a full

      inventory.  We have specifically given them 2,464 individual

      telephone records.  We've provided an inventory on disc and in

      hard copy again so that they can search for that information.

      And perhaps most importantly, we've provided them 325

      laboratory reports as of today.

               Those laboratory reports provide all of the

      information we have thus far on what our lab has done in terms

      of testing all of the physical evidence that's involved with

      this case.

               When we turned over the 302's, your Honor, not only

      did we provide the inventories and the indices, but we

      categorized certain witness statements as arguably Brady.  In



                                                                 



    other words, we marked certain witnesses and serial numbers,

    provided them in six different categories.  As to the 302's, we

    marked 2,236 as arguably Brady.  That is under a very liberal

    interpretation of Brady following your guidance from our first

    hearing with you.  We marked 1,567 at Category 1, which are

    John Doe 2 or other suspects.

             Those 302's, your Honor, involve every time the FBI

    receives some kind of credible information about another

    suspect or someone else who knew John Doe 2 or thought they had

      seen him or identified him.  They went out and interviewed

      those witnesses, did the follow-up and prepared a 302.

               We've also provided 1,270 inserts which are marked

      arguably Brady, and 1,075 of those are in that John Doe 2/other

      suspects category.

               As for grand jury, your Honor, we have not turned over

      grand jury to the defense, however, we have done a Brady review

      of that grand jury; that is, looking for anything that's

      arguably exculpatory as to both defendants.  We provided a

      letter to defense counsel noting two statements by witnesses

      that we specifically believed could be Brady, and we also

      referred them back to numerous 302's of witnesses where the

      Brady that we found in the grand jury was the same that was

      contained in the 302 of the witness.

               As for the grand jury, they have 302's of virtually

      all of those witnesses that are in the grand jury; so the only



                                                                 



    thing that we've withheld as to grand jury are things that we

    believe are pure Jencks Act material under 18 U.S.C. 3500.

    That is, we provided the Brady.  We're just withholding the

    statements of persons that we are not sure whether they're

    going to be witnesses or not.

             The final category I think that falls under Brady that

    the defense is interested in are threats to the Murrah Building

    and claims of responsibility.  We have told them that we are

    analyzing the information that we have as to that and will

      provide it.  However, we have already determined that we have

      provided 240 302's and 42 inserts that discuss potential

      threats and claims of responsibility for this bombing.

               Those, your Honor, are normally not people who called

      in and said, I did the bombing, but they're normally, "I think

      my brother-in-law was involved in the bombing," or "I think

      someone else was involved with the bombing," or "I think the

      Iraquis were involved with the bombing," or whatever the name

      of the nation.  So that's been documented in those 302's which

      the defense has had since our beginning production in January.

               We have been doing this all since last August, when

      we -- the Court at that time signed an order.  We have had

      meetings with the defense counsel on a biweekly basis for them

      to review the physical evidence.  We've made these major

      document productions on a monthly basis since January; and

      whenever the defense calls or writes us letters or asks for



                                                                 



    additional follow-up information, we have either tried to

    provide that information or written them back, saying that we

    decline to produce that material because we don't think it's

    discoverable, we don't have that material, or we're going to

    produce it at a later date.

             THE COURT:  I have a couple of questions.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

             THE COURT:  One -- and I don't remember whether I've

    asked this before, frankly:  Were there orders here for

      electronic interceptions, or do we have wiretap or oral

      interception orders in this investigation?

               MS. WILKINSON:  We do as to other witnesses, your

      Honor, but not to the defendants.  And we have provided those

      tape recordings in that voluminous bulky evidence that I talked

      about that's denoted 1B evidence.  We've provided the tapes and

      transcripts and transcripts of those wiretaps.  We have not

      provided, except for one incident, the supporting affidavit and

      the applications and orders because it is our position that the

      defense doesn't have standing to challenge those.

               THE COURT:  They don't.  All right.

               Now, one of the things in reviewing Mr. Jones' paper

      filed yesterday:  An area of inquiry here includes, I suppose,

      what the Government knows about contents of the building before

      the explosion, whether there were explosive materials within

      the Murrah building.  Have you done something about that?



                                                                 



             MS. WILKINSON:  We have, your Honor.  There are 302's

    indicating that the ATF and the Customs Service did have some

    inert explosives in their possession and other explosives used

    during their normal course of business, investigating cases and

    training their employees.  Those are documented in 302's.

    There are also statements.  There are allegations that ATF had

    materials inside and they were carrying out another explosive

    device.  That's been documented through interviews and 302's

    for the defense and for the Government for our investigatory

      purposes.

               THE COURT:  Okay.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I should point out that of

      those approximately 21,000 witness statements -- we're not

      planning on calling 21,000 witnesses, in case you were worried.

      We are providing all of those so that the defense basically

      knows our investigation which, as you know, is very unusual in

      a Federal criminal case.  The law, the statutes, do not require

      us to produce those types of statements.  We only normally

      produce statements of the witnesses we intend to call; but

      because of the nature of this case and because we want the

      defense to have the information they believe they might need,

      although we don't believe much of that is Brady, for their

      investigation, we have provided.

               What we don't want to provide, your Honor, is

      information that we haven't used in our investigation, which



                                                                 



    we'll discuss later, under CIPA provisions and requests to

    search intelligence information.

             THE COURT:  Thank you.

             Mr. Tigar.

             MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, I hesitate to

    contradict my colleague, but the some 20,000 statements that we

    have received are in boxes.  As of now, we are unable to search

    them other than by serial number.  We can't do LEXIS or NEXIS

    word searches; and I wouldn't want the Court to believe that

      the information is accessible to us in this way.

               THE COURT:  Are you telling me you don't have the

      CD-ROMs?

               MR. TIGAR:  We have the CD-ROMs, your Honor.  However,

      in order to access them and make them tell us things, we have

      to have computer programs.  Those computer programs are in the

      process of being installed on our machines pursuant to the

      Court's order giving us the equipment.  So I wouldn't want the

      Court to think that we are now at the point where we can begin

      to do these comparative searches to which my colleague refers.

      It's going to take us some time to do that.  That's simply by

      way of telling the Court that this is a massive amount of

      information, as Mr. Woods said.  It requires a great deal of

      resources in order to process it.  We are moving through it.

      We are not able at this point to tell the Court exactly when

      that's going to be done, although we can say that it takes a



                                                                 



    full 8-hour day to review 125 of these statements, which is a

    pretty good day's work.

             From these statements, we then get leads.  The

    investigators have to go out and follow up these leads because

    there is a great deal of exculpatory information here,

    particularly as to Mr. Nichols, and that area around Herington,

    Kansas, and that Junction City/Herington area.

             But I wouldn't want the Court to think that we can --

    we've got some whiz-bang 21st Century thing all set up whereby

      we can instantly search these things.

               THE COURT:  Yeah, but what I'm understanding you to be

      saying is that you're not really contradicting Ms. Wilkinson

      with respect to what has been provided.  You're simply not in a

      position to use it in the manner in which she suggests until

      you get some software installed?

               MR. TIGAR:  That's correct, your Honor.  Her recitals

      of what has been turned over to us is, so far as my notes

      reflect, accurate.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MR. TIGAR:  I'm simply signalling to the Court that we

      have a big job of work ahead of us.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               Well, Mr. Jones, someone from your office, or your

      side have any contradiction of what Ms. Wilkinson has recited?

               MR. JONES:  I don't have a contradiction.  I have an



                                                                 



    elaboration.

             THE COURT:  All right.

             MR. JONES:  The raw numbers that Ms. Wilkinson

    references, I'm sure are accurate; but I think that -- like

    Mr. Tigar, that the presentation is grossly misleading.

             First of all, the documents were turned over on

    January 23 and 24, ten months after the arrest of the

    defendant.  It is true that the physical evidence at various

    stages has been made available since August.

               But I think Mr. Tigar has correctly stated that the

      CD-ROMs and these discs are useless to us.

               The Court has previously authorized us to place this

      on a computer program, just as you have with them.  It will

      take six weeks to do this.  And one of the reasons that it

      takes six weeks is because the documents weren't cleaned up

      before we got them.  To use her example of word search, that

      only will work if the correct spelling of Andrew Strassmeir's

      name is consistent throughout.  If his name is misspelled, if

      one S is dropped or another S is added, the search won't pick

      it up.  The search doesn't pick up serial numbers; and what we

      were given were the documents in serial numbers, which is

      helpful in the sense of it is a rough chronology of who was

      investigated -- or rather, who was interviewed; but the --

      someone in our office has physically had to go through 21,069

      statements and put them in alphabetical order, which, as the



                                                                 



    Court can imagine, is not an easy task.

             Also, the inserts themselves, which is a third of what

    was produced, are not alphabetized, nor do we have them in a

    serial number.  They are an entirely separate category and

    approximately 500, maybe not quite 500 -- maybe 400 some odd of

    all of these documents, the person who is being questioned or

    interviewed is blocked out.

             So the problem that we have, your Honor, to bring it

    down to the matter the Court is interested in, is it's

      difficult for us to tell whether that which we have requested

      has been given until we have the complete computer search and

      the complete alphabetized list made.

               For example, let's say, because I think it's true,

      that we ask for a 302 from Dana Bradley.  Well, because she is

      a key witness, that's one that's kind of easy to find.  But if

      we were asking for, say, Tom Smith, we wouldn't know whether we

      had Tom Smith, if he was in an insert, without physically

      checking it.  And even if he's in the insert, he could be under

      a protected identity where his name is taken out.

               Now, as I say, we're going through those and trying to

      work with the Government on resolving the protection of the

      identity.

               With respect to the physical evidence, our expert that

      the Court has permitted us to retain recently has not seen this

      and will have to work with the Government now that their



                                                                 



    evidence is up here so that it may be inspected.  But even with

    this, there are a number of items that -- from our inspection

    that we have requested that do not seem to have been produced.

    Now, whether that's because they don't exist or if they do

    exist, the Government is not aware of them or they're

    withholding them on some claim of privilege, that's why we're

    here today.

             THE COURT:  Well, except that's not exactly why we're

    here today, if you're going to follow up with your motions

      to -- motion to compel.

               MR. JONES:  Well, with respect to Rule 16, that would

      be correct, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               Is there something that the Government can provide

      without giving up work product or something that could help to

      move this process along by the defense?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have had one of our

      paralegals in weekly contact with both teams about this CD-ROM

      technology, for example.  We provided that back on January 23.

      And I believe, in part, Mr. Tigar's office was waiting to buy

      the software till they moved to Denver, till you had issued

      your opinion on the change of venue.  I'm not sure about

      Mr. Jones' team, but we have been speaking with them.  You

      know, members of our team speak to members of their team on a

      daily basis.  We do follow up on these requests.  In fact, as



                                                                 



    to Mr. Jones' request to file a Rule 16 on April 21, when he

    and his team members came to us several weeks ago asking for an

    extension, at first, we declined.  We asked them to provide us

    with a list of the materials they needed.  We have been in

    contact with them so that, as I said earlier, when they ask us

    for something, we try and provide it so we don't have to come

    in front of the Court to resolve these disputes.

             I'm not sure -- I would rather have Mr. Jones come to

    us again to resolve any Rule 16 disputes before we file them

      with the Court, unless there is something, of course, we've

      declined to provide to them.

               THE COURT:  Well, it sounds like Mr. Jones' team, as

      it were, is ahead of Mr. Tigar's team as far as reviewing this

      material.  I'm not saying this in criticism at all; but if we

      need something that you don't have and the Government or

      somebody can provide it, we ought to do it so we can get it

      moving.

               MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, we are -- I don't want to have

      fewer gold stars on our chart on the wall than Mr. Jones is

      getting today.

               THE COURT:  I'm sure.

               MR. TIGAR:  We are moving as quickly as we can.

               We have rejected some of the offers that the

      Government has given us about assistance because we don't want

      their commercial providers in our space watching us set up a



                                                                 



    search protocol to figure out what we think is important in

    these documents.

             That's just a recipe for difficulty with respect to

    work product and privilege issues.

             We have the computers.  They are installed.  The

    software is on them, and our experts tell us that we are moving

    ahead at a good clip.  But the problem has been that we

    simply -- no more would they come in with their people and say

    well, here's all our work product and here's how we're going to

      try our case.  We've got to keep some wall of separation here,

      and we drew that line very clearly and very early.  And now

      that we're in Denver with the computers, we're moving forward

      in a quite satisfactory way.

               THE COURT:  Well, I think where we are is that there

      is the opportunity for exchange here and with the reservation

      of work product on all sides.  I mean, I didn't -- I think I --

      in asking you if there is something you could provide, I, of

      course, expect you to reserve your work product and protect

      that, as I do the defense counsel.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe both Mr. Jones

      and Mr. Tigar would tell you that we have offered our

      assistance and we have been willing to provide information that

      they request unless it's something that we have a legal dispute

      on.  And those, obviously, we bring before the Court.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I think that's as far as



                                                                 



    we can go at this time, then, on the general discovery.

             One area of dispute certainly in the papers here is

    the matter of the FBI laboratory.  And Ms. Wilkinson has talked

    about laboratory reports have been provided.  Perhaps you can

    address this.  This all relates to the matter of this Agent

    Whitehurst and an ongoing -- apparently ongoing internal

    investigation in Justice.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

             Agent Whitehurst is a chemist in the FBI laboratory or

      was at the time he started making these allegations about

      improper procedures and specifically about certain examiners in

      the FBI laboratory.  He started writing letters back to the

      Inspector General of the Department of Justice -- oh, I'm not

      even sure when he started, whether it was in 1993 or 1994 or

      1995.  But in June of 1995, he made specific allegations about

      an agent named Roger Martz in connection with the O.J. Simpson

      matter.  And in that case, the IG then started investigating

      all of the allegations that Mr. Whitehurst had made previously;

      and then Mr. Whitehurst started writing additional letters to

      the Inspector General and has continued to do so to this date.

               As of last week, when we checked with Washington,

      there were 125 letters written by Agent Whitehurst, some as

      long as 90 pages, some as short as one page.

               Back in June of 1995, as you may know, Judge Ito

      refused to allow Agent Whitehurst to testify in that matter



                                                                 



    because he had no firsthand knowledge of the matters that he

    was criticizing.

             In that regard, in our case, Agent Whitehurst had no

    involvement with the Oklahoma City bombing examination and the

    laboratory other than participating in one partial examination.

    At the beginning of the case, the clothes that Mr. McVeigh was

    wearing at the time of his arrest by the Oklahoma state

    troopers were put in a sealed bag.  Obviously, at that time,

    they did not know that he had any connection to this case.

      Those clothes were turned over and flown to the FBI laboratory

      after he was arrested on federal charges.  Clothes were sent

      back to the laboratory.  The bag was opened.  They were taken

      to a testing area, and one of the chemists tested for --

      conducted certain examinations.  And Agent Whitehurst was asked

      to conduct one test where he found no result.  That was his

      only participation in the Oklahoma City bombing; however, he

      has made numerous allegations about this case and all of the

      other major cases that the laboratory has participated in.

               The Government has established procedures through the

      Department of Defense to try and balance the IG's interest in

      conducting a full investigation of these matters and fulfilling

      our Brady and Giglio obligations in all of these cases.

               What the IG has done is withheld some of the letters

      so that they could confront the examiners that Mr. Whitehurst

      is accusing, and then they have turned them over to a central



                                                                 



    repository in the criminal division of the Department of

    Justice.  There are -- there are a team of assistant U.S.

    Attorneys who are reviewing the materials and providing them to

    prosecutors who are involved with these various cases.

             We have received some of those items; and last week, I

    received a copy of all 125 letters.  We are reviewing those

    letters, and we will provide the information that we believe is

    required of us under Brady and Giglio and Rule 16 to the

    defense counsel.

               As I said, it's a voluminous record that Agent

      Whitehurst has; made and although he doesn't have much personal

      knowledge about this case or many of the others that he's

      commenting on, we feel like we must review all of the letters

      to provide information that, even if it's not directly about

      our case, may be involved with the laboratory in aspects that

      relate to our case.  And we have no dispute with the defense

      that we're not going to turn that over; it's just a matter of

      timing.

               THE COURT:  Well, I suppose one of the contexts in

      which this matter might be necessary to review is in -- I

      assume that the evidence in this case will include testimony

      concerning examinations of material.  And, certainly, some of

      it is going to include something to prove the allegations that

      there was a bomb made and what type of bomb was involved.

               MS. WILKINSON:  That's true, your Honor.



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  If there is a problem with respect to the

    protocol, if there is a problem with respect to the persons

    conducting the test, all of those things, I think, are by way

    of foundation and possibly voir dire before the introduction of

    that testimony and those exhibits.

             Now, I don't know.  It may be necessary for us to

    conduct a pretrial hearing with respect to that admissibility;

    and I think perhaps that's the focus for addressing these

    issues.

               Do you see it that way, too?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  We agree with that.

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MS. WILKINSON:  I don't see any problem with it.  We

      are just in the process of reviewing this.  I believe

      Mr. Jones' argument is that we've had this material for some

      time.  He's aware -- perhaps he is; I don't know what contact

      he's had with Agent Whitehurst -- that Agent Whitehurst

      continues to write these letters, the procedures that we've

      established with the Department of Justice, and that although

      we received some of the letters, we didn't receive the full 125

      letters until last week.

               THE COURT:  Is there an ongoing -- I got the flavor

      here somewhere that there is an employment dispute of some

      type.

               MS. WILKINSON:  There is not an employment dispute,



                                                                 



    your Honor.

             THE COURT:  Or an assignment or something like that.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  Agent Whitehurst was transferred

    to the paint analysis section, and there are some internal

    investigations going on; but the most important one in this

    case is the Inspector General's investigation, which has not

    concluded.  That is the investigation where the Department of

    Justice hired five outside experts to help the Inspector

    General review these materials and the allegations.

               They have not prepared their report and finished it.

      We anticipate that it will come out some time this summer, so

      they still have an ongoing investigation.

               As to Mr. -- or Agent Whitehurst's dispute with the

      FBI about where he works, I'm really not familiar with that;

      but I do --

               THE COURT:  Well, I don't need to address it.  I

      just -- there is an issue with respect to his credibility, I

      assume.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  That's very true, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  Now, you received a copy of this in one of

      the pleadings filed by Mr. Jones.  Attached to it is a

      memorandum from the -- I think an Acting Assistant Attorney

      General regarding the investigation.

               MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  And communication to the field, U.S.



                                                                 



    Attorneys.  You're familiar with that.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

             THE COURT:  And you're following up on it.

             MS. WILKINSON:  We are.  In fact, those are the

    procedures that say basically in common sense terms prosecutors

    who are involved with these type of cases with these agents,

    please send all your information to the Department of Justice

    criminal division so they can review it, centralize it and send

    you back material that could be Brady.  What that memorandum

      says is the prosecutor himself or herself has to make that

      determination and then, in turn, release some or all of that

      information to defense counsel.  And that's the process that

      we're trying to follow, your Honor, because some of these

      allegations obviously have impact on many other cases.

               THE COURT:  Thank you.

               MR. JONES:  May I respond, your Honor?

               THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

               MR. JONES:  Well, first let me say it's not

      Mr. Whitehurst, it's Dr. Whitehurst; and he has testified as a

      witness for the FBI in a number of high profile cases.  Any

      NEXIS or LEXIS search will show the extent of his academic and

      professional background.

               He made extremely serious charges against the FBI

      laboratory and for a period of time handled those matters

      internally.  And they only became external when a major news



                                                                 



    network inadvertently discovered something in the World Trade

    Center bombing trial in New York City.

             His allegations are serious enough that the Attorney

    General herself appointed a five-member panel including

    Dr. Gerard Murray of the National Forensic Laboratory in

    Belfast to investigate his allegations; so they are not routine

    run-of-the-mill employment dissatisfaction.  They go to the

    very heart of the integrity of the scientific inquiry that the

    FBI laboratory may make.

               With respect to this particular case, we have been

      asking the Government for material on Dr. Whitehurst since

      October, and we have yet to receive any of it.  We have no

      contact with Dr. Whitehurst.  We have asked to interview him

      and have been -- that has been resisted by the Government.

               We received this memorandum from a member of the

      press, not from Dr. Whitehurst or because of Dr. Whitehurst.

      This memorandum is dated January 4 and today is April 8.

               THE COURT:  You got that from the Acting Attorney

      General?

               MR. JONES:  Yes.  The 125 letters are not 125 letters

      involving Oklahoma City.  They involve all of his cases.  And

      we filed with the Court last week a document from

      Mr. Whitehurst -- Dr. Whitehurst to the office of the Inspector

      General.  And attached to it was a letter from Mr. Stanley

      Rothstein of the terrorism and violent crimes section sending



                                                                 



    to Mr. Moody, a convicted felon, convicted of the death of

    Judge Vance, on January 24 material that they had received from

    Dr. Whitehurst.

             I don't understand why it's possible to send this

    material to Mr. Moody within three weeks after it's received

    and we can't get it four months later.

             THE COURT:  Well, what is it that you're asking for?

             MR. JONES:  What I want are the letters and reports

    that he has made that criticize -- if that's what they do --

      and I assume they do based upon the press reports -- the FBI

      laboratory collection and analysis of the forensic evidence in

      this case.

               THE COURT:  Well, that's, you know -- that's the focus

      of interest here and --

               MR. JONES:  Yes.

               THE COURT:  And that's why I was suggesting with

      Government counsel here that maybe the best way to approach

      this is to have a hearing with respect to that evidence in

      advance of trial.

               MR. JONES:  Well, except, your Honor, the reason why

      we want it is because we have consulted with outside experts

      and forensic laboratories, and we want to have our experts look

      at that in time so that we can raise appropriate motions with

      the Court, if they are necessary, concerning separate testing,

      our ability to look at the protocols, at the printouts, the



                                                                 



    photographs, whatever may have been done in this laboratory

    process.  And we see it as a -- something that we need to do

    long in advance of trial in order to prepare for that hearing

    that your Honor has suggested because -- and I don't want --

    we're in a public setting.  I don't want to discuss the FBI

    laboratory report on the bomb at this point except to say that

    it's a clearly contested matter among the three sides here; and

    I don't see why we simply cannot get a copy of Frederic

    Whitehurst's letter today.

               Now, I don't know that I'm entitled to their analysis

      of Whitehurst's letter, but I don't understand the logic that

      Moody can get the Whitehurst letter and we can't.  That's all

      we've asked for at this time, is what allegations has he made

      and could we have a copy of them.

               THE COURT:  About this --

               MR. JONES:  This case.

               THE COURT:  -- the testing done on material submitted

      to the laboratory in this investigation.

               MR. JONES:  Yes, or criticism of the people that did

      the testing in this case.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Well, Mr. Tigar, I don't know

      where you are on this controversy.

               MR. TIGAR:  We have joined in the motion, your Honor.

      At the trial of this case, the Government will be required to

      prove three things:  First, that the testing procedures used



                                                                 



    meet the Daubert standard; second, that the expert they tender

    is a qualified expert, and third, that the particular

    procedures used by that expert and the facts upon which he or

    she relied meet the standards of the Rules of Evidence.

             Mr. Whitehurst raises difficulties with respect to

    each one of these Daubert elements.

             Now, the personal knowledge issue is, of course,

    irrelevant.  Mr. Whitehurst's knowledge comes entirely from his

    conversations with our adversary; therefore, they would be

      admissible as admissions of a party opponent, the sole

      provision of the Rules of Evidence not subject to the personal

      knowledge requirement of Rule 602.

               In this list that is provided here as an attachment to

      Mr. Jones' motion, there are included the names, for example,

      of James Thurman and David Williams, people who we believe did

      have something to do with the forensic examinations in this

      case.

               Thus, in order to wind us up at trial, able to make

      intelligent challenges to the Government's tender of expert

      witnesses, and also should your Honor determine that the

      experts are able to testify for us to be able to attack their

      credibility.

               THE COURT:  Well, you see, that -- you mentioned

      Daubert; and I think consistent with -- since Daubert, most

      courts have held Daubert-type hearings in advance of trial.



                                                                 



    And I would anticipate doing that here, whether we had this

    controversy or not.

             MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  I believe that that's

    what should happen.  I think the Government should come up and

    say that this is what we're going to have and this is who is

    going to come in the box and do it.

             THE COURT:  Right.

             MR. TIGAR:  I simply wanted to point out that your

    Honor's threshold determination that a witness is an expert and

      that the procedures used are adequate would not foreclose us at

      trial --

               THE COURT:  Oh, no.

               MR. TIGAR:  -- from having this information to put in

      front of the jury.  An expert is someone who wasn't there when

      it happened but for a fee will gladly imagine what it must have

      been like.  That's our view of it.  And I think we're entitled

      to challenge that in front of the jury.

               THE COURT:  Well, I'm not suggesting that you can't.

      Obviously, the value of any such evidence is a matter for the

      jury to determine.  And whatever is relevant to impeaching that

      or determining that can be considered.

               But I don't want to have this case and preparation of

      this case delayed by sort of a parallel investigation of the

      FBI laboratory.

               What we're concerned about is what affects the



                                                                 



    evidence in this case.  And I think that the way to best

    address that is to think of a -- I don't know that we can set a

    time this morning, but think of a time when the Government will

    be prepared to go forward with something of a Daubert

    presentation.

             MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, I understand about the

    parallel investigation.  I was making the point that if

    Mr. Whitehurst has knowledge that would suggest that, say, one

    of these people on this list is not a good scientist or

      routinely fixes results, that testimony would be admissible.

      Our position is that in a Daubert finding, we should be able to

      present extrinsic evidence; i.e. extrinsic to the voir dire of

      the particular expert tendered.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Wilkinson?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we'd be prepared to

      provide the letters to defense counsel in 30 days.  That way,

      there will be no problem with getting close to the trial date.

               THE COURT:  Now, when you say "the letters," are you

      talking about 125 letters?

               MS. WILKINSON:  No.  We're talking about the ones that

      we believe are relevant.

               THE COURT:  To this case.

               MS. WILKINSON:  To this case.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Those are the ones Mr. Jones

      has requested.



                                                                 



             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  As far as I know, there are no

    reports.  He asked for letters or reports.  As far as I know,

    Agent Whitehurst has just written letters to the Inspector

    General outlining his grievances or his allegations about

    examiners in this case and many others.

             It isn't, though, just the letter about this case

    specifically, because he also makes allegations about the

    examiners that are involved with our case, but also other

    cases; and we have to look at those to see if they're similar

      enough that they would be something that the defendants would

      be entitled to.

               We also propose, your Honor, that we have a hearing in

      August to resolve these pretrial matters and that we do it as

      to our experts and the defense experts.

               We are not asking the Court to wait for the IG

      investigation.  Obviously, that's a separate determination.

      And even if the IG made some findings that were adverse, it's

      arguable whether those would be admissible in this trial.  We

      disagree with Mr. Tigar on his theory of party admissions, but

      we can get to that when the time is appropriate.

               So we think if we set a date in August where we would

      have all of our experts prepared and the defense would, we

      could go through those pretrial hearings and deal with all of

      those issues as to their qualifications.

               I should make clear as to Mr. Jones' complaint about



                                                                 



    the Moody case.  In that case, the allegations were made much

    earlier than they were in the Oklahoma bombing case.  And the

    judge in that case -- I believe the district court took up a

    2255 and had a hearing -- I believe it was yesterday -- where

    the court brought down the expert and did a hearing.  And it

    was discovered that the experts that were hired for the

    Inspector General's report investigation also disagreed with

    Mr. Whitehurst's allegations in that case.

             And I know that the state counsel in the Moody case

      has decided not to use Agent Whitehurst based on his

      allegations in the Moody case.

               THE COURT:  So that was an evidentiary hearing on a

      2255?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

               Also, as I said, back in June of 1995, when Judge Ito

      declined to permit Agent Whitehurst to testify, it wasn't just

      based on his lack of personal knowledge, but it was based on

      his lack of knowledge of the rules.  Our rule, which is

      similar, Rule 703, as you know, permits an expert to testify if

      he has scientific, technical, or other specialized expertise.

      And Agent Whitehurst seems to be preoccupied with the fact that

      you can only testify about scientific matters if you are a

      scientist and that you can only testify about matters in which

      you have Ph.D. qualifications.  That is clearly not the law

      under the Federal Rules, and that will be one of our arguments



                                                                 



    at the pretrial hearing in August, if you set one.

             THE COURT:  All right.

             MR. JONES:  Your Honor, may I respond?

             THE COURT:  Yes.  What we have specifically, though,

    is that these letters are going to be provided to you within 30

    days.

             MR. JONES:  Well, yes, but I object to Counsel's

    attempting to assassinate Dr. Whitehurst before we even get any

    of this material.  This is irrelevant to our case, and it's not

      accurate.  We submitted to the Court, attached to our report to

      the Court, his report in Moody, which goes into considerable

      detail besides the experience and qualifications.  I don't care

      whether he's right or wrong there.  I want to know whether the

      FBI lab is right here, and I still don't understand why it

      takes 30 days.  We oppose an August setting.  The Government

      wants to set hearings before we get what we need to prepare for

      that hearing, and then we get into these disputes and so we run

      right up against the hearing date.

               THE COURT:  Well, I don't expect to set the hearing

      this morning.

               MR. JONES:  All right, sir.

               THE COURT:  I expect to take this, as other matters

      here, a step at a time.  And are you aware of this evidentiary

      hearing apparently that was conducted?

               MR. JONES:  I was not aware of it at all.



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  Well, perhaps a transcript of that hearing

    may be of value.

             MR. JONES:  I'll try to get one.

             The point, though, that I'm making is that -- and

    before we leave the question of the letter, we want all of the

    letters.  And we'll characterize them as "letters," since she

    says there is no report that relates to the Oklahoma City

    bombing case.  But -- and I didn't hear this -- where he's made

    allegations of misconduct -- and I'm using that in a broad

      sense -- of an examiner who examined material in this case, I

      think we should be aware of those allegations.

               THE COURT:  Well, I interpreted that to include

      anything, any allegations about personnel who did the testing

      in this matter.

               MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  All right.  So it's covered.

               MR. JONES:  Thank you.

               THE COURT:  Well, I think we'll leave with the

      Government's agreement to provide what we've just talked about

      within 30 days.  What we do with it from there on out, we'll

      discover as we go forward.

               MR. JONES:  No pun intended, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  No, it was intended.

               Now, we have this whole matter of where we go with the

      Classified Information Procedures Act.  And I think that before



                                                                 



    we start down that road, maybe we should take a recess so that

    people sort of form up how you're going to present that.

             Frankly, I'm confused as to how best to hear it.  And

    as a part of that, there was filed by Mr. Jones a motion to

    submit some material under seal and in camera.  That motion is

    in the open.  The material that was attached in sealed form was

    ordered by me to remain sealed.

             And I have not reviewed it myself because I think it

    should be discussed here as to whether I should examine it.

               So before we go into this whole area, I want Counsel

      to know that I have not read what was submitted under seal and

      will not do so until there is an opportunity to discuss it

      here.

               So we'll take a 20-minute recess.

          (Recess at 10 a.m.)

          (Reconvened at 10:20 a.m.)

               THE COURT:  Be seated, please.

               All right.  The subject is the Classified Information

      Procedures Act.  Ms. Wilkinson?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, although the mention of

      classified information I think makes most criminal lawyers and

      judges nervous, it really has very little to do with the issues

      that Mr. Jones raises in his briefs.  He's really making a

      wide, overbroad and speculative discovery request -- excuse me.

      He's making a wide, overbroad and speculative discovery request



                                                                 



    and couching it in terms of classified information.

             Under the Classified Information and Procedures Act,

    the court normally gets involved when the Government, as you

    stated, says there is classified information that is relevant,

    discoverable, Brady; that needs to be provided to the defense

    in some form, or the defense says that they have classified

    information in their possession or have received it from the

    Government that they know they need to prepare their defense.

             The most famous cases are of Poindexter and North,

      where those defendants claimed that because of their

      relationship with intelligence agencies and their employment,

      those issues that were classified by the Government were

      central to their defense against the charges.  That is

      obviously not the case here.

               The defendants are requesting classified information

      just as they request other information about the case, hoping

      that there would be some tie to some other terrorist

      organization.

               In fact, in their pleadings when they request

      information, it is so broad that they ask for any information

      on an individual or a group with a motive, means and/or

      opportunity and who or which has expressed a desire to injure

      or damage U.S. property, employees or citizens.

               In other words, they are asking the Government to

      provide any information on terrorists or terrorist groups that



                                                                 



    they may have had a motive to harm the United States'

    interests.

             They attach to this request specific demands for

    information about the roles of Sudan and Iraq in the World

    Trade Center bombing, links or ties between German Neo-Nazi

    groups and the KK; the Christian Identity Movement; The Order;

    The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord, and links to

    other terrorist organizations from Iran and Iraq.

             They also complain or contend that they are entitled

      to information from a wide variety of organizations such as the

      Sikh Separatists, spelled S-I-K-H; the Ananda, A-N-A-N-D-A,

      Marga cult from India; the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front;

      the Movement of Revolutionary Left of Chile; the Provisional

      Irish Republican Army; numerous factions of the Palestinian

      Liberation Organization; the Armenian Secret Army of the

      Liberation of Armenia; the FNLM, and, of course, the South

      African Congress.

               Without giving any type of information why this type

      of information is relevant to their case, they claim that any

      type of terrorist organization such as these organizations or

      any others that may have tried to harm the United States or

      expressed a desire or means to harm the United States should be

      revealed to them whether the information is classified or not.

               To support this laundry list of requests, they attach

      a history of terrorist activities around the world since 1983,



                                                                 



    somehow trying to justify that this information is tied to the

    Oklahoma City bombing.

             Our position, your Honor, is that they are not

    entitled to this request that the Government search

    intelligence agency files or for that matter any other files

    for this type of broad information without any kind of

    particularized showing on how it would be relevant and

    exculpatory to their case.

             As you know, there is a long line of cases in the

      Tenth Circuit and in the Supreme Court which say that Brady did

      not provide for discovery in criminal cases and did not create

      a right to it.  They say that any potential Brady information

      that's based on mere speculation that evidence might help the

      defense is not discoverable by defendants.  In Wood vs. 

      Bartholomew at 116 Supreme Court 7 and in Moore vs. Illinois at

      408 U.S. 786, the Supreme Court specifically held that the

      Government did not have to disclose evidence pointing only

      tangentially or speculatively to possible other suspects.

               It is the Government's position that the defense's

      request for classified information and demands for us to search

      intelligence agencies' files who have not participated with us

      in the investigation in the criminal investigation, is

      inappropriate, overbroad and should be declined by the Court.

               Specifically, if the defense is claiming that the

      suspects or all potential suspects who could have bombed or



                                                                 



    harmed the United States are relevant, we would turn them to

    Hopkinson vs. Shillinger at 866 F.2d 1185, a Tenth Circuit case

    in 1990, where the court found that information about other

    suspects whose connection to the offense is speculative does

    not fall under the rulings of Brady and its progeny.

             And another case in the Tenth Circuit, United States 

    vs. Comosona at 848 F.2d 1110, found that information that is

    not facially -- is facially nonexculpatory that might possibly

    be favorable to the accused through some sort of inferential

      reasoning is not discoverable by the defense.

               Your Honor, as a factual matter, the defense claims

      that the intelligence agencies participated and generated

      voluminous reports in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing

      case.  That is not true.

               Back on April 19, 1995, when the bombing occurred, the

      Federal Government put together its resources, including a

      representative from one of the intelligence agencies, to

      determine if we could find out who had organized and carried

      out this heinous bombing.

               By April 21 -- that is, two days later -- the

      Government learned through the FBI's diligent investigation

      that the bombing had been carried out by a U.S. citizen; that a

      Ryder truck had been used, a VIN number had been traced, and

      Mr. McVeigh had been identified as the individual who rented

      that truck.



                                                                 



             At that point, your Honor, the intelligence agencies

    were no longer involved with the preliminary investigation.  I

    use the term "preliminary investigation" because the

    intelligence agencies came forward only to help us try to

    identify who any possible suspects could be.

             They did not provide reports to the Government.  And

    in fact in August, approximately three months after the

    investigation started, we specifically requested if they had

    any information on Mr. McVeigh, Mr. Nichols, or any of their

      aliases, and the CIA told us they had no such information.

               On April 21, after we determined that Mr. McVeigh was

      involved and Mr. Nichols turned himself in and mailed

      statements to the FBI, the intelligence agencies were no longer

      involved with any of the investigation.

               The National Security Act of 1947 prohibits

      intelligence agencies from investigating U.S. persons for

      domestic criminal violations.  Therefore, the NSA, the CIA, and

      the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, were not involved

      with this investigation.

               And despite Mr. Jones' claims that the representatives

      of the White House and other persons of the Federal Government

      maintained on the first few days of the bombing that they were

      marshalling all of our resources, that does not lead to his

      conclusion that we have had the intelligence agencies produce

      reports for us in this case.  They have not been, to use the



                                                                 



    legal term, "aligned" with the criminal investigation, and they

    have not provided us information.

             Nevertheless, back in February of this year, we sent a

    letter to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense

    Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency asking

    them for all material they had under Brady, Rule 16, and Jencks

    Act and any information they had which would tend to show that

    these defendants did not participate in the crime or that

    others carried out the crime.

               We are in the process of working with them to review

      any information that they might collect and determine if there

      is any Brady information or the like in their possession.

               If, and only if, your Honor, we determine that there

      is Brady, Giglio, Rule 16 or Jencks Act materials possessed by

      the intelligence agencies, we will then come forward to the

      Court to determine if we can reveal that information in (1) an

      unclassified or declassified format, which is obviously most

      advantageous to all of us; (2) if that's not feasible, in a

      substituted or redacted format or a summary.

               That, your Honor, is what CIPA provides.  All CIPA

      permits is for the Government or the defense to come forward

      once information is ruled discoverable and provide a way for

      the Government or the defense to use it in a criminal case

      protecting some of the intelligence equities that may exist.

               So we believe that the --



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  When do you expect to be able to make a

    statement about that?

             MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have reviewed some of

    the documents, but we have not finished the documents.

             As you might imagine, we sent a letter which required

    a very broad search by these agencies, and they are erring on

    the side of caution, as they should, to pick up all documents

    that may arguably fall under these categories.  And I would

    imagine we would need two more months to complete our review

      with them and make final determinations.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  But at this point, your Honor, we are

      aware of no information that these agencies have in their

      possession that would fall under Brady, Rule 16 and Giglio.

               THE COURT:  Now, there is a conspiracy charge here, of

      course, without identification of co-conspirators, as is the

      language of the indictment.

               At some time, I think at least for purposes of the

      co-conspirator statements, we're going to have to have the

      Government identify what co-conspirators there are with respect

      to 801(d)(2)(E).  When do you expect to do that, or when could

      you do that?

               Some suggestion here, of course, is co-conspirators,

      we don't know who they are; they may be involved with

      investigations done elsewhere.



                                                                 



             MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I'm not sure when we would

    be able to have that information; obviously before trial,

    because we'd have to meet the standards for co-conspirator

    statements.

             But I can tell you as of today, we have no information

    showing that anyone but Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols were the

    masterminds of this bombing.

             The co-conspirator statements that we would intend to

    introduce are mostly statements from these two individuals

      which are admissible also under other rules of evidence.

               And I would imagine approximately four to five days

      before trial, when we are going to turn over our witness

      statements, we're going to be able to identify those

      co-conspirators to make the arrangements before you on the

      admissibility of co-conspirator statements.

               I need to clarify one thing I said to you before the

      break.  I was talking about materials removed from the building

      on the date of the bombing, on April 19.  There were no live

      explosives removed from the building.  There were no live

      explosives as far as we know in the building.  I used the term

      inert.  "Inert" means it was devised to look like an explosive

      device, but there was no aluminum -- I mean no black powder or

      nitroglycerin or other things used to make explosives.  So

      there were no live explosives in the building on April 19.

               THE COURT:  So when you say "explosives," you're



                                                                 



    talking about explosive material.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Not even explosive materials.  Inert

    explosive.  They're training devices, something that's --

             THE COURT:  Mock.

             MS. WILKINSON:  A mock device, yes, sir.

             THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

             Well, Mr. Jones . . .

             MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I forgot -- I forgot to

    raise one issue you had raised before the break about the

      sealed documents.

               I reviewed Mr. Jones' pleadings that he provided

      yesterday afternoon where he now has changed his classified

      information procedures request to ask that the Court review

      sealed documents which are also ex parte; that is, the

      Government has not been provided with copies.

               THE COURT:  Right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  I assume it's to show that he has some

      evidentiary basis for making these requests, particularized

      showing of why he needs this intelligence information.

               The Government is opposed to the Court reading those

      ex parte.  We believe that we are entitled to review those as

      we would if he made any discovery requests that he needed more

      information from the Government.  We're happy to keep those

      under seal in case that they reveal some potentially classified

      information; but we see no reason why the Government should not



                                                                 



    review those and be able to provide the Court with the

    arguments either that the investigation has been followed up

    and that information has been provided to the defense or that

    we don't believe that information is relevant or makes a

    sufficient showing to force the Government to search and engage

    in additional investigation.

             THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

             MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, I would first

    like to address the motion that I filed yesterday that the

      Court receive this material ex parte and in camera.  And

      specifically I rely upon two federal cases.  First is United 

      States vs. Clegg at 740 F.2d 16, which is a 1994 case arising

      out of the Eleventh Circuit.  And at page 17, the Eleventh

      Circuit says the district court allowed the defendant to submit

      an in camera ex parte affidavit setting forth in detail why the

      requested information was material to the preparation of the

      defense.  After review, the district court ruled documents were

      discoverable.  This was a case involving national security

      issues.

               In United States vs. Poindexter, the former national

      security adviser for President Reagan, in the District of

      Columbia, a case before Judge Gesell reported at 698 Fed. Supp.

      316 at 321, which is a 1988 case, Judge Gesell said, "The Court

      will hear counsel for Defendant North at what may prove to be

      more than a single in camera ex parte oral presentation



                                                                 



    commencing on July 14, 1988, at 9:30 a.m., for the sole purpose

    of being informed without disclosure to the independent counsel

    of the reasons why he and his counsel consider the specific

    items of classified information he is seeking under (1) above

    to be required as relevant and material to his defense."

             So I think that the case law is quite clear that the

    Court has the discretion to submit this material from us

    ex parte in camera to be reviewed only by the Court.

             The reasons that we ask that the Court review it

      ex parte in camera is first because it involves discussing with

      the Court certain methodology and certain people that we have

      interviewed who we do not believe have been interviewed by the

      Government, or by Mr. Tigar for that matter, who have told us

      certain matters that directly relate to national security

      information that we are seeking.

               Secondly, there is certain information in that

      material, in fact approximately a third of it, that might be

      embarrassing and affect the right to a fair trial of one party

      to this case.

               Third, there are certain confidential sources of

      information given to us from people associated with the

      Government and/or the press and/or public at large who have

      requested anonymity, and the information that they have given

      is of such importance that we are pledged to respect that

      request.  And for those reasons, we ask that the Court receive



                                                                 



    it ex parte in camera.

             I would point out to the Court -- and this is the tail

    end of my section dealing with the ex parte in camera

    submission, and it goes to some of the matters that

    Ms. Wilkinson addressed.  And before I get to the general

    request, I want to address the specific.

             Ms. Wilkinson and the Government are framing the issue

    in a way not contemplated by the statutory scheme.  The

    statutory scheme provides that we file the motion.  And the

      case law is quite clear that the burden that we have at this

      time is, quote, "a low one."

               Now, the Government comes back and says, well, in the

      case that quoted that particular one, although there are

      several cases, they were seeking the discovery of the

      defendant's own statement.  But that's a distinction without a

      difference.

               The case law is clear that when we make the request

      for national security information that the Court's order that

      that be produced is a low threshold.  Once the Court orders it,

      then the Government responds by either producing it or, more

      likely and more frequently, claiming a privilege.

               At that point when the Government asserts the

      privilege, then we have to come forward and show how the

      material is relevant and how particularly it relates to our

      defense.



                                                                 



             What Ms. Wilkinson and the Government are attempting

    to do is to take the third step and make it the first step, by

    saying to the Court first of all, there is nothing to produce

    that we know of; but, of course, we've asked them in February

    to produce it.  The truth of the matter is, in laymen's terms,

    she doesn't know whether they have anything or not because the

    CIA and the NSA have not responded.  So it's an open question

    yet as to whether there is anything.

             Secondly, they are attempting to take away from the

      Court the order that the Court would enter which would tell

      them what to search for.  In other words, she is framing the

      search.

               Well, considering that the Government didn't think

      there was anything exculpatory in Vickie Beemer and Eldon

      Elliott and Lea McGown's statement, I hardly think it is a

      surprise that the CIA and the others will come back and find

      nothing.

               The correct procedure for CIPA is for the Court to

      order the Government to produce it and to tell the Government

      what to produce.  Then the Government takes the Court's order

      to those agencies and the agencies search their files and match

      it against what the Court says, not what one of their

      co-counsel says that's in another branch of the executive

      department.

               However, we went ahead, although we don't suggest that



                                                                 



    the Court change the CIPA procedure, and prepared a detailed

    submission backed up with affidavits and statements and other

    physical objects to support the particularity, which I am

    certainly prepared to discuss with the Court, but I don't think

    it should be done in a public session.

             Rather, since we are in a public session, I would now

    like to address the specific issues that Ms. Wilkinson raised.

             THE COURT:  Well, to back up for a moment --

             MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

               THE COURT:  -- the material that's submitted under

      seal at this time is:  Is it contemplated that you propose

      after that's reviewed, if it is, ex parte and in camera to

      submit to me an order to be entered requiring the Government to

      respond with respect to classification of the material?

               MR. JONES:  Yes, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  So that recognizing that at this moment,

      as I understand your statement, there is in the sealed

      documents the material that should be sealed because it reveals

      defense -- your defense efforts, among other things.

               MR. JONES:  As well as our defense hypothesis.

               THE COURT:  Yes.  And which is a matter that should

      not be disclosed to co-counsel or to the Government.

               MR. JONES:  Correct.

               THE COURT:  Not co-counsel.  Co-defendant's counsel.

               MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  But then ultimately, there has to be

    disclosure at least to the Government of what it is that you

    seek to determine, whether it's classified and should remain

    such.

             MR. JONES:  Yes.  But that's a different issue than

    telling them why I think it exists and who has told me it

    exists and what use I will make of it.

             THE COURT:  I understand.  But you would be coming

    forward with a proposed order for me to enter to give to the

      Government with material for them to review.

               MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  And the order would further

      provide, as it must, that counsel don't have to give it to me

      until first --

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MR. JONES:  -- the Court hears its claim of privilege.

      So the mere fact that you order them, what you're really doing

      is ordering them to search for certain information that I have

      characterized and then assuming that I make the low threshold

      showing; and then they can come back and say all right, we

      found the travel records of Sam Smith, as an example; and --

      but we have a privilege on that and our privilege is blank.

               So I don't get those records.  The Court then

      determines the applicability of the privilege.  And that, I

      believe, is the correct way to proceed, not the way that she is

      suggesting.



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  So you would be submitting to me an order

    that you believe is justified under the sealed document.

             MR. JONES:  Absolutely.

             THE COURT:  And is there a proposed order in the

    sealed document?

             MR. JONES:  There is not a proposed order in the

    sealed document, your Honor, because as late as yesterday, I

    received additional information and I am prepared to narrow

    some of the requests more specifically.

               THE COURT:  So are you going to submit, then, a

      proposed order?

               MR. JONES:  I will.

               THE COURT:  And submit that under seal?

               MR. JONES:  I will.

               THE COURT:  So that it could be evaluated with the

      other information?

               MR. JONES:  Yes.

               THE COURT:  You know, as it stands, I don't know

      what's in there; but I would probably be lost looking in there

      without knowing what is this all to come down to.

               MR. JONES:  The material is accompanied with, if I may

      use an expression, a road map at the beginning, saying this is

      what we have, and then at the end, saying this is how we think

      it's relevant.

               But clearly, the Court would need or should desire, as



                                                                 



    it does, a proposed order so that you can see if the items that

    I have requested are supported by the information that I have

    supplied both publicly and under seal.

             THE COURT:  Okay.

             MR. JONES:  May I proceed, your Honor?

             THE COURT:  Yes.  I guess I need to know when you --

    when you would be submitting such a proposal.

             MR. JONES:  I would try to have it here by Monday.

             THE COURT:  All right.

               MR. JONES:  Your Honor has been on the bench long

      enough to catch the nuances of statements of counsel; but I

      hope that I may with liberty call the Court's attention to two

      that Ms. Wilkinson made.

               She said the Government has information only that

      Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols are the masterminds of the bombing.

      Well, of course, that's not what the charge is.  The charge is

      a conspiracy and various substantive crimes.  Whether or not

      they are the masterminds or not does not preclude the

      possibility that others may be involved.

               What the Government is essentially doing is filing the

      equivalent of a motion for summary judgment that the defendants

      are guilty and, therefore, since they are guilty, there can't

      be anybody else involved and we don't need to provide any

      further information; and as one of the statements that she

      makes in support of that, that Mr. McVeigh has been identified



                                                                 



    as the person that rented the Ryder truck.  And I respectfully

    dissent.

             The evidence is that he is not the person that rented

    the Ryder truck.  He is not 5'10", 5'11."  He doesn't weigh 180

    to 185 pounds, he doesn't have green eyes and he doesn't have

    acne.  And those are the descriptions of the person that

    identified himself as Robert Kling.

             It wouldn't make any difference whether they did

    identify Mr. McVeigh.  And I believe Mr. Elliott did in June at

      a time when Mr. McVeigh was known to even monks on the side of

      the Himalayan mountains in Tibet.

               The question is not who are the other co-conspirators

      of Mr. McVeigh, although that might clearly relate to the

      punishment phase under Chaney vs. Brown.  And we would be

      entitled to it, because under Chaney vs. Brown, there was a

      suggestion that there was evidence that suggested that the

      defendant there did not personally kill the defendant -- the

      deceased and, therefore, they were entitled to information that

      might mitigate his role in it.

               And while I raise that ground, I don't concede by

      raising that ground that Mr. McVeigh is involved or that he is

      guilty.  Rather, what I say is that there is information held

      by the Government that points to others, not McVeigh plus

      others, but others that are responsible for the bombing of the

      Oklahoma City building.  And we want that evidence in order to



                                                                 



    prepare our defense.

             It isn't speculative.  It isn't remote.  We name

    specific countries.  We set forth the specific reasons, the

    specific informants, their credibility and the evidence that we

    rely upon to make it relevant.

             With respect to the general issue of national

    security, our motion could be characterized as both a Rule

    16(a)(1)(C), in that we are seeking material preparation for

    the defense, although it's outside our usual Rule 16 motion,

      because there is a specific statute here, and also because it

      is Brady.

               We believe that we need this information to show that

      the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah building was planned,

      financed and executed by a foreign state or a terrorist group

      under the control of a foreign state and probably in connection

      with a domestic terrorist organization.

               We have outlined to the Court that should this motion

      be granted that we have a team of two or three experts, all of

      whom have in the past had high security clearances, who have

      particular expertise and knowledge in the intelligence

      community and specifically with reference to some of the items

      here who are capable of evaluating that material and advising

      us with respect to its reliability and credibility.

               With respect to the specific items or -- and some of

      the general ones, we are prepared to narrow them.  I don't know



                                                                 



    whether the Court wants me to narrow them on the record now or

    simply to do that in another way by drafting the order so that

    I don't unnecessarily take up the Court's time.

             However, a number of the requests are specific

    requests as opposed to general; so the characterization by

    Ms. Wilkinson that these are overbroad is clearly inaccurate.

    Requests 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 31

    are specific requests.

             THE COURT:  Are you referring to the numbers in this

      April 8 --

               MR. JONES:  Yes.

               Furthermore, it is not true that I have requested

      information concerning the wide variety of organizations that

      she has listed, although perhaps I should, since she has raised

      them today; but I don't.  I am specifically seeking information

      that relates to the Republic of Iraq, to the Republic of Iran,

      Sudan, the connections, if any -- and I believe there are --

      that exist between one or more of those groups and certain

      terrorist groups inside the United States and in the Federal

      Republic of Germany and in the United Kingdom.  That's about as

      specific as I can make the requests.  And in addition to that,

      I have certain individuals in the United States that I identify

      by name.

               The general basis as set forth in the documents that

      we filed with the Court -- and I will not go into them and



                                                                 



    belabor them because I'm sure the Court has read them -- but it

    is clear that when this bombing occurred, based upon the public

    record and statements made publicly by the President's Chief of

    Staff and by the director of the ATF and by FBI officials

    speaking on background basis only that the immediate attention

    of the investigation was focused on the Middle East.

             Now, there is a reason why that was done.  They didn't

    focus on Australia or south Asia or China or the former Soviet

    Union or some remote country in Africa.  It was focused

      specifically on the Middle East; and the reason it was focused

      upon the Middle East is because there is evidence in existence

      in the public record, some of which we submitted to the Court

      and certainly private intelligence data -- and when I say

      "private," I suppose I should say classified intelligence

      data -- that one or more of the countries in those -- in that

      area have engaged in terrorist activities both abroad and in

      the United States against United States property, personnel and

      citizens.  And that's documented in the chronology.

               Now, these people that were conducting this

      investigation were not fools.  They made these inquiries

      because the logic and experience of international terrorism,

      particularly as it relates to the United States both here and

      abroad, required their attention to focus in on those

      particular nations.

               When Mr. McVeigh was arrested, it is certainly true, I



                                                                 



    believe, that that investigation was aborted and did not go any

    further.

             But yet if we look carefully at the Government's

    statements and pleadings and some of the evidence that has been

    furnished to us -- and I'll just refer to the public record --

    there is a suspicion of foreign involvement.  For example, the

    grand jury indictment specifically found that the grand jury

    believed -- that is to say, it had probable cause to believe --

    that, quote, "others unknown," close quote, to the grand jury

      were involved.  It doesn't say other unknown or John Doe 2

      unknown.  It said, "others unknown."

               The Government has announced repeatedly an interest in

      pursuing a John Doe 2, an individual whose appearance suggests

      a Middle Eastern, Hispanic or perhaps American Indian

      complexion; an individual not yet found, but an individual that

      exists as certainly as I am standing here in front of you.  And

      all that one needs to do is to examine in camera the 302's of

      the interviews with Lea McGown, her daughter, her maid,

      Mr. Elliott, Mr. Kissinger and Ms. Beemer.  These individuals,

      separate and apart from the other at a time before the

      $2 million reward was announced, before it became a worldwide

      publicity event, were describing the same individual, though

      they were a mile and a quarter from each other.

               He was at the Ryder truck rental with Robert Kling,

      and he was at The Dreamland Motel.  In fact, one witness goes



                                                                 



    so far as to place him inside the Ryder truck.

             There is another witness whose statement is made

    available to the Court because it's a part of the public

    record, a woman in the Murrah building that claimed to have

    seen a John Doe 2 look-alike as the only person in the Ryder

    truck exiting the Ryder truck moments before the explosion,

    walked to the back of the truck, walked to the front of the

    truck.

             So clearly, despite Ms. Wilkinson's very sincere

      statements, there are a number of people who claim to have seen

      another individual who has not yet been taken into custody, in

      addition to the grand jury statement of others unknown.

               The evidence that we submitted to the Court in the

      public findings shows that the FBI's initial communications

      suspected Islamic Jihad of being involved in the matter.  There

      is an affidavit that is now in the public record when the

      Jordanian American was taken into custody as a material witness

      that states that three Middle Eastern individuals were seen

      leaving -- running from the immediate area of the Murrah

      building just before the bombing.

               In addition to that, there is an FBI bulletin relayed

      through the Oklahoma City police department according to the

      public record of an all-points bulletin for a brown pickup; and

      that information is also submitted to the Court.

               The information that came from the wire services and



                                                                 



    the interviews including the interview of Mr. Leon Panetta,

    show that from the early stages, the FBI and the CIA and the

    National Security Agency and the National Security Council were

    checking their data bases, their index, sending out cables and

    collecting information of a possible foreign involvement.

             The suggestion made here by Ms. Wilkinson that the CIA

    does not investigate American citizens inside the United States

    is, of course, correct; but that's not the issue.  The issue is

    what investigation did they make of foreign nationals abroad.

               The combination of the FBI's own material witness

      warrant, allegations of what witnesses claim, the description

      of John Doe 2 and the number of people that claim to have seen

      him, the grand jury's reference to others unknown, all suggest

      additional individuals, even if we assume for purposes of

      Ms. Wilkinson's argument that Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols are

      included in that; and information concerning those individuals

      and who they might be is clearly relevant on the issue of

      mitigation.

               With respect to the general argument concerning Middle

      East terrorism, there are again other indications.

               The FBI indicated in its statement to the press that

      eight groups claimed responsibility for the Murrah building,

      seven of whom were foreign and six of those apparently were

      Arabic or Muslim oriented.

               There is a statement by the director of the ATF that



                                                                 



    the Federal investigators were looking to the Middle East

    first.

             I've already mentioned the FBI affidavit concerning

    the Arab gentlemen that were seen running from the scene.

    There is also the statement shortly after the bombing by the

    former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, David

    McCurdy, that there is, quote, very clear evidence, close

    quote, pointing to a Middle East connection in the Oklahoma

    City bombing.

               There are, in addition to that, public statements made

      and collected by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service

      concerning certain broadcasts originating in the Middle East,

      even in the unclassified ones, that strongly suggest a motive.

               In addition to that, there is in the public record and

      at the trial of Sheik Abdullah in New York City and at the

      original World Trade Center bombing trial evidence that Iraq is

      behind the conspiracy to blow up the Javitz Federal Building in

      New York City, which is a building in New York City very

      comparable to the Murrah building in Oklahoma City and that

      Iraq played a role in the bombing of the World Trade Center

      building.

               And the World Trade Center building bombing is

      particularly relevant to this case because the original spin,

      if I can use that term, was that this was the act of four

      misfits, the followers of some eccentric maverick sheik in



                                                                 



    Egypt who got together and rented a Ryder truck and put

    explosives in it and went down and tried to topple one of the

    twin towers and then went back two or three days later and

    attempted to collect the deposit on the truck.

             Well, we now know that while those facts may be true

    and the jury found them to be true that on the very evening of

    the World Trade Center bombing, Ramses Joseph, believed to be

    an Iranian intelligence agent and taken into custody after an

    attempt in the Phillipines to blow up 11 American jumbojets on

      the same day is now given the credit, if you can use that term,

      for the plan to blow up the World Trade Center bombing.  That

      doesn't prove that he's involved in the Oklahoma City bombing.

      What I'm simply suggesting to the Court that this litany that

      these Army drifters or these misfits or these two masterminds

      did this and did this alone is something that we have heard

      before, which has been over taken by events.

               The materials that we have submitted, your Honor, we

      believe are sufficient to ask the Court to order the production

      of them.  But I have gone a step further, aside from the public

      record; and I have a supplement this morning which I would seek

      to introduce into the public record and if I may just -- I gave

      a copy to the Government.  It's defendant McVeigh's motion to

      supplement motion for disclosure of discoverable and

      exculpatory intelligence collected by the Central Intelligence

      Agency, the National Security Agency, the Departments of



                                                                 



    Justice and State, and any other intelligence gathering

    agencies, Rule 16 material and brief in support, which I ask

    leave to file in open court this morning.  This is from the

    public record.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Excuse me, your Honor.  We might have

    misplaced it, but I don't believe any of the Government

    attorneys have a copy of the --

             MR. JONES:  Okay.  Well, I'll give you another copy.

    I thought it was in the brown material, but I'll get you

      another.  If I may just have one moment.

               THE COURT:  Yes.  And this is an open motion?

               MR. JONES:  Yes.  This is from material in the public

      record.

               The Chicago Tribune reported that the CIA spokesman

      had acknowledged on the record that the agency is involved in

      the search.  There is a description that the car bombs that

      were used at the Murrah building are favored by Islamic

      fundamentalists.  It discusses in Exhibit B that Oklahoma City

      has an Islamic Center and the state is home to about 5,000

      Muslims.  It goes on to say that a television documentary

      linked Oklahoma City to an Islamic fundamentalist network

      operating out of New Jersey, Chicago and Texas.  Mr. Steven

      Emerson, a terrorism expert and executive producer of "Jihad in

      America" said -- and I don't think there is any question

      Mr. Emerson is an expert on terrorism -- that Oklahoma City has



                                                                 



    been the venue for several Islamic conventions, including one

    in 1992 where 6,000 people cheered calls for killing of Jews

    and infidels.  This meeting, incidentally, took place four

    blocks from the Murrah building.

             The Daily Telegraph, a London newspaper of record,

    says the Federal Bureau of Investigation has called on the

    Central Intelligence Agency to search its international sources

    for possible leads among foreign terrorist groups.  The

    agencies' counter-terrorism center has issued a directive to

      all CIA stations to help in this case.

               Mr. Emerson, who has been investigating extremists

      committed to Jihad, holy war, since the Trade Center bombing

      says elaborate support and recruiting center networks have been

      set up with branches in at least 38 states.

               THE COURT:  This is material attached to the motion?

               MR. JONES:  It is.  I simply call it to the Court's

      attention.  I will file it and I will --

               THE COURT:  Well, file the motion.

               MR. JONES:  I will file it and not read it further.

               THE COURT:  Have you submitted the motion to the

      courtroom deputy here?

               MR. JONES:  I have not.

               I have it now.  If I may do so, your Honor, with a

      copy.

               THE COURT:  And if you have a copy -- all right.  It's



                                                                 



    filed.

             MR. JONES:  And I have underlined and marked the

    relevant sections that I wish to call to the Court's attention.

             Our motion, as I indicated to the Court, is predicated

    upon Rule 16 and Brady.  We believe that this classified

    information is discoverable as it affects the manner and

    disclosure of it, but doesn't affect the right for us to have

    it.

             In other words, CIPA doesn't affect our right to have

      it.  It merely affects the manner and means of the disclosure

      to us.

               We believe that this information is relevant to the

      development of a possible defense and that we should have the

      opportunity to inspect and review such material in possession

      of the Government as it may aid in the presentation of our side

      of the case.  That language is from Judge Gesell's opinion in

      Poindexter, when he ordered the release of National Security

      information.

               Now, if I understand correctly the Government's

      position, aside from the repeated intonations that Mr. McVeigh

      and Mr. Nichols are guilty, it simply boils down to this:  Yes,

      there was an investigation, yes, the CIA and the Department of

      State and the National Security Agency did all of this, but it

      doesn't help us in the investigation of our case because we

      believe Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols are guilty.



                                                                 



             I'll concede that.  That, I'm sure, is an honestly

    held opinion.

             But I'm a little leery about letting people who are so

    convinced of Mr. McVeigh's guilt as they are be the ones to

    determine whether we should get anything that undermines that

    belief, because they have a self-interest in holding to their

    belief, in protecting national security information and not

    releasing it to us.

             Now, clearly, although this may have occurred in what

      has been called the largest small town in America, let's not

      kid ourselves:  The evidence is overwhelming that the United

      States has very serious enemies who are embarked and have

      embarked on murder, assassination and blowing up embassies,

      federal buildings, naval yards, both inside this country and

      outside this country.

               And there is no reason why Oklahoma City is immune to

      that.

               In fact, the logic of it is that Oklahoma City or

      Omaha or Kansas City would be a primary target because they are

      unprotected, because they are soft, because they don't have the

      Federal Protective Service and the elaborate camera and the

      blocks in front of it to keep trucks from coming up to it.

               So any foreign intelligence group or any foreign

      terrorist group that has a desire to do the United States harm

      is now going to avoid the two coasts and come to those areas of



                                                                 



    the country that are soft.

             If there is not anything in this material that would

    help us, then fine.  There should be no reason why it should

    not be exposed to our experts, one of whom is a former senior

    consultant to the Central Intelligence Agency and a consultant

    to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.  And

    one of the others has been under contract to the CIA, and a

    third is one of the nation's leading experts on Iraq.  Those

    people understand the intelligence world and what must be

      protected.

               I don't propose to review that material myself or

      Mr. Burr or Mr. Nigh.  I propose to have it reviewed by experts

      with perhaps either Mr. Wyatt or Mr. Hankins or both of them,

      who are generally familiar with the defense hypothesis to

      determine if the information is helpful.

               But I don't think that we should go so far and say

      that we're trying to uncover the family jewels here.  Among the

      specific things that we have asked for are documents that are

      fairly easy to produce, such as passport and travel records.

      And while those are generally protected for privacy interests,

      I don't think that they impact upon the national security of

      the United States and disclosure to us would be harmful to

      those interests.

               So in conclusion, I simply submit to the Court that

      the public record that we have made shows an active



                                                                 



    investigation, a reason that the FBI at least at one time

    thought some of these people were involved; and clearly they

    don't think they're involved now, or they would have charged

    them.

             But we think they are involved; and the information we

    have, which we've submitted ex parte in camera, we believe

    supports that, at least to the extent of forcing the Court --

    forcing the Government to respond to a court order so that

    those documents may then be discussed in a secret proceeding in

      private and the claims of privilege and relevance weighed.

               But I don't think that I'm called upon today to prove

      relevance of something that I haven't seen.  I'm only required

      to show that there is a good faith basis for us to ask for it

      and there is some reason to believe that they exist.

               And I respectfully submit we have done that.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

               Mr. Tigar, you filed a notice indicating joinder.

               MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  And I just -- I'd like

      to address the Court very briefly.

               The motion before you contains 32 numbered requests.

      The Government's response is that it has sent letters to a

      number of enumerated Federal agencies.

               The most revealing statement made by Government

      counsel this morning, if I noted it correctly, was that the

      intelligence agencies did not provide reports to the



                                                                 



    Government.

             I had thought before this morning that the

    intelligence agencies were a part of the Government.  And I

    think that that provides the key to what we would think that

    it's appropriate for the Court to do.

             Before there was a CIPA, there were a number of

    decisions by the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts

    about the Government's discovery obligation.  For purposes of

    Rule 16 and Brady, there is only one Government, it is our

      position.  That has been a matter of debate between us and our

      adversaries since the very first meeting.  But if there is only

      one government, as there is only one party in a civil case --

      I've had civil cases here with multinational corporations as my

      client.  I had to search everywhere.

               If there is only one government, the CIA, DIA and so

      on are all a part of it.  And, therefore, the Court's discovery

      orders, the discovery obligations of the Government, run

      equally to all of those agencies.  And I would suggest that

      the -- at the very least, the Government give to the Court in 

      camera for its inspection the letters that it has sent to these

      agencies to see whether the discovery requests that are made

      comply with the Government's Brady obligation and Rule 16

      obligation as this Court understand it.

               With respect to the specifics of the requests that are

      made here, we, too, have a number of concerns.  The case



                                                                 



    against Mr. Nichols is filled with contradictions.  There are

    witnesses who have placed a large number of people in uniforms

    out at Geary State Fishing Lake, contrary to the Government's

    allegations; there are reports of bombings in the desert.

    There is the conflicting testimony of Mr. Fortier on these

    matters with respect to Mr. Moore.  There is the detention of

    Mrs. Nichols and her eventually leaving for the Phillipines,

    where she continues to be subject to questioning and harassment

    not only by agents of the United States Government but of

      foreign governments.

               All of these issues point to the fact that there is

      going to be evidence that is in the hands of agencies that

      Government counsel this morning said are not part of the

      Government but really are, these intelligence agencies.  There

      has got to be a search of that.  And it isn't just CIPA, your

      Honor.  I've been in cases in which I represented a former

      Secretary of the Treasury.  It wasn't at all surprising that

      there was secret information somehow or his voice had been

      picked up.  That was relevant and we had to deal with it.  I

      represented a former Secretary of the Senate Majority.  It

      isn't surprising that a search had to be made.  That's what

      we're asking be done; that the discovery obligations be

      regarded as belonging to the entire government, including those

      portions of it that are engaged in foreign intelligence

      activities.  And that's simply because those agencies



                                                                 



    themselves took credit for an early and extensive involvement.

             And so I join with Mr. Jones.  You can pick at, as the

    Government has done, request No. 20 as being a little bit

    overbroad, request No. 21 as being ill-phrased; but those first

    requests that ask for specifics about particular individuals

    and particular events -- your Honor, that lies at the heart of

    what we'd be entitled to under Rule 16 and Brady, and we're

    asking the Court to get in here and supervise the way that

    these Government lawyers deal with these agencies in trying to

      get this information to which we're entitled.

               We would wait until Mr. Jones submits his proposed

      order.  We may have an amendment or a change to it, but I

      wanted to let the Court know that we support this motion.

               THE COURT:  Well, but we have another problem here, as

      I understood Mr. Jones; and that is some of what has been

      submitted under seal and which I have not reviewed is also to

      be kept ex parte from you because of a difference between the

      defendants.

               MR. TIGAR:  I'm sure that's right, your Honor.

               Your Honor is going to confront at the appropriate

      procedural hour a well-taken severance motion.  And it may very

      well be that the material that Mr. Jones has submitted will

      bear upon that in some way.  And we'll have to figure out how

      to deal with it.

               THE COURT:  Well, what is your position with respect



                                                                 



    to my looking at what has been submitted under seal?

             MR. TIGAR:  Mr. Jones is entitled to represent his

    client.  And if he has a submission that's made in good faith,

    I think that case law supports his right to have your Honor

    look at it.

             If it turns out down the road that it's material to

    some motion for severance, then we have confidence that your

    Honor will take the appropriate steps.  But I -- I think that

    these ex parte showings are a routine part of the discovery

      process in both civil and criminal cases, including in this

      building.

               I've had in front of Magistrate Borchers -- I've had

      an ex parte in camera evidentiary hearing in this very

      building.

               THE COURT:  Well, I understand that, although it's

      always a matter that is uncomfortable for me to be reviewing

      material that's not known to you or to the Government's lawyer.

      And I have to be -- have to evaluate carefully whether I'm

      going to do that.

               MR. TIGAR:  I understand, your Honor; and I am not

      waiving an opportunity at some appropriate hour down range to

      say, well, now circumstances have moved to where we ought to

      see it.

               And I couldn't remember the volume, and Government

      counsel wouldn't help me; but in Alderman against United 



                                                                 



    States, which I think is in 390 U.S. at 165, but it might be

    394, the Government said that even where national security is

    involved and you have to give it to defendants that a

    protective order is regarded as sufficient because, you know,

    as Chief Judge Vincent said, judicial control over the evidence

    in a case can't be abandoned to the caprice of executive

    officers; and that's precisely the position that's being taken

    here.  It's not exactly the caprice; it's to their epistolary

    efforts, which may turn out to be the same thing.

               THE COURT:  Okay.

               All right, Ms. Wilkinson.

               The first question, so that I don't lose track of it,

      is the suggestion just made by Mr. Tigar that I more

      specifically order you and other counsel to search and to

      disclose -- and Mr. Jones has mentioned this -- to disclose to

      me what exactly you have requested from the agencies.

               MS. WILKINSON:  As I'm sure you anticipate, your

      Honor, we would object to that; and we would object to that

      based on the pretty settled doctrine of Brady and its progeny.

      As you know, the Government always has that burden and has it

      until the trial is completed and after that to turn over any

      information that is exculpatory as to either defendant.

               As federal prosecutors, we follow that and take that

      obligation very seriously; and in this case, when there is a

      close call, we always opt in favor of disclosure to the



                                                                 



    defendants, so it is something that we do in this case and in

    every other case as federal prosecutors.

             What we don't do, however, for the reasons that the

    Court set forth earlier, is involve the Court in Brady

    determinations.  That is for the reasons that you stated.

             THE COURT:  But I'm back again to being puzzled about

    what's Brady and what's Rule 16; and I'm still confused as it

    relates to this material.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Well, trying to understand Mr. Jones'

      rather eloquent presentation, I believe he was saying that the

      information may show some sort of mitigating evidence; that is,

      that others were involved or that his client, for argument's

      sake only, I understand, had a lesser role in this conspiracy.

               As we said earlier, your Honor, the Government is

      aware of no information that it hasn't provided already to the

      defense that shows that there is any kind of mitigating

      evidence that others directed and financed the bombing of the

      Oklahoma City Federal Building.

               In fact, it is the Government's position that the

      ammonium nitrate and fuel oil bomb that was used at Oklahoma

      City on April 19 cost the defendants less than $1,000 to put

      together.  So there is no information or evidence that would

      suggest that you needed a foreign government to finance and

      direct this bombing.

               As to the information that Mr. Jones requests about



                                                                 



    other foreign governments, he says he has information.  I would

    point out first of all if he has that information -- as you

    know, we're not under an obligation under Brady to provide it

    if it's in the hands of the defense.

             However, if he has information, particular specific

    information, that the Government, whether it be intelligence

    agencies or other entities of Government, have information

    that's exculpatory as to his client, I believe that we would be

    entitled to see that under seal and either search for that

      information or respond as to why we think we don't have that

      information; but we would not ask the Court implement some type

      of order where you would be reviewing information just provided

      from one side and asking -- no, ordering -- the Government to

      search for information from an agency or from agencies that

      although they are part of the Government, as Mr. Tigar pointed

      out, they were not part of the criminal investigation.  Perhaps

      I didn't choose my words carefully enough, but they were not

      part of the criminal investigation.

               All of the quotes that Mr. Jones read to you from his

      papers that he submitted today are all from journalistic either

      articles or television reports at the time, on or about, of the

      bombing, approximately, when there was early speculation,

      because there was obviously a great appetite by the American

      public to find out who did this, who could have done this.  And

      as we found out in our papers, no one wanted to believe that a



                                                                 



    U.S. citizen would perpetrate this type of heinous crime on our

    own citizens; so everyone was looking to foreign terrorists.

    The Government doesn't deny that.

             However, instead of speculating or hypothesizing, to

    quote Mr. Jones, we conducted a criminal investigation; and the

    investigation has not shown, although we have interviewed

    21,000 witnesses, that any foreign government had any

    involvement in this activity, 'that any foreign individual was

    involved with the conspiracy.

               So Mr. Jones is asking you to conduct basically a

      civil discovery proceeding in a criminal case.  He's asking you

      to allow him to hypothesize and speculate based on some

      statements he's received from people that the Iraquis or the

      Sudanese or some other foreign government financed, organized

      this terrorist organization and that therefore you should order

      the Government to either investigate or search its files for

      this generalized information on the hope or the whim that there

      is some other ephemeral suspect that could have been involved

      in this case.

               We would argue --

               THE COURT:  That is where I think -- here's where I

      understand we are in part.

               And Mr. Jones, if I state this incorrectly, I'm sure

      you'll advise me.

               But I understood from what he has said that if I



                                                                 



    review the material submitted under seal, in camera and ex 

    parte, I will perhaps come to the view that he apparently has,

    which is that the defense wishes to investigate beyond what the

    Government has done in its investigation and require Government

    counsel and then the agencies to assist in that investigation

    by providing information that may be of value, then, in further

    efforts by the defense, so that we're really, you know -- I

    don't know whether it's Brady or it's discovery.  And we're

    looking at the provisions in Rule 16 that says, ". . . may be

      helpful to the defense in the preparation of its case."

               And I think perhaps that's where we are, which then

      could have a Brady component to it, so that this isn't what the

      Government's investigation has been but what information may be

      in the possession of these agencies which could be of value in

      carrying out the defense investigation.

               Mr. Jones, is that --

               MR. JONES:  That is correct, your Honor.  And I hasten

      to say again on the record -- and I thought it made clear --

      that I'm not seeking this just for mitigation.  My first

      objective is for something else.

               THE COURT:  Yeah.  I understand.

               So we have a -- an effort to investigate where the

      Government has stopped its investigation.  I think that's where

      we are.

               MS. WILKINSON:  I believe that's true, your Honor.



                                                                 



    He's saying that perhaps the Government should have looked at

    these other organizations, say the Iraquis or the Sudanese,

    more closely to determine if there were any connections.

             What we can do is go back to the case law, which says

    that the Government isn't obligated and there is no general

    rule of discovery in a criminal case.  And that is what

    Mr. Jones is asking you to order us to do.  And in Pennsylvania 

    vs. Ritchie, a Supreme Court case in 1987, the court said that

    defense counsel is not entitled under Brady to conduct its own

      review of government files to determine what information will

      be helpful.

               That is really what they're asking you to do.  They're

      asking you to give them access to CIA files that aren't related

      to this criminal case, let them review it and determine if they

      can use that as a lead to further their investigation.

               THE COURT:  Well --

               MS. WILKINSON:  If we did that, your Honor, first of

      all we would be here for years.  The requests that Mr. Jones

      makes are so broad because of the nature of terrorist

      organizations and all the information he's requesting, because

      he doesn't have specific information about any one of these

      groups being connected with these defendants or with this

      crime -- he's asking you to open up all these files, allow him

      to review all of those.

               THE COURT:  Yeah, that's true; but excepting for the



                                                                 



    more particularized showing that is represented by him to be

    contained within the sealed document.  And of course your

    position is that I shouldn't look at the sealed documents,

    which makes it a little tough.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Our position isn't that you shouldn't

    look at them, your Honor.  It's that we should look at them.  I

    point out an example:  Yesterday --

             THE COURT:  Excuse me for interrupting.  Suppose I

    look at them and decide we're not going any farther with it.

      Is there harm to the Government then?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Not if you decide that way, your

      Honor.

               THE COURT:  Well, to try to focus on your objection,

      you're not suggesting that I'm some way going to be so

      contaminated by looking at this material I can't proceed in the

      case or something like that, are you?

               MS. WILKINSON:  No, your Honor.  Most respectfully, I

      am suggesting that you may be uninformed as to the scope; and I

      would cite an example from yesterday's Time magazine article

      where Mr. Jones is quoted, where he is putting some of this

      information out in the media about some threat that Vince

      Cannistarro, a former CIA employee, received and he reported to

      the Time magazine reporter that Mr. Cannistarro received

      information from a source that someone knew about the bombing

      before April 19.  When Time magazine called Mr. Cannistarro, he



                                                                 



    said that wasn't true and he had shown to Mr. Jones himself --

    told him that wasn't true.  In fact, the information had come

    after the bombing and that he believed that source was not

    credible and was calling to blame someone else.  I don't

    remember if it was the Iraquis other Middle Eastern country.

             My point is if you just listen to what Mr. Jones is

    saying -- and he may believe it's true.  I'm not commenting on

    that he's trying to mislead you in any way; but without the

    other information that the Government has, it would be very

      difficult for you to evaluate that information without knowing

      the scope of the Government's investigation.

               THE COURT:  That's why I have a generalized concern

      about looking at anything ex parte in any case; but so that we

      can be clear here, suppose I get the proposed order of

      Mr. Jones submitted by Monday and then examine this material

      and then decide whether I'm going to take it any farther.  If I

      take it any farther, I must contact the Government.

               MS. WILKINSON:  That would be fine, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  All right.  I think that procedurally is

      the next step.

               Mr. Tigar, you look eager to get in on this.

               MR. TIGAR:  I think I want civilian -- I like civilian

      status in the Time magazine sweepstakes, your Honor.

               But I'd like to -- I don't think we've resolved this

      question of the Government's contact with the agencies.



                                                                 



    Suppose, your Honor, that there is relevant and material

    information in the hands of the CIA.  As a criminal defense

    lawyer, as a criminal defendant, Mr. Nichols is entitled to

    that information under Rule 16.  In the ordinary course, I

    would ask your Honor to issue an order to the CIA to produce

    it.

             The Government says they're going to help us by

    sending the CIA a letter so that we'll get that information and

    I don't have to ask your Honor for an order.

               THE COURT:  Now, are you talking about in the Rule 16

      focus?

               MR. TIGAR:  Well, in the Government's letter to these

      agencies, your Honor, is only one letter.  It asks the agencies

      to produce such things as the Government believes the defense

      may be entitled to.  I'm not yet asking to have for production

      what the agencies give to these prosecutors.  I'm asking your

      Honor to monitor the process by which these prosecutors deal

      with these other agencies.

               THE COURT:  But here -- here there is, I think, a

      difference between Brady and the discovery rule.  My view of

      Brady is the Government counsel know what their obligation is

      and they will perform it or they won't and their case is at

      risk with respect to that.

               There is no way, I think, that a Court can evaluate

      the Government's response under Brady, nor should there be.  I



                                                                 



    mean I don't think that's the role of the Court.  And I don't

    believe that the cases put the burden on the Court to do that;

    and, you know, the -- the matter could be seen as a shield or a

    protection to the prosecution that a court has said you've done

    your job and nobody can challenge it.  I'm not going to do

    that.  That's their responsibility.

             But when we look at it under Rule 16, it's a different

    thing; and that's why I keep coming back to which are we

    talking about.

               MR. TIGAR:  I understand the Court's view about Brady.

      The Government, as I say, has sent one letter.  It promises

      fully to discharge its discovery obligations, including its

      Rule 16 obligations, by means of this method of contacting the

      agencies.

               I thought I was proposing a compromise.  I could ask

      your Honor for an order directly to the CIA to fulfill the Rule

      16 obligations.

               THE COURT:  What would that order say?

               MR. TIGAR:  It would recount all the categories of

      discovery to which we believe we are entitled.  I think that's

      a foolish act, because the Government and the defense have

      agreed on what those categories are.  I just want to make sure

      that when the Government writes the CIA a letter and says

      "Produce it," that we're getting an honest count, your Honor.

      And --



                                                                 



             THE COURT:  Okay.

             MR. TIGAR:  Because otherwise, we have abdicated this

    responsibility to the Government.  So that's why we ask for the

    production of those letters.

             THE COURT:  Well, let me come back to Ms. Wilkinson

    and apologize for the interruption.

             MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I don't want to take away from

    Ms. Wilkinson, but at some point I'd like to respond.

             THE COURT:  You will be able to.  But I want to let

      her complete her statement and, of course, address what

      Mr. Tigar did on this permitted interruption.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I would like to make

      something clear:  Mr. Jones claims that the Government has now

      agreed that all the intelligence agencies participated in this

      investigation.  That is not what we are saying.  We're making

      clear that the intelligence agencies only participated in the

      preliminary meetings.  They were not a participant in the

      criminal investigation in any way, none of the intelligence

      agencies.

               THE COURT:  Well, what I heard you say and what I'm

      understanding is that there was immediately after the event a

      kind of all-points bulletin if any agency knows anything, get

      on it.

               MS. WILKINSON:  That's exactly it, your Honor.  And I

      think that's what the American public would expect the



                                                                 



    Government to do; before we had any evidence that we knew it

    would specifically tie anyone to the crime, we would try and go

    out to all of our agencies, all the sources and determine if

    anyone had any relevant information so that there wasn't any

    rush to judgment as to who the defendants were in this case.

    And it was only after we followed much of the physical evidence

    that we determined that these two defendants were involved.

             As to Mr. Tigar's point that somehow in this case

    there is some reason for the Court to intervene and supervise

      our requests of the intelligence agencies, I would again point

      him to the CIPA cases that show this is unprecedented.  The

      court only gets involved once the Government determines that

      there is discoverable material.  It doesn't have anything to do

      with classified information.  Again, it's what we do every day

      as prosecutors.  We review the files and not with the court's

      assistance, and we determine what is discoverable under Rule

      16.

               As to that specific rule, your Honor, the only thing

      the defense is entitled to is something that's material to

      their defense; that is, something that will be fruitful for

      their defense.  They have no information that they've provided

      to us that in these intelligence agencies' files there is

      anything material.  They're on a fishing expedition for this

      type of information.

               THE COURT:  He's asking -- Mr. Tigar is asking me, as



                                                                 



    he says, I think, to monitor what you're doing; and I'll simply

    put the question to you as the prosecutor in this case and

    officer of the Court:  Is it your position that the requests

    that you have made, you or others in the prosecution role have

    made, to the agencies referred to here in your brief are

    adequate to give you information that would enable you to

    respond appropriately under both Rule 16 and Brady?

             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  We asked them

    specifically and gave them some explanation for Rule 16

      material, Jencks material and Brady material.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  So we asked them -- as I said, they're

      doing a very broad search.  I would doubt that -- I had

      requested and I have seen some results -- that they have

      produced more documents than would really qualify under that,

      again being careful because of the nature of this case and our

      request to err on the side of caution producing more documents

      than we think would be necessary to turn over.

               My answer is yes.

               THE COURT:  Yes.  You've made the representation, and

      I think that I'm entitled to rely on it.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, in terms of the review

      that Mr. Jones asked you to do ex parte, I would just point out

      one of the examples that Mr. Jones used himself about the World

      Trade Center case.



                                                                 



             While I think perhaps that connection to this bombing

    might make an interesting Oliver Stone movie, I didn't hear

    anything from Mr. Jones about how the defendants in the World

    Trade Center and these alleged connections to the Iraqi

    government have any connection to the Oklahoma City bombing,

    other than his hypothesis that perhaps these groups have

    organizations or cells around the country and Oklahoma City is

    a likely target because it wasn't as protected as some other

    targets.

               It may be stating the obvious, but the bombing

      occurred on April 19, 1995, on the anniversary date of the Waco

      tragedy.  All of the information that we have received during

      our investigation shows that the defendants were angry about

      the Government's conduct, they wanted to retaliate against the

      Government based on Waco, and that in fact the evidence shows

      that Mr. McVeigh was recruiting other individuals based on his

      hatred for the Government and unhappiness with the Waco

      situation.

               So that's the connection that we're following, your

      Honor.  That's the evidence that we're seeing, witnesses who

      are telling us that Mr. McVeigh was taking a copy of the Turner 

      Diaries, which is kind of a chilling account of a bombing that

      is very similar to the one that occurred in Oklahoma City and

      sending that to other people, family, friends, relatives,

      trying to recruit them into his activities.  There is no



                                                                 



    information, once again, showing that he has contacts or has

    been recruited by or is recruiting foreign individuals or

    foreign terrorist organizations.

             We have phone records, we have motel records.

             THE COURT:  I guess it's the Government theory of the

    prosecution, and I understand that.

             MS. WILKINSON:  I just point that out, your Honor, to

    show that we have conducted a thorough investigation.  And if

    we have information showing that there were foreign governments

      involved, I understand that Mr. Tigar is saying, like, it's the

      hen guarding the chicken hatch.  But our point is, we -- is

      that not the right phrase, Mr. Tigar?

               MR. TIGAR:  The fox.

               THE COURT:  It's the fox.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Fox guarding the hen house.

               THE COURT:  Well, it's a feminist revision.

               MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you, your Honor.

               But that's our obligation as federal prosecutors, and

      we are not trying to win the case; we're trying to do justice.

      Obviously, if we think the defendants are guilty, we're going

      to do everything we can to prove that beyond a reasonable

      doubt; but we have a different burden, and we understand that.

      And it's important in this case, probably more than any other,

      that we show the American public that we are carrying out those

      obligations and trying to find the truth and justice and not



                                                                 



    just trying to tar these defendants with the evidence that we

    have.

             THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

             Now, Mr. Jones, as promised, you have an opportunity

    to speak.

             MR. JONES:  I commend the Government for a resourceful

    effort to repeal the Classified Information Procedure Act.

    The -- I don't -- I don't want to exaggerate, but there is

    nothing more critical for the defense than this motion.

               We want the Court to proceed and we ask the Court to

      proceed in accordance with the Classified Information Procedure

      Act as interpreted by the federal courts, not as interpreted by

      Ms. Wilkinson.

               What Ms. Wilkinson wants the Court to do is to read

      this only as a Brady request as though CIPA never existed and

      simply trust to her and her colleagues the obligation to

      furnish exculpatory information which they begin by saying

      doesn't exist but then we just wrote the agencies and we've

      just heard from a few of them.

               And by the -- intoning the litany that we are

      responsible public prosecutors who wish to see that justice is

      done, we'll play fair within the system.  But these are the

      same people -- and I keep harping back to it -- who have

      consistently said to the Court they don't want judicial

      intervention in discovery.  We want judicial intervention.



                                                                 



    They have withheld information, delayed information, sat on

    information, and prejudiced our defense.  And I am prepared to

    back up every statement I make.

             They are not cooperating with us.  They are

    withholding it even until today.

             Now, we submit to the Court that any fair-minded

    person reading what we have submitted, including Mr. Panetta --

    it isn't necessary to talk about the Daily Telegraph and

    New York Times -- just read the statements made by the chief of

      staff of the White House that, of course, all these agencies

      were involved in the investigation; and as soon as the FBI

      announced that they had caught the culprit, they stopped.

               If we treat this just as a Brady matter and forget

      that Congress passed the Classified Information Procedure Act,

      we are harmed.  That's why they've written the agencies.

               They want to frame, without the Court seeing it, the

      request; but they object to the Court seeing privately the

      basis and the relevancy and materiality and evidence we have

      asked for, but they don't want us to see what they have sent to

      the agencies; that is we walk a switch in which they will come

      back and say there isn't anything.

               I simply wanted to say to the Court that we ask the

      Court to proceed in accordance with the Classified Information

      Procedure Act.  But since Ms. Wilkinson brought up the Time

      magazine article herself, I will address it.



                                                                 



             That article was written by Richard Leyco.  I wouldn't

    know Richard Leyco if he walked into the room.  He's never been

    in my office.  We've never had a conversation on the phone, by

    mail, by letter or anything.  And I don't know the basis for

    the statement that I told him that Vincent Cannistarro made a

    statement that he had received a warning on April 18, because I

    have never made such a statement; and in fact, if there is any

    doubt about it, when the Court reviews the in camera material I

    invite the Court to the first sentence on page 3 of the

      in camera material.  And the Court is familiar with the

      Cannistarro item because it has been previously submitted to

      the Court in connection with another matter, and clearly there

      is no representation there that that occurred on April 18.

               However, since the Government has brought it up, I

      counted the number of times that Ms. Wilkinson represented to

      your Honor that the Government had no evidence of foreign

      involvement.  The Government does have it.  It has a report by

      the former chief of counter-terrorism of the Central

      Intelligence Agency concerning specific information, specific

      targets, given to him by the chief of counter-terrorism of an

      ally of the United States in the Middle East where American

      boys died to save that country.  And if that isn't evidence of

      foreign involvement, then I don't know what is.

               It is the same type of thinking that allows them to

      represent to the Court that there is nothing exculpatory about



                                                       



    the fact that Eldon Elliott said that Robert Kling was 5'10",

    5'11", weighed 185 pounds when my client is 20 pounds lighter

    and 4 inches taller.  Of course, it's exculpatory.  Of course,

    they have the evidence.  And that information was furnished to

    us after we filed this motion, though it occurred on April 19

    and they've had it since then.

             So of course, they have the information; and of

    course, it's relevant and material, and of course, the Court

    should order them to produce it.  And we should go under the

      Classified Information Procedure Act.  The Court needs to take

      control of this discovery process because we are being

      prejudiced by these repeated public statements to the Court

      that they're doing something that they're not.

               THE COURT:  Will you rise to the defense of the

      Government team, Ms. Wilkinson?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Gladly, your Honor.

               I'm not sure what report Mr. Jones is talking about;

      however, I will restate again we have no evidence of foreign

      involvement.  Counsel have provided information, and he has

      information he provided to us of interviews of foreign citizens

      who declined or say they have no knowledge of the bombing.  For

      example, Andrew Strassmeir is someone that Mr. Jones has been

      requesting information.  He interviewed him, and Mr. Strassmeir

      acknowledges meeting Mr. McVeigh at an earlier point back, I

      believe, in 1993, but says that he never spoke to Mr. McVeigh



                                                       



    around the time of the bombing.

             But I think, your Honor, we should go back to the

    basics.  The basics are the Classified Information Procedure

    Act was not intended to span the traditional rules of criminal

    discovery.  All it is is a procedural tool.  And somehow,

    Mr. Jones is trying to turn that and say we're not following

    the CIPA rules or we're trying to withdraw the statute.  We're

    not.  All we're saying is there is no information that needs to

    be protected right now under CIPA or provided to them.

               We are following the same obligations, the same rules

      we follow for discovery of unclassified information; and you

      could assume that some of the information Mr. Jones is

      requesting is unclassified and apply the same rules.  That's

      what we're asking the Court to do.  Apply the same rules to us

      that you do in the unclassified arena to the classified arena.

               The cases of United States vs. Varca, which is a Fifth

      Circuit case, United States vs. Baptista-Rodriguez, which is an

      Eleventh Circuit case, all say that CIPA doesn't create any new

      law governing the admissibility of evidence or the discovery

      rules.

               We believe the Government is following the discovery

      rules, we are cooperating, we gave you the litany of

      information we provided to the defense, and we're aware of our

      continuing obligations.

               We will discharge those obligations, and we don't



                                                       



    believe there is any need for Court intervention.

             THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I'm going to take the

    step, the next step of looking at the material that was

    submitted under seal with Mr. Jones' motion and we'll see what

    happens after I do that.  I think we have to leave it at that

    point, at that stage right now.

             I have as the next scheduled item the 1:30 hearings on

    the Government's motion filed in this case seeking a protective

    order on defendant McVeigh's proceeding with discovery in a

      civil action in which he's the defendant.

               MR. JONES:  Your Honor --

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MR. JONES:  Do you want me to go here?

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I wonder if the Court would

      reconsider letting us address this Brady matter.  We have a

      motion pending.  The Court has not overruled it or sustained it

      in whole or in part, and we believe that there is still a large

      number of items that we have not received.  And I wonder if the

      Court would consider this procedure which I will offer in good

      faith with the hope that it will be productive:  I would like

      to ask the Court to rule on, I think it's seven or eight items

      today because, apparently, we don't have them.  I will then sit

      down with Mr. Hartzler and Ms. Wilkinson on the rest of the

      proposed order and see if we can determine whether they've



                                                       



    already given it to us and if so, where is it, how is it

    described, so we can verify that.  If they haven't given it to

    us, will they give it to us and when; and if they haven't given

    it to us, will -- we'll bring it back to the Court and you can

    decide whether they should or shouldn't.

             But with the time moving on and there are some very

    important items here that I believe counsel have and I think

    we're clearly entitled to, I wonder if the Court would permit

    us after lunch to identify those eight or nine items, the Court

      rule on those today or make some disposition, the Court further

      direct the parties to negotiate again; and we make a report

      back to the Court, say, within 30 days and we'll try to clear

      up.

               THE COURT:  We can take that up, sure.  I'm not going

      to tell you that I will rule on them.  I will hear you on them.

               MR. JONES:  I mean, if I can at least present them.

               THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, I think there is time for

      that.

               MR. JONES:  Do you want me to do it now?

               THE COURT:  Well, you can specify them now and give

      the Government an opportunity to consider it over the noon

      recess.  That may be helpful.

               MR. JONES:  All right, sir.

               Part of this is my writing and part of it is

      Mr. Nigh's writing.  I can read his.  I will try to read mine.



                                                       



             First, your Honor, we requested some time back and

    were told we would not receive it by Mr. Ryan; and it's

    possible there has been a reconsideration, but I can't find it:

    We asked for evidence of prior threats against the Murrah

    building.  And specifically what we were referring to was the

    Fort Smith sedition trial in 1988, in which it was claimed that

    Mr. Richard Snell and others had planned to use a rocket

    launcher to blow up either the Murrah building or the building

    in Dallas.  And I'm paraphrasing.  That wasn't exactly what it

      was.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MR. JONES:  So I would call it previous threats

      specifically against the Murrah building dating back to 1980.

      And I think there are two.

               No. 2, we requested information concerning the

      allegation in the search warrant used on the James Nichols farm

      that a confidential informant had told the Government that

      Mr. Nichols -- Mr. James Nichols had talked about blowing up

      the Murrah building and had a diagram or picture of it that he

      showed this person.  And we would like to have the specifics of

      that.

               No. 3, we have asked the Government to furnish us a

      copy of a memorandum sent out to all United States Marshals'

    offices in March of 1995 which was reported in the Newark Star 

      Ledger.  And the memorandum was quoted from, apparently, and a



                                                       



    copy of the Newark Star Ledger article was in our report to the

    Court as well as our motion for exculpatory evidence.  I think

    it seems fairly clear what the marshals' memorandum was

    referring to, and it's the one that talks about that they've

    received information indicating as a result of an incident at

    the World Trade Center trial -- and I believe that was it --

    that there would be a terrorist attack against a major federal

    building or installation in the United States, it would be a

    worldwide media event with many innocent people killed.  And I

      think that's a substantially correct paraphrase from the

      memorandum as reported by the newspaper.

               That, I think, goes to the question of the CIPA matter

      and in an indirect way but clearly goes to the exculpatory

      nature of it.

               We asked for details to Mr. Fortier's proffer and the

      negotiations dealing that led to the plea agreement with

      Mr. Fortier.  And we based upon that request upon a very

      informative article that appeared in USA Today by Kevin Johnson

      which described those negotiations.

               We asked for information on the lineups.

      Mr. Hartzler, I think, has written us a letter and made some

      reference to 60 days before the trial, they'll give us a list

      of people that they will rely upon as its eye witnesses for

      lineup; but if there is a lineup and people didn't identify

      Mr. McVeigh, I think that's clearly exculpatory and we should



                                                       



    like to have it.

             THE COURT:  Did he tell you that it was an actual

    physical lineup and not a photographic lineup?

             MR. JONES:  It may have been photographic, but the

    numbers -- and I'm informed that there were actual physical

    lineups in which persons did not identify Mr. McVeigh, although

    they claimed to have seen someone in the immediate area, a

    Ryder truck or whatever.  I'm not familiar with those details

    because I don't have the lineup information, but, apparently,

      there were such lineups.

               Next, we asked for information which we have been told

      exists that the FBI conducted an inquiry that or an

      investigation that indicated that a department store had leased

      or otherwise used a number of Ryder trucks on the morning of

      April 19, 1995, and that in two of those trucks -- and I'm

      paraphrasing the report -- there was a person, young, thin,

      white Caucasian accompanied by perhaps a shorter more stocky

      Hispanic person.  And I believe that this may be the person or

      the truck that Mike Marose, the man at 8th and Harvey -- I

      believe that's where the Johnny's Tire Store had in mind when

      he said it was Mr. McVeigh.  But if there is evidence of other

      Ryder trucks in Oklahoma City that morning that the FBI has, I

      think that's exculpatory because it may explain some of the

      sightings that are Mr. McVeigh or simply Mr. McVeigh

      look-alikes, and finally of eyewitnesses at Elliott or



                                                       



    elsewhere that do not match Mr. McVeigh.  I'm particularly

    interested in Elliott's.  It may be that they have given us all

    the FBI Elliott 302's, but I don't know who the employees are

    because they won't talk to us.  Those are items that they have

    not furnished to us.  And if they have furnished them to us, we

    can't find them, although we've looked.

             Again, they could be there, but if we could get some

    clarification to it -- but if they haven't, it seems to me that

    this material is clearly exculpatory, and we would like to have

      its production as soon as possible.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I'll ask the

      Government's response sometime during the afternoon session.

               So I was reciting that I have, according to my

      schedule, this motion for protective order in the criminal case

      dealing with the civil action against Mr. McVeigh, and we also

      have in the civil case 96-M-606, Mr. Nichols' case, a motion

      for protective order pending, dealing with the motion to

      dismiss.  And then at 2:30, we have the motions to quash filed

      by the State of Oklahoma Medical Examiner on subpoenas issued

      both by the Government and by Mr. McVeigh.  And counsel for the

      Oklahoma medical examiner will be expected to be here at that

      time.

               That's the schedule that I have; so we'll recess until

      1:30.

          (Recess at 11:50 a.m.)

                                PROCEEDINGS

          (Reconvened at 1:30 p.m.)

               THE COURT:  Please be seated.



                                                       



             Is someone for the Government prepared to respond to

    this request for the seven items?  Ms. Wilkinson?

             MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

             As to the first item, your Honor, it was my

    understanding that Mr. Jones requested information about a

    threat against the Murrah Building related to the Snell case.

    We have provided a 302 of an assistant United States attorney

    who had participated in that trial and had debriefed a witness,

    a man named James Ellison, who made the comment that back in

      1983 -- that is, 12 years before the Oklahoma City bombing --

      they had discussed building -- excuse me -- blowing up a

      Federal building in Oklahoma City.  And that was provided

      through an FBI 302 with a Serial No. 6754 to the defense some

      time ago.

               As to the second request --

               THE COURT:  And that's the only thing that you have

      that comes under that category?

               MS. WILKINSON:  That's the only specific threat we

      have back in that time frame that Mr. Jones is requesting.  As

      I told the Court earlier, we have provided additional 302's

      that are general threats and claims of responsibility, but this

      is the one that I understood he was specifically requesting.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  As to Request No. 2, allegations in a

      search warrant about James Nichols, we have provided that also



                                                       



    under an FBI 302, No. 9899.

             THE COURT:  Okay.

             MS. WILKINSON:  No. 3, Mr. Jones requested that we

    provide a copy of a United States marshal's memorandum that was

    described in the Newark Star Ledger.  We decline to provide him

    that memorandum for the following reasons, your Honor:  It is

    my understanding that back after the World Trade Center case,

    the first case and the second case and several other incidents

    that occurred -- for example, the arrest and filing of

      extradition papers against a man named Mr. Marzuk (phonetic),

      who is an alleged Palestinian fund raiser in New York City --

      the FBI issued an all-points bulletin, a threat warning.  There

      was no information in that threat warning saying that they had

      information that a specific bombing incident or retaliation

      would occur, but it was their belief, based on intelligence

      information, based on the verdicts in the World Trade Center

      cases, and based on some informant information, that there

      could be retaliation.  And that was the nature of that

      information.  We don't believe that that should be turned over

      to the defense.

               THE COURT:  It's your understanding that that's the

      reference in this newspaper article?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MS. WILKINSON:  No. 4, the defense requests details



                                                       



    about Mr. Fortier's proffer and the negotiations between the

    Government and Mr. Fortier.  We have already provided the

    defense with copies of Mr. Fortier's plea agreement.  We will

    not provide information about the negotiations between the

    Government, Mr. Fortier.  We don't believe they are

    discoverable; however, if Mr. Fortier takes the witness stand

    on behalf of the Government, obviously some of the information

    will be revealed on direct examination.  And I'm sure Mr. Jones

    will raise those questions on cross-examination with

      Mr. Fortier, and we will either -- either he will answer or

      we'll make the necessary objections, if appropriate.

               THE COURT:  Well -- and you'll also provide 3500 to

      the extent it's 3500 material.

               MS. WILKINSON:  That's right, your Honor.

               No. 5 was lineup information.  I'm not sure whether

      Mr. Jones was requesting all eyewitness information and lineup.

      We have provided 302's which document lineups and photospread

      identifications.

               We don't believe, however --

               THE COURT:  Do you have numbers on those?

               MS. WILKINSON:  I don't have those numbered, your

      Honor.  They're numerous.

               THE COURT:  Well, can you provide the numbers later

      without asking you to look at them right now?

               MS. WILKINSON:  We can, your Honor.  That may take us



                                                       



    some time because there is not a system for pulling those all

    out.  Obviously again through these 21,000 reports, we'd have

    to review most of them to determine which ones mention a lineup

    or a photo spread.  That's why we volunteered to provide the

    information 60 days before trial of those eyewitness

    identifications that we are going to introduce at trial.

             Your Honor, it is our position, however, that anyone

    who fails to identify Mr. McVeigh is not Brady material;

    however, we have provided much of that information through

      302's and inserts.

               THE COURT:  Well, I suppose it would depend upon

      someone who is being put forward as an identifying witness,

      identification witness, but who failed on another occasion --

      on some other occasion to identify.  That would be Brady, you

      would agree with that?

               MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, we would, your Honor.  And if

      someone made a misidentification, that would be Brady.

               No. 6 was information about FBI investigation into

      other Ryder trucks.  There are two reports, No. 13,247 and No.

      13,252, which document the FBI's investigation into some of

      these matters.

               The final one -- I have seven.  I know Mr. Jones said

      eight, but we only came up with seven requests that he made --

      were statements from Elliott's Body Shop of employees

      identifying or describing Mr. McVeigh.



                                                       



             All of those 302's have been provided to the defense.

             THE COURT:  All right.

             MR. JONES:  May I respond briefly, your Honor?

             THE COURT:  Yes.

             MR. JONES:  This information, the serial numbers are

    very helpful.  For example, on the first one, the assistant

    U.S. attorney that debriefed James Ellison, without knowing who

    that is, we would have no way of knowing what 302 to look at

    because it's a debriefing of James Ellison, but it's apparently

      someone else's 302; but in any event, the number is helpful.

               With respect to the matter of the memo to the federal

      marshals -- and I don't know.  I'm not here to argue the merits

      of whether we should get that, but at some time I think these

      outstanding issues are going to have to be addressed; and

      counsel characterizes why it's not important to us.  If it's

      all points, then that by implication included Oklahoma City.

      And we've already submitted information to the Court showing

      the large Islamic Muslim community in Oklahoma City, some of

      whom are quite radical and fundamentalist as indicated before.

      I don't think it's unreasonable for us to get that.  We're not

      asking for the intelligence data at this time that backs it up;

      we simply ask for a copy of a motion, which apparently at least

      portions of have been reproduced in the newspaper.

               With respect to the proffer matters, I frankly think

      we should probably reserve that to another time.



                                                       



             THE COURT:  I agree.

             MR. JONES:  And the lineup information:  It seems to

    me incredulous to believe that the Government doesn't have a

    folder labeled "lineups" in which this information is readily

    available to them and that they have to search through 21,000

    302's; and I simply invite them to perhaps check again with the

    FBI or whoever is in charge of their records on this.  I can't

    believe that 302's dealing with a lineup wouldn't be in a

    special folder or classification.

               With respect to the eighth matter -- and maybe I

      didn't make my request very clear.  It wasn't really a request

      for them.  What I was saying to the Court is that one of the

      outstanding issues to be resolved -- and we addressed it in our

      brief because the Tenth Circuit hasn't specifically addressed

      it -- is whether exculpatory, which includes impeachment

      material, which is in material that is Jencks, at least the

      exculpatory/impeachment purpose should be furnished to the

      defendant prior to Jencks being furnished, and that's still one

      of the open questions that apparently the parties are not going

      to be able to work out among themselves because of differing

      interpretations as they see it of the law.  And there is

      apparently no controlling Tenth Circuit case, and therefore

      it's ripe for your Honor to make a ruling, which we would

      invite you to do.

               THE COURT:  Well, I'm a little uncertain.  What's the



                                                       



    factual context we're dealing with?

             MR. JONES:  It's this, your Honor, and I'll try to

    state it fairly:  I believe it's the Government's position that

    if there is Jencks material, specifically, say, grand jury

    testimony, that contains within it material we could use to

    impeach the witness or -- and/or exculpatory material, that it

    is sufficient for them to simply characterize the exculpatory

    but nonimpeachment material by letter as opposed to giving us

    what was actually said, although they claim the same thing in a

      302, but we don't have a transcript.

               THE COURT:  Well, what witness are we talking about?

      What are you --

               MR. JONES:  I'm not sure all of them, but clearly we

      would be talking about four witnesses, Mr. Fortier,

      Mrs. Fortier, Mr. Elliott and Ms. Beemer and perhaps others,

      but those are the ones that come readily to mind.  Our

      position -- and maybe I should say our position is if there is

      anything in the grand jury transcripts that are impeachment or

      exculpatory, we should get at least at this time that actual

      wording of the grand jury transcript, maybe not the --

               THE COURT:  You mean testimony from those persons?

               MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  That portion that is

      exculpatory and/or impeachment material should be furnished to

      us along with all the other Brady and Giglio material.

               I think their position is it should be done later, but



                                                       



    I'll let them speak for themselves.

             But I do think that we are correct, is that both of us

    say there is no controlling Tenth Circuit law as such.

             MS. WILKINSON:  We agree on something, your Honor.

    There is no Tenth law -- Tenth Circuit law on this specific

    point; however, as I said earlier, we have provided a letter to

    the defense pointing out what we believe to be arguably Brady

    in the grand jury.  We have given them the substance of that.

    It's my understanding that is the law; that we provide the

      substance.

               We will at a later time, like we said, 45 days before

      trial provide them the actual grand jury testimony so that they

      can review that and prepare for trial for those witnesses that

      they're talking about, the Fortiers, Mr. Elliott and

      Ms. Beemer.

               THE COURT:  All of their testimony.

               MS. WILKINSON:  All of it.

               MR. JONES:  One matter Mr. Wyatt just brought to my

      attention, and that is Ms. Wilkinson said we have all the 302's

      from the Elliott Body Shop employees.  But may I ask if there

      are others other than Mr. Elliott, Mr. Beemer, Ms. Ramos and

      Mr. Kissinger.

               THE COURT:  You mean are there other employees?

               MR. JONES:  Right.  Those are the ones we know of.  Is

      there a 302 for an employee that we're not knowledgeable of?



                                                       



             MS. WILKINSON:  I believe there is a part-time

    employee named Mr. Nelson.

             THE COURT:  Nelson.

             MR. JONES:  Do you know the first name?

             MS. WILKINSON:  I believe it's Bob.

             MR. JONES:  Thank you.

             THE COURT:  Well, I'm not going to rule on the scope

    of the Brady requirement at this time.  I think we've made a

    record on it.  I'm not sure how I'm going to rule on it.  I'm

      not going to rule on it now.  I think it would be just jumping

      at it now; and even though there is no Tenth Circuit authority,

      there are other circuits where there may be at least persuasive

      authority.

               And I don't know whether you briefed that in any of

      the papers thus far.

               MR. NIGH:  We did, your Honor.

               MR. JONES:  And the circuits are split.

               MS. WILKINSON:  The Government also addressed that

      issue.

               THE COURT:  Well, I'll take a look at it and take a

      look at those authorities.

               Now, we have the motion in this case, 96-CR-68, by the

      Government for a protective order with respect to civil

      discovery in a related civil suit in the Western District of

      Oklahoma in which Mr. McVeigh is a defendant.



                                                       



             So I'll hear from Mr. Connelly on this.

             But I believe we have counsel for the plaintiff in

    that civil action in the courtroom.

             MR. OLIVER:  Larry Oliver, your Honor.

             THE COURT:  Mr. Oliver.

             MR. CONNELLY:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  May it

    please the Court, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

    establish very clear limits upon pretrial discovery.  In

    particular, Rule 15 precludes pretrial depositions other than

      in exceptional circumstances that no one suggests are present

      here.  The Tenth Circuit and other courts have deemed it

      abusive for a criminal defendant to seek to expand his rights

      of available discovery by resorting to a civil lawsuit.

               THE COURT:  In cases in which he's the plaintiff.

               MR. CONNELLY:  No, your Honor.  Mr. McVeigh argues

      that it's limited to that, but that's not the case.  In United 

      States vs. Phillips, for example, 580 F.Supp. 517, the criminal

      defendant was also the defendant in a state court lawsuit.

               THE COURT:  Well, let me just ask you this question.

      Perhaps the opinion deals with it, but, you know, I've got here

      the principles of comity, I've got a court -- a state court

      which apparently has jurisdiction of the matter, and we have

      Mr. McVeigh as a defendant there.  How can I simply enter an

      order that says he can't defend himself in that case and let it

      go to a default judgment?



                                                       



             I mean it seems to me that there are two ways to

    approach the problem.  One is to seek an order from the state

    court judge who has that case, and there is a problem with that

    because you don't have any standing in the case, not being a

    party to it.  The other is to seek an injunction to the whole

    proceeding in aid of this jurisdiction in this proceeding,

    which you haven't asked for.

             The order that you asked for is to deny a civil

    defendant the opportunity to defend himself.

               MR. CONNELLY:  Well, we have asked that the -- it's

      basically the same order that Judge Aspen entered in the

      Phillips case, which was again a criminal defendant and a civil

      defendant.  And in that case it was an order temporary --

      temporarily staying the defendant from pursuing or receiving

      any discovery.  Now, it may well be, your Honor, that if the

      plaintiff indicates that it intends to go forward -- that the

      civil plaintiff intends to go forward, that this Court has to

      take a further step and in fact stay the entire proceeding.

               THE COURT:  Right.

               MR. CONNELLY:  In the Phillips case, the state

      plaintiff indicated that he was not -- he was willing to defer

      to the criminal proceeding and not pursue discovery until after

      the criminal proceeding was wrapped up.

               But the Court clearly has the power, your Honor, to

      (a) stay a criminal defendant from abusing and exploiting his



                                                       



    criminal discovery rights by seeking civil discovery, which is

    initially the reason we came in here because Mr. McVeigh was

    seeking discovery.  It was not the plaintiff but the initial --

             THE COURT:  Well, I understand that posture.

             MR. CONNELLY:  And included international depositions

    and included notes in a deposition of FBI Agent Whitehurst.

             THE COURT:  What about the suggestion that has been

    made by Mr. McVeigh's counsel that the Government be noticed on

    any depositions and be granted an opportunity to participate?

               MR. CONNELLY:  In the first matter, I'm not sure there

      is any warrant for that under state court practice, whether we

      are entitled in fact to sit at counsel table at a state court

      deposition; but even assuming we were, your Honor, that is

      exactly the type of disturbance and interruption with the

      federal criminal proceeding that courts have recognized

      justifies a stay of the state court civil discovery process.

      It's disruptive of this case for an attorney for the United

      States that should be preparing to go to trial in this case to

      have to attend either as an amicus curiae or observer or

      perhaps even as a participant in a state court civil lawsuit.

               That is a -- for Mr. McVeigh -- I think there are two

      issues, and the Court has accurately hit on them.  First is

      whether Mr. McVeigh, represented by a federally appointed

      lawyer as an indigent defendant, is entitled to have that

      lawyer represent him and pursue discovery on his behalf in a



                                                       



    state court civil proceeding.  We submit the answer to that,

    your Honor, is clearly no.  There is no basis in the Rules of

    Criminal Procedure or in the Criminal Justice Act or in any

    other authority for Mr. McVeigh's federally appointed lawyer to

    be a participant and a defense lawyer for him an in a state

    court civil proceeding.

             THE COURT:  There is an order entered by me.

             MR. CONNELLY:  I was not aware of that.

             I think, your Honor, that that is, with respect,

      exactly the kind the practice that the court in Stewart, the

      Tenth Circuit in Stewart, 872 F.2d, held would be an abuse of

      process, for a criminal defendant to pursue discovery in a

      state court civil case for the purpose of aiding his criminal

      defense.

               THE COURT:  Yes, and this was made in what has been an

      ex parte manner under 848(q), in which I did caution Mr. Jones

      specifically on that record that this should not be done in a

      manner which would disadvantage the Government in this

      proceeding.  And therefore the Government should be given

      notice that this proceeding was going forward.  And of course,

      you're aware of it or you wouldn't be here on this motion.

               MR. CONNELLY:  Right.  We are aware of it, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  But -- and the authority, of course, is

      within the Court's ancillary authority in connection with any

      accused person not under the Criminal Justice Act here but



                                                       



    under 848 to defend him as needed.

             MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, it's our position apart

    from the Criminal Justice Act that as a matter of Federal Rules

    of Criminal Procedure and the limits of discovery on that

    case -- and they are very clear limits, as the Court is

    aware -- Rule 15, there is no provision for depositions in this

    type of case; that those limits cannot be circumvented and

    expanded by resorting to a state court civil discovery.  We

    would ask the Court to bar Mr. McVeigh from pursuing discovery

      in that case, and we would ask -- also ask the Court for leave

      to file within a given time, if the plaintiffs insist on

      pursuing discovery, an application to stay the entire

      proceeding.  And the plaintiff lawyers are here now.  And if

      that is -- that is the interest that they are asserting, we

      would ask that that also be stopped in order to avoid any

      prejudice to Mr. McVeigh.

               THE COURT:  Exactly.

               MR. CONNELLY:  Again we submit that's well established

      in the case law in the Tenth Circuit and elsewhere.

               THE COURT:  Well, I think I can call on Mr. Oliver to

      respond on that.  He's not representing a party in this case,

      but we need to know what his position is representing a

      plaintiff in this related matter.

               So, Mr. Oliver, if you don't object to it, I'll ask

      you for what your position is on behalf of the plaintiff, who



                                                       



    is Ms. Smith.  Is that the name of the plaintiff?

             MR. OLIVER:  Well, your Honor, it's not our purpose in

    this lawsuit in Canadian County, Oklahoma to help either the

    defendant or interfere with their defense.  It's not our

    purpose in this lawsuit in Canadian County to aid or interfere

    with the Government.

             I represent a woman who lost two kids in this thing.

    We filed a lawsuit.  It's a wrongful death action, Canadian

    County, Oklahoma.  I informed counsel for the prosecution that

      we will not interfere with any of their witnesses, not our

      purpose at this point to call anybody that is going to testify

      in this case.

               We had a deposition set today.  They asked us to wait

      till we had this hearing.  So far as I know, the man we wanted

      to depose today has nothing to do with this case -- I mean the

      federal prosecution.  And I certainly have no objection to the

      proposed order that Mr. Jones set before you.  I have no

      objection to notifying or giving notice to the Federal

      Government or anybody we want to subpoena.

               THE COURT:  Well, how about to the suggestion that you

      stay that lawsuit until we get on with this criminal

      prosecution.

               MR. OLIVER:  Sir?

               THE COURT:  The suggestion is that you stay your

      lawsuit until we get on with this prosecution.  Obviously, the



                                                       



    events that are going to unfold in the testimony here will be

    relevant to your case, and I wouldn't expect you to want to try

    the action in Oklahoma before this prosecution is tried.

             MR. OLIVER:  No, sir, it's not our intention.  We have

    sort of low-profiled it and are going to continue to be that

    way until such time as this trial is to be conducted, which I

    understand to be in August.

             THE COURT:  We don't have a trial date here.

             MR. OLIVER:  It was my understanding.  I don't read

      the newspapers perhaps as often as I should.

               THE COURT:  I don't know that the newspapers give you

      information that you will need.

               MR. OLIVER:  Anyway, we don't want to interfere with

      anybody, and we will share any information that we --

               THE COURT:  Well, I'm asking you now:  What is your

      position with respect voluntarily to stay that action?

               MR. OLIVER:  I think that, your Honor, that would be

      to the detriment of our client.

               THE COURT:  Would you care to elaborate on that?

               MR. OLIVER:  Yes, sir.  As time goes by, people lose

      their memories.  Witnesses have a habit of disappearing.

      Things happen.  We know where some of the people are to be

      deposed.  We will share our information with everybody, and I

      think that would deny us of our right to a day in court to ask

      us to delay our part of this litigation.



                                                       



             THE COURT:  What is scheduled in the state court at

    this time?

             MR. OLIVER:  We have no schedule whatsoever.  There is

    nothing scheduled, your Honor.  I have not asked for a

    scheduling order.  I have not asked for any dates, and neither

    has the defendant.

             THE COURT:  All right.

             Mr. Jones?

             MR. JONES:  I know that your Honor has studied the

      cases on this clearly.  But in order to make full

      representation of my client's position on this matter, I would

      like to address what I think are the first principles here.

               To begin with, the Constitution doesn't require the

      order that Counsel seeks for the Government, nor does it

      require a stay of the proceedings.  It would be a correct

      statement of the law that for each case he can bring up that

      shows that a stay should be entered, I can bring a counter that

      says a stay shouldn't be entered; and the cases all say the

      same thing:  It's discretionary with the court.  The legal

      principles are well established.  It's one of those situations

      that's fact-driven, as the Court sees.

               With respect to this particular case, first, I

      disagree with counsel; and the Court apparently is of the same

      opinion.  Criminal Justice Act clearly authorizes the

      appearance of counsel in, quote, ancillary proceedings, close



                                                       



    quote, that may reasonably bear upon the task that he has been

    assigned to handle.

             No. 2, many of the cases -- certainly not all of them,

    but many of the cases that Mr. Connelly relies upon are

    factually distinguishable from the situation here.  They

    generally involve either one of two circumstances.  First, the

    criminal defendant is the plaintiff in the civil action and

    sometimes sues the Government itself.  A typical example,

    someone is under an investigation for tax fraud, so they file a

      refund claim and sue the IRS in district or court of claims or

      tax court and try to use that as discovery; or if they're sued

      by a private individual, not the Government, and they are truly

      the defendant in the civil case, they try to use the civil case

      to discover the Government's evidence.

               And in fact, that's the situation in the Phillips

      case, which is remarkably distinguishable from here.  In the

      Phillips case, at page 519, the last sentence says, A review --

      last paragraph -- "A review of the discovery materials already

      obtained and requested by Phillips, the civil action indicates

      that Phillips has unquestionably utilized the state civil

      discovery rules for the prime purpose of obtaining materials to

      which he is not entitled under federal criminal discovery

      rules."

               Now, I haven't asked for anything under the federal

      criminal discovery rules; and I'm at a little loss at the



                                                       



    Government's position.  To begin with, they claim that this

    case will interfere with the Court's jurisdiction and allow us

    to discover things that we're not entitled to discover.

             Well, it's difficult to reconcile that argument

    intellectually with the argument made two hours ago that we're

    getting it all anyway.  And furthermore, the argument made in

    the brief, as elsewhere, is that the people that we don't --

    that we want to depose are straws in the wind, we're grasping,

    it doesn't have anything to do with the criminal case.

               Well, since there is no 302's from Kenneth Tyndall,

      David Irving, Kirk Lyons, Dennis Mahon, or Andreas Strassmeier,

      at least through the last filing, it's a little difficult for

      me to understand if the Government hasn't interviewed these 5

      individuals out of 21,000, then how is it that we want to take

      a deposition in a civil case that's somehow interfering with

      their criminal case?

               The truth of the matter is that we're not trying to

      use this to circumvent the criminal discovery rules.  We're not

      trying to use a civil case to discover their case.  We are

      using the civil case to defend us in an action brought by a

      highly visible plaintiff -- so visible that she took up half a

      page in the New York Times with her father or stepfather,

      legitimately so -- I'm not saying that in any critical way --

      who has lost two small children and who seeks a judgment

      against our client.  And the Government invites the Court to



                                                       



    stay these proceedings until it's over with at the same time

    they're asking for the death penalty for our client.

             So I say to the Court, when would Mr. Oliver have his

    case if our client is convicted?

             And once this proceeding is over, we've been informed

    by the district attorney in Oklahoma County (sic) that he wants

    to initiate criminal proceedings.

             So in theory, in Oliver's case -- and our defense to

    it could be delayed perhaps as long as five years while this

      matter winds its way through the courts here.  And I think he's

      right.  This woman lost two small children; two and three I

      think their ages were.  This is a death penalty case.

      Unquestionably she would be prejudiced.  And in fact, the truth

      is she'd be a lot more prejudiced by the stay than the

      Government would be by going forward.

               So what I think that the Court should do --

               THE COURT:  Well, how are these witnesses that

      you're -- these are depositions on your initiative; right?

               MR. JONES:  The individuals I identified.  Mr. Oliver

      has served other notices.

               THE COURT:  How are these witnesses you've noticed of

      assistance to the plaintiff in that case?

               MR. JONES:  They're not of assistance to the

      plaintiff.  They're of assistance to the defense.

               THE COURT:  That's what I assumed.



                                                       



             MR. JONES:  Mr. Oliver has some witnesses that he

    thinks would be of assistance to him in representing his

    client.

             What I said to the Court -- and I don't think I'm

    stepping out of bounds to say this; and if the Court thinks I

    am, you can stop me -- but the Court did share those concerns

    with me, as it's indicated on the record.

             THE COURT:  In the ex parte --

             MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

               THE COURT:  I've already mentioned it, so obviously

      you may.

               MR. JONES:  I asked for a low threshold amount of

      money to be authorized to spend, to take depositions.  I

      convinced the Court that I would give the Government notice of

      any depositions that we would take and that I would not seek --

      and I told the Court this.  And I say it again today and will

      draft an order to that effect.  I do not seek to take the

      deposition of any Government employee, any FBI agent, any ATF

      agent.  I will not subpoena any Government agency to produce

      documents in the civil case.  I absolutely will not do it.  And

      if some unusual circumstances causes me to change that

      position, I will advise the Government and petition the Court

      for modification of the order I invited the Court to enter.

               Now, that's an entirely different situation than in

      Phillips.  I'm not seeking anything from the Government.  But



                                                       



    in fairness, it is before the Court.  It may be challenged and

    contested, but it is before the Court that a large number of

    key witnesses, civilian witnesses -- not government employees,

    not investigative agents -- have for whatever reason refused to

    talk to me.  If a civil case comes along that I didn't collude

    with and I didn't ask for it to be filed, there is absolutely

    no reason why I can't use that proceeding to take the

    deposition of someone in Herington, Kansas, that talks to every

    newspaper in the country that comes by and sees him or her plus

      the federal agents but won't talk to me -- talk to Mr. Oliver

      but won't talk to me.

               Now, the only exception to what I've said is that I

      did issue a subpoena to Frederic Whitehurst, but I didn't issue

      the subpoena to Frederic Whitehurst until I made a request to

      interview him.  And the Department of Justice wrote me back and

      said, You need to issue a subpoena.  And as soon as I issued a

      subpoena to Mr. Whitehurst to take his deposition, along comes

      the motion here to prevent me from taking the deposition.

               So I don't see how the Court is prejudiced.  I don't

      see how the defendant is prejudiced.  I don't see how the

      Government is prejudiced in this case.  It seems to me that

      it's possible and proper to draw a protective order that

      requires me to give the Government notice, permits them to sit

      in the depositions, which under Oklahoma law they can.  I don't

      know whether they can ask any questions, but I don't have any



                                                       



    objection to that if they want to ask questions.  I can't speak

    for Mr. Oliver; that I will not subpoena any federal agents or

    federal employees, I should say, will not subpoena any

    production of documents from any federal agency and simply

    won't do it.  But for those civilian witnesses that will assist

    me in answering his claim, I should be permitted to take their

    deposition.

             And the Court has to control my expenses in that

    regard; and the Court is familiar with the modest amount I

      requested.  And I believe I also informed the Court if, after

      spending that, that I found it wasn't necessary to go further,

      I wouldn't proceed any further.

               So I ask the Court to enter an appropriate balancing

      protective order.

               THE COURT:  Mr. Connelly, do you wish to respond to

      this?

               MR. CONNELLY:  Briefly, if I may, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, the law is well established

      in the Tenth Circuit and elsewhere, in the Stewart case in

      particular, 872 F.2d at 662, I believe it is, that the -- a

      criminal defendant may not expand his rights of discovery by

      resorting to civil discovery.  That is true whether he is a

      civil plaintiff or a civil defendant.  In In re Boesky

      litigation, Michael Milken was sued as a defendant by the SEC



                                                       



    and indicted criminally by the United States attorney.  He

    sought to pursue civil discovery against the SEC.  Judge Polack

    (phonetic) said he's not entitled to do that.  Whether or not

    he's a civil defendant or civil plaintiff makes no difference.

    The question is does he intend to expand his rights of criminal

    discovery.  There is no question that is what's going on here.

    Mr. McVeigh's discovery in the state civil lawsuit is not for

    the purpose of defending himself there; it's for this case.

             THE COURT:  Well, how is it for this case when these

      aren't witnesses that have been interviewed in this case

      apparently by the Government?

               MR. CONNELLY:  Well, I don't agree that all of them

      haven't been interviewed.  Some have been subjects of inquiry

      made in the investigation; but that point exactly is the

      problem in terms of burdening the Government.

               THE COURT:  Well, you know, I think that procedurally

      you should seek to enjoin the entire civil action.

               MR. CONNELLY:  May we have leave to do that?

               THE COURT:  It is difficult for me to issue an order

      that says one side can't defend himself and the other side can

      proceed.  Mr. Oliver indicates he wants to proceed.  I believe

      we ought to have a motion that essentially is asserting that

      that case is an interference with this Court's proceeding in

      this criminal prosecution; and accordingly Mr. Oliver can have

      an opportunity to respond, as will Mr. Jones on behalf of



                                                       



    Mr. McVeigh; and we'll have, I think, more procedural

    regularity.

             MR. CONNELLY:  Okay.  May we -- does the Court want to

    set a date or propose a date?  Within a week?  We'll file it --

             THE COURT:  I think you ought to file the motion as

    soon as possible, giving notice; and then we'll have the matter

    heard.

             MR. CONNELLY:  Okay, your Honor.  Thank you.

             THE COURT:  But I'm going to -- Mr. Oliver, you don't

      have any problem with staying proceedings until that is heard,

      do you?

               MR. OLIVER:  No.  No.  We don't want to interfere with

      you or anybody.

               THE COURT:  All right.  So whatever time it takes for

      you to couch your motion in terms of an interference with the

      prosecution -- not just the prosecution, the Court's handling

      of the criminal case, then we'll take it on.

               MR. CONNELLY:  Thank you, your Honor.  We'll file that

      by next week.

               THE COURT:  All right.  And we'll proceed.

               Now, the other matter of a protective order is the

      motion by defendants in 96-M-606.

               MR. OLIVER:  Your Honor, may we be excused?

               THE COURT:  Yes, of course.

               MR. OLIVER:  Thank you.



                                                       



             THE COURT:  Thank you for attending.  We appreciate

    your being here.

             And this is, of course, Terry Lynn Nichols against

    Janet Reno as the Attorney General and Patrick Ryan as United

    States Attorney in the Western District of Oklahoma, the case

    being under the Administrative Procedures Act --

             MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.

             THE COURT:  -- on which there is a motion to dismiss

    pending with -- I think we have it set for argument the 30th or

      the 1st.  I don't remember which.

               MR. CONNELLY:  I think that may be May 1.  But

      April 30, May 1, these matters are set to be heard.

               THE COURT:  Right.

               MR. CONNELLY:  As the Court is aware, the United

      States filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, I

      believe, in October of last year.  And the defendants -- both

      defendants, Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols, have moved to strike

      that death penalty notice, raising a plethora of substantive

      and procedural objections to the decision to seek a death

      penalty in this case.

               Mr. Nichols, as the Court is aware, has filed a civil

      action, again raising procedural challenges to the decision to

      impose the death penalty.  I think all have agreed that that is

      part and parcel of -- to the criminal case and is going to be

      heard together.



                                                       



             THE COURT:  Yes.  And the legal issues are a little

    different.  The one is that it -- there is no jurisdiction

    under the Administrative Procedures Act because it's a matter

    given wholly to the discretion and not reviewable.

             MR. CONNELLY:  The United States --

             THE COURT:  The other is in the criminal case.

             MR. CONNELLY:  Right.  And the United States has moved

    to dismiss the civil lawsuit arguing that the remedy, if at

    all, lies in a criminal case.

               THE COURT:  Right.

               MR. CONNELLY:  And that there is no jurisdiction under

      the federal question statute and under the Administrative

      Procedure Act for Mr. Nichols to challenge an action in the

      criminal case by virtue of --

               THE COURT:  Is there discovery outstanding that this

      goes to?

               MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  And requests for documents?

               MR. CONNELLY:  Yes.  Mr. Nichols filed a Rule 34

      request in the civil case seeking all documents, internal

      documents of the United States Attorney and any official of the

      Department of Justice leading to the decision and underlying

      the decision to file that death penalty notice.

               The United States submits that that material is

      privileged under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(2)



                                                       



    and that the discovery should not be ordered until such time --

    at least until such time -- and we would submit never, but at

    least until such time as the Court rules on the motion to

    dismiss the civil lawsuit.

             The discovery is not necessary and I think it's

    conceded not necessary in any way for the -- for Mr. Nichols to

    respond to the motion to dismiss.

             He has opposed the motion to dismiss the civil

    lawsuit.  Discovery is not necessary in order to determine the

      purely legal issues raised by that.  This discovery would only

      be relevant if this Court were to hold that the civil lawsuit

      can go forward and that there is some litigation as to the

      impartiality and to the propriety of the decision, internal

      decision-making process upon which to seek that death penalty

      notice.  And for those reasons, your Honor, our position is

      basically twofold:

               One, we think this discovery request is premature in

      the sense that it should not be necessary and not be sought

      until after the dispositive legal issues in the motion to

      dismiss are decided.

               And second, we submit that it is privileged material

      under Rule 16(a)(2) of the criminal procedure rules that cannot

      therefore be obtained simply by filing a civil lawsuit that

      seeks the material under the guise of the civil rules.  It's

      pure work product, internal decision-making of the Government.



                                                       



    The reason why the Government sought the death penalty notice

    in this case and the matter of internal discussion and debate

    is classic work product that is privileged under Rule 16(a)(2)

    and under traditional work product law, Hickman vs. Taylor, and

    under decisions embodied in 16(a)(2).  So for those reasons, we

    ask for a protective order denying the discovery at least until

    such time --

             THE COURT:  At least staying it.

             MR. CONNELLY:  Staying the discovery.  And the request

      would also extend -- I believe there has been a request for a

      discovery conference seeking all persons with knowledge of the

      decision to impose and seek the death penalty.  And our request

      would also bar and stay, in effect, all civil discovery pending

      such time as the Court decides the dispositive legal issues and

      the motion to dismiss.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Tigar, I have your brief

      filed April 1, which is in response to the motion to dismiss --

               MR. TIGAR:  That is correct.

               THE COURT:  -- in this civil action; and, of course, I

      also have the opposition to the present motion.

               MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  But how is it that the discovery that you

      have requested needs to be responded to before we hear the

      motion to dismiss?

               MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, the motion to



                                                       



    dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) will not be heard until the end of

    the month.  Our request -- our Rule 34 request is, contrary to

    Government counsel's statement, extremely modest; and

    therefore, we face the question that the Court often faces:

    Does the filing of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion automatically or

    presumptively call for a complete halt on discovery,

    particularly when the discovery requests are extremely modest

    and when there is a well-founded claim that the 12(b)(6) motion

    is ill-founded, even if the Court should be inclined to agree

      with the Government's view?

               Under the only federal case that deals with the issue

      before the Court, Walker and Diaz vs. Reno, the court says in

      dictum that were there evidence that the Attorney General

      failed to follow her own regulations, there would be something

      to do; that is to say, we believe this is a case that will best

      be resolved on cross-motions for summary judgment.

               There is no reason to extend on into the indefinite

      future the procedural hour at which such motions would be ripe

      by denying to us the very simple discovery that we seek here.

               And I say "simple discovery" for this reason:  The

      12(b)(6) motion can be granted only if there is no conceivable

      set of facts upon which we might prevail; and yet the record

      before your Honor shows that the Attorney General's premature

      announcement raises at least some question.

               The Government's position is, of course, that we can't



                                                       



    have civil case review because we get review in the criminal

    case.  And in the criminal case, they filed a paper saying we

    don't get review there, either, so at some point, it has to be

    resolved.

             What we seek here, your Honor, is this:  A report or

    recommendation by defendant Ryan, a report or recommendation by

    the Department of Justice.

             Now, let's -- I want to go back to this, your Honor.

    I sat in Mr. Ryan's office because he invited me to, because he

      was required by law to invite me to; and I said to him in a

      record that I caused to be transcribed and on a written

      submission that I caused to be made public that there was no

      reason to take the life of this man.

               Mr. Ryan declined to furnish me with a sentence, a

      phrase, a syllable of evidence or basis upon which he thought

      he'd like to take the life of this man.

               I went to the Department of Justice and I demanded

      that we have that proceeding in the open, in clear light of

      day, but was denied.  I made again a submission upon the public

      record in clear light of day; and I said to those three

      worthies at the Department of Justice, Tell me, please, what

      this man, Mr. Ryan, who sat there as I spoke -- what did he

      tell you that said that he should be able to take the life of

      this man?

               And they wouldn't tell me.



                                                       



             Your Honor, this is not work product.  This was an

    adversary proceeding before the Department of Justice in which

    we were compelled to argue in the dark; and to claim that those

    statements are work product just doesn't fit the facts.

             Your Honor, they fall into two categories:  Either

    they're inculpatory of Mr. Nichols, in which case they've got

    to be somewhere in the record and so they should tell us, or

    they're exculpatory, in which case we ought already to have

    received them.

               Your Honor, it seems to me that as a practical matter,

      therefore, staying all discovery with this very modest

      discovery request and my promise that I'm going to move for

      summary judgment and expect a cross-motion and let's get on

      with it is wrong.

               Now, the second thing -- and I know I'm taxing your

      Honor's patience, but I think this is important.

               THE COURT:  Have I shown that in some way?

               MR. TIGAR:  No, your Honor, but I talk too much.  But

      I have to respond to this work product thing.

               I've litigated cases in this court, your Honor; and I

      thought that when a party said, "work product," they're

      supposed to file a privilege log and they're supposed to comply

      with the elementary rules.  But, you know, I don't mind a free

      and open encounter.  It's like Ike Eisenhower said about Joe

      McCarthy.  He said, I grew up in Abilene and fighting was okay



                                                       



    as long as the bullet was in the front.

             If they have a claim, your Honor, about this work

    product, they ought to file a privilege log.

             The point is that we have a civil case here.  In the

    criminal case, the information we seek is going to be

    producible at some point.  The inculpatory/exculpatory

    provision can be produced now of the reports themselves,

    perhaps for in camera inspection, which would be the procedure

    if there was a privilege log.

               And then since we're not talking about trying to take

      Janet Reno's deposition, for heaven's sake, let's get over this

      12(b)(6), which is not the way in federal civil procedure to

      resolve important issues.  And let's have cross-motions for

      summary judgment; but let us, for heaven's sake, allow the

      disinfecting power of sunlight into this process before we do.

               THE COURT:  Well, I'm going to grant the protective

      order to stay discovery in 96-M-606.  The issue, as I see it,

      on the motion to dismiss, is subject matter jurisdiction in the

      case.  And I think that's different, really, the way I

      understand these issues, from my limited review of the briefing

      that has been filed on the motion to dismiss -- is whether

      there is jurisdiction there, not whether a case could be made

      factually.  And I think that it is prudent to stay all

      discovery until we see whether the Court has jurisdiction, and

      then I'm not ruling on questions of privilege or work product



                                                       



    or anything like it.

             We'll address the motion to dismiss in connection with

    the same hearing as the motion in the criminal proceeding, but

    I'm going to stay discovery until resolution of the motion to

    dismiss.

             Now, we have the matter of the State of Oklahoma and

    the medical examiner.  I don't know if counsel for the State is

    ready to proceed.  We set it at 2:30.

             MS. HALE:  We are, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  If you're ready, I'd like to go forward.

               MS. HALE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  My name is

      Jeannine Hale.  I'm from the Oklahoma Attorney General's

      office, and I'm an Assistant Attorney General.  I'm here today

      on behalf of the Office of the Medical Examiner of the State of

      Oklahoma.

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MS. HALE:  I have with me Mr. Pat Crawley from my

      office, who is also an Assistant Attorney General, who

      regularly represents the Office of the Medical Examiner and one

      of the directors from that office.

               THE COURT:  Let me, if I may, ask you this:  I have

      reviewed what has been filed in the supplement in the Oklahoma

      statute that has been cited.

               The way I understand this statute, the medical

      examiner has authority under Oklahoma law to obtain medical



                                                       



    records for persons when he conducts autopsies and these

    procedures.  And that has been done in this case.  And there is

    reference here to a lot of X-rays.  I presume it was necessary

    to obtain X-rays for purposes of identification of people, the

    identification of the people whose remains were being examined.

             And it is that and any other material that came to the

    medical examiner from some other source, as opposed to

    documents or reports or information generated directly by the

    medical examiner, that's at issue here.  Is that my

      understanding, Ms. --

               MS. HALE:  We've had a little more time since we filed

      our quick response and motion to quash to study that, and our

      position right now is the subpoena is directed towards all case

      files.  And each of those case files contains internal memos,

      notes that were written in the process with regard to each

      death.  So we do have both internal agency memoranda which our

      Oklahoma courts have held was work product and was

      privileged --

               THE COURT:  Work product?

               MS. HALE:  Yes.  That's the terminology that they use;

      but upon examination of those cases with federal cases, it's

      basically the official information type privilege that's

      been --

               THE COURT:  Let's break it down, though.  I take it in

      these case files, there is information of the type that I've



                                                       



    mentioned, where it came from an outside source, like X-rays,

    dental records, things like that; right?

             MS. HALE:  That's correct.

             THE COURT:  And under Oklahoma law, the medical

    examiner has no authority to release those to anybody except

    back to where they came from.

             MS. HALE:  That's correct.

             THE COURT:  That's your position?

             MS. HALE:  Yes.

               THE COURT:  I'd like to stay with that first --

               MS. HALE:  Okay.

               THE COURT:  -- and see whether that's really at issue

      here, because I don't know.  We've got both the Government

      here, the prosecution, and the defense, Mr. McVeigh's

      counsel -- has subpoenaed the medical examiner.

               So we'll come back to you on these other matters, but

      I'd like to deal with these one at a time.  I think they may be

      qualitatively different.

               MS. HALE:  We're prepared on each of those issues.

               THE COURT:  Well, let me hear from the -- from the

      parties here as to that; and then I'll come back to you about

      this -- whatever this privilege is under Oklahoma law.  But the

      statute says, the way I've read it, Medical Examiner, you can't

      release this to anybody other than back to where you got it.

               MS. HALE:  That's correct.



                                                       



             THE COURT:  Okay.

             Now, what's at issue here?  Let me hear from the

    Government.  That was -- the Government made the first

    subpoena -- served the first subpoena on the medical examiner.

    Are you seeking the kind of information I've just talked about?

             MR. CONNELLY:  We are, your Honor.  We're seeking the

    entire case file as related to the medical examiner's work in

    connection with the 168 victims of the bombing.

             THE COURT:  Now, why do you seek the medical records

      of these people?  You know, one of the things that bothers me

      here is we're -- there is a reference here to privilege and no

      privilege and all that.

               But I suppose the interest at stake here is not just

      the medical examiner's.  He is something of a surrogate under

      Oklahoma law for the privacy of the persons who can't speak for

      themselves.

               MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, the way the subpoena

      originally came about is that we were asked by Mr. McVeigh and

      the defense to facilitate production of the case files of the

      medical examiner.  We agreed to subpoena those files --

               THE COURT:  Okay.

               MR. CONNELLY:  -- for them; so in some sense, we were

      a facilitator of discovery that the defense was requesting.  We

      also have an independent interest, more narrowly than the

      subpoena that was ultimately issued, in certain identification



                                                       



    issues in order to prove our case.  To identify, for example, a

    particular victim, there may be a need -- as the medical

    examiner found, need to go back and seek the preliminary

    medical records or dental records to aid in the identification

    process.  But that is a reason we -- twofold reason that we

    sought the subpoena.

             THE COURT:  Is there an apparent need now with respect

    to all of these records?  What did you subpoena?  All case

    files?  Which is at least 168?

               MR. CONNELLY:  We did that.  That was done, indeed, to

      facilitate discovery for the defense.  I think they had an

      interest in pursuing some theories of exculpation or

      impeachment or otherwise.  I don't want to speak for them, but

      that was done.  It indicated to us that they were interested in

      obtaining the entire case files of all victims.

               We had a much more narrow interest in order to prove

      our own case as necessary; and to the extent stipulations

      cannot be obtained on that to prove the identification issues,

      there may be need for some specific records.

               But we are certainly -- and so like I say, there was a

      twofold interest in -- in -- in our subpoenaing the medical

      examiner records.

               Now, we are certainly willing to work on stipulations

      with all the parties, with the two defendants and with the

      medical examiner to the extent that might obviate the issue.



                                                       



    To the extent the issue can't be obviated, we think there is an

    issue under the supremacy laws of whether or not the state

    statute can bar evidence necessary.  To the extent it is, in

    fact, necessary to the criminal case, we would submit that the

    federal court's authority needs to be vindicated under the

    supremacy clause and state privilege cannot control.  Rule 501

    establishes the privilege in a federal criminal question case

    as this, and we don't think there is any question that these

    records are not privileged as a matter of federal law under

      501.

               But we would certainly --

               THE COURT:  Well, you know, I'm getting back to whose

      records are they, really.  The medical examiner has the power

      to get them from health care providers.  I assume one of the

      type here that you know about are going to be dental records,

      for example, since that -- that, I'm advised, is one of the

      ways of identifying remains.

               But suppose we take this approach that the medical

      examiner is required not to release those records back to their

      sources until we determine whether it's necessary to provide

      any of them and then have this matter in a more particularized

      purpose, if it is necessary to address any of those records for

      the identification of any particular set of remains.

               MR. CONNELLY:  I think that's an excellent suggestion.

      Like I say, our interest is more narrow.  It may be that the



                                                       



    parties should sit down with the medical records.  We could

    certainly do that.  And it would also be in the context of

    perhaps stipulations, if there are stipulations as to identity

    of a particular victim that would obviate the need.  And I

    don't see any reason why identity should be the test, the issue

    in certain of these cases.  If it is, we may have a need for

    certain medical- or dental-type records that the medical

    examiner himself relied on in determining identity.

             THE COURT:  You're anticipating calling the medical

      examiner as a witness?

               MR. CONNELLY:  I think that's all to be worked out in

      terms of -- I think a lot depends on stipulations and depends

      on what we can work out voluntarily to save time and to

      streamline.  But that's certainly an issue that we're going to

      need to explore as trial approaches; and it's something we'll

      have to explore with all the parties, with the two defendants

      and perhaps with the medical examiner as well.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Jones, are you addressing

      this, since you've issued the subpoena, too, and then

      Mr. Connelly says you put him up to it?

               MR. JONES:  I did, your Honor; and he was very

      accommodating, I'm sure a decision he now regrets.

               First with respect to the Attorney General's claim of

      privilege, that has a kind of a nostaglic pre-Appomattox Court

      House flavor to it; but the truth of the matter is the South



                                                       



    lost the Civil War and the supremacy clause governs.  Ind the

    decision that we cite in our brief on page 3, the Coopers & 

    Lybrand case, the court holds that there is no confidential

    accountant/client privilege under federal law and that in a

    fundamentally federal proceeding such as this, the court may

    not recognize a state-created privilege.

             THE COURT:  Well, but I -- I separated that out from

    this matter of the fact that the medical examiner has presently

    custody of records that didn't -- he didn't generate.

               MR. JONES:  That's true, but they were furnished to

      him and they're in his custody now.

               THE COURT:  But there is a state statute that says

      he's got the authority to get them, but he can't give them to

      anybody else.

               MR. JONES:  That's true, but it seems to me clearly

      that that statute fails --

               THE COURT:  Well, I don't think that's a privilege

      issue.

               MR. JONES:  Well, perhaps -- If it's not a privilege

      issue, then on what basis can you withhold subpoenaed evidence

      in a criminal case?

               THE COURT:  Well, because it isn't his evidence.

      These aren't his records.  He had the power to get them --

               MR. JONES:  I understand --

               THE COURT:  -- but he doesn't have the power to give



                                                       



    them to anybody.  That's the way I understand Oklahoma law.

    You're an Oklahoma lawyer.  You know better than I do.

             MR. JONES:  I wouldn't concede that, your Honor; but I

    don't see how that's any different than -- I understand the

    point the Court is making; but how is that different than those

    tax cases that we are all unfortunately familiar with where I

    give my tax records to my CPA to prepare my tax return and

    while they're at his office, the Federal Government subpoenas

    them?

               THE COURT:  Yeah, but the CPA is your agent.

               MR. JONES:  Exactly.  He is --

               THE COURT:  And the medical examiner is not

      voluntarily the agent of any of the people who were killed.

               MR. JONES:  I understand the distinction the Court is

      making.  It may be a good one; but basically, what I say is

      that once you are in possession of something, no matter how you

      got it, and somebody subpoenas it, as long as you're in

      possession of it, it can be subpoenaed, particularly in a

      criminal case and particularly if it's evidence.

               THE COURT:  Let me ask you what's wrong with my

      suggestion, which is to instruct the medical examiner to retain

      the records and not return them and then see what we really

      need, because I don't know that we should go charging off and

      making all of these copies of X-rays and all these things if we

      don't actually need it but for a few or any.



                                                       



             MR. JONES:  I don't think that your Honor's suggestion

    is an unwise one; but I have two comments that I would make in

    reference to it very respectfully.

             First, we are doing what the medical examiner told us

    to do.  Dr. Jordan himself, when I made a request for the case

    file on Mrs. Levy and one other case file -- I think it was

    case No. 107 -- he said, quote, "All you've got to do is bring

    me a subpoena and I'll make the copies and give them to you."

             THE COURT:  Maybe he hadn't consulted with counsel at

      that time.

               MR. JONES:  Well, I think he had, your Honor, because

      we talked earlier in the morning and we talked later in the

      day.

               Same thing with the X-rays.  He said, Steve, give me a

      subpoena and they're here and, in fact, I've already made you

      copies.  Bring me a subpoena and you can pick them up.  So I

      thought that's how this arose.  He suggested a subpoena.  I

      called Mr. Connelly, who was in one of his cooperative spirits

      that day -- something that doesn't happen very often -- but

      nevertheless, he accommodated my request, and then along comes

      the medical examiner's lawyer, the Attorney General, saying we

      don't want to do it that way.

               So the first answer is I did it the way he said.

               Now, so -- the merits of the Court's suggestion:  The

      Court knows because you authorized it that we have retained as



                                                       



    a forensic pathologist in this case Sir T.K. Marshall, the

    retired chief state pathologist for Northern Ireland in

    Belfast, because our investigation indicates that he is the man

    most familiar with autopsies and forensic evidence of deceased

    persons as a result of ammonium nitrate explosions.  And the

    last visits that I made to the United Kingdom, I had a lengthy

    meeting with him and took with me files from the medical

    examiners' office, copies that had been furnished, and went

    over it.

               There is some serious issues here perhaps concerning

      the identification of body parts and who they belong to.

               THE COURT:  Well, but it isn't massive, is it?  I

      mean -- we know of one situation, because we've already

      discussed it, with respect to the exhuming of the remains of

      one person.

               MR. JONES:  There are two things there, your Honor.

      First, it potentially is massive, but I'll come to that in a

      minute.  If P54 is Mrs. Levy's leg, as the Government contends,

      then, obviously, the second leg in Mrs. Levy's casket belongs

      to somebody and; so we keep going down the process till we find

      out or exclude someone.

               But secondly, very serious allegations have been

      raised in this case, not by defense counsel, but frankly by

      persons who at least on their surface appear to have

      substantial qualifications and credentials on explosions,



                                                       



    retired chief of the FBI field office in Los Angeles and

    retired general in the United States Army, qualified in

    explosives that have postulated based upon rather deep research

    that there is more than one explosive device here.  And there

    is other evidence or information, such as the seismograph.

             Dr. Marshall has advised me that there are ways of

    determining that he is familiar with of whether there is a

    second explosion based upon the medical examiner's records.

             THE COURT:  Yes.

               MR. JONES:  So I don't want to exclude anything.

               THE COURT:  No, you know, I've assumed that somewhere

      along the way here that in trial, we're going to be concerned

      with what these remains tell us about direction, a lot of other

      things, location of any explosive device and all that.  I'm

      assuming that.  But I don't know that it's necessary right now

      to just have this wholesale turnover.

               Mr. Connelly suggests that there may be a meeting of

      all involved, Mr. Tigar's team, too, since they're going to be

      concerned about this but haven't been involved on this dispute

      yet on paper.

               MR. WOODS:  We have, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  Did you join on this?  You haven't issued

      a subpoena, have you?

               MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor.  We have had the same

      discussions with the Government -- may I just bring something



                                                       



    to the attention of the Court?  The way this dispute arose,

    last year, the FBI provided the medical records from the

    medical examiner's office to us.  They all consisted of three

    or four sheets per deceased person.

             That was represented to be the complete records of the

    medical examiner's record.

             Once Mr. Jones went over and actually looked at one,

    which was Lakesha Levy, it turns out to be there are hundreds

    of pages in each of these files which the Government didn't

      know existed, nor did we.  And we have then made the request of

      the Government to get those; and that's what they were doing

      when the medical examiners threw up this opposition.

               So we have drafted our subpoena and it will be filed

      tomorrow.

               THE COURT:  Well --

               MR. WOODS:  That's where we are.

               MR. JONES:  May I address the Court's suggestion?

               THE COURT:  Yes.

               MR. JONES:  I think we can live with your Honor's

      suggestion.  I would, if the Court would permit me, offer this

      modification:  I believe that the motion should be overruled to

      quash on the understanding that the medical examiner of the

      State of Oklahoma will make available to us at his regular

      working hours in a room where we could privately discuss and

      our expert can come and see his complete files on the Oklahoma



                                                       



    City bombing case victims -- that is, the deceased persons,

    X-rays, everything that he has and that those items that we may

    need to copy or to have photographs, such as X-rays or

    reproduced, will be reproduced.

             At some point, as this case makes its way towards

    trial, while I'm perfectly willing to try to negotiate and

    resolve differences amicably, I think decisions have to be made

    so we don't keep coming back to the Court.  We did what the

    medical examiner told us to do.  That, apparently, is not

      satisfactory.  I'm willing to do what the Court suggests as a

      reasonable compromise if we don't have to keep coming back up

      here to get another subpoena for X-rays.

               In other words, if it's just understood that he'll

      make them available, our expert will be there.  Presumably the

      Government may bring someone in, Mr. Tigar may bring someone

      in.  And whatever we want to copy under an appropriate

      protective order that's already been entered with respect to

      the victims' photographs, we may copy at our expense -- or I

      shouldn't say at our expense, under CJA48.

               I doubt there will be much copying.

               THE COURT:  What is the protective order on

      photographs?  I'm not aware of it.

               MR. JONES:  There was a protective order on

      photographs that they would not be shown to anyone other than

      the expert witnesses, the attorneys in the case; and in the



                                                       



    case of those given to me, that they would remain in my

    personal custody under lock and key.  And they are.

             THE COURT:  This is an order entered before me in this

    case?

             MR. JONES:  I believe so, your Honor.

             THE COURT:  Before I was in the case.

             MR. JONES:  Yes.  And I think that the amount of

    copying that we will need to do will be very limited.  I should

    suspect a fraction of it.

               I don't know that we really wanted to copy all of it

      here.  I think what we really wanted was it made available to

      us so we could then copy.

               THE COURT:  So you're suggesting an opportunity for

      inspection?

               MR. JONES:  Over a several-day period or several-week

      period.

               THE COURT:  Yes, I understand that.  It can't be

      done --

               MR. JONES:  Wholesale inspection under a protective

      order and copying of those items that we think we need.  I

      can't imagine there will be very many.

               THE COURT:  And if there is a dispute about the

      copying, we'll deal with it --

               MR. JONES:  Yes.

               THE COURT:  -- where we have specific items.



                                                       



             MR. JONES:  Yes.  I can't imagine that there would be

    a dispute, but there might be.

             I suppose if we tried to abuse it, we'd just go ahead

    and copy them, but we're not going to do that.

             THE COURT:  Mr. Connelly, does the Government share

    that approach?

             MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, I think that will be

    workable.

             THE COURT:  Well, let's hear, Ms. Hale, from you on

      that.

               I think there is a difference here between inspection

      of records and release of them.

               MS. HALE:  Your Honor, Mr. Crawley has filed a motion

      for admission pro hac vice earlier today.  Would it be

      appropriate --

               THE COURT:  Granted.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.

               I think that we need to clear up what kind of records

      we're talking about here.  I think your Honor has a good grasp,

      first of all, on part of what the records are.  The medical

      examiner has almost plenary power to go out and get records

      from anybody.  They have no choice in that matter in the State

      of Oklahoma.  They retrieve these records despite any

      privileges that may exist when he's examining a death that's --

      that falls within the purview of his office.



                                                       



             THE COURT:  Yes.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  What we have in the duces tecum

    subpoenas that have been served on our office by both sides --

    and we want to make it absolutely clear, the office of the

    chief medical examiner intends not to hinder the prosecution or

    the defense in this case.  We take an absolute neutral

    position.  We simply have found what we have found from our

    investigation.

             Now, in the records, we have antemortem and we have

      postmortem records, and that's the distinction that must be

      made here.

               THE COURT:  I understand.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  The statute protects those records that

      we have retrieved that have to do with the victims prior to the

      April 19 explosion.

               All of the records that the medical examiner has --

      and he has, oh, somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 X-rays, for

      instance -- these include dental X-rays.  A lot of the dental

      X-rays and those other X-rays were ones that were taken after

      the explosion.

               We have no problem with the release of those X-rays if

      somebody wants to pay the costs of, as I understand it, both

      parties -- and I think this is something that must be resolved

      for certain today in this hearing, is that as long as we

      understand that the original records -- and that's what our



                                                       



    first understanding they were going to take everything we

    had --

             THE COURT:  Oh, no.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  So that's not going to happen; but as

    far as copying these X-rays, whoever wants to pay for them, we

    have not a problem with that.

             The investigation of the chief medical examiner in

    each of these cases has been provided to both parties, and the

    investigation is complete.

               The only records or memorandum that may be contained

      in the file other than the medical records that cannot be

      released under the statute is the memos or notes of the agents

      during the investigation as they're going through the rubble.

      And some of it may be nothing more than scribbling.  It

      probably doesn't mean anything to anybody else, but it

      generally is protected in Oklahoma.  As your Honor probably

      well knows, the system in Oklahoma is bifurcated as far as

      civil and criminal.

               The Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals, which is a

      court of last resort in criminal cases, has held that these

      memos of the agents in the investigation are subject to what

      they call the work product privilege and are not discoverable

      in a criminal prosecution.

               Now --

               THE COURT:  I don't think that privilege affects this



                                                       



    Court.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  I understand that that privilege would

    not -- first of all, it doesn't exist in the Federal Rules; but

    then the Federal Rules, as I understand them, do not list out

    what the privileges are.  The privilege would be determined by

    this Court in light of reason and experience --

             THE COURT:  And common law.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  -- whether that privilege could be

    sustained by this Court.

               But we're not really struggling with those particular

      documents in the first place.  We don't think that that's of

      much note.

               But we do have a statute, and we would disagree that

      the supremacy clause comes into play in that statute

      automatically.  We feel like that there must be some showing

      here.  The right of privacy of these individuals is very great.

      We have extremely sensitive information that's going to be in a

      person's file as far as their complete medical history in the

      past.

               THE COURT:  Was that what the Oklahoma medical

      examiner did, just gather all kinds of medical history?

               MR. CRAWLEY:  We have all kinds of information that

      was gathered because, as your Honor probably knows, in this

      particular case, there was a great amount of difficulty in

      identifying the bodies; so we had personal items, photographs



                                                       



    that we retrieved from the families, and I'm sure --

             THE COURT:  But I don't -- the treatment of a person

    for this or that condition:  Is that in some way relevant to

    all of this?

             MR. CRAWLEY:  I don't believe so.

             THE COURT:  Here's what I'm suggesting, you see:  The

    statute says the records may not be released to any other

    person by the medical examiner and the custodians of such

    records shall incur no liability by reason of the release of

      such records to the medical examiner.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  Correct.

               THE COURT:  Now, it doesn't literally say that the

      records may not be exposed to inspection to -- under

      appropriate protective orders to representatives at least of

      the parties in this case.  And there is a difference -- to me a

      lawyer-like difference -- between releasing records and

      exposing them to inspection to determine whether there is a

      need for calling on them.

               It seems sensible to me to go forward with the notion

      that Mr. Jones has expressed here to have a conference and an

      inspection of the records where they are with the assistance,

      of course, of the medical examiner's people, to determine what

      is needed and then to call for that, assuming there is anything

      needed, on a specific motion or order.

               I don't know, as I sit here, the law with respect to



                                                       



    who owns the medical records of a deceased person and what is

    the privacy right that remains after a person is deceased.

             I don't know the answer to that.  Do you?

             MR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I wouldn't want to venture it at

    this point.  I would say that, though, there is going to be

    information in these files that affects some living persons,

    too, by the nature of these particular files.

             However, I am familiar with a case where they cited --

    that your Honor had established a confidentiality order, I

      believe it was, where an in camera inspection is made and then

      there is a solid order here about the release of this kind of

      information -- which, as your Honor recognizes, we're not on

      anybody's side here.

               THE COURT:  I understand.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  But we certainly don't want --

               THE COURT:  You don't want to get exposed to liability

      here, among other things.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  I'm not as frightened of liability as I

      am just the inflammatory press releases that may come out of

      something like that --

               THE COURT:  That, of course --

               MR. CRAWLEY:  -- that would effect innocent people.

               THE COURT:  We're talking about a first-level approach

      here; and that is inspection under a protective order that the

      items attained there, first of all, not be copied until there



                                                       



    is a further order of Court and that the information gathered

    not be released to anybody else until we've reviewed it.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  We can certainly live with that.

             THE COURT:  And we'll continue these subpoenas until

    we see whether it's necessary to quarrel about it.

             And the medical examiner continue to maintain custody

    of the records without returning to anybody now.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  Certainly.

             THE COURT:  Why isn't that a good approach here?

               MR. CRAWLEY:  The medical examiner has no problem with

      that approach.

               As I understand it, they were asking to take another

      process here where that's released.

               THE COURT:  Well, Mr. Jones did suggest that they go

      ahead and get copies.  I'm simply saying before you get copies,

      if there is a quarrel about it, you come back here and I'll

      resolve the quarrel.  And I've already indicated that I don't

      think this -- respectfully, I don't think that the Oklahoma

      Court of Criminal Appeals sets the privilege standards in this

      court on the privilege to withhold information under work

      product or whatever.  The statute is a different thing.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I appreciate the Court's position;

      however, I would say I don't think that a privilege that has

      been established by a state court is -- can be denigrated to

      having absolutely no emphasis --



                                                       



             THE COURT:  I didn't mean to say that.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  I think the Court should still look at

    whether or not the information will be relevant --

             THE COURT:  Sure.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  -- to begin with.

             THE COURT:  That's why I'm talking about a specific

    need for it.

             MR. CRAWLEY:  Right.

             THE COURT:  There is no need to just gather all this

      volume of material.  It's my guess that the need will be much

      more particularized and not affect that many people.

               MR. CRAWLEY:  I think you're absolutely right, your

      Honor.

               MR. JONES:  We'll draft the order, but make sure that

      I understand.

               THE COURT:  It's an order for inspection with

      appropriate protective order as to what is done with the

      information.  It does not include copying until we get down to

      the specific records.

               MR. JONES:  Unless -- but anything that there is no

      dispute on, we can copy?

               THE COURT:  If there is no dispute.

               MR. JONES:  At cost to the party?

               THE COURT:  To the parties here.

               MR. JONES:  And that includes the entire antemortem



                                                       



    and postmortem file to look at and inspect?

             THE COURT:  Yes.  I'm interpreting this statute to

    limit release to release, rather than to inspect in place.  To

    me, there is a distinction there, and that's my order.  Inspect

    in place is not releasing, so the medical examiner is not

    violating the statute.  All right?

             MR. JONES:  We'll draft the proposed order and

    circulate it to all parties, including the medical --

             THE COURT:  Including counsel for the medical

      examiner.

               MR. JONES:  Certainly.

               THE COURT:  All right.  Now Mr. Hartzler, do you have

      another matter?

               MR. HARTZLER:  No.  It's on this matter, your Honor.

               THE COURT:  All right.

               MR. HARTZLER:  I do have some concern about an issue

      that you raised that we haven't looked at, which is the privacy

      rights of the deceased persons; and I recognize that we're

      going to have a protective order.  We're going to try to

      protect those interests.  But maybe I'm unfairly reading

      between the lines what Mr. Crawley said, but I'm concerned that

      there is information about victims in these records that should

      not -- should not be disclosed and would be embarrassing.  And

      I'm just concerned that we're --

               THE COURT:  That's why we have a protective order



                                                       



    component.

             MR. HARTZLER:  I appreciate that.

             THE COURT:  That it not be disclosed to anyone outside

    of those who need to know it as counsel in the case.

             MR. JONES:  And the expert.

             THE COURT:  And the expert, yeah.

             Well, I'm not even sure about the expert, if we're --

    let's, you know -- I don't want to -- we could have medical

    records that show a person has been treated for a condition

      having no relevance whatsoever to that person's identity, to

      the condition of his or her remains, to any issue in this case,

      and which could be embarrassing to the memory of that person

      and to the survivors.  I don't think we -- anybody here wants

      to get in a position where that kind of thing is disclosed.

      And I don't have to illustrate by example.  Everybody knows

      what I'm talking about.

               MR. HARTZLER:  Certainly.

               THE COURT:  All right.  And then as I say, I don't

      know if it should become necessary to get that kind of

      information -- I don't know what the law is about whose

      interests are affected.

               I don't know whose rights those are once -- I don't

      know what the privacy rights of a deceased are.

               MR. HARTZLER:  That's really all I'm trying to raise,

      whether or not those privacy rights ought to step in at this



                                                       



    point before the Government or the defendants, including

    counsel, experts, anyone, has an opportunity to review these

    records.  And we -- the problem is we simply do not know.

             THE COURT:  Right.  So we take it again, as so many

    other things, a step at a time.

             Well, see if you can draft an order that is agreeable.

             Mr. Jones?

             MR. JONES:  Your Honor, this morning with enthusiasm

    and certitude, I advised the Court we would file our Rule 16

      motion by April 21.  I was ambushed by other individuals, whom

      shall not be identified at this time except to say they sit

      close to me, and I was persuaded over the lunch hour without

      any choice in the matter that perhaps it would be an abundance

      of caution to suggest an alternative proposal, which is that

      you will let us take the material that the Government has given

      us, what for lack of a better term we'll call Rule 16 material,

      and let us try to analyze everything that they have given us so

      that we don't have to give you a shopping list under Rule 16.

      And then we may simply file a motion at that time.

               We'll try to do that as expeditiously as possible, and

      I assume that -- although it was not specifically addressed by

      Ms. Wilkinson, that there is no objection to our meeting with

      the Government once more to talk about the specific items of

      exculpatory evidence and see where we stand on those and see if

      we can narrow those differences.



                                                       



             So I move --

             THE COURT:  You withdraw your offer for --

             MR. JONES:  I move to vacate the order granting us to

    April 21.

             THE COURT:  Well, no order entered; and I don't see

    that's a material problem because I didn't put a time limit on

    Mr. Tigar's Rule 16 motions.  So Ms. Wilkinson, do you have any

    problem with that?

             MS. WILKINSON:  No, your Honor.  We would just ask

      that Mr. Jones come to us with any requests for information

      before we come to the Court.  For example, of things we

      resolved this afternoon over the lunch break, I think we could

      have done them among the parties and didn't need to bring it in

      front of the Court.  So we just ask -- and sometimes there is

      misunderstandings.  I'm not blaming anyone; but before we file

      any motion, I ask that there be a record that there is some

      correspondence that we have refused to provide the information.

               MR. JONES:  We brought them to their attention

      repeatedly.

               THE COURT:  We're not going back and forth on this.

      There is a requirement in the local rules of this court that

      you first attempt to get agreement with opposing counsel; and

      that is adopted really in the civil context, but I consider it

      to be equally applicable in the criminal proceedings.

               So there ought to be a certification that that effort



                                                       



    has been attempted and failed when there is a motion filed that

    seeks the intervention of the Court.

             MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you, your Honor.

             THE COURT:  I believe that concludes the matters that

    were scheduled for hearing.

             There are some other matters that come under this

    Court's previous rulings with respect to privacy interests of

    the defendants that I think we should address while we're

    together and with the Government.  And we'll do that in a

      different room in a nonpublic setting.  And we'll take a recess

      now.  I don't know how long counsel expect to be on that.  I

      would suggest that we take it up with Mr. Nichols first and

      then Mr. McVeigh in a room that you'll be advised about.

               MR. JONES:  We remain here, your Honor, until we're

      called for?

               THE COURT:  Yes.  And they'll escort you to the room.

               Do you, Mr. Tigar, want Mr. Nichols to be present at

      that matter, or -- you can advise the clerk.

               MR. TIGAR:  Mr. Manspeaker and I have discussed that,

      your Honor.  Thank you.

               THE COURT:  All right.  So -- and let me just say

      since we're here on this record and in public that I believe

      these -- for the reasons that I set forth in the memorandum

      opinion dealing with the public access issues that were raised

      early on here on a motion regarding sealing that there are



                                                       



    times when the privacy interests of the accused are predominant

    and outweigh the public interest in the proceeding, and this

    has nothing to do with the adjudicative power of the Court.

             And it is for that reason that we're going to go -- I

    guess we could call it in camera or at least nonpublic to deal

    with those issues, some affecting each of the accused.

             So with that, our next hearing, I guess, is, what --

    we've got April 15 instructions, proposals and then we're to

    meet with them, with counsel on them at the end of the month?

               MR. TIGAR:  Yes, you were.  As I understood it, the

      conference to settle prayers was April 30 and then a public

      hearing on the 3591 was May 1.

               THE COURT:  I believe that's what the record shows.

               All right.  Court is in recess.

          (Recess at 2:55 p.m.)
