<title>SMALL COMPANY WINS CONTRACTS</title>
<h2>Small Company Wins Contracts</h2>
<p>

A small business in Quebec is winning contracts for producing snowmobile windshields from
major firms such as Bombardier, thanks to a revolutionary technology developed in
collaboration with the Network of Centres of Excellence on High-performance Concrete. Fibres
Donnite Inc., of Richmond, Quebec, needed moulds that are more durable and heat-resistant
than conventional metal ones to manufacture the windshields. The company contacted the
Network's Program Leader, Dr. Pierre-Claude Aitcin, to see if using high-performance concrete
(HPC) could be the solution. As a result of this interaction, today Fibres Donnite is using HPC
moulds to produce snowmobile windshields of exceptional quality and at a lower cost for
Bombardier and other snowmobile manufacturers. According to Fibres Donnite's Director of
R&D, Luc Beaupré, material costs for producing the HPC moulds are 90% less than for
conventional aluminum moulds; the HPC product also slashes production time by a factor of
15, and should have a much longer life cycle. This successful transfer of technology is giving
one small business in Quebec the competitive edge in beating out foreign competition.

<title>NEW APPROACH TO CYSTIC FIBROSIS</title>
<h2>New Approach to Cystic Fibrosis</h2>
<p>
As scientists achieve a better understanding of the complex protein chemistry that usually keeps
our lungs clean and healthy, research is now pointing the way to a potential new therapy for
people suffering from the devastating effects of cystic fibrosis (CF).
<p>
This prospect emerged as researchers with Inspiraplex, the Respiratory Health Network of
Centres of Excellence, were studying the mechanisms which leave lung cells unable to cope
with the fatal buildup of mucus that occurs in the breathing passages of CF patients. The team
broke new ground when it discovered that it could inhibit critical enzymes called phosphatases,
thereby keeping channels in lung cells open so that salt and water can be secreted to help clear
away mucus from the breathing passages. These enzymes normally act as gatekeepers closing
channels in lung cells and controlling the flow of chloride ions across lung cells. A complex
chemical process that involves phosphorylation opens the channels and dephosphorylation
closes them. The problems associated with cystic fibrosis set in when this channel, called cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) remains closed.
<p>
"The balance between these two processes (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) determines
the activity of the CFTR channel," says Inspiraplex researcher Dr. John Hanrahan, a
physiologist at McGill University. While studying how CFTR functions, Dr. Hanrahan and his
network colleagues noticed that inhibitors of dephosphorylation opened the channels in lung
cells regardless of whether they had been affected by cystic fibrosis. "We were quite surprised
to find that channels which were functioning normally, as well as those with disease-causing
mutations, would open when cells were exposed to these inhibitors," says Dr. Hanrahan.
<p>
Such inhibitors can already be found in drug form as medications that are valued for their
ability to bolster the body's immune system. These latest findings are now being regarded as
a possible key to dealing with cystic fibrosis. The results were published in the American
Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in September in a paper co-authored
by Dr. Hanrahan and other members from Inspiraplex and the Canadian Genetic Diseases
Network. A patent application has already been filed by Inspiraplex and McGill University on
these compounds, which have also generated interest among potential pharmaceutical partners
as a potential new therapeutic agent against CF.
<p>
Besides facilitating and fostering interdisciplinary research, Inspiraplex also broadens the
horizons of its researchers by giving them the opportunity to work in an entirely new area. Dr.
Hanrahan's work, which has previously focused mainly on the movement of ions in the
kidneys and intestine, is now focusing on chloride channels in the airway. "The Respiratory
Health Network has introduced me to many important problems in lung pathology, where
transport processes may be abnormal," he says.
<p>
Inspiraplex involves over 200 outstanding researchers. research associates and graduate students
from 13 universities and three research institutes in a highly interdisciplinary environment that
combines many fields - physiology, environmental and rehabilitation medicine, biochemistry,
genetics, cell and molecular biology, biophysics, and engineering. Partnerships have been
formed with six industries.

<title>CURING "SICK" BUILDINGS</title>
<h2>Curing "Sick" Building</h2>
<p>

A new concept of air ventilation designed and tested by inspiraplex, the respiratory health
network, and its industrial partner may help increase the well-being and productivity of people
working in "sick" buildings. Increasingly recognized as being partly responsible for higher
absenteeism and lower productivity in the modern sealed workplace, "sick building syndrome"
(SBS) is described as causing symptoms ranging from dry throats and mental fatigue to
headaches and dizziness. The Network's new system, called Zero-Complaint Heating,
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) helps address some of the suspected causes, which
include poor ventilation, airborne chemicals, or variations in temperature, humidity and
lighting.
<p>
The new Zero-Complaint HVAC gives individuals greater control over conditions within their
own work area. HVAC features a series of vents branching from a building's main ductwork
into each person's workplace. Using a remote control similar to that of television sets, workers
can manipulate the temperature and humidity of the vent in their immediate environment. The
design emerged out of an intensive study on air quality and worker performance in sealed
buildings by a Network team led by Dr. Richard Menzies', of McGill University. They found
substantial differences in humidity and temperature from one office setting to another, even
work areas that were only a few metres apart. Dramatic changes in the outdoor air supply did
little to change or affect workers' symptoms or sense of well-being.
<p>
Inspiraplex brought Dr. Menzies together with Toronto-based Engineering Interface Ltd., where
the idea of local controls had already been formulated. Using Dr. Menzies' findings and testing
methodology, the company's engineers were able to modify and gauge the effectiveness of this
new technology, now being patented. After several promising small-scale tests, the HVAC
system is now ready for a full-scale evaluation in buildings in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal
by autumn 1993. By comparing the performance of workers on floors with and without the
new system, the Inspiraplex team and its industrial partner should be able to determine the
health and economic benefits of this innovation. According to the World Health Organization,
up to 30 percent of new or remodelled buildings may have unusually high rates of "sick
building" complaints. Of the hundreds of buildings that have been evaluated by Health and
Welfare Canada, more than two thirds have been found to have problems with ventilation.

<title>BREATHING EASIER</title>
<h2>Breathing Easier</h2>
<p>

A new type of breathing ventilator that will soon be commercialized has been developed by
the respiratory health network, Inspiraplex. The ventilator works on the principle of
'Proportional Assist VentilationTM' (PAV)TM, a new concept developed after eight years of
research by Dr. Magdy Younes, a principal Network investigator at the Respiratory Hospital
in Winnipeg. PAV works by letting the ventilator respond to the individual breathing needs of
patients, unlike conventional systems that predetermine the amount of pressure or air that is
needed.
<p>
"The Network made it possible for us to put this concept to the test. We were able to hire
engineers to design and build a prototype ventilator from scratch, based on the new PAV
concept. The advantage with this concept is that existing ventilators can be modified to deliver
proportional assist," notes Dr. Younes.
<p>
This leading technology, coupled with an interest in the Network's approach to R&D, and the
Winnipeg area's strength in respiratory research, is attracting industry. Two companies, Puritan-
Bennett Corporation and Respironics Inc., have obtained non-exclusive licences for the
prototype hardware and concept from the University of Manitoba, the research centre that holds
the patents. A British manufacturing company - Medix Pharmaceuticals Inc. - is now
establishing a subsidiary plant in the Winnipeg area to develop products relating to respiratory
health.

<title>A ROBOT THAT LIKES TO PLAY</title>

<h2>A Robot That Likes to Play</h2>
<p>
Playing with a ball or teddy bear is every child's delight. But for the child who is physically
disabled, a ball that is out of reach or that has fallen to the ground becomes a source of
frustration. Life may become easier for these children, however, thanks to a promising offshoot
from advanced research in robotics and computational. perception by the institute for Robotics
and Intelligent Systems (IRIS). A team of IRIS researchers is working together to design a
robot that could eventually assist physically disabled children in day to day activities. The IRIS
team has filed for a patent on the communications panel they designed for the robot, dubbed
PLAYBOT. This touch-sensitive display uses 'play language' - nouns, actions and verbs
depicted in icons - and acts as a control device. A child looking for a teddy bear, for example,
will be able to touch or point at a sequence of icons to locate the toy and, with the robot's
help, pick it up and play with it. Ultimately, the researchers aim at creating a sophisticated
robotic wheelchair that would process information from the robot's arms and head and the
child's control panel to assist the child. The IRIS team has succeeded in building an early
prototype of PLAYBOT, consisting of a platform holding the control panel, a robotic arm and
a head with built-in cameras to follow human vision. The project is using and helping to
advance technologies that are at the forefront of robotics research.
<p>
A team of seven principal investigators, 15 graduate students and four research associates and
programmers at the University of Toronto, York University and the University of Western
Ontario working on several different areas of IRIS research are involved in the project. "We
have been able to draw on wide expertise through the Network and its variety of research
projects, giving us the opportunity and capability to stretch our horizons and work on
PLAYBOT," says Dr. John Tsotsos, a project leader for PLAYBOT and IRIS, and professor
of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.
<p>
IRIS's collaborative and multidisciplinary research program includes 24 projects at 19
Canadian universities. Related Network projects include the design of an advanced multi-
fingered robot hand that could bring human dexterity to tasks that must be carried out in hostile
or dangerous environments. Network researchers are also developing more intelligent controls
for excavators and other large machines, and are also exploring microrobotic systems, opening
the doors to microsurgery and new therapeutic possibilities. IRIS brings together over 130 of
the best research talents in this field in Canadian universities. Close to 300 graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows work on IRIS projects. The network is managed by PRECARN
Associates Inc., an industrial consortium of 39 companies and government agencies and a
strong partner in this national R&D team effort.

<title>NATURAL LANGUAGE COMPUTER INTERFACE</title>
<h2>Natural Language Computer Interface</h2>
<p>

Getting a computer to understand a request for information in everyday language may be more
than a matter of convenience. Researchers with the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent
Systems (IRIS) point out that the computer could show you things you could not have found
any other way.
<p>
Computer scientists at the University of Regina and Simon Fraser University have developed
two complementary approaches to helping a computer process a command in plain English
terms. A natural language/ database interface, called System X, employs elaborate rules of
grammar to parse a command into its essential components. A second system, called
DBLEARN, enables the computer to use the attributes provided by a natural language
instruction to find new linkages within a database.
<p>
The researchers refined a prototype of System X by trying it out on a.vice-president of Roger's
Cablesystems Ltd., a key supporter of the work. He wound up keeping the equipment several
weeks longer than anticipated because he found it so useful. "He was getting graphs of relevant
data in two minutes that he had been taking six weeks to get," says Dr. Nick Cercone, vice-
president of research at the University of Regina. "That meant he was able to make better
decisions more quickly."
<p>
The system allowed the executive to enter into his computer terminal a statement like "Give
me the Western region outage log for June," which would quickly yield a table or graph of the
relevant data from the company's database.
<p>
Dr. Cercone says such an interface, which could be wedded to DBLEARN, provides much
more than simple ease of use. In an experimental trial with the Natural Sciences and
Engineering Research Council's Grants Information System, he and his colleagues
demonstrated how DBLEARN "discovered" new groupings between various parts of the grants
information database. "These are mined results classification information, categorization
information, association information," he says.

<title>SMART WAY TO OPERATE</title>
<h2>Smart Way to Operate</h2>
<p>
A team of researchers with the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS) is
developing intelligent controls for excavators and other heavy machines aimed at making the
operator's life easier and safer. The project, which is the first of its kind worldwide, has wide-
reaching possibilities for Canada's crucial forestry industry and other primary industries. The
long-term goal is to develop mobile machines for forestry and agriculture that behave as 'smart
assistants' to their operators and minimize impact on the environment. Building smarter
machines for the operator will help ensure efficient cutting and quality control. "Ultimately,
we'd like to let the operator work out the strategy and let the machine carry out the actual
task," says Dr. Peter Lawrence, Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of British
Columbia, whose team is collaborating on this project with Network participants in other IRIS
centres at the universities of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
<p>
Before a machine can perform a complex task simply by being told, it has to be able to figure
out the position of its limbs, and of the objects it is working with. The IRIS team has made
advances on various aspects of this problem. Certain members have developed parallel
algorithms and distributed them on a network of microprocessors, an important step towards
letting a machine's control systems interpret vital information at high speed. For example, if
there is increased friction in machine bearings and gears, the control
systems can figure out the malfunction in advance, and issue a warning. The IRIS team has
used the algorithms to develop a machine control simulator. Several companies have shown
interest in using it as a training tool. In related work, other IRIS members are developing new
sensing systems to enable the machine to sense where its arms are in relation to its
environment.
<p>
RSI Research Inc., a B.C.-based company, is closely watching these latest developments.
Earlier versions of a computer control system created by Dr. Lawrence and students are now
being installed by the company on existing machinery including a Caterpillar feller buncher
and a Hitachi excavator. Novice operators can easily operate a machine fitted with these
computer- coordinated controls.

<title>CELLULOSE FIBRES INNOVATION</title>

<h2>Cellulose Fibres Innovation</h2>
<p>

Measuring the quality of cellulose fibres for paper- making used to take several days, but it can
now be accomplished in a matter of minutes through an innovation developed by the
Mechanical and Chemimechanical Pulps Network. The device, called a Fibre Quality Analyzer
(FQA), represents the. network's first commercially viable product. "People have never been
able to do this kind of testing this quickly before," says the network's Executive Director, Dr.
Gordon Leary.
<p>
The FQA determines the length of cellulose fibres as well as their shape, which can affect the
strength of the resulting paper. This kind of information enables paper manufacturers to assess
the fibres they are using and optimize the quality of the finished product.
<p>
Starting with a beaker containing a sample of pulp, the FQA dilutes it to an appropriate
concentration and passes it into a viewing cell. Video imaging technology then analyzes the
fibre characteristics, generating measurements which can be printed or stored electronically.
<p>
The equipment also features a patented design to keep the viewing cell from fouling or
clogging, which researchers had regarded as a major problem to be overcome. Since the cell
relies on hydrodynamic focusing rather than directing fluid flow through narrow apertures, the
system can handle recycled fibres containing ink, filler, extractives and pitch. This capability
also raises the possibility of using the FQA for on-line use.
<p>
The FQA emerged from about three years' worth of intensive research and development by the
University of British Columbia's Pulp and Paper Research Centre and the Pulp and Paper
Research Institute of Canada. Networks of Centres of Excellence funding of the university
research was complemented by funding to Paprican from Paprican's industrial members and
the B.C. Science Council.
<p>
An industrial partner, OpTest Equipment Inc. of Hawkesbury, Ontario, used the research to
develop a working prototype of the FQA in less than a year. Although the nine-person
company would have been too small to conduct such original research on its own, its
collaboration with the Mechanical and Chemimechanical Pulps Network has made it the sole
licensee to manufacture the device and market it to paper mills around the world.

<title>SUPERHEATED STEAM MAKES STRONGER PAPER</title>
<h2>Superheated Steam Makes Stronger Paper</h2>
<p>

Drying newly formed paper with superheated steam may significantly improve paper quality,
according to researchers with the Mechanical and Chemimechanical Pulps Network. McGill
University researcher Dr. Murray Douglas, and his team of network-funded students and
research associates have found that this revolutionary process, in which paper is dried in steam
at temperatures as high as 450 degrees centigrade, produces substantially stronger paper.
<p>
The team is also discovering that this radically different process for drying paper has the
potential to cut capital costs and save energy. Superheated steam can dry newsprint about ten
times faster than current technology. "There is the potential for higher energy efficiency with
the new process because, unlike a conventional paper dryer, steam is recycled and there is no
hot, humid air to discharge," notes Dr. Douglas. "Our early research indicates that the
superheated steam drying process improves product quality and would cut the length of dryer
sections of paper mills to Just a fraction of what they are today," he says. This would
significantly reduce the size of a typical drying installation, which currently requires a building
the length of a football field to hold about 50 large rotating heated cylinders that dry a
continuous sheet of wet paper.
<p>
Steam drying also offers the potential to make better use of mechanical pulps, a class of pulps
formed by grinding wood into its constituent fibres rather than extracting the fibres chemically.
While less expensive and less polluting, mechanical pulps produce a weaker paper. Superheated
steam can help to remedy this shortcoming, students of Dr. Douglas believe, because the
unique combination of sheet temperature and moisture "plasticizes" the wood's lignin, a natural
polymer, leading to a significantly stronger paper.
<p>
Although superheated steam is used to a limited extent in other industrial drying processes, Dr.
Douglas says it has never been applied before in papermaking. The Network is actively
exploring the commercial potential of this discovery. McGill University has obtained one patent
and is proceeding with other patent applications.
<p>
Pulp and paper production is Canada's major manufacturing industry. For Canada, the pulp and
paper industry accounts for approximately $12 billion in net exports. The Mechanical and
Chemimechanical Pulps Network works in partnership with the Pulp and Paper Research
Institute of Canada (Paprican). With this strong industry contribution and involvement and
federal funding, approximately 45 research supervisors and 145 researchers at 10 universities
and one government laboratory across Canada are tackling scientific and engineering problems
in five major areas: bleaching, chromophores, mechanical pulping, process control, and pulp
processing. Newsprint recycling has recently been added.

<title>HELPING PAPER KEEP ITS COLOUR</title>
<h2>Helping Paper Keep its Colour</h2>
<p>

Researchers in the Mechanical and Chemimechanical Pulps Network have unravelled the
complex chemistry responsible for one of the paper industry's most serious problems - paper
that turns yellow only a few weeks after it is made. The new understanding achieved by the
Network should provide the basis for improving a low grade of paper, and for helping
Canadian manufacturers to increase their competitiveness by making mechanical pulps more
suitable for an expanded range of higher-value grades of paper.
<p>
Both industry and academic researchers specializing in wood chemistry have been wrestling
with the problem of yellowing for more than 40 years. Network researcher Dr. Jeffrey Wan,
of Queen's University, was able to bring a new approach to the problem through his work on
the behaviour of free radicals, groups of atoms that arc generally highly reactive. In pulp and
paper processing, these free radicals often persist in the finished product, where they interact
with light and turn the white page yellow.
<p>
The technical name for this chemical reaction is reversion, because it reverses the effect of the
bleaching that is meant to make the wood pulp as white as possible. While previous research
has focused on ways of treating paper to counteract reversion, Dr. Wan and his team of
researchers at Queen's found that a more comprehensive bleaching technique could make rever-
sion all but impossible.
<p>
It was while searching for evidence of the cause of yellowing, that Dr. Wan discovered how
bleaching itself generates both "good" radicals, which preserve the paper's integrity, and "bad"
radicals, which lead to yellowing. He saw that a post-bleach treatment would have to maximize
the good radicals, and eliminate the bad. The team developed a treatment system that protects
paper against the yellowing radicals, while preserving those radicals that can repair any
yellowing damage that does occur. The system, now being patented, has been dubbed the P-R
(protect-repair) mechanism.
<p>
This is an important step towards broadening the market for mechanical pulps, at present the
basis for Canada's economically vital newsprint industry. An additional advantage in doing so,
is that the process is environmentally friendly. Unlike chemical pulping processes that require
chemicals to break wood down into its constituent fibres, mechanical pulping is largely a
matter of grinding up the wood into basic components. It is cheaper and less polluting, but the
problem of yellowing has limited its potential market.
<p>
"The Network has given us vital access to people who are at the forefront of important
techniques, not only in instrumentation, but also in the specialized chemistry," notes one of the
Network's industrial researchers, Dr. John Schmidt, of the Pulp and Paper Institute of Canada
(PAPRICAN), who worked on the bleaching technology.
<p>
Pulp and paper production is Canada's major manufacturing industry. The pulp and paper
industry accounts for approximately $12 billion worth of the country's net exports; this is
approximately equivalent to that of mining, petroleum, electricity, and fisheries combined. It
alone accounts for nearly all of Canada's net trade balance.

<title>KEEPING CANADA AT THE LEADING EDGE OF MICROELECTRONICS</title>
<h2>Keeping Canada at the Leading Edge of Microelectronics</h2>
<p>

In the miniaturized world of microelectronics, small is powerful and the key to commercial
success. An International race Is under way to pack as many functioning devices as possible
on a microchip, and the prize Is a share of the rapidly growing communications and computer
products market. Researchers at Micronet - Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems for
Ultra Large Scale Integraton (ULSI) - are helping to put Canada among the front runners in
this race. Micronet's goal is to develop the capability to produce a semiconductor chip no
larger than a thumb-print that has the capacity to hold 100 million transistors and other
electronic components.
<p>
Using forefront X-ray lithography, a team at INRS in Varennes, Quebec, working in close
association with Northern Telecom Electronics Limited (NTEL) in Kanata, Ontario, has
developed the technology for producing transistors that are ten times smaller than those
produced by current methods. To make use of X-ray technology, a number of challenges face
the researchers. One involves choosing and developing the right mask, which is a type of high-
tech stencil used to define the lines on the chip.
<p>
Radiation projects the pattern of the mask onto a resist film" that incorporates the complex
circuit designs. Although X-rays give a sharper and smaller definition of circuit lines, the
wavelengths used in X-ray lithography do not penetrate most materials. To solve the problem,
the Micronet team has developed an X-ray mask of very thin silicon carbide film and as a
result has been able to routinely create high resolution gratings and lines. The team is working
to build the first prototype transistors by the summer, using this
X-ray mask.
<p>
Currently a tiny 1 cm chip can contain up to 2 million microscopic transistors and other
electronic components. One transistor is about 1/100th the diameter of a human hair, already
an astronomic reduction from the first transistors of 1948 that were the size of a vitamin pill.
A 19505 transistor radio held about five of these transistors. In today's information
society,where transmission of computer data and visual information Is growing at an
unprecedented rate, squeezing more signal processing capability onto a semiconductor chip is
vital. Tiny chips that can perform more functions at higher speed entail significant reductions
in cost and dramatically Increase the versatility of a semiconductor chip.
<p>
Micronet draws together over 70 leading scientists from 16 Canadian universities and one
government lab-oratory. It also provides a stimulating training environment for more than 200
graduate students. Micronet's 11 industrial affiliates are major players in Canada's vital
communications and electronics Industry.

<title>CLUE TO HEALING SPINAL CORD</title>
<h2>Clue to Healing Spinal Cord</h2>
<p>

A 12-member team in the N.R. Network (neural regeneration and recovery) has Identified one
of the reasons why spinal cord injuries do not heal. The finding could have major implications
for spinal cord repair. bringing hope to people who are permanently paralysed. The research
team, led by Dr. John Steeves of the University of British Columbia (UBC), found that myelin,
a fatty substance in the spinal cord of all vertebrates, inhibits the regeneration of nerve fibres
after injury. The researchers have successfully suppressed myelin production in embryonic
chicks by injecting a specific antibody with serum complement proteins into the spinal cord.
This has extended the period for repair of injuries to a later time in the embryonic development
than was otherwise possible. More recently,the researchers succeeded in removing myelin from
adult chicken and mouse spinal cords using similar procedures. Myelin, which appears
relatively late in embryonic development, performs several functions,including the prevention
of unwanted nerve fibre growth. This could explain why it inhibits the regeneration of nerve
fibres after injury.
<p>
"I think this is one essential step towards the possibility of regeneration, although it may not
be sufficient by itself," said Dr. Steeves. "Neural development is a complex process. Our work
has helped to identify one of the factors that inhibits regeneration," he said. A patent on the
myelin suppression technique has been filed through the University of British Columbia.
<p>
The UBC team is collaborating with Network researchers at three other universities: Manitoba,
McGill and Queen's. "The Network helps create one large super lab: we can take advantage
of state-of-the-art research facilities and expertise in participating centres. This is what is
necessary to pursue leading research and compete in a large worldwide arena,"noted Dr.
Steeves.
<p>
The N.R. Network brings together over 100 top scientists in 14 universities across Canada to
promote nervous system regeneration and recovery of functions lost as a result of trauma or
disease. The Network has established ties with eight industrial affiliates who assist in the
practical assessment of research results.

<title>JOINT BLOOD RESEARCH PROJECT</title>

<h2>Joint Blood Research Project</h2>
<p>

Canadian bio-pharmaceutical company Hemosol Inc., of Etobicoke, Ontario, has Joined the
Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence (PENCE) in collaborative research
aimed at modifying hemoglobin, a red blood cell protein, as a carrier for drugs, specifically
targetting organs or tumors. According to Dr. Anthony Magnin, Hemosol's Vice-President, Sci-
entific Operations, the partnership will play an important role in the company's move to
expand beyond the area of blood substitutes. Hemosol's current technology is based on the
purification and chemical manipulation of the blood related proteins involved in the field of
oxygen transport. Founded in 1985, the company has made progress in the worldwide search
for a commercially viable human blood substitute.
<p>
"PENCE's leading-edge research and expertise in protein structure, function and remodelling
complements Hemosol's strong background in the pharmaceutical, chemical and medical
areas," said Dr. Magnin. "We see a diverse range of products resulting from this collaboration,
which is enabling us to find new applications for modified hemoglobin and new methods for
accomplishing these modifications."
<p>
Hemosol is currently collaborating with PENCE scientist Dr. Ron Kluger, of the University of
Toronto, and his team who have developed a novel approach to modifying hemoglobin.as a
potential carrier for drugs. Hemosol has also recruited Dr. Gordon Adamson, until recently a
postdoctoral fellow carrying out investigative research for PENCE in Edmonton. "More and
more people are alternating between working in academia and industry and the exchange
benefits both sectors," noted Dr. Magnin.
<p>
PENCE links 200 outstanding scientists, research associates, graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows in a collaborative venture to study the structure and function of proteins and to design
and produce novel proteins of potential economic benefit. Including its newest industrial
partner, Hemosol, PENCE has established linkages with nine companies.

<title>Business Ventures Into Neuroscience</title>

<h2>Business Ventures Into Neuroscience</h2>

<p>Canada’s critical mass and world-class expertise in neuroscience
research has gained a strong vote of investor confidence from
the business community.  A partnership led by Royal Bank Group,
the Caisse de dépot et placement du Québec and MDS Health
Ventures was launched  last September to finance a new
multi-million dollar venture capital fund that supports the
development and commercialization of drug products and devices
for a wide range of neurological disorders.  The leading-edge
research platforms pulled together by the NeuroScience Network
under the federal NCE program contributed to winning this
confidence from the new investing group, called NeuroScience
Partners Limited Partnership.  Investors have committed $52.5
million to commercialize managed by MDS Health Ventures Inc.,
an affiliate of MDS Health Group Limited, Canada’s largest technology-based
health and life sciences company.  Other investors include The Manufacturers
Life Insurance Company, the Ontario Hydro Pension Fund, the
Manitoba Teachers’ Retirement Fund and the Société Innovatech du
Grand Montréal.  NeuroScience Partners has set a target to raise
a second $52.5 million, and has obtained a firm commitment of
$22.5 million from current investors if this second tranche is
raised.

<p>The NeuroScience Network will play an important role in helping
the partnership identify opportunities for developing and
commercializing Canadian advances in neuroscience.  The network
links 125 research participants from 18 universities and
research institutes across Canada in key areas of neuroscience
research, thereby providing access to the leading neuroscience
being developed in this country and the opportunities for
developing products for a wide range of brain and central 
nervous disorders.  These include stroke, epilepsy,
schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, Parkinson’s
disease, brain and spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease).  In Canada
alone, neurological disorders account for 30 per cent of all
health care costs, and some two million Canadians 
suffer from brain disorders.

<p>“It’s critical that we develop an industry in Canada that is
capable of funding research in neuroscience in addition to the
public funds that this research sector attracts,” notes Warren
Bull, Executive Director of the NeuroScience Network.  “This
partnership is a real opportunity to keep our scientists in
Canada and develop products in our country that are emerging
from our leading-edge neuroscience research.”

<title>A Young Researcher’s Perspective</title>

<h2>A Young Researcher’s Perspective</h2>

<p>It isn’t only because he has held two network-related
scholarships in a row that University of Ottawa postgraduate
student Alain Berinstain is an enthusiastic supporter of the NCE
program. Looking back on five years of network association, he
values the experience as a whole.  

<p>“Five years in network research,” he reflects “has allowed me to
deepen the professional relationship I have with members of the
network from across Canada.  We have a mutual respect for each
other, and the exposure to the Canadian scientific and
industrial community I have experienced would have been
difficult to obtain without the network.  My future in the field
is much more secure, thanks to the network contacts I have
acquired.  As I prepare for graduation, I would like to thank
all the members of the network with whom I have interacted
during that time.”

<p>As a researcher in the Mechanical and Chemimechanical Pulps
Network, Berinstain was eligible for one of the four
DuPont-Paprican scholarships awarded annually to outstanding
postgraduate researchers working in the NCE’s 12 centres.  Now
that he is about to graduate, he sees his network experience as
a major influence on his professional development. Berinstain’s
network research, conducted under the supervision of Principal
Researcher Dr. Juan C. Scaiano, involved one of the network’s
major research goals: determining the nature of changes that
light causes in paper made from mechanical pulps. “We used laser
technology to study how paper reacts to light and to determine
what causes it to change colour and to yellow,” Berinstain
explains.  “During Phase I, we made a lot of progress in
understanding this phenomenon.  Now in Phase II it’s time 
to apply this knowledge to developing a strategy for stopping
the yellowing process.  By the end of Phase II, we’ll be very
close, and it’s thanks to the network’s 
support that we have made this progress.”

<title>New Approach to Cystic Fibrosis</title>

<h2>New Approach to Cystic Fibrosis</h2>

<p>As scientists achieve a better understanding of the complex
protein chemistry that usually keeps our lungs clean and
healthy, research is now pointing the way to a potential new
therapy for people suffering from the devastating effects of
cystic fibrosis (CF).

<p>This prospect emerged as researchers with the Inspiraplex
network were studying the mechanisms which leave lung cells
unable to cope with the fatal buildup of mucus that occurs in
the breathing passages of CF patients.  The team broke new
ground when it discovered that it could inhibit critical enzymes
called phosphatases, thereby keeping channels in lung cells open
so that salt and water can be secreted to help clear away mucus
from the breathing passages.  These enzymes normally act as
gatekeepers closing channels in lung cells and controlling the
flow of chloride ions across lung cells.  A complex chemical
process that involves phosphorylation opens the channels and
dephosphorylation closes them.  The problems associated  with
cystic fibrosis set in when this channel, called cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), remains closed.

<p>“The balance between these two processes (phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation) determines the activity of the CFTR channel,”
says Inspiraplex researcher Dr. John Hanrahan, a physiologist at
McGill University.  While studying how CFTR functions, Dr.
Hanrahan and his network colleagues noticed that inhibitors of
dephosphorylation opened the channels in lung cells regardless
of whether they had been affected by cystic fibrosis.  “We were
quite surprised to find that channels which were functioning
normally, as well as those with disease-causing mutations, would
open when cells were exposed to these inhibitors,” says Dr.
Hanrahan.

<p>Such inhibitors can already be found in drug form as medications
that are valued for their ability to bolster the body’s immune
system.  These latest findings are now being regarded as a
possible key to dealing with cystic fibrosis.  Inspiraplex and
McGill University have filed a patent application on these
compounds, which have also generated interest among potential
pharmaceutical partners.

<title>Joint Blood Research Project</title>

<h2>Joint Blood Research Project</h2>

<p>The Canadian bio-pharmaceutical company Hemosol Inc., of
Etobicoke, Ontario, is a partner with the Protein Engineering
Network of Centres of Excellence (PENCE) in collaborative
research aimed at modifying haemoglobin, a red blood cell
protein, as a carrier for drugs specifically targeting organs or tumours.
The company’s main focus, since its founding in 1985, has been
on finding a commercially viable human blood substitute.

<p>Hemosol’s Vice-President for Scientific Operations, Dr. Anthony
Magnin, says that PENCE has played an important role in
Hemosol’s move to expand beyond the area of blood substitutes. 
“PENCE’s leading-edge research and expertise in protein
structure, function and remodelling complements Hemosol’s strong
background in the pharmaceutical, chemical and medical areas,”
he says.  “We see a diverse range of products resulting from
this collaboration, which is enabling us to find new
applications for modified haemoglobin and new methods for
accomplishing these modifications.”

<p>Hemosol worked closely with a team led by PENCE’s Dr. Ron
Kluger, of the University of Toronto, who developed a novel
approach to modifying haemoglobin as a potential carrier for
drugs. The collaboration between the network and the company has
already proved fruitful: a patent has recently been granted and
the technology has been licensed to Hemosol.

<title>Michael Smith lauréat du prix nobel de 1993</title>
<img src="/images/g_imp_b.gif">

<p>
<h2>Michael Smith, lauréat du Prix Nobel de 1993</h2>

<p>
Jusqu'à ce qu'on lui décerne le prix Nobel de chimie de 1993,
Michael Smith était l'un des secrets les mieux gardé des Réseaux
de centres d'excellence.  Biochimiste de l'Univ. de la
Colombie-Britannique (UCB), M. Smith était également directeur
scientifique du <a href="http://diadem.biochem.ualberta.ca/pence.html">Réseau de
centres d'excellence en génie protéique</a> au cours des cinq premières années
du réseau. Michael Smith et ses réalisations sont devenus une source d'inspiration
pour tous les Canadiens, qui savent dorénavant que le Canada peut reconnaître et
soutenir un talent exceptionnel en recherche.

<p>
Le Réseau en génie protéique fait largement appel à la technique
de chimie de l'ADN du professeur Smith dans ses travaux sur la
structure et de la fonction des protéines et pour l'amélioration
des enzymes et d'autres protéines susceptibles d'avoir des
retombées économiques. Ces protéines améliorées peuvent
déboucher sur de nouvelles façons de traiter le cancer et les
maladies infectieuses. Elles peuvent également être utilisées
comme enzymes spécialisées dans l'industrie des produits de
chimie fine et dans une variété de produits industriels.

<p>
Cette technique de génie génétique est enseignée aux jeunes
chercheurs du laboratoire de biotechnologie de l'UCB, dirigé par
le professeur Smith, et aux étudiants associés au Réseau. 

<p>
Connue sous le nom de mutagénèse dirigée basée sur l'emploi des
oligonucléotides, cette technique est maintenant utilisée par les
chercheurs du monde entier pour comprendre le fonctionnement des gènes
du cancer et de virus, en vue de mener à la mise au point de nouveaux médicaments.

<p>
Grâce à cette technique, il est possible de reprogrammer le code
génétique en utilisant un fragment d'ADN synthétique pour
modifier un gène et produire ainsi une protéine modifiée.
Aujourd'hui généralisée en génie génétique, cette technique est
utilisée notamment dans l'épissage des parcelles d'ADN, leur
élimination, ou l'insertion de fragments d'ADN.

<p>
La mise au point de cette technique a permis de réaliser
d'énormes progrès en génie génétique et protéique. Elle remonte
au début des années 70 à l'époque où le professeur Smith
poursuivait des travaux sur la synthèse et la modification des
oligonucléotides, c'est-à-dire de courts fragments d'ADN. Des
recherches subséquentes lui ont permis de mettre au point une
façon d'intégrer le fragment d'ADN synthétique modifié dans
l'ADN d'un virus et de créer délibérément une mutation
génétique. Cette technique a ouvert la voie à l'utilisation des
oligonucléotides comme outil pour modifier un gène et pour
faciliter l'étude de la structure protéique ainsi modifiée.

<p>
Le 10 décembre 1993, lors de la cérémonie officielle à Stockholm
marquant l'anniversaire du décès d'Alfred Nobel, le monde entier
a reconnu la contribution de Michael Smith, qui partage le prix
de 6,7 millions de couronnes suédoises (environ un million de
dollars CAN) avec le scientifique américain Kary Mullis. Le professeur
Smith a fait don de son prix à la recherche sur la biochimie du système nerveux
central (plus particulièremenr à la recherche sur la schizophrénie), et à
la promotion des sciences chez les jeunes. Le professeur Mullis est
l'inventeur de la réaction de polymérisation en chaîne, une technique qui
permet de resynthétiser des millions de fois un segment d'ADN d'un génome
plus complexe en quelques heures. Cette technique sert entre
autres à détecter la présence de virus HIV ou de gènes
défectueux dans les maladies héréditaires.

<p>
Lors du lancement du Programme en 1988, Michael Smith a joué un rôle
de premier plan dans l'élaboration du programme de recherche du Réseau, qui est
administré conjointement par le Conseil de recherches médicales et le Conseil de
recherches en sciences naturelles et en génie. Le Réseau de centres
d'excellence en génie protéique relie 260 chercheurs
exceptionnels, adjoints de recherche, étudiants aux cycles
supérieurs et stagiaires postdoctoraux de 13 universités et quatre laboratoires
du gouvernement fédéral dans un effort visant à faire progresser la
recherche susceptible d'engendrer des avantages économiques pour
le Canada. Il est au nombre des 14 réseaux actuellement
appuyés par le Programme des réseaux de centres d'excellence.

<title>Des économies considérables</title>

<h2>Des économies considérables</h2>

<p>Les recherches d’un réseau peuvent mener à un grand éventail
d’applications.  La preuve, Béton Canada compte des clients tant
dans l’industrie de la construction que dans le secteur de
l’agriculture.  L’industrie de la construction s’intéresse
particulièrement au béton à haute performance (BHP), qui offre
une durabilité accrue, et réduit les coûts de construction
d’ouvrages de surface, comme les ponts ou viaducs, et les 
édifices à plusieurs étages.  Cette industrie s’intéresse
également à des applications destinées à la construction, à
l’entretien et à la réparation d’infrastructures submergées qui,
au Canada seulement, représentent plusieurs milliards de
dollars.  Dans la photographie ci-contre, on peut voir le
coulage d’un BHP à la fois très liquide et résistant au lavage
utilisé dans la réparation de structures endommagées.

<p>L’industrie agricole commence également à se servir du BHP dans
les bâtiments où d’autres types de béton s’avèrent une source de
problèmes, notamment pour la construction d’enceintes destinées
au bétail.  Le béton traditionnel, qui est très poreux, est
souvent un milieu propice à la prolifération des bactéries et
des parasites infectant les animaux.  Les éleveurs encourent des
frais pour désinfecter leurs granges et subissent des pertes de
revenus lorsque, des suites d’une infection, un animal perd du
poids ou meurt.  Les enceintes en BHP, qui est beaucoup moins
poreux que d’autres bétons, aident 
à réduire la prolifération des bactéries responsables des
infections.  Ci-contre, les porcelets, élevés dans des enceintes
dont le plancher chauffé est en BHP, sont moins sujets à des
infections, et contribuent à augmenter les revenus de l’éleveur.
Au Québec, les revenus d’exportation du porc en 1994 ont été
supérieurs à ceux des exportations d’électricité par
Hydro-Québec.  On comprend donc pourquoi le BHP, qui réduit les
risques d’infections entraînant des pertes importantes de
revenus pour les éleveurs de bétail, suscite tant d’intérêt dans
le secteur agricole.

<title>DES PONTS VERS L'AVENIR</title>
<h1>Des ponts vers l'avenir</h1>
<p>

Un nouveau pont érigé à Portneuf (Québec) a été construit avec
un béton plus résistant et plus durable que jamais auparavant,
grâce à la recherche d'un Réseau de centres d'excellence. Ce
pont, qui remplace une ancienne structure d'acier au coeur de
Portneuf, est le premier de ce type en Amérique du Nord à être
conçu et construit en béton à haute performance (BHP), à l'aide
de la technologie mise au point par le Réseau de centres
d'excellence sur les bétons à haute performance. La durabilité
et la résistance accrues du BHP le rendent idéal pour la
conception de structures plus minces. Le BHP s'est avéré la
meilleure solution dans le cas de Portneuf, étant donné
certaines contraintes d'espace et physiques :11 fallait
construire le pont au-dessus d'une petite rivière dont le niveau
peut devenir très élevé à cause des crues et du dégel
printanier. Les crues auront moins de chances d'atteindre le
niveau de ce pont construit avec un tablier plus mince. «Sans la
technologie du béton à haute performance, nous n'aurions pu
construire ce genre de pont», a déclaré Louis-Georges Coulombe,
ingénieur en structure au ministère des Transports du Québec.
<p>
Cette réussite est le résultat d'un partenariat unique entre le
Réseau et plus de 20 intervenants (entrepreneurs en
construction, ingénieurs-conseils, fabricants de matériaux,
propriétaires et chercheurs du Québec). Ils ont uni leurs
efforts dans une entreprise de transfert de technologie appelée
«Projet Voies nouvelles du béton», qui vise à trouver et à
mettre au point de nouvelles applications pour le BHP. Selon
François Lacroix, directeur du Projet et directeur régional de
l'Association canadienne du ciment Portland au Québec, «c'est
grâce à l'existence du Réseau de centres d'excellence sur les
bétons à haute performance que «Projet Voies nouvelles du béton»
a vu le jour en 1990. Notre objectif est d'accroître les
applications du BHP et de construire des projets expérimentaux
pour en répandre l'utilisation.» Les partenaires poursuivent
leur collaboration en vue d'élaborer des devis pour d'autres
projets utilisant le BHP, comme un pont à Mirabel et des
passerelles piétonnières à Lavai.
<p>
Le Réseau, qui a offert son expertise et sa technologie pour
mettre au point le matériau du pont de Portneuf, a installé dans
le 4)ont des instruments de mesure perfectionnés de façon à
recueillir des données essentielles pour poursuivre la recherche.
<p>
La structure tout entière du pont, y compris le tablier, est
faite de béton de 60 MPa à fumée de silice (le Mégapascal est la
mesure de résistance du béton à la compression). Le pont peut
supporter tous les types de circulation, y compris la machinerie
lourde et les camions. On a éliminé les matériaux protecteurs
supplémentaires, comme une membrane et de l'asphalte sur le
tablier, pour confirmer les résultats des recherches sur le
rendement élevé du BHP dans des conditions réelles.
L'élimination du besoin de recourir à des matériaux protecteurs
contribuerait à abaisser les coûts de réparation et de
remplacement de cette infrastructure coûteuse du Canada, et la
durabilité du BHP aidera à maintenir faibles les coûts
d'entretien pendant la durée de vie de la nouvelle structure. Au
Québec seulement, au moins 300 millions de $ seront consacrés au
remplacement ou au renforcement de vieux ponts au cours des 10
prochaines années.

<title>UNE PETITE ENTREPRISE GAGNANTE</title>
<h1>Une petite entreprise gagnante</h1>
<p>
Grâce à une technologie révolutionnaire mise au point en
collaboration avec le Réseau de centres d'excellence sur les
bétons à haute performance, une petite entreprise du Québec
obtient des contrats de fabrication de pare-brise de motoneiges
avec d'importantes entreprises. dont Bombardier. Située à
Richmond au Québec, Fibres Donnite Inc. avait besoin de moules
plus durables et plus résistants à la chaleur que les moules
conventionels en métal. L'entreprise a fait appel à
Pierre-Claude Aïtcin, directeur du Réseau, pour savoir s'il
était possible d'utiliser le béton à haute performance. Elle
utilise désormais des moules en béton à haute performance pour
fabriquer des pare-brise de motoneiges de qualité supérieure et
peut ainsi offrir de meilleurs prix à Bombardier et aux autres
manufacturiers de motoneiges. Selon Luc Beaupré, directeur de la
R et D de Fibres Donnite, les moules en béton à haute
performance coûtent 90 % moins cher que ceux en aluminium, se
fabriquent quinze fois plus vite et devraient durer plus
longtemps. Le succès de ce transfert de technologie donne à une
petite entreprise du Québec les moyens de surpasser la
concurrence étrangère.

<title>LUEUR D'ESPOIR POUR LE TRAITEMENT DE LA FIBROSE KYSTIQUE</title>
<h2>Lueur d'espoir pour le traitement de la fibrose kystique</h2>
<p>

Une nouvelle approche à la chimie complexe des protéines mise au
point par une équipe d'inspiraplex, le réseau en santé
respiratoire, pourrait ouvrir la vole à une nouvelle thérapie
pour le traitement de la fibrose kystique.
<p>
Ce projet a vu le jour alors que les chercheurs du réseau
étudiaient les mécanismes qui empêchent les cellules pulmonaires
d'éliminer l'accumulation fatale de mucus dans les voies
respiratoires des personnes atteintes de fibrose kystique.
L'équipe a découvert que certains composés chimiques pouvaient
inhiber des enzymes appelées phosphatases. ce qui permettrait de
maintenir les canaux des cellules pulmonaires ouverts de façon
que l'organisme libère l'eau et les sels nécessaires pour
déloger le mucus accumulé dans les voies respiratoires. Ces
enzymes sont des sortes de soupapes qui interviennent dans des'
processus chimiques complexes appelés phosphorylisation et
déphosphorylisation qui ouvrent et ferment respectivement les
canaux des cellules pulmonaires et contrôlent le flux d'ions
chlorures. Les problèmes associés à la fibrose kystique
surviennent lorsque ce canal protéique, appelé cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), demeure fermé.
<p>
« L'équilibre entre la phosphorylisation et la
déphosphorylisation détermine l'activité du canal CFTR », a
expliqué le Dr John Hanrahan, physiologiste à l'Université
McGill et chercheur du réseau. Alors qu'ils étudiaient le
fonctionnement du CFTR, le Dr Hanrahan et ses collègues du
réseau ont remarqué que les inhibiteurs de la
déphosphorylisation ouvraient les canaux, qu'il y ait ou non
présence de fibrose kystique. « Nous étions très surpris de
découvrir que des canaux normaux, tout comme des canaux ayant
subi des mutations causées par la maladie, s'ouvrent quand les
cellules sont exposées à ces inhibiteurs enzymatiques », a
expliqué le Dr Hanrahan.
<p>
Ce type d'inhibiteurs se retrouve déjà sous forme de médicaments
qui ont la capacité de renforcer le système immunitaire. La
récente découverte de l'équipe d'inspiraplex pourrait s'avérer
la clé de la mise au point d'un traitement efficace de la
fibrose kystique. Les résultats des travaux du Dr Hanrahan et de
l'équipe d'inspiraplex et du Réseau canadien sur les maladies
génétiques ont été publiés dans la revue américaine Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences. Par ailleurs, inspiraplex
et l'Université McGill ont déposé une demande de brevet pour ces
composés, auxquels les partenaires potentiels de l'industrie
pharmaceutique s'intéressent en vue de développer un nouvel
agent thérapeutique pour le traitement de la fibrose kystique.
<p>
En plus de faciliter et de promouvoir la recherche
inter-disciplinaire, inspiraplex permet aux chercheurs d'élargi
i leurs horizons en leur donnant l'occasion de poursuivre des
avenues de recherche complètement nouvelles. Le Dr Hanrahan, qui
étudiait auparavant le transport des ions dans les reins et
l'intestins poursuit maintenant des travaux sur les canaux à
chlorure dans les voies respiratoires. « Le Réseau en santé
respiratoire m'a conduit à étudier de nouveaux problèmes
importants en pathologie pulmonaire. où les processus de
transport peuvent être anormaux », a expliqué le chercheur.
<p>
Inspiraplex réunit plus de 200 excellents chercheurs, attachés
de recherche et étudiants aux cycles supérieurs de 13
universités et trois instituts de recherche qui effectuent de la
recherche regroupant plusieurs disciplines, notamment la
physiologie, l'hygiène du milieu et la réadaptation, la
biochimie, la génétique, la biologie cellulaire et moléculaire,
la biophysique et le génie. Six partenaires industriels
participent aux travaux du réseau.

<title>AU SECOURS DES ÉDIFICES « MALADES »</title>
<h2>Au secours des édifices « malades »</h2>
<p>
Un nouveau concept de ventilation conçu et testé par inspiraplex
et son partenaire industriel pourrait contribuer au bien-être et
à la productivité des personnes travaillant dans des édifices
«malades». On reconnaît de plus en plus que le «syndrome des
travailleurs de bureau» est en partie responsable du taux
d'absentéisme plus élevé et de la productivité plus faible dans
les lieux de travail modernes et étanches: ce syndrome cause des
symptômes allant d'une sécheresse de la gorge à la fatigue
mentale, jusqu'aux maux de tête et aux étourdissements. Le
nouveau «système de chauffage, de ventilation et de
climatisation à tolérance zéro» offre une solution à certaines
des causes soupçonnées du syndrome, comme la mauvaise
ventilation, les substances chimiques diffusées dans l'air ou
les variations de température, d'humidité et d'éclairage.
<p>
Ce système confère aux personnes un plus grand contrôle sur les
conditions qui règnent dans leur lieu de travail. il comprend
une série de tuyaux dont les ramifications à partir des
conduites maîtresses d'un édifice se rendent jusqu'aux postes de
travail individuels. _ l'aide d'une télécommande semblable à
celle d'un téléviseur, une personne peut modifier la température
et l'humidité de l'air arrivant à son poste de travail. Ce
système a été conçu à la suite d'une étude intensive sur la
qualité de l'air et le rendement du personnel dans des édifices
étanches, menée par une équipe du Réseau dirigée par Richard
Menzies, de L'Univ. McGill. Ce chercheur a découvert des
différences considérables d'humidité et de température d'un
poste de travail à un autre, même lorsque ceux-ci n'étaient
éloignés que de quelques mètres. Des changements importants aux
conduites d'alimentation en air frais n'ont pas contribué à
réduire les symptômes des travailleurs ou à améliorer leur
sensation de bien-être.
<p>
Inspiraplex a réuni M. Menzies et Engineering Interface Ltd.,
une entreprise de Toronto, qui avait déjà songé à des
dispositifs de contrôle local. A l'aide des résultats des
travaux et de la méthode d'essai de M. Menzies, les ingénieurs
de l'entreprise ont été en mesure de modifier et d'évaluer
l'efficacité de cette nouvelle technologie, maintenant brevetée.
Après plusieurs tests prometteurs à petite échelle, le système
sera installé dès l'automne 1993 dans des édifices de Toronto,
Ottawa et Montréal en vue d'une évaluation complète. En
comparant le rendement du personnel sur les étages disposant du
nouveau système et sur d'autres étages, on devrait être en
mesure de déterminer les avantages de cette innovation au plan
de la santé et au plan économique. D'après l'Organisation
mondiale de la santé, jusqu'à 30 % des édifices neufs ou rénovés
suscitent des taux inhabituellement élevés de plaintes pour
insalubrité. Parmi les centaines d'édifices évalués par Santé et
Bien-être Canada, plus des deux tiers ont des problèmes de
ventilation.

<title>FACILITER LA RESPIRATION</title>
<h2>Faciliter la respiration</h2>
<p>

Inspiraplex, le réseau en santé respiratoire, a mis au point un
nouveau type de ventilateur qui sera bientôt mis en marché. Le
Dr Magdy Younes du Respiratory Hospital de Winnipeg, au
Manitoba, est chercheur principal du Réseau. Il a passé huit ans
à concevoir un nouveau ventilateur à assistance respiratoire
proportionnelle. Contrairement aux ventilateurs traditionnels,
dont la pression ou la quantité d'air sont prédéterminées, ce
ventilateur réagit aux besoins individuels des patients.
<p>
«Le Réseau nous a permis de mettre le concept à l'essai. Nous
avons chargé des ingénieurs de concevoir et de fabriquer un tout
nouveau ventilateur, d'après le concept «d'assistance
respiratoire proportionnelle». L'avantage de ce concept est
qu'il permet de modifier des ventilateurs existants afin qu'ils
puissent offrir une assistance proportionnelle», fait observer
le Dr Younes.
<p>
L'industrie a d'ailleurs manifesté de l'intérêt pour cette
technologie d'avant-garde, pour l'approche innovatrice du
Réseau, de même que pour l'expertise en recherche sur les
maladies respiratoires que l'on retrouve dans la région de
Winnipeg. En effet, deux entreprises, PuritanBennett Corp. et
Respironics Inc., ont obtenu de l'Université du Manitoba, le
centre de recherche qui a déposé le brevet pour le Réseau, des
droits non exclusifs concernant le prototype et le concept.
D'autre part, une entreprise de fabrication britannique, Medix
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a manifesté son intérêt en vue d'établir
une filiale à Winnipeg pour mettre au point des produits reliés
au traitement des maladies respiratoires.

<title>DÉSENGORGER LES LIGNES TÉLÉPHONIQUES</title>
<h2>Désengorger les lignes téléphoniques</h2>
<p>

Il faut du matériel électronique perfectionné pour arriver à
acheminer toujours plus de conversations sur des réseaux
sursaturés de téléphones cellulaires et de radios. Mais comme le
constatent les fabricants de ce matériel, les progrès
technologiques dans ce domaine exigent aussi l'élaboration de
systèmes d'analyse perfectionnés.
<p>
En collaboration avec l'Institut canadien de recherches en
télécommunications (ICRT), une équipe de chercheurs à
l'Université McGill a élaboré des algorithmes qui rendent
possibles des améliorations de ce genre aux communications sans
fil. En réduisant le débit de transmission des données, un
processus appelé encodage de la parole, on peut disposer de plus
de largeur de bande et accommoder un volume plus élevé de
communications.
<p>
Une connexion vocale de haute qualité par l'intermédiaire d'une
ligne téléphonique normale exige la transmission de 64 000 bits
de données par seconde. Le nouvel algorithme de l'ICRT réduit ce
débit à 8 000 bits/sec tout en maintenant la même qualité de
voix. Peter Kabal, professeur de génie électrique à l'Université
McGill, attribue cette réduction importante aux toutes dernières
puces de traitement numérique des signaux qui accommodent des
algorithmes d'encodage de la voix plus perfectionnés.
<p>
« Il y a quelques années, on nous aurait dit que ce genre
d'amélioration était trop complexe à mettre en application»,
dit-il, en soulignant que l'industrie a maintenant besoin
d'applications aussi puissantes. Les chercheurs industriels
n'ont pas encore réussi à élaborer des normes qui permettraient
de gérer un système de téléphonie cellulaire numérique unifié
dans toute l'Amérique du Nord. Le professeur Kabal croit que son
groupe peut apporter une contribution importante dans ce
domaine. «L'ICRT contribue à faciliter ce processus, ajoute-il,
en établissant un pont avec l'industrie et en s'assurant qu'on
travaille à des problèmes d'intérêt industriel.»

<title>Percée extraordinaire en photonique</title>

<h2>Percée extraordinaire en photonique</h2>

<p>Les futurs systèmes de commutation en télécommunications requis
pour l’autoroute électronique devront absorber un très grand
débit de transmission entre les cartes de circuits imprimés
(PCB), débit pouvant atteindre plusieurs térabits à la seconde.
Un térabit à la seconde permet la tenue simultanée d’environ 
15 millions de conversations téléphoniques ou la 
transmission de 330 000 images vidéos d’une grande clarté.  La
technologie électronique actuelle ne pouvant répondre à de
telles attentes, une équipe de l’Institut canadien de recherches
en télécommunications (ICRT) s’affaire à y remédier en faisant
appel à la technologie des ondes lumineuses.  Plus
particulièrement, cette équipe travaille à la mise au point de
techniques d’interconnexion des PCB reposant sur des rangées de
canaux optiques à deux dimensions, qui se propagent dans l’air
et traversent la courte distance entre les PCB.  L’un des
principaux avantages de cette méthode réside dans la création 
de très grandes largeurs de bandes de communication entre les 
composantes clés d’un système électronique.

<p>Récemment, des chercheurs de l’Université McGill ont mis au
point un système prototype capable d’interconnecter entre elles
des cartes de circuits imprimés au moyen d’instruments optiques
et optomécaniques conçus à cette fin.  Ce système est la
première expérience réussie du genre sur l’application de
méthodes optiques dans le boîtier d’un panneau électronique
standard, et démontre qu’il est possible d’intégrer des
interconnexions optiques utilisant l’espace libre dans les
systèmes électroniques usuels.

<p>" Cette démonstration constitue un jalon important dans
l’atteinte de notre objectif à long terme qui est de mettre au
point une technologie optique adaptée aux systèmes de
commutation de demain ", déclare le professeur David Plant, qui a
dirigé l’équipe de McGill ayant construit le prototype.

<p>Ce programme de recherches de l’ICRT regroupe sept professeurs
et douze étudiants des 2e et 3e cycles.  Participent également à
ce projet plusieurs attachés de recherche des universités McGill et
McMaster et de TR Labs ainsi que des chercheurs du CNRC.

<title>UN ROBOT QUI AIME JOUER</title>

<h2>Un robot qui aime jouer</h2>
<p>

Jouer avec une balle ou un ours en peluche est un plaisir pour
tout enfant. Mais pour celui qui souffre d'un handicap physique,
une balle hors d'atteinte ou tombée sur le sol devient une
source de frustration. De récentes percées en robotique et en
perception computationnelle réalisées par l'institut de
robotique et d'intelligence des systèmes (IRIS) pourraient
toutefois rendre la vie de ces enfants plus facile. En effet,
une équipe du réseau travaille à la conception d'un robot qui
pourrait éventuellement assister les enfants handicapés dans
leurs activités quotidiennes. Les chercheurs ont déposé
récemment une demande de brevet pour le tableau de communication
qu'ils ont mis au point pour le robot, surnommé PLAYBOT. Le
tableau s'active au moyen d'un écran tactile affichant des noms,
des actions et des verbes du langage du jeu illustrés par des
icônes et qui servent à donner les commandes. Par exemple, un
enfant qui cherche son ours en peluche peut appuyer ou pointer
vers la série d'icônes qui indiqueront au robot de repérer le
jouet, puis d'aider l'enfant à le ramasser et à s'amuser avec
l'objet. Les chercheurs visent éventuellement à créer un
fauteuil roulant robotisé qui traiterait l'information à partir
de la tête et du bras du robot ainsi que du tableau de commande
pour venir en aide à l'enfant.
<p>
L'équipe de l'IRIS a réussi à construire un prototype du PLAYBOT
qui consiste en une plateforme sur laquelle repose le tableau de
commande, un bras robotisé ainsi qu'une tête munie de caméras
qui suivent la vision humaine. Les chercheurs font non seulement
appel aux techniques les plus avant-gardistes de la robotique
mais contribuent également à faire avancer le domaine.
<p>
L'équipe de recherche, qui regroupe sept chercheurs principaux,
15 étudiants aux cycles supérieurs et quatre associés de
recherche et programmeurs aux universités York, Western Ontario
et de Toronto, représente différents domaines de recherche de
l'IRIS. «Nous avons été en mesure de tirer parti des vastes
compétences que l'on retrouve dans les différents projets
poursuivis par le réseau, ce qui nous a donné l'occasion
d'élargir nos horizons et de concevoir le PLAYBOT», explique
John Tsotsos, responsable de projet pour le PLAYBOT et l'IRIS et
professeur d'informatique à l'Université de Toronto.
<p>
Le programme de recherche concertée et multidisciplinaire de
l'IRIS regroupe 24 projets dans 19 universités canadiennes. Ces
projets comprennent la conception d'un robot multipode
perfectionné capable de se mouvoir comme la main humaine et qui
pourrait effectuer des tâches en milieu hostiles ou dangereux.
Les chercheurs travaillent également à la mise au point de
dispositifs de contrôle plus intelligents pour les excavatrices
et autre machinerie lourde et explorent de nouveaux systèmes de
microrobotique qui pourraient déboucher sur de nouvelles
applications en micro-chirurgie et en soins thérapeutiques. Le
réseau réunit plus de 130 des meilleurs chercheurs
universitaires dans ce domaine. Près de 300 étudiants aux cycles
supérieurs et stagiaires postdoctoraux collaborent aux projets
de l'IRIS. Le réseau est administré par PRECARN Associates Inc.,
un consortium de 39 sociétés et organismes gouvernementaux et un
partenaire solide dans cet effort national de recherche
concertée.

<title>UN ORDINATEUR PLEIN D'IMAGINATION</title>
<h2>Un ordinateur plein d'imagination</h2>
<p>
Réussir à faire comprendre à un ordinateur une demande de
renseignements dans un langage courant pourrait s'avérer être
bien plus qu'une simple question de commodité. En effet selon
les chercheurs de l'Institut de robotique et d'intelligence des
systèmes. l'ordinateur pourrait indiquer des regroupements que
nous n'aurions pu soupçonner nous-mêmes.
<p>
Des informaticiens des universités de Regina et de Simon Fraser
ont élaboré deux approches complémentaires pour aider un
ordinateur à analyser une instruction en langue anglaise
courante. Une interface langage naturel-base de données, appelée
Système X, utilise des règles de grammaire complexes pour
décomposer une Instruction en ses éléments essentiels. Un second
système, appelé DBLEARN, permet à l'ordinateur d'utiliser les
attributs fournis par une instruction dans un langage naturel,
afin de découvrir de nouveaux liens au sein d'une base de
données.
<p>
Les chercheurs ont perfectionné un prototype du Système X en le
mettant à l'essai auprès d'un vice- président chez Roger's
Cablesystems Ltd. Celui-ci a trouvé l'équipement tellement utile
qu'il l'a conservé beaucoup plus longtemps que prévu. «Il a
obtenu en deux minutes des graphiques de données pertinentes, ce
qui lui aurait pris six semaines à obtenir autrement, souligne
Nick Cercone, vice-président à la recherche à l'Université de
Regina. Cela signifie qu'il a été capable de prendre de
meilleures décisions plus rapidement.»
<p>
Le système lui a permis de taper une phrase du genre «Donne-moi
le fichier des résultats de la région de l'Ouest pour juin», et
d'obtenir aussitôt un tableau ou un graphique des données
pertinentes extrait de la base de données de l'entreprise.
<p>
M. Cercone affirme qu'une telle interface, qui pourrait être
jumelée à DBLEARN, fait bien plus que faciliter l'utilisation
des données. Lors d'un essai expérimental avec la base de
données sur les subventions du Conseil de recherches en sciences
naturelles et en génie, ses collègues et lui ont démontré de
quelle façon DBLEARN a «découvert» de nouveaux regroupements
entre les diverses sections de la base de données sur les
subventions. «Ces regroupements, souligne-t-il, nous fournissent
une mine de résultats, car on obtient de l'information à la fois
par classification, catégorisation et association.»

<title>DES MACHINES PLUS INTELLIGENTES</title>
<h2>Des machines plus intelligentes</h2>
<p>

Une équipe de l'institut de robotique et d'intelligence des
systèmes (IRIS) met au point des dispositifs de contrôle
intelligents pour les excavatrices et d'autres types de
machinerie lourde, en vue de faciliter la tâche de l'opérateur
et d'accroître sa sécurité. Ce projet offre de vastes
possibilités à l'industrie forestière, Si importante au Canada,
et à d'autres industries primaires. L'objectif à long terme
consiste à mettre au point des machines agricoles et forestières
mobiles qui «assistent intelligemment» l'opérateur et réduisent
les répercussions sur l'environne- ment. Ces machines plus
intelligentes augmenteront la rentabilité des coupes et le
contrôle de la qualité. «En fin de compte, l'opérateur devrait
être en mesure de planifier la stratégie de coupe et de laisser
la machine effectuer elle-même la tâche», explique Peter
Lawrence, professeur de génie électrique à l'Univ. de la C.-B.,
dont l'équipe collabore à ce projet avec d'autres chercheurs du
Réseau rattachés aux universités de la Saskatchewan et du
Manitoba.
<p>
Avant qu'une machine ne puisse effectuer une tâche complexe en
obéissant simplement à une commande, elle doit être en mesure de
déterminer la position de ses membres et des objets qu'elle
manipule. L'équipe de l'IRIS a réalisé des progrès relativement
à divers aspects de ce problème. D'autres chercheurs de l'IRIS
ont élaboré des algorithmes parallèles qui ont été distribués
sur un réseau de microprocesseurs, une étape importante vers la
conception d'une machine dont les systèmes de contrôle peuvent
interpréter à haute vitesse des informations cruciales. Par
exemple, Si la friction des roulements et des engrenages
augmente, le système de contrôle peut déterminer à l'avance la
défectuosité et émettre un signal d'avertissement. Les
chercheurs ont eu recours aux algorithmes pour mettre au point
un simulateur de contrôle de la machine. Plusieurs entreprises
se sont montrées intéressées à l'utiliser comme outil de
formation. Dans le cadre de travaux connexes, d'autres membres
de l'IRIS sont à mettre au point des systèmes de détection
permettant à la machine de détecter la position de ses bras par
rapport à son environnement.
<p>
RSI Research Inc., de la Colombie-Britannique, suit de près les
récents progrès du Réseau. Cette entreprise installe
actuellement sur une abatteuse-groupeuse fabriquée par
Caterpillar et une excavatrice Hitachi une version antérieure
d'un système de contrôle mis au point par le professeur Lawrence
et ses étudiants. Les opérateurs novices peuvent facilement
faire fonctionner la machinerie équipée de ces dispositifs de
contrôle synchronisés et informatisés.

<title>LE CANADA A L'AVANT-GARDE EN MICRO-ÉLECTRONIQUE</title>
<h2>Le Canada à l'avant-garde en micro-électronique</h2>
<p>

Dans le monde de la micro-électronique, la clé du succès
commercial est la miniaturisation et la puissance.  De nombreux
pays sont dans la course pour intégrer le plus de dispositifs
sur une micropuce, et le gagnant sera assuré d'une part du
marché en rapide expansion qu'est celui des communications et
des produits informatiques. Les chercheurs de Micronet -
Dispositifs, circuits et systèmes micro-électroniques intégrés à
ultra-grande échelle (ULSI) aident le Canada à se placer dans le
peloton de t_te. L'imposant défi de Micronet consiste à mettre
au point une puce semi-conductrice pas plus grande qu'un ongle
et pouvant contenir 100 millions de transistors et d'autres
composants électroniques.
<p>
En utilisant la technique de la microlithographie par rayon X,
une équipe de l'INRS à Varennes. au Québec, qui collabore
étroitement avec Northern Telecom Electronics         Limited
(NTEL) de Kanata en Ontario, a mis au point une technologie
permettant de produire des transistors dix fois plus petits que
ceux fabriqués avec la méthode actuelle. Les chercheurs qui
veulent utiliser cette technologie ont toutefois plusieurs défis
de taille à relever. Entre     autres, ils doivent déterminer et
mettre au point le masque approprié. c'est-à-dire une sorte de
pochoir de pointe, pour définir les traits sur la puce.
<p>
Par radiation, on projette le motif du masque sur une «couche
résine» où sont gravés les dessins complexes des circuits. Bien
que les rayons X donnent une résolution plus précise et plus
petite des traits du circuit. les longueurs d'ondes utilisées en
microlithographie par rayon X ne pénètrent pas la plupart des
matériaux. Pour résoudre ce problème, l'équipe de Micronet a
élaboré un masque à rayons X fait d'une très mince pellicule de
carbure de silicium et est ainsi en mesure de créer sans
problèmes des grilles et des traits à haute résolution. L'équipe
 compte fabriquer les premiers prototypes de transistors d'ici
l'été, à l'aide de ce masque à rayons X. A l'heure actuelle, une
puce de 1 cm peut contenir jusqu'à deux millions de transistors
et d'autres composants électroniques microscopiques. Le diamètre
d'un transistor est environ le centième de celui d'un cheveu
humain, une réduction phénoménale par rapport aux premiers
transistors con_us en 1948, qui étaient environ de la dimension
d'un comprimé de vitamines. Dans les années cinquante, une radio
transistor contenait environ cinq de ces transistors. Dans la
société d'information d'aujourd'hui, où la transmission de
données informatiques et visuelles connaît une croissance sans
précédent, il est capital de donner plus de puissance aux puces
semi-conductrices. Des composants minuscules plus puissants et
plus rapides permettent      de réduire les coûts et d'augmenter
considérablement la polyvalence d'une puce semiconductrice.
<p>
Micronet regroupe 70 chercheurs chevronnés de 16 universités
canadiennes et d'un laboratoire gouvernemental. Il offre
également un milieu de formation stimulant à plus de 200
étudiants aux cycles supérieurs. Micronet a créé des
partenariats avec il sociétés industrielles qui         jouent
un rôle de premier plan dans l'industrie des communications et
de l'électronique, un secteur d'importance vitale pour le Canada.

<title>COMBATTRE LES INFECTIONS EFFICACEMENT</title>

<h1>Combattre les infections efficacement</h1>
<p>
Une entreprise pharmaceutique de Vancouver, Micrologix Biotech,
a acquis les droits exclusifs pour la mise au point de puissants
agents antibactériens pour combattre certaines maladies
infectieuses contractées en milieu hospitalier. Un partenaire
industriel du <a href="http://www.cbdn.ca">Réseau canadien de recherche sur les bactérioses</a>,
Micrologix utilise des «Rehausseurs» (Enhancers), une
technologie antimicrobienne mise au point par une équipe de
chercheurs du réseau sous la direction du docteur Bob Hancok de
l'Univ. de la Colombie-Britanique. Les rehausseurs sont des
peptides génétiquement modifiés qui peuvent à la fois agir comme
de nouveaux antibiotiques et améliorer l'efficacité des
antibiotiques traditionnels. Les peptides tuent les bactéries
infectieuses en détruisant leur membrane cellulaire. On peut
détruire la bactérie ellemême ou permettre à un antibiotique
destiné à tuer celle-ci de la pénétrer. Cette approche novatrice
est particulièrement utile pour combattre le problème croissant
des bactéries infectieuses qui présentent une résistance élevée
aux médicaments (c.-à-d. les bactéries dont la membrane
cellulaire ne peut être pénétrée par l'antibiotique). En
Amérique du Nord seulement, deux millions de personnes
contractent des maladies infectieuses en milieu hospitalier ce
qui entraîne des soins de santé de 1,5 milliard de dollars par
année.
<p>
Selon Kevin Nephin, vice-président de Micrologix «nos
chercheurs, en collaboration avec le Réseau, peuvent faire appel
à cette technologie pour concevoir des composés plus efficaces
destinés à des fins thérapeutiques humaines. Ils ont mis au
point un composé de premier ordre, le Nihilin 101, qui peut
enrayer plusieurs infections bactériennes dérivées du milieu
hospitalier parmi les plus dangereuses.»  Au cours des douze
prochains mois, Micrologix effectuera des essais pré-cliniques
sur trois composés faisant appel à.la technologie des
rehausseurs. En outre, l'entreprise a immédiatement investi 500
000 $ pour faire progresser les travaux du réseau dans ce
domaine. «Les rehausseurs pourraient trouver de nombreuses
applications dans le traitement des maladies bactériennes,
fongiques et parasitaires». explique William Kay, un chercheur
principal du réseau et professeur de biochimie et de
microbiologie à l'Univ. de Victoria.
<p>
Le Réseau canadien de recherche sur les bactérioses regroupe 44
éminents chercheurs de sept universités et deux laboratoires
gouvernementaux. Plus de 225 associés de recherche, étudiants
aux cycles supérieurs et techniciens participent aux activités
de recherche du réseau, qui comprennent l'étude de l'attaque
bactérienne et la réaction de l'hôte dans des systèmes
biologiques très différents des humains. des animaux et des
plantes. Le réseau a établi des liens avec 12 partenaires
industriels. La société Micrologix a été créée en 1986 et a
généré des ventes de plus de un million de dollars en vaccins et
diagnostics pour humains et animaux. De l'avis de Kevin Nephin,
l'exploitation de cette technologie devrait permettre à
l'entreprise, qui emploie actuellement 27 personnes, de doubler
son personnel au cours des trois prochaines années.

<title>LUTTE À LA MALADIE DU HAMBURGER</title>

<h1>Lutte à la maladie du hamburger</h1>
<p>
Un nouveau médicament qui pourrait empêcher la dangereuse et
parfois mortelle «maladie du hamburger» a été mis au point par
des chercheurs du Réseau canadien de recherche sur les
bactérioses (RCRB). Le SYNSORB-P prend au piège et neutralise
les toxines bactériennes potentielles avant qu'elles' ne
puissent faire des ravages. La bactérie (une variété de E. coli)
se développe dans la viande hachée ou dans le lait non
pasteurisé et les produits laitiers. Plus de 400 Canadiens ont
été atteints par cette maladie l'an dernier. Dans la plupart des
cas, celleci s'est déclarée après l'ingestion de boeuf haché
insuffisamment cuit ou après que le sujet ait été en contact
avec une personne infectée. Cette bactérie, qui se multiplie
dans le tube digestif, entraîne des vomissements, de la diarrhée
et de la fièvre. Ses toxines peuvent provoquer un syndrome
hémolytique urémique (SHU) aigu, pouvant causer des dommages aux
reins et au système nerveux central. La maladie s'est récemment
manifestée dans les Territoires du NordOuest et dans l'État de
Washington.
<p>
Les essais précliniques en vue de déterminer l'innocuité du
médicament sont présentement en cours. «Les résultats
préliminaires sont très encourageants», a déclaré Glen Armstrong
de l'Univ. de l'Alberta, l'un des chercheurs du Réseau qui a
contribué à l'élaboration du médicament. Cette invention
constitue une application thérapeutique innovatrice des
SYNSORBS, qui avalent tout d'abord été mis au point au
laboratoire de Raymond Lemieux, de l'Univ. de l'Alberta, en
collaboration avec une équipe de recherche de l'ancienne société
Chembiomed Ltd., entreprise albertaine de technologie de pointe
et partenaire industriel du Réseau. Les SYNSORBS sont des
molécules de sucre de synthèse qui relient des protéines telles
que les toxines et les enferment à l'intérieur de particules
poreuses d'organismes monocellulaires appelés diatomes. M.
Armstrong et son équipe, en collaboration avec Murray Ratchife,
à l'époque chez Chembiomed, ont réussi à isoler une molécule de
sucre du SYNSORB et à en vérifier la capacité de lier et de
bloquer les toxines nocives qui causent le SHU. Cette découverte
fait à présent l'objet de recherches plus poussées par le
Alberta Research Council, propriétaire de la technologie. «Les
toxines sont leurrées par le sucre qui limite les récepteurs sur
les cellules hôtes. Elles sont ensuite prises au piège à
l'intérieur du SYNSORB qui contient le sucre», explique M.
Armstrong.
<p>
Les deux collaborateurs du Réseau, le Alberta Research Council
et le Centre canadien de référence pour les maladies rénales
pédiatriques, participent aux essais précliniques.

<title>Prévenir les infections fatales chez les personnes atteintes de
fibrose kystique</title>

<h2>Prévenir les infections fatales chez les personnes atteintes de
fibrose kystique</h2>

<p>Un chercheur du Réseau canadien de recherche sur les bactérioses
(RCRB) a dévoilé un nouveau procédé biochimique qui pourrait 
permettre de prévenir les infections chroniques provoquant le
décès de la plupart des personnes atteintes de fibrose kystique.  

<p>Ces personnes succombent habituellement à un bactérie appelée
Pseudomonas aeruginosa qui envahit les poumons et les affaiblit. 
Les voies respiratoires des personnes atteintes de fibrose
kystique présentent déjà une accumulation excessive de mucus et
le stress additionnel causé par l’infection est souvent fatal.  Les
bactéries pénètrent à l’intérieur de l’organisme en adhérant aux
cellules épithéliales de la bouche et s’y reproduisent
suffisamment pour provoquer une infection des poumons.
L’utilisation d’un nouveau glucose non toxique et bon marché
pourrait toutefois empêcher les bactéries d’adhérer aux cellules
épithéliales.  En empêchant les bactéries de s’établir à
l’intérieur de l’organisme, on peut prévenir les infections et
conséquemment prolonger la vie de nombreuses personnes atteintes
de fibrose kystique.

<p>Le Dr David Speert, chef du département des maladies
infectieuses et immunitaires à l’Université de la
Colombie-Britannique et à l’hôpital pour enfants de la
Colombie-Britannique, a démontré la faisabilité de ce
traitement.  Il a concentré ses travaux sur le Dextran, un
composé de glucose mis au point il y a environ 50 ans comme substitut du
sang.  Au cours de travaux en collaboration avec Polydex
Pharmaceuticals, le Dr Speert avait originalement envisagé
d’utiliser le Dextran comme un moyen d’améliorer la fonction des
macrophages, des globules blancs qui jouent un rôle très
important dans la réponse immunitaire.  Il a observé que le Dextran
n’améliorait pas cette fonction mais empêchait plutôt les bactéries
d’adhérer aux macrophages.   

<p>Le Dr Speert et Thomas Usher, inventeur du Dextran, ont 
déposé une demande de brevet visant l’utilisation de ce 
composé pour le traitement de personnes souffrant de fibrose
kystique. La prochaine étape des travaux portera sur 
l’efficacité clinique de cette nouvelle thérapie.

<title>UN NOUVEAU VACCIN POUR LES SAUMONS</title>
<h2>Un nouveau vaccin pour les saumons</h2>
<p>
La mise au point d'un nouveau vaccin permettra à l'industrie
aquicole canadienne de demeurer compétitive à l'échelle
internationale. Conçu pour prévenir la furonculose, une maladie
répandue et coûteuse qui touche l'industrie aquicole des
saumons, le vaccin est le résultat d'une collaboration entre
Microtek R&D Ltd, de Victoria en C.-B., et de deux chercheurs de
l'Université de Victoria affiliés au Réseau canadien de
recherche sur les bactérioses. Le vaccin vivant, très efficace
lors des essais en laboratoire, peut être administré à l'aide de
techniques d'immersion, un progrès important dans la technologie
de vaccin aquicole. Selon le directeur de la Recherche de
Microtek, Richard Smith, la collaboration avec le Réseau a
permis d'accélérer le programme de mise au point du vaccin.
Microtek attend l'approbation réglementaire pour effectuer des
essais en entreprise. L'industrie aquicole du saumon de la C.B.
accuse des pertes de 5,4 millions de $ annuellement à cause de
la furonculose; à l'échelle mondiale, ces pertes s'élèvent à 100
millions de $.

<title>DÉCOUVERTE DES GÈNES RESPONSABLES DU DIABÈTE JUVÉNILE</title>
<h2>Découverte des gènes responsables du diabète juvénile</h2>
<p>

Une équipe de recherche dirigée par Dr. Leigh Field du Réseau
canadien sur les maladies génétiques (RCMG) a découvert deux
nouveaux gènes qui jouent un rôle important dans le
développement du diabète juvénile. Cette percée est un pas
important vers l'identification de la cause de cette forme
commune de diabète, qui touche un enfant sur 300 de moins de 20
ans. Elle pourrait amener le réseau à développer des techniques
de diagnostic en vue d'identifier les enfants qui ont un risque
élevé de développer cette maladie et, en bout de ligne, d'en
prévenir l'apparition.
<p>
« Lorsque nous comprendrons quelle combinaison de gènes a le
plus de chances d'engendrer le diabète, nous pourrons, en
analysant l'ADN d'un simple prélèvement sanguin, déterminer les
enfants qui courent un risque élevé de contracter cette maladie
et leur administrer un traitement pour en prévenir l'apparition
», a déclaré le Dr Field, professeur au département de génétique
médicale de l'Université de Calgary. Les résultats des travaux
de l'équipe ont été publiés dans le numéro d'octobre de la revue
Nature Genetics.
<p>
Le diabète juvénile, aussi appelé diabète de type 1, est une
maladie particulièrement complexe, en raison de la combinaison
de plusieurs gènes, qui est à l'origine de son apparition. Deux
de ces gènes continuent encore de dérouter les chercheurs. « Je
crois que nous sommes très près de découvrir combien de gènes
sont nécessaires pour provoquer l'apparition de la maladie et
d'identifier les enfants les plus susceptibles de devenir
diabétiques », explique le Dr Field, qui poursuit des travaux
sur cette maladie depuis 1983 avec l'appui du Conseil de
recherches médicales du Canada. Sa participation au réseau
depuis 1990 lui a permis de réorienter ses travaux dans une
nouvelle direction qui a mené à la découverte des deux nouveaux
gènes. C'est en utilisant une méthode de triage de chromosomes
du génome, qu'elle a réussi à découvrir ceux qui ont les gènes
qui transmettent les caractéristiques de la maladie. L'équipe a
étudié et comparé 100 gènes marqueurs dans 250 familles comptant
un ou deux enfants diabétiques. Après quatre ans de recherche,
le Dr Field et son équipe ont réussi à localiser le premier gène
responsable du diabète au bas du chromosome 15, et le second au
milieu du chromosome II.
<p>
Environ 100 000 Canadiens sont atteints de diabète juvénile et
doivent recevoir une injection quotidienne d'insuline pour
survivre. Le diabète est une réaction du système immunitaire,
qui attaque et détruit les cellules du pancréas produisant
l'insuline. L'équipe du réseau poursuivra ses travaux en vue de
déterminer tous les gènes associés à la maladie et en prévenir
l'apparition. « Les installations du réseau et la collaboration
dans toutes les régions du pays sont essentielles pour faire
progresser rapidement les travaux du Dr Field», a indiqué
Michael Hayden, le directeur scientifique du réseau. Selon le Dr
Field, l'environnement stimulant et la collaboration au sein du
réseau constituent un atout important pour ses travaux.
<p>
Le Réseau canadien sur les maladies génétiques réunit plus de
330 chercheurs, associés de recherche et étudiants aux cycles
supérieures répartis dans huit universités et six centres
hospitaliers. Le réseau a établi des partenariats et des
collaborations dynamiques avec huit partenaires industriels. En
outre, les sociétés Merck Frosst et MDS Health Ltd. participent
très activement aux activités du réseau depuis sa mise sur pied.

<title>Sur la piste de la maladie de Huntington</title>

<h2>Sur la piste de la maladie de Huntington</h2>

<p>Au Canada, environ 3 000 personnes sont atteintes de la maladie
de Huntington, et 15 000 autres pourraient la développer un
jour. Cette maladie, qui frappe habituellement les personnes
âgées entre 30 et 50 ans, détruit lentement les cellules
cérébrales et entraîne la détérioration du contrôle du mouvement
et de diverses fonctions psychologiques.  Un enfant dont un
parent est affecté par ce trouble a 50 % des chances de
développer la maladie de Huntington, pour laquelle il n’existe
actuellement aucun traitement efficace.

<p>Des chercheurs du Réseau canadien sur les maladies génétiques
(RCMG) ont identifié un trait génétique clé associé à la
répartition mondiale de la maladie de Huntington. Dans un
article paru dans le New England Journal of Medicine, le Dr
Michael Hayden, directeur du RCMG, et ses collègues ont fait
état de la découverte d’un modèle de répétition d’un gène
particulier chez des patients de 43 pays et cinq souches
raciales qui différencie clairement les personnes normales de
celles qui sont affectées par cette maladie héréditaire
incurable. 

<p>" Cette découverte nous aidera à prédire qui sera affecté par la
maladie et à comprendre les mécanismes de sa distribution dans le monde
entier ", a déclaré le Dr Hayden, qui dirige une équipe de chercheurs à
l’Université de la Colombie-Britannique. Tout récemment, ce groupe a réussi à
cloner le gène de la maladie de Huntington chez la souris, une
percée importante pour la compréhension du fonctionnement normal
de ce gène et l’établissement d’un système type de la maladie.
" Un de nos principaux objectifs, a expliqué le Dr Hayden, est de
déterminer la fonction de ce gène et de comprendre comment ses
mutations causent la maladie. "  

<p>Le clonage du gène, qui a été publié au début de 1994 dans la
revue Human Molecular Genetics, a couronné une année de progrès
pour les chercheurs de Vancouver qui essaient d’élucider les
mystères de cette maladie héréditaire. Les chercheurs de
Vancouver ont mis en application de nouvelles techniques de
marquage et d’isolement des gènes mises au point par une équipe
du Hospital for Sick Children de Toronto sous la direction du Dr Johanna Rommens.

<p>Le Dr Hayden attribue cette réussite en grande partie à l’appui
du Conseil de recherches médicales et du Programme de RCE, ce dernier ayant
permis d’intensifier les efforts pour comprendre la maladie de
Huntington et trouver un traitement efficace. " Notre
collaboration avec les installations centrales du Réseau
canadien sur les maladies génétiques est cruciale pour atteindre
nos objectifs en vue de comprendre les causes biochimiques de
cette maladie ", a-t-il ajouté.

<title>UNE PERCÉE EN GÉNÉTIQUE</title>
<h2>Une percée en génétique</h2>
<p>

Le Dr Robert Korneluk, un des chercheurs principaux du Réseau
canadien des maladies génétiques, a joué un rôle important dans
la découverte du gène défectueux responsable de la dystrophie
musculaire myotonique. L'une des maladies neuromusculaires
héréditaires les plus fréquentes, la dystrophie myotonique
touche environ une personne sur 7 000 au Canada. Le centre de
recherche du Réseau est situé à l'Hôpital pour enfants de l'Est
de l'Ontario. Le Dr Korneluk a dirigé les travaux pendant cinq
ans en collaboration avec des chercheurs des PaysBas, de la
Grande-Bretagne et des États-Unis. Selon le Dr Korneluk,
l'échange rapide d'information au sein du Réseau a permis
d'accélérer le clonage du gène et a permis à l'équipe de passer
rapidement aux étapes importantes qui suivent de cette
découverte la caractérisation du gène; la mise au point de
nouvelles techniques de diagnostic et l'étude des possibilités
de traitement.

<title>Un projet de recherche conjoint sur l’hémoglobine</title>

<h2>Un projet de recherche conjoint sur l’hémoglobine</h2>

<p>La compagnie biopharmaceutique canadienne Hemosol Inc., établie
à Etobicoke (Ontario), s’est jointe au Réseau de centres
d’excellence en génie protéique dans un partenariat de recherche
visant à modifier l’hémoglobine, une substance protéique
contenue dans les globules rouges du sang, afin qu’elle serve de
véhicule pour le transport de médicaments vers des organes ou
tumeurs cibles.  Depuis sa création en 1985, Hemosol poursuit
activement des recherches en vue de mettre au point et de 
commercialiser un substitut aux produits du sang.

<p>Le vice-président de la recherche scientifique chez Hemosol,
Anthony Magnin, affirme que le Réseau en génie protéique a été
un élément important dans la décision d’Hemosol d’élargir son
champ d’activité au-delà des substances de substitution des
produits sanguins.  " La recherche et l’expertise poussées du
réseau dans la structure, les fonctions et la reconfiguration
des protéines complètent les solides compétences d’Hemosol en
recherche pharmaceutique, chimique et médicale, affirme-t-il. 
Ce partenariat a donné lieu à la création d’une gamme
diversifiée de produits qui nous permettront de trouver de
nouvelles applications à l’hémoglobine modifiée et de nouvelles
méthodes pour accomplir ces modifications. "

<p>Hemosol a collaboré étroitement avec le Professeur Ron Kluger,
de l’Université de Toronto, et son équipe qui ont développé une
nouvelle approche pour modifier l’hémoglobine et en faire un
véhicule pour le transport des médicaments.  Ce partenariat
entre le réseau et la compagnie a déjà porté fruits; un brevet
vient d’être délivré et une licence pour l’exploitation de cette
technologie a été émise au nom d’Hemosol.

<title>RÉGÉNÉRATION DE NERFS ENDOMMAGÉS</title>
<h2>Régénération de nerfs endommagés</h2>
<p>
Chaque année au Canada, plus de 25 000 personnes sont victimes
d'accidents ou de maladies qui endommagent le système
cérébrovasculaire et 1 000 autres subissent des lésions à la
moelle épinière. Le Réseau NeuroSciences réunit des scientifiques des quatre coins du pays
qui cherchent à trouver des moyens de rétablir les fonctions du
systèmes nerveux par suite de lésions ou de maladies
invalidantes comme la maladie d'Alzheimer ou celle de Parkinson.
Le Réseau s'appuie sur les progrès révolutionnaires de son
directeur scientifique, le Dr Albert Aguayo, et de ses associés
du Centre de recherches en neurosciences de l'Université McGill.
L'équipe a découvert que certaines cellules nerveuses
endommagées du cerveau et de la moelle épinière peuvent se
régénérer et rétablir leurs liaisons. Rétablir les fonctions
nerveuses est un autre objectif du Réseau. Le Dr Gerald Loeb et
ses associés de l'Université Queen's ont mis au point un
ensemble de modules miniatures contrôlés électroniquement qui
permettent d'établir une liaison avec des nerfs et des muscles
endommagés et de stimuler le mouvement. De la grosseur d'un
grain de riz, ces minuscules cylindres sont insérés dans le
muscle et contrôlés par télécommande. Parallèlement, le Dr Stein
et ses associés de l'Alberta effectuent des essais similaires
sur des implants chirurgicaux. Un tel implant a déjà réussi à
réanimer un nerf et on tente actuellement de le modifier afin
qu'il puisse stimuler jusqu'à 16 muscles paralysés. Le Réseau
négocie actuellement avec une entreprise en haute technologie
désirant établir une filiale au Canada pour fabriquer ces
appareils biomédicaux et leurs systèmes de contrôle.

<title>UNE FIBRE PREMIERE DE TETE</title>
<h2>Une fibre premiere de tête</h2>
<p>

L'évaluation de la qualité des fibres de cellulose en vue de la
fabrication du papier, qui auparavant exigeait plusieurs jours,
est aujourd'hui réalisée en quelques minutes, grâce à un
dispositif innovateur mis au point par le Réseau sur les pâtes
mécaniques et chimicomécaniques. Appelé analyseur de qualité des
fibres (AQF). ce dispositif est le premier produit
commercialisable du réseau. «Personne n'a été capable
d'effectuer jusqu'à maintenant ce genre d'analyse en si peu de
temps». souligne le directeur administratif du réseau, M. Gordon
Leary.
<p>
L'analyseur détermine la longueur et la forme des fibres de
cellulose, qui peuvent influer sur la résistance du papier. En
connaissant les caractéristiques des fibres qu'ils utilisent.
les fabricants peuvent optimiser la qualité du produit fini.
<p>
L'AQF dilue un échantillon de pâte recueilli dans un bêcher pour
obtenir la concentration appropriée. puis achemine le tout à une
éprouvette d'observation. La technologie d'imagerie vidéo permet
à son tour d'analyser les caractéristiques de la fibre,
fournissant ainsi des données que l'on peut imprimer ou
enregistrer de manière électronique.
<p>
L'équipement comprend également un concept breveté qui empêche
l'éprouvette d'observation de s'encrasser ou de s'engorger. ce
qui constituait depuis longtemps un problème majeur. Comme
l'éprouvette repose sur des principes d'hydrodynamique plutôt
que sur l'écoulement des liquides pour les acheminer à travers
des ouvertures étroites, le système peut traiter des fibres
recyclées contenant de l'encre, des charges, des matières
extractives et de la résine. Compte tenu de cette capacité du
système. on envisage également la possibilité d'utiliser l'AQF
en mode direct.
<p>
L'AQF est le fruit de trois années intenses de R et D au centre
de recherche sur les pâtes et papiers de l'Université de la
Colombie-Britannique et à l'Institut canadien de recherches sur
les pâtes et papiers. En plus d'être appuyée par le Programme de
RCE. la recherche universitaire a bénéficié de l'appui de
Paprican, par l'entremise de ses membres en industrie. et du
Science Council of British Columbia.
<p>
Un partenaire industriel, OpTest Equipment Inc. de Hawkesbury,
en Ontario. a utilisé la recherche pour mettre au point un
analyseur prototype en moins d'un an. L'entreprise de neuf
employés aurait été normalement trop petite pour effectuer de la
recherche originale par ellemême, mais sa collaboration avec le
réseau lui a permis d'être aujourd'hui la seule entreprise
autorisée à fabriquer l'appareil et à le commercialiser dans
toutes les usines de papier au monde.

<title>DU PAPIER PLUS RÉSISTANT GRÂCE À LA VAPEUR SURCHAUFFÉE</title>
<h2>Du papier plus résistant grâce à la vapeur surchauffée</h2>
<p>
Une technique de séchage à la vapeur surchauffée pourrait
améliorer considérablement la qualité du papier, selon des
chercheurs du Réseau sur les pâtes mécaniques et
chimicomécaniques. Dirigée par le professeur Murray Douglas, de
l'Université McGill, une équipe d'étudiants et d'associés de
recherche a en effet découvert que ce procédé révolutionnaire de
séchage à des températures pouvant atteindre jusqu'à 450 degrés
centigrades produit du papier beaucoup plus résistant.
<p>
L'utilisation de la vapeur surchauffée pourrait également
permettre d'économiser de l'énergie et de réduire les coûts.  En
effet, il faut dix fois moins de temps pour sécher du papier
Journal à la vapeur surchauffée qu'avec les technologies
courantes. «Ce procédé pourrait avoir un rendement énergétique
élevé car, contrairement aux méthodes de séchage
traditionnelles, la vapeur est recyclée et il n'y a aucune
évacuation d'air chaud et humide, explique le professeur
Douglas. Nos premiers résultats révèlent que ce procédé améliore
la qualité du papier et pourrait permettre de réduire
considérablement la dimension des installations de séchage de
papier.  Une installation de séchage typique nécessite
actuellement une superficie de la dimension d'un terrain de
football pour loger une cinquantaine de gros cylindres
chauffants qui sèchent une feuille continue de papier humide.
<p>
Ce procédé pourrait en outre permettre de mieux utiliser la pâte
mécanique, qui est obtenue par broyage du bols. Moins chère et
moins polluante que les pâtes dérivées de l'extraction chimique
des fibres, la pâte mécanique produit toutefois du papier moins
résistant. Selon les étudiants du professeur Douglas, la vapeur
surchauffée pourrait remédier à ce problème. La température
élevée combinée à l'humidité provoque la plastification de la
lignine de bois, un polymère naturel, et contribué ainsi à
augmenter la résistance du papier.
<p>
La vapeur surchauffée est employée pour un certain nombre de
procédés industriels de séchage, mais M. Douglas tient à
préciser qu'on n'a jamais appliqué ce procédé à la fabrication
du papier. Le Réseau explore activement les applications
commerciales de cette découverte. L'Université McGill a obtenu
un brevet et s'apprête à faire breveter d'autres applications.
<p>
La production de pâtes et papiers constitue la principale
industrie manufacturière du Canada avec 12 milliards de dollars
d'exportations nettes. Le Réseau sur les pâtes mécaniques et
chimico-mécaniques travaille en étroite collaboration avec
l'institut canadien de recherche sur les pâtes et papiers
(Paprican). Grâce à cet appui appréciable de l'industrie et la
participation du gouvernement fédéral, environ 45 superviseurs
de recherche et 145 chercheurs dans 10 universités ainsi qu'un
laboratoire gouvernemental travaillent à résoudre des problèmes
techniques et scientifiques dans cinq grands domaines:
blanchiment, chromophores, fabrication de la pâte mécanique,
contrôle des procédés, et transformation de la pâte. Le
recyclage du papier journal a été récemment ajouté à ces
activités.

<title>DU PAPIER QUI NE JAUNIT PAS</title>
<h2>Du papier qui ne jaunit pas</h2>
<p>

Des chercheurs du Réseau sur les pâtes mécaniques et
chimico-mécaniques ont éclairci l'énigme du processus chimique
complexe responsable de l'un des plus graves problèmes de
l'industrie papetière le jaunissement du papier à peine quelques
semaines après sa fabrication. Cette percée devrait contribuer à
améliorer les papiers de qualité inférieure et à accroître la
compétitivité de l'industrie canadienne qui pourra produire des
pâtes mécaniques pour une gamme élargie de papiers de qualité
supérieure.
<p>
Les chercheurs industriels et universitaires spécialisés en
chimie du bois se heurtent au problème du jaunissement depuis
plus de 40 ans. Jeffrey Wan, un chercheur du Réseau rattaché à
l'Université Queen's, a abordé le problème sous un angle nouveau
dans ses travaux sur le comportement des radicaux libres, des
groupes d'atomes en général très réactifs. Dans le traitement
des pâtes et papiers, ces radicaux libres subsistent souvent
dans le produit fini, où ils interagissent avec la lumière et
font jaunir le papier blanc.
<p>
Appelée réversion, cette réaction chimique inverse l'effet du
blanchiment qui vise à rendre la pâte de bols aussi blanche que
possible. Les recherches antérieures portaient surtout sur les
façons de traiter le papier pour contrer la réversion. Le
professeur Wan et son équipe de chercheurs à Queen's ont
découvert qu'une technique de blanchiment plus globale rendrait
la réversion à toutes fins utiles impossible.
<p>
C'est en cherchant la cause du jaunissement que M. Wan a
découvert comment le blanchiment produit à la fois de «bons»
radicaux, qui préservent l'intégrité du papier. et de «mauvais»
radicaux, qui entraînent le jaunissement. Il a constaté qu'un
traitement postérieur au blanchiment devrait maximiser les bons
radicaux et éliminer les mauvais. L'équipe a ainsi mis au point
un système de traitement qui protège le papier contre les
radicaux provoquant le jaunissement, tout en préservant ceux qui
peuvent corriger tout jaunissement éventuel. Le système,
maintenant breveté, a été surnommé «mécanisme P-C» (protection-
correction).
<p>
C'est là une étape importante vers l'élargissement du marché des
pâte mécaniques qui constitue actuellement la base de
l'industrie canadienne du papier journal, dont l'importance
économique est capitale. Ce procédé a en outre l'avantage d'être
sans danger pour l'environnement. Contrairement aux procédés de
traitement des pâtes chimiques qui nécessitent le recours à des
produits chimiques pour décomposer le bols en fibres, la
fabrication mécanique consiste en grande partie à broyer le bois
pour en obtenir les composantes de base. Ce procédé est moins
coûteux et moins polluant, mais le problème du jaunissement en a
jusqu'à présent limité le marché potentiel.
<p>
«Grâce» au Réseau, nous avons pu entrer en contact avec les
chercheurs qui sont à l'avantgarde des techniques importantes,
non seulement en matière de machinerie, mais aussi de «chimie
spécialisée», souligne l'un des chercheurs industriels du
Réseau, John Schmidt, de l'institut canadien des pâtes et
papiers, qui a travaillé à la technologie du blanchiment.
<p>
La production des pâtes et papiers est l'une des industries
manufacturières les plus importantes du Canada. Elle représente
approximativement 12 milliards de dollars en exportations
nettes, soit à peu près l'équivalent des exportations des
industries des mines, du pétrole, de l'électricité et des pêches
combinées. L'industrie, des pâtes et papiers représente la
presque totalité de la balance commerciale nette du Canada.

<title>Un partenariat unique en neurosociences </title>

<h2>Un partenariat unique en neurosociences</h2> 

<p>Du fait de son importance et de sa renommée à l’échelle
mondiale, le secteur canadien de la recherche en neurologie
s’est acquis la confiance des investisseurs du milieu des
affaires.  Lancé en septembre dernier par la Banque Royale, la
Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec et MDS Health
Ventures, Neuroscience Partners appuiera la mise au point et la
commercialisation de médicaments et de dispositifs pour le 
traitement de nombreux troubles neurologiques. Ce nouveau
partenariat dispose d’un capital initial de 52,5 millions de
dollars en plus d’engagements de 22,5 millions de dollars si les investisseurs 
décident d’ajouter une nouvelle tranche de 52,5 millions de
dollars au capital initial. Neuroscience Partners est administré
par MDS Ventures Inc., une société affiliée de MDS Health Group
Limited, la plus importante entreprise spécialisée en sciences biologiques et de
la santé au Canada.  Parmi les autres partenaires, mentionnons la
Compagnie d’Assurance-Vie Manufacturers, les caisses de retraite
d’Hydro-Ontario et des enseignants du Manitoba et la Société
Innovatech du Grand Montréal. 

<p>Les diverses capacités de recherche de pointe réunies sous
l’égide du Réseau NeuroSciences du Programme de RCE ont été un
facteur décisif de la mise sur pied de ce partenariat novateur.
Le Réseau Neurosciences réunit 125 chercheurs de 18 universités
et instituts de recherche canadiens qui poursuivent des travaux
dans des domaines clés des sciences neurologiques. Le réseau
aidera le partenariat à identifier des occasions de développer
et de commercialiser les percées canadiennes pour le traitement
de divers troubles neurologiques du cerveau et du système
nerveux central.  Mentionnons à titre d’exemple l’apoplexie,
l’épilepsie, la schizophrénie, la maladie d’Alzheimer, la
dépression, la maladie de Parkinson, les accidents cérébraux et
traumatismes de la moelle épinière, la sclérose en plaques et la
sclérose latérale amyotrophique (maladie de Lou Gehrig). Au
Canada seulement, les troubles neurologiques absorbent 30 % du
budget des soins de santé et environ deux millions de personnes
sont atteintes de maladies cérébrales.  

<p>" Il est important de développer une industrie canadienne capable 
d’appuyer la recherche en sciences neurologiques, en plus du 
financement que ce secteur attire, explique Warren Bull,
directeur administratif du Réseau.  Ce partenariat nous donne
une véritable occasion d’inciter nos chercheurs à demeurer au Canada et de 
développer des produits canadiens issus de la recherche de
pointe en neurosciences. "

<title>Point de vue d'un jeune chercheur</title>

<h2>Point de vue d'un jeune chercheur</h2>

<p>Ce n’est pas parce qu’il a reçu deux années consécutives une
bourse connexe à ses travaux au sein d’un réseau qu’Alain
Berinstain, étudiant aux cycles supérieurs à l’Université
d’Ottawa, manifeste un tel enthousiasme envers le Programme de
RCE.  Les cinq années d’expérience acquise dans le cadre de sa
participation à un réseau valent, à son avis, leur pesant d’or.

<p>" Les cinq années de travaux de recherche pour le compte du
réseau, raconte-t-il, m’ont permis d’approfondir les rapports
professionnels que j’ai établis avec d’autres membres du réseau
dans tout le Canada.  Nous nous vouons mutuellement un grand
respect et, grâce au réseau, j’ai pu pénétrer au sein de la
communauté scientifique et industrielle canadienne, ce qui, dans
d’autres circonstances, aurait été difficilement possible. 
Grâce à ces nouveaux contacts, je me sens confiant quant à mon
avenir dans le domaine. Étant sur le point d’obtenir mon
doctorat, je profite de cette occasion pour remercier tous les
membres du réseau avec qui j’ai eu l’occasion de travailler au
cours de cette période. " 

<p>Chercheur du Réseau sur les pâtes chimiques et
chimico-mécaniques, M. Berinstain s’est mérité deux fois en deux
ans l’une des quatre bourses Du Pont-Paprican décernées annuellement à des
étudiants exceptionnels des 2e et 3e cycles dans l’un des douze
centres d’excellence du Réseau.  Sur le point d’obtenir son 
doctorat, il considère que son expérience au sein du réseau a eu
une influence considérable sur sa formation professionnelle. 
Les travaux effectués par M. Berinstain, sous la direction de
Juan C. Scaiano, un chercheur principal du réseau, ont porté sur
l’un des principaux objectifs du réseau : étudier la nature des
changements provoqués par la lumière sur le papier fabriqué à
partir de pâtes mécaniques.  " Nous nous servons du laser pour
étudier comment le papier réagit à la lumière dans le but de
déterminer ce qui cause le jaunissement, a précisé 
M. Berinstain.  Durant la Phase I, nous avons fait d’énormes
progrès dans la compréhension de ce phénomène et maintenant,
durant la Phase II, nous cherchons à appliquer les connaissances
que nous avons acquises pour freiner le processus de
jaunissement.  D’ici à la fin de la Phase II, nous devrions être
près de notre but.  Tous ces progrès, nous les devons au soutien
que nous fournit le réseau. "

<title>Lueur d’espoir pour les victimes de la fibrose kystique</title>

<h2>Lueur d’espoir pour les victimes de la fibrose kystique</h2>

<p>Une nouvelle approche à la chimie complexe des protéines mise au
point par une équipe d’Inspiraplex, le réseau en santé
respiratoire, pourrait ouvrir la voie à une nouvelle thérapie
pour le traitement de la fibrose kystique.

<p>Ce projet a vu le jour alors que les chercheurs du réseau
étudiaient les mécanismes qui empêchent les cellules pulmonaires
d’éliminer l’accumulation fatale de mucus dans les voies
respiratoires des personnes atteintes de fibrose kystique.
L’équipe a découvert que certains composés chimiques pouvaient
inhiber des enzymes appelées phosphatases, ce qui permettrait de
maintenir les canaux des cellules pulmonaires ouverts de façon
que l’organisme libère l’eau et les sels nécessaires pour
déloger le mucus accumulé dans les voies respiratoires.  Ces
enzymes sont des sortes de soupapes qui interviennent dans des
processus chimiques complexes appelés phosphorylisation et déphosphorylisation qui
ouvrent et ferment respectivement les canaux des cellules
pulmonaires et contrôlent le flux d’ions chlorures. Les problèmes associés à la
fibrose kystique surviennent lorsque ce canal protéique, appelé
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),
demeure fermé. 

<p>" L’équilibre entre la phosphorylisation et la
déphosphorylisation détermine l’activité du canal CFTR ", a
expliqué le Dr John Hanrahan, physiologiste à l’Université
McGill et chercheur du réseau. Alors qu’ils étudiaient le
fonctionnement du CFTR, le Dr Hanrahan et ses collègues du
réseau ont remarqué que les inhibiteurs de la
déphosphorylisation ouvraient les canaux, qu’il y ait ou non
présence de fibrose kystique. " Nous étions très surpris de
découvrir que des canaux normaux, tout comme des canaux ayant
subi des mutations causées par la maladie, s’ouvrent quand les
cellules sont exposées à ces inhibiteurs enzymatiques ", a
expliqué le Dr Hanrahan. 

<p>Ce type d’inhibiteurs se retrouve déjà sous forme de médicaments
capables de renforcer le système immunitaire. La récente
découverte de l’équipe d’Inspiraplex pourrait s’avérer la clé de
la mise au point d’un traitement efficace de la fibrose
kystique. Par ailleurs, Inspiraplex et l’Université McGill ont
déposé une demande de brevet pour ces composés, qui suscitent
également l’intérêt de partenaires potentiels de 
l’industrie pharmaceutique.

<H1><FONT COLOR="#000000">Working for Canadians</FONT></H1>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Federal Networks of Centres of
Excellence</FONT></H2>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">They began as an experiment to increase
the effectiveness and productivity of Canada's world-class research
and development. They've become a model for optimizing S&amp;T
resources. </FONT></I></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Invaluable partners in Canada's S&amp;T
Strategy</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In all sectors of a knowledge-based economy,
the ability to innovate-in products, in processes and in service
delivery-is a major factor in creating prosperity and contributing to
the quality of life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Canada's innovation capability depends on
the synergy that results when the best researchers in the nation's
universities, government laboratories and private-sector firms
collaborate to identify and drive projects that meet economic and
social needs and goals. The Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE)
program responds to this challenge.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Innovation equals growth and jobs</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Canada's scientists and engineers have
brought Canadian research and technology to the forefront of
international science in many disciplines. But to exploit these
opportunities in today's highly competitive international markets, we
must have mechanisms for bringing industry into the system at an
earlier stage of the innovation cycle. That's what the NCEs were set
up to do.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Canada's Networks of Centres of Excellence
are a unique approach to the management and enhancement of national
S&amp;T resources. The NCE program demonstrates that Canadians'
investment in our public- and private-sector S&amp;T activities and
infrastructure can be optimized by focusing our collective wisdom in
nationwide networks concentrating on strategic Canadian
priorities.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Formulated for success</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">NCEs link Canada's centres of scientific and
engineering expertise, whether in adjacent cities or in widely
separated provinces, into networks of public- and private-sector
research communities that share R&amp;D goals and resources.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Each Network:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">is a dynamic partnership involving
   universities, industries and government, each contributing vision,
   direction, ideas, expertise and financial support;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">is run like a corporation-each is
   managed by a Board of Directors composed of senior executives of
   companies, university officials, financial experts, researchers
   and research managers, technology-transfer experts and others who
   actively contribute to the research and business direction of the
   network; and</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">trains Canada's upcoming generation of
   scientists, engineers, S&amp;T managers and knowledge
   entrepreneurs by making them full research team participants who
   work side-by-side with the network's top researchers and its
   partners.</FONT>
</UL>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Getting on with business</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For 10 NCEs, 1995 marked their sixth year in
business: time enough to confirm that the exciting premise that led
to the NCE system was not only valid, but prescient. The premise?
That bringing public- and private-sector partners together to
identify and collaborate on priorities and goals will accelerate the
development and application of technologies to benefit the country
and enhance Canadians' lives. This annual report describes the
significant impact of that vision and introduces the four new
networks that began operation this year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Canadians would be the first to agree with
the United Nations' report that Canada is one of the best countries
in the world in which to live. But they would also agree that, if we
are to maintain that enviable standard of living, we can no longer
depend solely on our natural resources. We must exploit another
Canadian resource-the wealth of scientific expertise and creativity
that has given us our international reputation for research
excellence. .</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dynamic S&amp;T priority-setting on a
national scale</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In planning their research agendas, NCEs
keep Canada's national S&amp;T priorities firmly in mind by:</FONT>

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Together with their partners, they
consolidate a vision of the future and develop concerted research
activities that ensure the vision is realized.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The NCEs are well placed to meet these
goals, since the fields in which they specialize will contribute
economic benefits and improved quality of life through so many
spheres: environmental protection, sustainable development, new
materials research, telecommunications and technology-based learning,
robotics, and health-related research in such areas as genetics,
bacterial diseases and neuroscience.</FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the NCEs have evolved, so have their
partnerships: some have now begun to partner not only within their
own networks, but with other networks. These extended collaborations
mean that Canadian taxpayers are getting an enhanced return on the

New Markets and New Jobs</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Micronet research has led to two independent
spin-off companies that will provide jobs and technologies for the
future of the Canadian economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Vinod Agarwal of McGill University is the
founder and president of a start-up venture called LV Software (LVS),
which has offices in Montreal, Ottawa and San Jose, California. LVS
develops and markets test automation products. Its recently launched
product, ASICtest, grew out of Dr. Agarwal's testability research and
was partially funded by Micronet and Bell-Northern Research (now
Nortel Technology). ASICtest is a front-end design and analysis tool
that can implement built-in-self-test (BIST) for integrated
circuits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Another Micronet spin-off company, Cadabra
Design Libraries Inc., is commercializing some of the Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) tools developed partially through Micronet funding.
Founded by Professor Martin Lefebvre of Carleton University, Cadabra
employs three full-time software developers and is based in Nepean,
Ontario. The company's first product is a layout synthesis tool that
allows better utilization of existing technologies in the design of
integrated circuits, resulting in more competitive products.
Professor Lefebvre says discussions with Micronet private-sector
partners were instrumental in providing him with industry awareness
and the impetus for starting the company.</FONT></P>

Exploring New Markets</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One of the major goals of the Mechanical
Wood-Pulps Network is to open new markets for mechanical pulps.
Mechanical pulps result from a process of grinding wood chips between
large metal plates rather than from chemical processing. Mechanical
or high-yield pulps retain more of the original wood fibre compared
with chemical processed pulps, but are more prone to yellowing. For
this reason, mechanical pulps are used mostly for low-grade papers
such as newsprint, advertising flyers and tissue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The network has made major progress in
finding higher value-added uses for the pulps. With active
participation from private-sector partners Clariant Corp., DuPont
Canada, Health Canada, MacMillan Bloedel, and National Silicates, the
focus is on ways to overcome the major problem of yellowing in
mechanical pulps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A research group led by Dr. J.K.S. Wan at
Queen's University has been issued a patent on a polymer additive
(polyethylene glycol thiolactate) that renders paper stable to light
for a year. Work is continuing with Clariant Corp. to commercialize
the technology and make it economical on a large scale. Full-scale
mill trials are scheduled for this summer. This development will
allow the use of mechanical pulps in value-added products such as
printing papers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Researchers at the University of Ottawa, led
by Dr. J.C. Scaiano, have found that clay fillers and additives
commonly used in papermaking also inhibit yellowing. Lab work
indicates that the yellowing mechanism can be limited sufficiently in
this way to make mechanical pulps suitable for printing
papers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dr. A.R.P. van Heiningen at the University
of New Brunswick has modified an existing process, using an improved
chemical technique to remove metallic ions from pulp, which in turn
reduces yellowing. Pilot mill trials are also under way for this
research. And two researchers at Paprican (Pulp and Paper Research
Institute of Canada), Dr. Cyril Heitner and Dr. John Schmidt, working
with Network Executive Director Dr. Gordon Leary, have discovered
that adding antioxidants to the pulp inhibits brightness loss.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This concerted national effort has led to
significant advances that could save millions of dollars a year by
reducing the bleaching used in paper production and improving the
recycling process. At the same time, mechanical pulps will become
more attractive to papermakers around the world, especially in the
United States, thus expanding the markets for Canadian
producers.</FONT></P>

Partnerships Lead to World-Class Ventures</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Two networks, the Canadian Genetic Diseases
Network (CGDN) and the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBDN),
have combined forces with a private-sector partner, SCIEX, and the
University of Alberta to develop new DNA sequencing technology and
software.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SCIEX is Canada's premiere analytical
instrumentation manufacturer, and a division of MDS Health Group
Ltd., Canada's largest technology-based health and life sciences
company.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"SCIEX is very pleased to collaborate with
the CBDN and CGDN," says Bill Davidson, Director of R&amp;D. "Under
this agreement, the networks are providing us with a
multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral approach to research, and a very
effective use of our research dollars."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Building on basic research sponsored by the
NCE, NSERC and the U.S. Department of Energy Human Genome Program,
the technology will permit the rapid characterization of genes
involved in bacterial and genetic diseases.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"This software provides roughly a fiftyfold
increase in the amount of DNA that can be sequenced, compared with
current state-of-the-art equipment," says Dr. Dovichi. "Given the two
million to six million nucleotide pairs (units) in the DNA of the
average bacterial pathogen, and the four billion units in the human
chromosome, such an increase in speed is essential."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A patent has been awarded by the U.S. Patent
Office, and prototypes of the advanced instrumentation are already
operational. The instrumentation, when available, will be employed in
universities, hospitals and biopharmaceutical companies
worldwide.</FONT></P>

Advanced Therapies</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CBDN industry partner SYNSORB Biotech Inc.
has continued to develop, and is in Phase III clinical trials with
SYNSORB-Pk, a novel treatment for haemolytic uraemic syndrome
(HUS)-also known as "hamburger disease."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This exciting therapeutic application is
intended to prevent life-threatening complications of HUS. HUS is
usually contracted by children exposed to particular strains of
Escherichia coli bacteria found in some ground beef or unpasteurized
milk products sold in Canada. Complications include kidney failure,
neurological damage and occasionally death. Children and the elderly
are particularly prone to these complications, for which there is no
effective treatment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"SYNSORB-Pk is an entirely new concept in
human therapeutics," says Dr. Brad Thompson, President and CEO of
SYNSORB Biotech Inc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SYNSORB-Pk was developed entirely within the
first phase of CBDN in the laboratory of Dr. Glen Armstrong at the
University of Alberta and Dr. Murray Ratcliffe (formerly of
Chembiomed Ltd.), building on basic technology of Dr. Raymond
Lemieux, also of the U of A. Development from concept to clinical
trials took place in just three years, thanks to cooperation with the
Canadian Pediatric Kidney Disease Reference Centre (CPKDRC) and the
Alberta Research Council (ARC). The technology has been patented by
Chembiomed Ltd. of Edmonton (a biotechnology company absorbed by ARC
in 1991). It is now licensed to SYNSORB Biotech Inc.
(Calgary).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SYNSORB Biotech Inc. was formed in 1994 and
is based partly on this unique CBDN technology. The company continues
to support CBDN research projects and to license new therapeutic
leads that result.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">With SYNSORB-Pk as its lead product, SYNSORB
Biotech Inc. is developing, and plans to market, a number of products
designed to treat bacterial infections of the gastroenteric
tract.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Building on the establishment of the
Neuroscience Partners Fund in 1994, which has met its initial goal of
raising $52.5 million in seed capital from the private sector, the
network is forming new partnerships with industry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Allelix Biopharmaceuticals, an existing
Toronto company, has set up a neuroscience division with a $6 million
boost from the Neuroscience Partners Fund and other investments
through its strategic alliances. As planned, the network and Allelix
are developing the terms for a "special partnership arrangement"
making Allelix the commercial receptor for specific network
technologies. The division will include research from three network
projects from three of the network's partner institutions with the
expectation that each will lead to commercially viable products with
therapeutic applications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A second venture, Neuromotion Inc. of
Edmonton, was formed around the medical devices products and
technologies developed by network investigators at the University of
Alberta. The company will focus on leading-edge technologies in
functional electrical stimulation (FES), which helps restore motor
and sensory functions after nerve damage. The Neuroscience Partners
Fund and the Alberta Heritage Medical Research Foundation have
invested a total of $1.25 million. The next round of financing for
later this year is expected to raise at least $2 million. Neuromotion
also will serve as the receptor organization for commercializing
certain Network technologies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Other new businesses are also being planned
around the expertise and technologies of the network. In addition,
the Neuroscience Partners Fund has made selected investments in
existing neuroscience companies, some of which are establishing
subsidiaries in Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As a result of the NeuroScience Network's
vision and commitment, Canada will have a homegrown CNS neuroscience
industry to create jobs and wealth, and develop neuroscience research
into products and therapies-in short, to be the receptor for our
world-class neuroscience research.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Pamela Renton is already a successful
research entrepreneur, even though she has just completed her
master's degree in mechanical engineering at McMaster University. She
has landed her first job with a Canadian robotics company, and she
knows her experience in the IRIS-subsidized student work-term program
gave her an advantage in the competition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ms. Renton spent a year working at NRC's
Institute for Information Technology as part of a team developing
software for "Range Vision for Telerobotic Control in Hazardous
Environments." The project involved AECL, SPAR Aerospace, NRC, the
Canadian Space Agency and PRECARN Associates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Under IRIS's Integrated Systems in Dynamic
Environments (ISDE) theme, this project's goal was to mount a
proof-of-concept demonstration highlighting the application of
Canadian telerobotics technology to hazardous site remediation-a
direct application of Ms. Renton's thesis research. She is now
putting her IRIS experience and her master's training to work for CRS
Robotics in Burlington, Ontario.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"When you read through job descriptions, you
come across all sorts of acronyms for specialized skills or
technologies," says Ms. Renton. "Now, for many of them, I can say
'I've done that.' The work has been a great opportunity to increase
my skills and learn new technologies."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Not only was Ms. Renton able to see the
application of her training in a real-world solution, but her
advanced education at McMaster was valuable to the research partners,
helping to cement the link between students and the research and
industry establishments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">During the 18 months of Phase II, IRIS has
supported 91 graduate students within network projects. Of those, 51
have gone on to jobs in Canadian industry. In addition, the network
employs 75 research engineers and 46 postdoctoral fellows.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The dedication of IRIS members in
establishing the work-term program, encouraging companies to hire

Stopping the "Brain Drain" from Canada</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Many people have lamented the "brain drain"
of highly qualified personnel to well-paying jobs in the United
States. Edmonton's Dr. David Wishart is a prime example of how PENCE
is helping to reverse this trend. Dr. Wishart's internship with PENCE
is directly responsible for his decision to stay in Canada.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dr. Wishart completed his training in PENCE
laboratories in 1995, accepted the Bristol-Myers Squibb Chair of
Pharmacy at the University of Alberta, and in July became a
participating scientist in PENCE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A critical factor in Dr. Wishart's decision
to turn down lucrative offers from the States was the opportunity to
develop his entrepreneurial skills through a new company, BioTools
Inc., of Edmonton, founded by Dr. Wishart and PENCE researchers Brian
Sykes, Jonathan Schaeffer and Duane Szafron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">BioTools has contracted seven people to
commercialize time-saving bioinformatics software tools developed in
PENCE and licensed from the University of Alberta. BioTools' products
are designed to help biotechnology companies and laboratories access
and organize massive amounts of protein-sequenced and structural
data, which are essential to progress rapidly in discovering the
structure of proteins. Given the high costs of pharmaceutical
companies' drug screening programs, knowledge of the molecular
structure of the target protein or its active site sequence is an
essential ingredient in a successful drug screening program.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Currently more than 75 graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows contribute to PENCE projects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"I strongly believe in this uniquely
Canadian way of creating knowledge-based industry for now and the
next century by maximizing the efforts and resources of a large group
of scientists and entrepreneurs," says Dr. Robert S. Hodges, Network
Leader, University of Alberta. "My thanks go to all those individuals
who are helping to make this vision a reality."</FONT></P>

Dramatic New Developments in Alzheimer's Disease Research</FONT>
</H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">An international team of scientists led by
CGDN's Dr. Peter St George-Hyslop at the University of Toronto's
Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases has discovered and
cloned two genes responsible for early-onset Alzheimer's disease, the
disease's most severe form.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alzheimer's affects more than 250,000
Canadians. There are few treatments and no cure. Early-onset
Alzheimer's is an extremely aggressive form, affecting individuals
aged 30 to 60 and progressing faster than the more common forms,
which strike at about age 65. Most victims of early-onset Alzheimer's
die within 10 years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The U of T team's discovery has offered new
hope for Alzheimer's sufferers, and caused a sensation around the
world. Their findings were published in the June 29 and August 31,
1995, issues of Britain's prestigious scientific journal
Nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The team found the first gene on chromosome
14, by employing a specialized gene isolation technique-developed
with CGDN's Dr. Johanna Rommens of Toronto's Hospital for Sick
Children. After studying 19 genes, they found one bearing the
mutations specific to people suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's.
The second homologene was located on chromosome one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The protein the genes control may provide
new ways to prevent the breakdown of brain cells that leads to the
disease's progressive memory loss and debilitation, says Dr. St
George-Hyslop. People with the gene in their family have a one-in-two
chance of inheriting it. The discovery of the two genes means a
simple diagnostic test can now be developed for early-onset
Alzheimer's.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CGDN investigators Drs. St George-Hyslop and
Rommens are collaborating with other network investigators at the U
of T, the Hospital for Sick Children, McMaster University, and UBC to
probe the exact causes of Alzheimer's disease.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"The network's continuing commitment,
together with the support of network core technology facilities and
collaborations across Canada, are crucial to the rapid progress of
Dr. St George-Hyslop's work towards improved diagnostics, and
ultimately new therapies, for this disease," says CGDN Scientific
Director Dr. Michael Hayden.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Funding for this research was provided by
CGDN, the Alzheimer's Association of Ontario, and private donors such
as philanthropist Mark Tanz.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The University of Toronto and Hospital for
Sick Children, along with CGDN management in Vancouver, have joined
forces as a business unit to commercialize the discoveries. A major
multi-year R&amp;D program with a private-sector partner is envisaged
to maintain Canada's lead in this important neurodegenerative disease
area.</FONT></P>

Keeping Canada at the Forefront of Technology</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A demonstration project under way in CITR's
Photonic Devices and Systems' Project marries the properties of
lasers with electronics technology in a dramatic innovation that may
break down the barriers to designing computers 100 times faster than
those we use today.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Current home and office computers contain a
single microprocessor that can carry out approximately 100,000,000
basic instructions every second. System designers dream of adding as
many as 100 more such processors. If they could be interconnected
reliably, their combined power could increase processing capabilities
by a factor of 100.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CITR's approach is to change the way in
which the microprocessors are interconnected by using "optical
backplane technology." "Optical" refers to technology that uses light
(in this case generated by lasers), and "backplane" refers to the
wiring system that connects the microprocessors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The advantages of laser light connections
are many: they take up less room on the backplane and can transmit
information at much higher speeds than electrical connections. Just
as a camera image must be kept from blurring through movement, the
laser connections must remain stable and reliable every time they are
made, regardless of exterior stress to the computer from the wear and
tear of day-to-day use.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To solve such problems, the network has
assembled multidisciplinary teams of government, university and
private-sector researchers who are collaborating on various aspects
of the project. This year, researchers from NRC, &Eacute;cole
Polytechnique and the University of Toronto are joining the team
initially made up of researchers from McGill, McMaster and TRLabs.
The McGill team recently completed its third optical backplane
demonstration system. Nortel Technology, formerly BNR Ltd., has been
an integral part of this project.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CITR's Photonic Devices and Systems Project
is one of six major projects in telecommunications technologies.
These projects include broadband wireless communications, mobile and
personal communications systems, ATM networks, Broadband Services and
Broadband Satellite Communications.</FONT></P>

Reduced Health Care Costs</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Respiratory diseases are the third most
expensive in Canada, after cardiovascular diseases and mental
disorders. The cost to Canadian health care is estimated at over $2
billion a year (1986 figures). In North America, more than 20 million
people suffer from one form of respiratory disease-obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sleep apnea is a condition in which
sufferers, without knowing it, stop breathing many times during the
night. Episodes can occur hundreds of times in one night, depriving
the person of rest and oxygen. Patients wake up feeling tired, often
with a headache, and are prone to driving and workplace accidents.
They can also experience severe mood swings, inability to
concentrate, heart disease and, in rare cases, death.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Inspiraplex researcher Dr. Alan Lowe of the
University of British Columbia has addressed this problem by
developing a novel invention that keeps the airway open without the
side effects of other appliances. The Klearwaytm device is a plastic
mouthpiece that pushes the lower jaw forward and keeps the teeth
together, preventing the tongue from blocking the airway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Inspiraplex researchers Drs. Lowe, J.
Remmers, K. Ferguson and J. Fleetham are conducting the first
randomized controlled clinical trial of this treatment for
OSA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Confidence in Klearwaytm is riding high, as
initial tests found it to be effective with up to 90 percent of
snorers and 70 percent of OSA patients. The device has been licensed
from UBC for marketing in Canada by Space Maintainers, and worldwide
by Great Lakes Orthodontics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In a related development, Inspiraplex
researchers unveiled details in September of a method of home
diagnosis for sleep apnea. The existing "gold standard" involves
spending the night in a sleep laboratory. As health care budgets are
cut back, home diagnosis of sleep apnea could save money and improve
the quality of life for patients in the same way day surgery and home
care have for other health problems.</FONT></P>

Canadian Expertise in Demand</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When the California State Division of Safety
of Dams discovered that the Littlerock Dam in Southern California did
not meet seismic safety standards, the State turned to Concrete
Canada for advice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Network researcher Dr. D.R. Morgan of AGRA
Earth &amp; Environmental Ltd. (AEE) in Burnaby, B.C., was called in
to help bolster the dam, which sits just south of the San Andreas
fault. One of two major retrofits needed to make the dam safe was a
layer of high-performance shotcrete (HPS) on the upstream face (see
photo). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dr. Morgan is leading a team of researchers
in Concrete Canada working on HPS, and was able to bring the latest
state-of-the-art technology to the Littlerock Dam Project. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The HPS mixture was achieved using a Ready
Mix supplied air entrained (contains air bubbles to allow for the
expansion of water in concrete during freezing) steel-fibre
reinforced, silica fume, wet-mix shotcrete. This HPS is more durable
than conventional concrete and less permeable to water and other
chemical agents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The challenge of the project was to develop
and enforce a rigid construction and curing (drying) system that
would provide a strongly adhering and essentially crack-free
shotcrete overlay on the existing concrete. Dr. Morgan's expertise
was critical, as the rigorous curing implementation was crucial and
was carried out in a severe desert climate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dr. Morgan is one of dozens of Concrete
Canada experts and companies supplying high-performance concrete
(HPC) knowledge and materials to high-profile projects like the
Hibernia offshore drilling platform and the PEI fixed link, as well
as to customers around the world (see box).</FONT></P>

Designed for a Unique Canadian Need</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The TeleLearning Research Network's
(TL-RN's) largest laboratory is Baffin Island-all 507,451 square
kilometres of it! The island represents just about every challenge
CSILE, one of TL-RN's four "beacon technologies," could possibly have
to overcome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CSILE, or Computer Supported Intentional
Learning Environments, is an innovative technology and a new approach
to learning. It is a networked system built around a hypermedia
database that is constructed cooperatively by learners. The purpose
of CSILE is to make learning collaborative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"A CSILE database is empty until a problem
is defined and students begin their investigation," explains Sandy
McAuley, an educator with the Baffin Divisional Board of Education
and a graduate of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education
(OISE), where CSILE development began in 1986.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To a system like CSILE, Baffin Island's
geographic and demographic realities are no hurdle: 3,800 students in
15 small communities spread out over nearly three quarters of a
million square kilometres of tundra, mountains and ice are easily
linked through computer networking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"When I was on leave at OISE, I saw CSILE
and realized that it offered the technological base we needed," says
Mr. McAuley. "CSILE lends itself to the exploration of issues that
are relevant to Baffin Island students. The curriculum validates
local culture and draws upon local resources."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">OISE's Dr. Marlene Scardamalia, TL-RN's
Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education Theme Leader, says CSILE was
immediately adopted by the Inuit students. "It was enchanting to see
the students take ownership of this technology. They interviewed
their elders and wrote about race and rare languages, creating
valuable records."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One of the four new members of the NCEs,
TL-RN has 55 research projects under way involving 32 research
organizations and 20 private-sector supporters. TL-RN projects are
organized around four beacon technologies: CSILE, TELEFORM (tools for
delivering telelearning to the workplace and home), VIRTUAL-U
(on-line learning environment for designing and delivering courses
from kindergarten to university), and CADRE (a set of design and
authoring tools and methodology for creating learning support
systems).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"TL-RN is the first initiative in the world
to link world-class researchers into a cohesive national effort to
develop advanced teaching approaches and technologies for building a
knowledge economy," says Network Leader Dr. Linda Harasim of Simon
Fraser University's School of Communications. "The Network will help
maintain Canada's reputation as a pioneer in telelearning, and
support the development, use and export of this consolidated
know-how."</FONT></P>

Intelligent Structures "Smartest" in the World</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bridges are getting pretty smart these days.
And a bridge under construction in Manitoba will be the smartest in
the world, thanks to some very clever technology being developed by
ISIS (Intelligent Sensing for Innovative Structures), one of the four
new networks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Using ISIS technology, the Province of
Manitoba is building the Headingly Bridge near Winnipeg, which is
one-half "smart" technology and one-half conventional construction.
The "smart" technology is a combination of Fibre Reinforced Plastic
(FRP) concrete and Optical Fibre Sensors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The FRP is concrete that contains carbon
fibres, encased in a plastic-like resin, to replace steel bars
normally inserted through concrete structures to add strength. Steel
corrodes when exposed to water, salt and other chemicals, but the
resin-encased carbon-fibre-reinforced FRP does not corrode and is 20
percent lighter than steel, 10 times stronger and lasts
longer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Headingly Bridge will be divided right
down the middle so that the Manitoba Department of Highways, which
has put over $250,000 into the project, can study how the side made
with FRP stands up to the elements compared with the regular
reinforced concrete.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Optical Fibre Sensors will be integrated
like a system of nerves into the bridge. The Headingly Bridge will
have 64 sensors embedded in the FRP along its 500-foot length. The
sensors will be linked through a regular telephone line to an
engineer in a remote office who can send laser light to the sensors
via an on-site laser generator to study the condition of the
bridge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"Stresses arising from traffic loads, cold
or wind change the wavelength of the light reflections coming from
the optical sensors," explains ISIS President Dr. Sami Rizkalla, one
of the creators of the integrated intelligent structure concept.
"Back in the office, we compare these changes with our baseline
wavelengths and interpret the results."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dr. Rizkalla admits that when he and ISIS
Theme Leader Dr. Ray Measures of the University of Toronto Aerospace
Studies first discussed combining their research interests, the whole
idea seemed a little crazy. Even today, there is no other structure
in the world using this technology, but lab trials and tests on a
bridge in Calgary have demonstrated the effectiveness of the combined
sensor and fibre technologies, and now ISIS is inundated with
requests from all over the world for information about the "smart"
structures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The FRP material will be used in several
projects in Manitoba to refurbish bridges that are wearing under
extra loads. ISIS predicts millions of dollars will be saved in
maintenance costs by using its long-lasting FRP and the sensors,
which eliminate expensive site maintenance visits. ISIS is also
developing a microchip that will perform the data gathering and
interpretive functions now done by a box of optoelectronics. It will
be possible to summon this sensing information from the chip via
satellite or phone lines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Under its business-oriented strategy, ISIS
has licensed the FRP technology to Wardrop Engineering, designers of
the Headingly Bridge, and many more licensing agreements are planned
for the future. Wardrop is benefiting from the interaction with both
the researchers and the students and has already hired two engineers,
one of which was a student working with Dr. Rizkalla. Overall, ISIS
has over 40 students and researchers working at 11 universities and
dozens of industry partners.</FONT></P>

Health Care Goes On-line</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The future of health care delivery and
management is going to be information technology-based, and the NCE's
new Health Evidence and Application Network (HEALNet) is working to
keep Canadian health care at the forefront.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Through strong partnerships with
private-sector companies, government-sponsored health research
agencies and professional organizations, HEALNet will develop
information-based tools for improving the health of Canadian workers,
productivity in the workplace, and the efficiency of the health care
system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One of four tools HEALNet is developing is a
"Clinical Information Network." The Clinical Information Network is a
computer operating system software package tailor-made for the
information needs of hospitals and other medical centres. It allows
computers in medical facilities to be linked as a local area network
(LAN) so that doctors and other health care professionals can share
information or look up stored information from medical journals or
other sources. The Clinical Information Network is a leading-edge
technology and the first product to offer a major networking shell
for clinical information in Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The system also has a built-in facility to
monitor how the software is being used, valuable for further
improvements to its services. Future versions will allow wide area
networking (WAN) so that multiple sites can share information, as
well as Internet connectivity. HEALNet's goal is to have an
information system that can be easily accessed by health care
professionals from home or lap-top computers at any location,
explains network manager Corey Wentzell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In this project, HEALNet has received
software and expertise from Microsoft Canada, as well as other
private-sector support. HEALNet plans to create an incorporated body
in the future to deal with commercial aspects of its research and
resulting products. Key partners will be offered equity stakes in
commercialized technologies in return for their support.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"Together with our partners, we will develop
tools that will ultimately improve health care in this country," says
Dr. George Browman, Scientific Leader for HEALNet at McMaster
University. "This is also a great economic opportunity that will
inevitably help private-sector partners produce commercially viable
medical products and services and ultimately reduce health care costs
for Canadians."</FONT></P>

<HR>
Maintaining Canada's Forests</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As one of the world's leading exporters of
wood products, Canada faces global concerns for sustainable forest
management, which may affect its forest trade. Protecting forests
while maintaining our nation's forest-based economy is the prime
objective of the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Network, one of
the four new NCEs. With $20 million in grants and partner
contributions over four years, SFM's 100 researchers at 23
universities will conduct research in forest management, from
silviculture and animal ecology to mechanical processes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Canada's northern-most harvestable forests,
boreal forests, are a delicate ecosystem and a summer home for over a
hundred migratory songbird species. Because of their more northern
location, boreal forests have a short growing season; they are slow
to regenerate and have a less diverse selection of tree species
compared to more temperate forests. Canada's is one of the last
undisturbed boreal forest areas in the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Economic activity in these forests must be
undertaken with great care. Under its four themes, SFM is conducting
research to ensure that sustainable development is carried out using
the latest environmentally friendly forest technologies and
management systems. In the Province of Alberta, five SFM members are
included on the Alberta Forest Management Science Council, which
advises the provincial government on policies to protect forest
ecosystems. The Government of Alberta is a strong supporter of the
network and recently announced a $3.2 million cash investment in the
SFM Network over the next three years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SFM's themes cover forest ecosystem studies
and the impact of human activities on forests; the socio-economic
impacts of human activities on forests; and advanced mechanical
processes of forestry, including energy and waste management. A
fourth theme integrates the three others to formulate policies and
practices for sustainable forest management.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Central to this research is the creation of
a comprehensive and scientifically credible database of ecological
information on the whole boreal forest, something that has never been
compiled in Canada. The information will be collected at core
research sites and combined with data gathered from across the
country.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#000000">Preparing the Next Generation of S&amp;T
Expertise: Canada's New Knowledge Entrepreneurs</FONT></H2>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">In a 1994 Conference Board of Canada
survey, 24% of the companies that conduct R&amp;D in Canada reported
that they expect to face a shortage of highly qualified personnel
over the next five years.</FONT></I></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Encouraging the development of knowledge
entrepreneurs</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Canada's innovation system requires a new
type of scientist and engineer: the knowledge entrepreneur. Not only
do graduates need an excellent grounding in their scientific or
engineering discipline, they also need management skills, an
awareness of economic priorities, and an understanding of the demands
and constraints of the industrial S&amp;T environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">NCEs provide students with on-the-job
experience that adds an industrial perspective to their academic
training. Whether they eventually choose academic or industrial
careers, graduates who have worked on NCE projects bring to their
employers a unique combination of skills. If they work in publicly
funded research institutions, they bring a realistic appreciation for
industry's needs and its receptor capacity; if they work in industry,
they bring a network of research contacts to their
environment.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">NCE graduates enjoy high placement
rates</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Graduates with NCE experience have no
trouble finding employment. Most report choosing from several offers.
Many join companies directly related to their NCE projects or
experiences. Initial productivity is high, since the new employee's
"learning curve" is shortened by previous exposure to the company's
culture.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">NCEs facilitate recruiting</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">From industry's point of view, a major
benefit of NCE partnership is the opportunity to identify promising
potential employees. NCE participation offers industry a pre-selected
pool of top-quality students who have trained under the best
researchers in their field and whose specialties coincide with the
company's interests. The numerous interactions between the students
and industrial participants also give companies a chance to stimulate
the students' interest in working for them.</FONT></P>

master's degree in mechanical engineering at McMaster University. She
has landed her first job with a Canadian robotics company, and she
knows her experience in the IRIS-subsidized student work-term program
gave her an advantage in the competition.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A HREF="pence.htm">Stopping the "Brain
Drain" from Canada</A></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Many people have lamented the "brain drain"
of highly qualified personnel to well-paying jobs in the United
States. Edmonton's Dr. David Wishart is a prime example of how PENCE
is helping to reverse this trend. Dr. Wishart's internship with PENCE
is directly responsible for his decision to stay in Canada.</FONT>

Nouveaux march&eacute;s, nouveaux emplois</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les travaux poursuivis par Micronet ont
donn&eacute; lieu &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation de deux entreprises
ind&eacute;pendantes qui contribueront &agrave; l'&eacute;conomie
canadienne par la cr&eacute;ation d'emploi et la commercialisation de
nouvelles technologies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Vinod Agarwal de l'Universit&eacute; McGill
est le pr&eacute;sident fondateur de LV Software (LVS), une nouvelle
entreprise qui a &eacute;tabli ses locaux &agrave; Montr&eacute;al,
&agrave; Ottawa et &agrave; San Jose, en Californie. LVS se
sp&eacute;cialise dans le d&eacute;veloppement et la
commercialisation d'outils d'automatisation de tests.
R&eacute;cemment, l'entreprise a lanc&eacute; un produit
appel&eacute; ASICtest issu des travaux de testabilit&eacute;
poursuivis par le professeur Agarwal partiellement financ&eacute;s
par Micronet et Recherches Bell-Northern (devenu Nortel Technologie).
Ce produit est en fait un outil de conception et d'analyse
pr&eacute;liminaires qui peut mettre en oeuvre
l'auto-v&eacute;rification incorpor&eacute;e de circuits
int&eacute;gr&eacute;s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cadabra Design Libraries Inc., une seconde
entreprise issue des travaux de Micronet, met en march&eacute; un
certain nombre d'outils de conception assist&eacute;e par ordinateur
(CAO) d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s en partie avec l'appui de Micronet.
Fond&eacute;e par le professeur Martin Lefebvre de
l'Universit&eacute; Carleton, Cadabra emploie trois concepteurs de
logiciels &agrave; temps plein &agrave; ses installations de Nepean,
en Ontario. Le premier produit issu de cette entreprise est un outil
de synth&egrave;se des trac&eacute;s qui permet d'appliquer plus
efficacement les technologies actuelles &agrave; la conception de
circuits int&eacute;gr&eacute;s et de fabriquer ainsi des produits
plus concurrentiels. Le professeur Lefebvre est d'avis que les
pourparlers avec les partenaires du secteur priv&eacute; de Micronet
l'ont grandement aid&eacute; &agrave; comprendre l'importance de la
collaboration avec l'industrie et le besoin de mettre sur pied cette
entreprise.</FONT></P>

&Agrave; la d&eacute;couverte de nouveaux march&eacute;s</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Percer de nouveaux march&eacute;s pour les
p&acirc;tes m&eacute;caniques est l'un des objectifs principaux du
R&eacute;seau des p&acirc;tes de bois m&eacute;caniques. Pour obtenir
la p&acirc;te m&eacute;canique, on utilise de grandes plaques de
m&eacute;tal plut&ocirc;t que des proc&eacute;d&eacute;s chimiques
pour broyer les copeaux. Les p&acirc;tes m&eacute;caniques ou
&agrave; haut rendement contiennent une quantit&eacute; plus
&eacute;lev&eacute;e de fibres de bois originales, contrairement aux
p&acirc;tes chimiques, mais sont plus susceptibles de jaunir.
Voil&agrave; pourquoi les p&acirc;tes m&eacute;caniques sont surtout
utilis&eacute;es pour des papiers de qualit&eacute; secondaire tels
que le papier journal, les feuillets publicitaires et le papier
hygi&eacute;nique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le r&eacute;seau a accompli des
progr&egrave;s remarquables en vue de trouver de nouvelles
utilisations &agrave; valeur ajout&eacute;e des p&acirc;tes. Le
jaunissement constitue un autre secteur o&ugrave; les travaux du
r&eacute;seau progressent. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la participation
active de partenaires du secteur priv&eacute; Clariant Corp., Du Pont
Canada, Sant&eacute; Canada, MacMillan Bloedel, et National
Silicates, le r&eacute;seau est sur le point de surmonter l'obstacle
majeur qu'est le jaunissement de la p&acirc;te
m&eacute;canique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Une &eacute;quipe de chercheurs
dirig&eacute;e par J.K.S. Wan &agrave; l'Universit&eacute; Queen's a
obtenu un brevet pour un additif de polym&egrave;re (thiolactate de
glycol de poly&eacute;thyl&egrave;ne) qui rend le papier stable
&agrave; la lumi&egrave;re pendant un an. Les travaux se poursuivent
avec la soci&eacute;t&eacute; Clariant Corp. afin de commercialiser
cette technologie et d'assurer sa viabilit&eacute; &eacute;conomique
&agrave; grande &eacute;chelle. Des essais &agrave; grande
&eacute;chelle en usine sont pr&eacute;vus pour cet
&eacute;t&eacute;. Cette perc&eacute;e permettra l'utilisation de
p&acirc;tes m&eacute;caniques dans des produits &agrave; valeur
ajout&eacute;e tels que le papier d'impression.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Parall&egrave;lement, une &eacute;quipe de
chercheurs de l'Universit&eacute; d'Ottawa, sous la direction de J.C.
Scaiano, a d&eacute;couvert que les pellicules et additifs d'argile
couramment utilis&eacute;s dans la fabrication du papier
emp&ecirc;chent &eacute;galement le jaunissement. Des travaux en
laboratoire r&eacute;v&egrave;lent qu'on peut r&eacute;duire de
mani&egrave;re suffisante le m&eacute;canisme de jaunissement de
cette fa&ccedil;on, ce qui rend acceptable l'utilisation des
p&acirc;tes m&eacute;caniques dans la fabrication de papier
d'impression.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Par ailleurs, le professeur A.R.P. van
Heiningen de l'Universit&eacute; du Nouveau-Brunswick a
modifi&eacute; avec succ&egrave;s un proc&eacute;d&eacute; existant
en appliquant une technique chimique am&eacute;lior&eacute;e pour
supprimer les ions m&eacute;talliques de la p&acirc;te, ce qui
r&eacute;duit le jaunissement. Des essais en usine sont actuellement
en cours. Enfin, deux chercheurs de Paprican (Institut canadien de
recherches sur les p&acirc;tes et papiers), Cyril Heitner et John
Schmidt, en collaboration avec le directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du
r&eacute;seau, Gordon Leary, ont d&eacute;couvert que l'addition
d'antioxydants &agrave; la p&acirc;te emp&ecirc;che le papier de
perdre de l'&eacute;clat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cet effort national concert&eacute; a
men&eacute; &agrave; des perc&eacute;es importantes qui pourraient
permettre d'&eacute;conomiser plusieurs millions de dollars chaque
ann&eacute;e par la r&eacute;duction du blanchiment utilis&eacute;
dans la production de papier et l'am&eacute;lioration des
proc&eacute;d&eacute;s de recyclage. Du m&ecirc;me coup, les
p&acirc;tes m&eacute;caniques deviendront plus attrayantes pour les
fabricants mondiaux de papier, en particulier aux &Eacute;tats-Unis,
d'o&ugrave; une opportunit&eacute; pour les producteurs canadiens
d'accro&icirc;tre leurs march&eacute;s.</FONT></P>

recherche sur les bact&eacute;rioses (RCRB), Sciex, un partenaire du
secteur priv&eacute; et l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta ont uni
leurs efforts en vue de d&eacute;velopper une technique et un
logiciel nouveaux de s&eacute;quen&ccedil;age de l'ADN. Le professeur
Norm Dovichi, chimiste &agrave; l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta et
membre des deux r&eacute;seaux, est le chercheur principal de ce
projet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sciex est le principal fabricant

R&eacute;seau canadien de recherche sur les bact&eacute;rioses (RCRB)
poursuit son expansion et a amorc&eacute; la phase III des essais
cliniques du SYNSORB-Pk, un nouveau traitement contre le syndrome
ur&eacute;mique h&eacute;molytique (SUH), commun&eacute;ment
appel&eacute; &#171; maladie du hamburger &#187;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cette nouvelle application
th&eacute;rapeutique du SYNSORB-Pk, vise &agrave; pr&eacute;venir les
complications du SUH, qui peuvent provoquer le d&eacute;c&egrave;s.
Habituellement, la maladie du hamburger se manifeste chez les enfants
qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; expos&eacute;s &agrave; certaines souches
de la bact&eacute;rie Escherichia coli parfois pr&eacute;sentes dans
le boeuf hach&eacute; ou dans les produits du lait non

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les complications de la maladie se
manifestent entre autres par une insuffisance r&eacute;nale, des
troubles neurologiques et occasionnellement le d&eacute;c&egrave;s.
Les enfants et les personnes &acirc;g&eacute;es sont les plus sujets
&agrave; souffrir des complications de la maladie, pour lesquelles il
n'existe encore aucun traitement efficace.</FONT></P>

la premi&egrave;re phase du RCRB aux laboratoires des professeurs
Glen Armstrong de l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta et Murray
Ratcliffe (anciennement de Chembiomed Ltd.), qui se sont
inspir&eacute;s des travaux de Raymond Lemieux, &eacute;galement de
l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta. La phase de d&eacute;veloppement
depuis le concept aux essais cliniques s'est &eacute;chelonn&eacute;e
sur trois ans seulement, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la collaboration du
Canadian Pediatric Kidney Disease Reference Centre (CPKDRC) et du
Alberta Research Council (ARC). Cette technologie a &eacute;t&eacute;
brevet&eacute;e par Chembiomed Ltd. d'Edmonton (une entreprise de
biotechnologie qui a &eacute;t&eacute; int&eacute;gr&eacute;e
&agrave; l'ARC en 1991). Une licence d'exploitation a

r&eacute;seau travaille maintenant &agrave; &eacute;tablir d'autres
partenariats avec l'industrie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Allelix Biopharmaceuticals, une entreprise
de Toronto, a mis sur pied une division de sciences neurologiques
gr&acirc;ce &agrave; un appui de 6 millions de $ du Fonds des

modalit&eacute;s d'un accord sp&eacute;cial de partenariat,
gr&acirc;ce auquel Allelix deviendra le r&eacute;cepteur commercial
de certaines technologies issues des travaux du r&eacute;seau. La

les fonctions motrices et sensorielles par suite de l&eacute;sions
neurologiques. Le Fonds des partenaires de NeuroSciences et le
Alberta Heritage Medical Research Foundation ont investi 1,25 million
de $ dans cette recherche. La prochaine ronde de financement
pr&eacute;vue pour plus tard au cours de l'ann&eacute;e devrait
permettre de recueillir au moins deux millions de $. Neuromotion Inc.
agira &eacute;galement &agrave; titre d'entreprise r&eacute;ceptrice

Former les sp&eacute;cialistes en S et T de demain</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Pamela Renton est une entrepreneure en
recherche qui r&eacute;ussit d&eacute;j&agrave; tr&egrave;s bien
m&ecirc;me si elle vient tout juste d'obtenir son dipl&ocirc;me de
ma&icirc;trise de l'Universit&eacute; McMaster. Elle a
d&eacute;croch&eacute; son premier emploi dans une entreprise
canadienne de robotique. Son exp&eacute;rience acquise dans le cadre
du programme de stages de travail financ&eacute; par l'IRIS lui a
donn&eacute; une longueur d'avance sur les autres candidats. Mme
Renton a travaill&eacute; durant un an &agrave; l'Institut de
technologie de l'information du CNRC o&ugrave; elle a fait partie
d'une &eacute;quipe charg&eacute;e de d&eacute;velopper le logiciel
du projet Vision 3-D pour la t&eacute;l&eacute;robotique dans les
environnements dangereux. Le projet faisait appel &agrave; la
participation d'EACL, de Spar A&eacute;rospatiale, du CNRC, de
l'Agence spatiale canadienne et de PRECARN Associates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Partie int&eacute;grante du volet des
syst&egrave;mes int&eacute;gr&eacute;s dans les environnements
dynamiques de l'IRIS, ce projet avait pour but de mettre sur pied la
d&eacute;monstration illustrant l'application de la
t&eacute;l&eacute;robotique canadienne appliqu&eacute;e &agrave; la
restauration d'environnements hostiles - une application directe de
ses travaux de recherche. Elle est maintenant en mesure de mettre
&agrave; profit l'exp&eacute;rience acquise &agrave; l'IRIS et sa
formation de ma&icirc;trise &agrave; des travaux pour le compte de
CRS Robotics de Burlington, en Ontario.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#171; Les descriptions de poste contiennent
toutes sortes d'abr&eacute;viations de comp&eacute;tences ou de
technologies sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es, indique Mme Renton. Pour bon
nombre d'entre eux, je peux maintenant dire : &#171; J'ai fait cela
&#187;. Le stage m'a fourni une excellente occasion d'&eacute;largir
mes comp&eacute;tences et d'apprendre de nouvelles
technologies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Non seulement Pamela Renton a-t-elle pu
constater l'application de sa formation &agrave; la r&eacute;solution
d'un probl&egrave;me concret, mais sa formation de pointe &agrave;
l'Universit&eacute; McMaster s'est av&eacute;r&eacute;e
pr&eacute;cieuse pour les partenaires de recherche en contribuant
&agrave; resserrer les liens entre les &eacute;tudiants, les
&eacute;tablissements de recherche et l'industrie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Durant les 18 mois de la Phase II, l'IRIS a
appuy&eacute; 91 &eacute;tudiants aux cycles sup&eacute;rieurs dans
le cadre de ses projets. Par la suite, 51 d'entre eux ont
trouv&eacute; un emploi dans l'industrie canadienne. De plus, le
r&eacute;seau a employ&eacute; 75 ing&eacute;nieurs-chercheurs et 46
stagiaires postdoctoraux.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le d&eacute;vouement des membres de l'IRIS
dans la mise sur pied d'un programme de stages qui permet d'embaucher
des &eacute;tudiants &agrave; une fraction du co&ucirc;t r&eacute;el
et de les faire participer &agrave; la conf&eacute;rence annuelle,
aux colloques et ateliers IRIS-PRECARN, d&eacute;montre l'engagement
concret du r&eacute;seau dans la formation de personnel hautement
qualifi&eacute; pour relever les d&eacute;fis de demain.</FONT></P>

Freiner l'exode des cerveaux</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">De nombreuses personnes d&eacute;plorent
l'exode de personnel hautement qualifi&eacute; vers des emplois plus
lucratifs aux &Eacute;tats-Unis. Le professeur David Wishard
d'Edmonton est un remarquable exemple des efforts du R&eacute;seau de
centres d'excellence en g&eacute;nie prot&eacute;ique en vue de
renverser cette tendance. Le stage que le professeur Wishart a
effectu&eacute; au sein du r&eacute;seau est la raison majeure de sa
d&eacute;cision de demeurer au Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Apr&egrave;s avoir compl&eacute;t&eacute; sa
formation aux laboratoires du r&eacute;seau au d&eacute;but de 1995,
le professeur Wishart a accept&eacute; la chaire Bristol Myer Squibb
en pharmacologie &agrave; l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta et est
devenu en juillet de la m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e chercheur membre du
r&eacute;seau.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">La possibilit&eacute; de perfectionner ses
comp&eacute;tences en entrepreneuriat dans une nouvelle entreprise,
BioTools Inc., d'Edmonton, qu'il allait fonder en association avec
Brian Sykes, Jonathan Schaeffer et Duane Szafron, chercheurs du
r&eacute;seau, a pes&eacute; fortement dans la d&eacute;cision de
David Wishart de refuser des offres de travail all&eacute;chantes aux
&Eacute;tats-Unis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">BioTools a embauch&eacute; sept personnes
&agrave; contrat pour commercialiser les logiciels de biologie ultra
rapides mis au point par le r&eacute;seau et obtenus sous licence de
l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta. Ces logiciels permettent aux
entreprises et aux laboratoires de biotechnologie d'obtenir et
d'organiser un volume consid&eacute;rable de donn&eacute;es sur la
structure et le s&eacute;quen&ccedil;age de prot&eacute;ines. Ces
donn&eacute;es sont essentielles &agrave; la progression rapide vers
la d&eacute;couverte de la structure d'une prot&eacute;ine. Compte
tenu des co&ucirc;ts &eacute;lev&eacute;s des programmes d'essai de
m&eacute;dicaments que doivent assumer les compagnies
pharmaceutiques, le fait de conna&icirc;tre la structure
mol&eacute;culaire d'une prot&eacute;ine cible, ou la s&eacute;quence
de son site actif, est un aspect essentiel &agrave; la
r&eacute;ussite de tout programme de cette nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&Agrave; l'heure actuelle, plus de 75
&eacute;tudiants aux cycles sup&eacute;rieurs et stagiaires
postdoctoraux participent aux projets du r&eacute;seau.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#171; Maximiser les efforts et les
ressources d'un grand nombre de chercheurs et d'entrepreneurs
constitue une approche &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation d'entreprises
fond&eacute;es sur le savoir unique au Canada, explique le professeur
Robert S. Hodge, directeur scientifique du r&eacute;seau, &agrave;
l'Universit&eacute; de l'Alberta. Je crois fermement en cette
approche autant pour les entreprises actuelles que celles qui verront
le jour au prochain si&egrave;cle et je remercie tous ceux et celles
qui contribuent &agrave; faire de cette vision une
r&eacute;alit&eacute;. &#187;</FONT></P>

Une perc&eacute;e importante dans la maladie d'Alzheimer</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Une &eacute;quipe de recherche
internationale dirig&eacute;e par le Dr Peter St. George-Hyslop,
chercheur du R&eacute;seau canadien sur les maladies
g&eacute;n&eacute;tiques (RCMG) au centre de recherche sur les
maladies neurod&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ratives &agrave;
l'Universit&eacute; de Toronto, a d&eacute;couvert et clon&eacute;
deux g&egrave;nes responsables de l'apparition pr&eacute;coce de la
maladie d'Alzheimer, la forme la plus grave de cette maladie.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Plus de 250 000 Canadiens souffrent de la
maladie d'Alzheimer. Les traitements sont peu nombreux et il n'existe
aucune cure &agrave; cette maladie. Cette manifestation
pr&eacute;coce de la maladie d'Alzheimer est extr&ecirc;mement
agressive, affecte des personnes &acirc;g&eacute;es de 30 &agrave; 60
ans et progresse plus rapidement que les autres formes plus
courantes, qui surviennent vers l'&acirc;ge de 65 ans. La
majorit&eacute; des personnes atteintes de cette forme de la maladie
d'Alzheimer d&eacute;c&egrave;dent dans les dix ans suivant son
apparition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cette d&eacute;couverte de l'&eacute;quipe
de l'Universit&eacute; de Toronto offre un nouvel espoir aux
personnes souffrant de la maladie d'Alzheimer et a fait sensation
dans le monde entier. Les r&eacute;sultats des travaux ont
&eacute;t&eacute; publi&eacute;s dans les &eacute;ditions du 29 juin
et du 31 ao&ucirc;t 1995 de la prestigieuse revue scientifique
britannique Nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">L'&eacute;quipe a d&eacute;couvert le
premier g&egrave;ne sur le chromosome 14, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une
technique sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e d'isolement des g&egrave;nes
d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e par la Dre Johanna Rommens du Toronto
Hospital for Sick Children et membre du r&eacute;seau. Apr&egrave;s
avoir &eacute;tudi&eacute; 19 g&egrave;nes, les chercheurs ont
d&eacute;couvert qu'un d'entre eux comportait les mutations
sp&eacute;cifiques des personnes qui souffrent de cette forme de la
maladie d'Alzheimer. Le second g&egrave;ne a &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;couvert sur le chromosome un.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">L'&eacute;tude de la prot&eacute;ine
contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e par les g&egrave;nes pourrait donner lieu
&agrave; la mise au point de nouvelles m&eacute;thodes visant
&agrave; pr&eacute;venir la d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rescence des
cellules du cerveau, qui engendre la perte progressive de la
m&eacute;moire et un affaiblissement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, explique
le Dr St. George-Hyslop. Les personnes dont la famille porte le
g&egrave;ne ont cinquante pour cent des chances de le compter dans
leur bagage g&eacute;n&eacute;tique. La d&eacute;couverte des deux
g&egrave;nes, explique-t-il, signifie que l'on peut maintenant
d&eacute;velopper un test simple pour diagnostiquer l'apparition
pr&eacute;coce de la maladie d'Alzheimer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les Drs St. George-Hyslop et Rommens ont
fait &eacute;quipe avec d'autres chercheurs du r&eacute;seau &agrave;
l'Universit&eacute; de Toronto, au Hospital for Sick Children,
&agrave; l'Universit&eacute; McMaster et &agrave; l'UBC pour tenter
de trouver les causes exactes de la maladie d'Alzheimer. &#171;
L'engagement continu du r&eacute;seau, l'appui de ses installations
centrales et les collaborations pancanadiennes sont essentielles
&agrave; la progression rapide des travaux du Dr St. George-Hyslop en
vue de d&eacute;velopper des diagnostics plus efficaces, et en bout
de compte, de nouvelles th&eacute;rapies pour soigner cette maladie
&#187;, explique Michael Hayden, directeur scientifique du
RCMG.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ces travaux ont &eacute;t&eacute;
financ&eacute;s conjointement par le r&eacute;seau, l'association
ontarienne de l'Alzheimer et un certain nombre de donateurs
priv&eacute;s, dont le philanthrope Mark Tanz. L'Universit&eacute; de
Toronto, le Hospital for Sick Children, et le centre administratif du
r&eacute;seau &agrave; Vancouver ont form&eacute; un consortium en
vue de commercialiser leurs d&eacute;couvertes. Le consortium
envisage de mettre sur pied un important projet pluriannuel de R et D
en collaboration avec un partenaire du secteur priv&eacute; en vue de
maintenir la position du Canada comme chef de file dans cet important
domaine m&eacute;dical.</FONT></P>

Le Canada &agrave; la fine pointe de la technologie</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Un projet de d&eacute;monstration en cours
dans le cadre du volet des syst&egrave;mes et instruments photoniques
de l'Institut canadien de recherche en
t&eacute;l&eacute;communications (ICRT) unit les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s du laser &agrave; l'&eacute;lectronique dans
une technologie spectaculaire qui pourrait &eacute;liminer les
obstacles &agrave; la conception d'ordinateurs 100 fois plus rapides
que ceux utilis&eacute;s de nos jours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les ordinateurs personnels sont dot&eacute;s
d'un microprocesseur unique qui peut ex&eacute;cuter environ 100 000
000 instructions par seconde. Les analystes programmeurs r&ecirc;vent
d'augmenter jusqu'&agrave; 100 le nombre de ces microprocesseurs. Si
on r&eacute;ussissait &agrave; les relier de fa&ccedil;on efficace,
leur puissance ainsi combin&eacute;e pourrait centupler leur
capacit&eacute; de traitement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cette innovation de l'ICRT est sur le point
de changer la fa&ccedil;on dont les microprocesseurs sont
interconnect&eacute;s gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la &#171; technologie des
fonds de panier optiques &#187;. Le terme &#171; optique &#187;
renvoie &agrave; la technologie qui utilise la lumi&egrave;re (dans
ce cas-ci g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;e par laser), et &#171; fond de
panier &#187;, au syst&egrave;me de connexion auquel est
branch&eacute; le microprocesseur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les connexions par laser offrent de nombreux
avantages : elles occupent moins d'espace dans les fonds de panier,
et peuvent transmettre des informations &agrave; des vitesses
beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es que par la voie
&eacute;lectrique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tout comme l'image d'une cam&eacute;ra ne
doit pas s'embrouiller quand elle capte un mouvement, les connexions
au laser doivent demeurer stables et efficaces chaque fois qu'elles
sont sollicit&eacute;es, peu importe le stress ext&eacute;rieur
caus&eacute; par l'usage quotidien.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Afin de surmonter cette difficult&eacute;,
le r&eacute;seau a fait appel &agrave; des &eacute;quipes
multidisciplinaires regroupant des chercheurs du gouvernement, des
universit&eacute;s et du secteur priv&eacute;, qui travaillent
&agrave; divers aspects du projet. Cette ann&eacute;e, des chercheurs
du CNRC, de l'&Eacute;cole Polytechnique et de l'Universit&eacute; de
Toronto ont joint l'&eacute;quipe, compos&eacute;e au d&eacute;part
de chercheurs provenant des universit&eacute;s McGill et McMaster, et
de TRLabs. L'&eacute;quipe de McGill vient de terminer son
troisi&egrave;me syst&egrave;me de d&eacute;monstration des fonds de
panier optiques. Nortel Technologie (anciennement Recherches
Bell-Northern) participe activement au projet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le projet de syst&egrave;mes et
d'instruments photoniques compte parmi les six projets majeurs de
l'ICRT en vue de d&eacute;velopper des technologies des
t&eacute;l&eacute;communications. Ces projets portent sur les
syst&egrave;mes de communications en espace libre, les
syst&egrave;mes de communications mobiles et personnelles, les
r&eacute;seaux ATM, les services &agrave; large bande et les
communications satellites &agrave; large bande.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alan Lowe, professeur d'Inspiraplex &agrave;
l'Universit&eacute; de la Colombie-Britannique, a mis au point une
technologie novatrice qui permet de maintenir les voies respiratoires
ouvertes, et sans les effets secondaires que provoquent d'autres
dispositifs. Le KlearwayMD est un appareil buccal qui pousse la
m&acirc;choire inf&eacute;rieure vers l'avant et maintient les dents
ensemble, emp&ecirc;chant ainsi la langue de bloquer les voies
respiratoires.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le professeur Lowe, et les chercheurs
d'Inspiraplex K. Ferguson, J. Fleetham et J. Remmers, ont mis sur
pied le tout premier essai clinique randomis&eacute;
contr&ocirc;l&eacute; de ce traitement de l'AOS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">KlearwayMD est prometteur, puisque les
premiers essais r&eacute;v&egrave;lent un taux de succ&egrave;s de 90
% chez les ronfleurs et de 70 % chez les patients souffrant d'AOS.
L'Universit&eacute; de la Colombie-Britannique a accord&eacute; une
licence d'exploitation au Canada &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
Space Maintainers, et &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger &agrave; Great Lakes
Orthodontics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Parall&egrave;lement, en septembre dernier,
les chercheurs d'Inspiraplex ont d&eacute;voil&eacute; les
d&eacute;tails d'une nouvelle m&eacute;thode permettant de
diagnostiquer l'AOS &agrave; la maison. Jusqu'&agrave;
pr&eacute;sent, les sujets devaient passer une nuit dans un
laboratoire sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; &agrave; l'h&ocirc;pital. Compte
tenu des compressions budg&eacute;taires dans les soins de
sant&eacute;, cette nouvelle m&eacute;thode contribuerait &agrave;
r&eacute;duire les co&ucirc;ts et &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la
qualit&eacute; de vie des patients, tout comme le font la chirurgie

L'expertise canadienne en demande</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lorsque la division de la
s&eacute;curit&eacute; des barrages de l'&Eacute;tat de la Californie
a appris que le barrage de Littlerock situ&eacute; dans le sud de
l'&eacute;tat ne respectait pas les crit&egrave;res actuels de
s&eacute;curit&eacute; sismique, c'est &agrave; l'expertise de
B&eacute;ton Canada qu'elle a fait appel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le chercheur du r&eacute;seau D.R. Morgan
d'AGRA Earth &amp; Environmental Ltd. (AEE), &agrave; Burnaby, C.-B.,
a &eacute;t&eacute; sollicit&eacute; pour aider &agrave; restaurer le
barrage situ&eacute; juste au sud de la faille de San Andreas. Une
des deux r&eacute;fections requises pour rendre le barrage
s&eacute;curitaire consistait &agrave; appliquer une couche de
b&eacute;ton projet&eacute; &agrave; haute performance (BPHP) sur la
face amont du barrage (voir la photo).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&Agrave; la t&ecirc;te d'une &eacute;quipe
de chercheurs membres de B&eacute;ton Canada qui poursuit des travaux
sur le BPHP, le professeur Morgan a &eacute;t&eacute; en mesure
d'appliquer les tous derniers d&eacute;veloppements de cette
technologie de pointe au projet du barrage de Littlerock.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le m&eacute;lange de BPHP a
&eacute;t&eacute; obtenu en utilisant du b&eacute;ton pr&ecirc;t
&agrave; l'emploi avec fum&eacute;e de silice, renforc&eacute; de
fibres d'acier et contenant de l'air entra&icirc;n&eacute;, (un
r&eacute;seau de bulles d'air permettant &agrave; l'eau de prendre de
l'expansion quand elle se transforme en glace au moment du gel). Ce
type de b&eacute;ton est plus r&eacute;sistant que le b&eacute;ton
conventionnel et moins perm&eacute;able &agrave; l'eau et &agrave;
d'autres agents chimiques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le d&eacute;fi &agrave; relever dans ce
projet consistait &agrave; &eacute;laborer un cahier des normes et
&agrave; appliquer ensuite un syst&egrave;me rigide de construction
et de m&ucirc;rissement (s&eacute;chage) qui permettait de recouvrir
le b&eacute;ton existant d'une couche de b&eacute;ton projet&eacute;
enti&egrave;rement adh&eacute;rente et sans fissures. L'expertise du
professeur Morgan s'est av&eacute;r&eacute;e cruciale, en ce qui a
trait particuli&egrave;rement &agrave; la mise en oeuvre des
sp&eacute;cifications relatives au m&ucirc;rissement, d'autant plus
critique dans un climat d&eacute;sertique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le professeur Morgan compte parmi les
douzaines de chercheurs et d'entreprises de B&eacute;ton Canada qui
fournissent leur expertise sur le b&eacute;ton &agrave; haute
performance (BHP) et des mat&eacute;riaux pour des projets de grande
envergure tels que la plate-forme de forage Hibernia et le pont de

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le plus grand laboratoire du R&eacute;seau
de centres d'excellence en t&eacute;l&eacute;apprentissage et
formation (R-TAF, ce sont les 507 451 kilom&egrave;tres carr&eacute;s
que constitue l'&icirc;le de Baffin! Cette &icirc;le
repr&eacute;sente en effet tous les d&eacute;fis que pourraient
surmonter la technologie des environnements d'apprentissage
intentionnels soutenus par ordinateur (Computer Supported Intentional
Learning Environments), ou CSILE, l'une des quatre &#171;
technologies-balises &#187; du r&eacute;seau.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CSILE est une technologie novatrice et une
nouvelle approche d'apprentissage et de recherche constitu&eacute;e
d'une base de donn&eacute;es hyperm&eacute;dia &eacute;tablie en
r&eacute;seau et construite en collaboration par les apprenants.
L'objectif de CSILE est de permettre l'apprentissage en
collaboration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#171; Une base de donn&eacute;es du
syst&egrave;me CSILE est vide jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'on identifie un
probl&egrave;me et que les &eacute;tudiants entreprennent de le
r&eacute;soudre &#187;, explique Sandy McAuley, &eacute;ducatrice au
sein du conseil scolaire de la division de Baffin et
dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;e de l'Institut d'&eacute;tudes
p&eacute;dagogiques de l'Ontario (IEPO), o&ugrave; le syst&egrave;me
CSILE a vu le jour en 1986.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Pour un syst&egrave;me tel que CSILE, les
r&eacute;alit&eacute;s g&eacute;ographiques et d&eacute;mographiques
de l'&icirc;le de Baffin ne constituent pas un obstacle : 3 800
&eacute;tudiants provenant de 15 petites communaut&eacute;s
r&eacute;parties sur pr&egrave;s de trois quarts de millions de
kilom&egrave;tres carr&eacute;s de toundra, de montagnes et de glace
sont reli&eacute;s efficacement entre eux par un r&eacute;seau
informatique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#171; Lorsque j'&eacute;tais en
d&eacute;tachement &agrave; l'IEPO, j'ai d&eacute;couvert le CSILE et
je me suis rendu compte qu'il offrait la base technologique dont nous
avions besoin, affirme Mme McAuley. Le CSILE se pr&ecirc;te &agrave;
l'exploration de questions pertinentes pour les &eacute;tudiants de
l'&icirc;le de Baffin. Ce programme refl&egrave;te la culture de la
r&eacute;gion et fait appel aux ressources de celle-ci. &#187;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Marlene Scardamalia, de l'IEPO, directrice
du projet du R-TAF de la maternelle &agrave; la 12e ann&eacute;e,
affirme que les &eacute;tudiants inuits ont tout de suite
adopt&eacute; le projet. &#171; C'&eacute;tait touchant de voir les
&eacute;tudiants s'approprier de cette technologie. Ils ont
interrog&eacute; leurs a&icirc;n&eacute;s et ont mis sur pied de
pr&eacute;cieux fichiers sur leurs origines et des dialectes
rares.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le R&eacute;seau en
t&eacute;l&eacute;apprentissage et formation, l'un des quatre
nouveaux RCE, m&egrave;ne de front 55 projets de recherche regroupant
32 organismes de recherche et 20 partenaires du secteur priv&eacute;.
Les projets du R-TAF gravitent autour de quatre technologies-balises
: CSILE, TELEFORM (outils de d&eacute;veloppement de la
t&eacute;l&eacute;formation en milieu de travail et &agrave; la
maison), VIRTUAL-U (environnement d'apprentissage en direct pour la
conception et la transmission de cours de la maternelle &agrave;
l'universit&eacute;), et CADRE (ensemble de conception et d'outils de
r&eacute;daction et de m&eacute;thodologie en vue d'&eacute;laborer
des syst&egrave;mes de soutien &agrave; l'apprentissage).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#171; Le R&eacute;seau en

une &eacute;conomie fond&eacute;e sur le savoir, indique la
directrice scientifique du r&eacute;seau, Linda Harasim, de

Les plus &#171; intelligentes &#187; structures du monde</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">De nos jours, les ponts sont de
v&eacute;ritables bijoux d'ing&eacute;niosit&eacute;, et l'un d'entre
eux, actuellement en construction au Manitoba, deviendra la plus
&#171; intelligente &#187; structure du monde gr&acirc;ce &agrave;
une technologie d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e par le r&eacute;seau SISI
(Syst&egrave;mes intelligents pour structures innovatrices), l'un des
quatre nouveaux membres des RCE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">La moiti&eacute; du pont Headling,
pr&egrave;s de Winnipeg, sera b&acirc;tie en partie avec cette
technologie intelligente de SISI, et en partie avec la technologie
courante de construction de ponts. Cette technologie int&egrave;gre
le plastique renforc&eacute; de fibres (PRF), le b&eacute;ton et les
capteurs &agrave; fibres optiques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le PRF est constitu&eacute; de b&eacute;ton
contenant des fibres de carbone entour&eacute;s d'une r&eacute;sine
semblable &agrave; du plastique. Ces fibres remplacent les barres
d'acier qui renforcent habituellement les structures de b&eacute;ton.
Le fer se corrode lorsqu'il est expos&eacute; &agrave; l'eau, au sel
et &agrave; d'autres produits chimiques. Le PRF, quant &agrave; lui,
n'est pas corrosif, est de 20 % plus l&eacute;ger que l'acier, 10
fois plus r&eacute;sistant et plus durable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">La structure du pont Headling sera
divis&eacute;e en deux afin de permettre au minist&egrave;re des
routes du Manitoba, qui a inject&eacute; plus de 250 000 $ dans le
projet, d'&eacute;tudier la r&eacute;sistance du c&ocirc;t&eacute; du
pont contenant le PRF par rapport au b&eacute;ton arm&eacute;
r&eacute;gulier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les capteurs &agrave; fibres optiques
sillonnent la structure du pont tel un syst&egrave;me nerveux. Le PRF
du pont Headling contient 64 capteurs le long de ses quelque 350 m.
Ces capteurs sont branch&eacute;s &agrave; une ligne
t&eacute;l&eacute;phonique ordinaire. Pour &eacute;tudier les
conditions du pont, les ing&eacute;nieurs peuvent transmettre,
&agrave; partir d'un laboratoire &agrave; distance, des faisceaux
laser aux capteurs par l'entremise d'un g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur
laser install&eacute; sur le pont.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#171; Des contraintes telles que le volume
de trafic, le froid ou le vent, modifient les longueurs d'onde des
faisceaux lumineux transmis par les capteurs optiques &#187;,
explique le pr&eacute;sident de SISI, Sami Rizkalla, l'un des
inventeurs du concept des structures intelligentes. De retour au
laboratoire, nous comparons ces changements avec les longueurs d'onde
de base et interpr&eacute;tons les r&eacute;sultats. &#187;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">M. Rizkalla admet que lorsqu'il a
discut&eacute; de la possibilit&eacute; de combiner ses
int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de recherche avec ceux du directeur
th&eacute;matique de SISI, Ray Measures, du d&eacute;partement des
&eacute;tudes en a&eacute;rospatiale de l'Universit&eacute; de
Toronto, cette id&eacute;e semblait irr&eacute;aliste. M&ecirc;me
aujourd'hui, aucune autre structure dans le monde entier n'utilise
cette technologie. Toutefois, des essais r&eacute;alis&eacute;s en
laboratoire et sur un pont de Calgary ont d&eacute;montr&eacute;
l'efficacit&eacute; du mariage de la technologie des capteurs et de
la fibre optique. Le r&eacute;seau est maintenant
d&eacute;bord&eacute; de demandes provenant de tous les pays pour en
conna&icirc;tre davantage sur ces structures &#171; intelligentes
&#187;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le PRF sera utilis&eacute; dans divers
projets de r&eacute;fection de ponts manitobains d&eacute;j&agrave;
endommag&eacute;s par de lourdes charges. Le r&eacute;seau
pr&eacute;dit que l'utilisation de ce mat&eacute;riau longue
dur&eacute;e jumel&eacute;e aux capteurs permettra
d'&eacute;conomiser des millions de dollars en co&ucirc;ts
d'entretien. SISI travaille &eacute;galement &agrave; la mise au
point d'une puce informatique qui permettra la collecte et
l'interpr&eacute;tation des donn&eacute;es, actuellement
effectu&eacute;es par l'entremise de lignes
t&eacute;l&eacute;phoniques. Les donn&eacute;es stock&eacute;es sur
la puce pourront &ecirc;tre transmises par satellite,
&eacute;liminant ainsi le besoin de lignes
t&eacute;l&eacute;phoniques et d'appareils de lecture en
laboratoire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dans le cadre de sa strat&eacute;gie, le
r&eacute;seau a accord&eacute; &agrave; Wardrop Engineering un
contrat d'exploitation sous licence du PRF et des technologies des
capteurs et pr&eacute;voit conclure de nombreuses ententes
d'exploitation dans l'avenir. Wardrop b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie de
cette interaction avec les deux chercheurs et leurs &eacute;tudiants,
et a d&eacute;j&agrave; embauch&eacute; deux ing&eacute;nieurs, dont
l'un &eacute;tait supervis&eacute; par M. Rizkalla. Le r&eacute;seau
r&eacute;unit 40 &eacute;tudiants et chercheurs provenant de 11
universit&eacute;s et plusieurs dizaines de partenaires
industriels.</FONT></P>

Des soins de sant&eacute; en direct</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">L'avenir des prestations et de la gestion
des soins de sant&eacute; r&eacute;side dans les technologies de
l'information, et le nouveau R&eacute;seau de liaison et
d'application de l'information sur la sant&eacute; (HEALNet/RELAIS)
vise &agrave; permettre au syst&egrave;me de sant&eacute; canadien de
maintenir une longueur d'avance en ce sens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Par l'entremise de solides partenariats de
recherche avec des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s du secteur priv&eacute;,
des organismes de la recherche dans le domaine de la sant&eacute; et
des organismes professionnels, HEALNet/RELAIS mettra au point des
outils informatiques en vue d'am&eacute;liorer la sant&eacute; des
travailleurs canadiens, la productivit&eacute; en milieu de travail
et l'efficacit&eacute; du syst&egrave;me de sant&eacute;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">L'un des premiers outils
commercialis&eacute;s par HEALNet/RELAIS est le R&eacute;seau
d'informations cliniques (RIC). Ce r&eacute;seau est en fait un
progiciel d'exploitation cr&eacute;&eacute; express&eacute;ment pour
les besoins des h&ocirc;pitaux et des centres de sant&eacute; en
mati&egrave;re d'information. Il permet de relier les ordinateurs de
ces &eacute;tablissements en r&eacute;seau local (RL) de fa&ccedil;on
que les m&eacute;decins et autres professionnels de la sant&eacute;
puissent partager des donn&eacute;es et consulter des informations
issues de revues m&eacute;dicales ou d'autres sources. Le RIC est une
technologie des plus nouvelles et le premier r&eacute;seau
d'information clinique au Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ce syst&egrave;me est &eacute;galement
dot&eacute; d'un dispositif int&eacute;gr&eacute; qui surveille
l'utilisation du logiciel et qui s'av&eacute;rera utile pour
l'am&eacute;lioration des services offerts. Les versions futures
pr&eacute;voient la mise en place d'un r&eacute;seau longue distance
qui permettra le partage de donn&eacute;es entre
&eacute;tablissements et les communications sur l'Internet. Le but de
HEALNet/RELAIS, explique le gestionnaire du r&eacute;seau, Corey
Wentzell est de mettre sur pied un syst&egrave;me d'information
auquel les professionnels de la sant&eacute; peuvent facilement

Maintenir le potentiel forestier du pays</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le Canada est l'un des principaux
exportateurs mondiaux de produits du bois. En mati&egrave;re de
gestion durable des for&ecirc;ts, il doit faire face &agrave; des
pr&eacute;occupations mondiales qui peuvent avoir des
cons&eacute;quences sur ses activit&eacute;s commerciales.
Pr&eacute;server la for&ecirc;t bor&eacute;ale canadienne, tout en
assurant la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; de l'&eacute;conomie
foresti&egrave;re du pays, constitue l'objectif premier du
R&eacute;seau de centres d'excellence sur la gestion durable des
for&ecirc;ts (GDF), un des quatre nouveaux membres des RCE. Avec un
budget de 20 millions de $ r&eacute;partis sur quatre ans, 100
chercheurs de 23 universit&eacute;s poursuivront des travaux de
recherche dans diverses disciplines li&eacute;es &agrave; la gestion
des for&ecirc;ts, de la sylviculture &agrave; l'&eacute;cologie des
animaux, sans oublier les proc&eacute;d&eacute;s
m&eacute;caniques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">La for&ecirc;t bor&eacute;ale
(temp&eacute;r&eacute;e du Nord), compos&eacute;e en grande partie de
vieille for&ecirc;t situ&eacute;e dans les for&ecirc;ts les plus
susceptibles d'exploitation au Nord du Canada, constitue un
&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me fragile et le refuge estival
d'au-del&agrave; d'une centaine d'esp&egrave;ces d'oiseaux chanteurs
migrateurs. Comme elle est situ&eacute;e surtout au Nord, la
for&ecirc;t bor&eacute;ale poss&egrave;de une saison de croissance
raccourcie; sa r&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ration est lente, et sa
diversit&eacute; d'essences moindre comparativement aux for&ecirc;ts
des r&eacute;gions plus temp&eacute;r&eacute;es. La for&ecirc;t
bor&eacute;ale canadienne demeure l'une des derni&egrave;res
r&eacute;gions foresti&egrave;res bor&eacute;ales vierges du
monde.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">L'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique dans ces
for&ecirc;ts doit &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e avec un soin
particulier. R&eacute;unis sous quatre th&egrave;mes, les travaux du
r&eacute;seau visent globalement &agrave; assurer le
d&eacute;veloppement durable, en faisant appel aux plus
r&eacute;centes techniques foresti&egrave;res et m&eacute;thodes de
gestion respectueuses de l'environnement. En Alberta, cinq chercheurs
membres du r&eacute;seau font partie du Alberta Forest Management
Science Council, qui conseille le gouvernement provincial en
mati&egrave;re de politiques ax&eacute;es sur la pr&eacute;servation
des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes forestiers. Un partenaire important du
r&eacute;seau, le gouvernement de l'Alberta a r&eacute;cemment
annonc&eacute; qu'il contribuerait pour 3,2 millions de $ en
esp&egrave;ces aux activit&eacute;s du r&eacute;seau au cours des
trois prochaines ann&eacute;es.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le programme du r&eacute;seau comprend les
quatre th&egrave;mes suivants : &eacute;tude des
&eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes forestiers et incidences de
l'activit&eacute; humaine dans les for&ecirc;ts; incidences
socio-&eacute;conomiques de l'activit&eacute; humaine dans les
for&ecirc;ts; proc&eacute;d&eacute;s m&eacute;caniques
avanc&eacute;s, y compris l'&eacute;nergie et la gestion des
d&eacute;chets; et un dernier volet qui englobe les trois autres
th&egrave;mes en vue de l'&eacute;laboration de politiques et
pratiques de gestion durable des for&ecirc;ts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cette recherche portera surtout sur la
cr&eacute;ation d'une base de donn&eacute;es &eacute;cologiques
exhaustive et scientifiquement cr&eacute;dible sur l'ensemble de la
for&ecirc;t bor&eacute;ale, premi&egrave;re compilation du genre
&agrave; s'effectuer au pays. Ces renseignements seront recueillis
&agrave; des sites principaux de recherche, et combin&eacute;s
&agrave; de l'information collig&eacute;e &agrave; partir des divers
sites r&eacute;partis dans tout le pays.</FONT></P>

dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;s form&eacute;s en S et T devront non seulement
avoir une base solide dans leur discipline des sciences ou du

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les RCE permettent aux &eacute;tudiants
d'acqu&eacute;rir une exp&eacute;rience en milieu de travail qui
ajoute la perspective industrielle &agrave; leur formation

universitaire ou industriel, les &#171; dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;s &#187;

Nombre d'entre eux joignent les rangs d'entreprises directement
associ&eacute;es &agrave; leur projet ou &agrave; leur

deviennent rapidement tr&egrave;s productifs, leur p&eacute;riode

la direction des meilleurs chercheurs dans un discipline

<H2><FONT COLOR="#000000">Un mod&egrave;le
&eacute;prouv&eacute;</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Le Programme des RCE est administr&eacute;
conjointement par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et
en g&eacute;nie, le Conseil de recherches m&eacute;dicales et le
Conseil de recherches en sciences humaines, en collaboration avec
Industrie Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">En 1990, &agrave; la suite d'un concours
faisant appel &agrave; une rigoureuse &eacute;valuation par les pairs
&agrave; l'&eacute;chelle nationale et internationale, les 15
premiers r&eacute;seaux de centres d'excellence ont entam&eacute;
leurs activit&eacute;s dans le cadre de la Phase I du Programme. En
1994, &agrave; l'issue d'une seconde ronde d'&eacute;valuation par
les pairs, dix de ces r&eacute;seaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; retenus
pour la Phase II.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Chaque r&eacute;seau concentre ses efforts
dans un domaine de recherche qui pr&eacute;sente un potentiel de
retomb&eacute;es socio-&eacute;conomiques importantes pour le Canada,
et chacun d'entre eux a d&eacute;j&agrave; d&eacute;montr&eacute; son
potentiel prometteur en mati&egrave;re de nouvelles applications
industrielles. Chaque r&eacute;seau se compose d'&eacute;quipes de
chercheurs universitaires, industriels et gouvernementaux collaborant
&agrave; des projets dont le d&eacute;veloppement est jug&eacute;
prioritaire par les partenaires des secteurs priv&eacute; et
public.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Les mod&egrave;les novateurs de partenariats
de recherche plurisectorielle mis en place durant la Phase I ne
cessent d'&eacute;voluer. Une des nouvelles caract&eacute;ristiques
de la Phase II r&eacute;side dans l'importance accrue accord&eacute;e
&agrave; une approche interdisciplinaire faisant appel &agrave; la
collaboration des secteurs priv&eacute; et public et &agrave;
l'utilisation productive de l'investissement du Canada en
recherche.</FONT></P>

</H1>
<H3><HR SIZE="9">Rationale</H3>
Over 30 types of vegetables and ten types of fruits are produced in New
York, and the farm gate value of fruits and vegetables approaches $500 million
annually. These crops are grown through-out the state on 350,000 acres by
over 7,000 farmers. New York producers enjoy nearness to market, excellent
soils, and a favorable climate. Variable product quality, continually increasing
competition for markets, high labor requirements, difficulty in managing
pest complexes, and inadequate post-harvest handling and storage facilities
are among the challenges; but the most important challenge is finding production
practices that are environmentally sound and profitable. Both consumers
and growers will benefit from solving these problems. 
<H3><HR>Goals</H3>
To accomplish its mission the Department has developed a strategic plan
containing six goals: 
<UL>
  <LI>Provide a scientific basis for improvement of yield, quality, and
postharvest characteristics of fruits and vegetables, taking into consideration
economics, social concerns, and the environment. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Disseminate information about effective, economical, and environmentally
sound horticultural practices to commercial producers, processors, marketers,
and gardening clientele; and nurture leadership within the agricultural
community. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Provide undergraduate and graduate level educational programs that
attract the best students; educate them to anticipate and meet the changing
needs and roles of horticulture; and supply the nation and world with better
informed growers, scientists, and citizens. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Evaluate the core environmental issues of fruit and vegetable science
and provide the industry and consumers with information about economically
and environmentally viable practices. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Become familiar with fruit and vegetable production and utilization
in other lands, and in collaboration with colleagues in other countries
contribute to global horticulture through education, research, and outreach
activities. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Improve public understanding of and appreciation for commercial and
home production of fruits and vegetables. 
</UL>
<H3><HR><A HREF="../Faculty/faculty.html">Faculty</A></H3>
There are 14 faculty members in the department, 9 of whom work in vegetable
crops and 5 in fruit crops. (Our sister department at Geneva has five faculty
in vegetables and eight in fruits.) <BR>

<A NAME="bio"><CENTER><H2>Biographical Sketch</H2></CENTER></A>
I was raised on a farm in New York's Hudson Valley.  My undergraduate degree from
<A HREF="http://www.reed.edu/">Reed College</A> (1969) was in Literature and Languages, and after college I spent
several years writing and traveling in South America on a Watson Fellowship.  I
then worked for twelve years in California as a gardener and operating engineer
in the San Francisco Parks Department.  In 1983, I began graduate study in
Plant/Soil Biology at <A HREF="http://www.berkeley.edu/">U.C. Berkeley</A>, and then completed a Ph.D. in Pomology,
Plant Pathology, and Ecology at <A HREF="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</A> in 1990. 
Shortly thereafter I joined the Cornell faculty as a Pomologist with research and teaching
responsibilities.  I share a ramshackle old farmhouse in the nearby village of
Trumansburg (home of Taughannock Falls and the Rongovian Embassy) with my wife,
three kids and a dapper old greyhound.  On weekends, we are developing a family
orchard of old European apple varieties for premium hard cider production.
<p>
<A HREF="#top">[Back to Top]</A>
<hr>

<a name="research"><H2>Research Interests</H2></a>
My main research concern is the long-term sustainability of essential features
and functions in orchard agroecosystems. Active projects include:  screening
apple germplasm for resistance to soilborne diseases causing orchard replant
problems; field trials comparing alternative orchard floor vegetation and soil
management systems; developing IPM systems for orchard groundcover vegetation;
environmental physiology and morphology of apple roots; variety and heritability
tests of Asian chestnuts; and monitoring nutrient and pesticide retention/cycling
in orchards.

Incompatibility in tomatoes in the cross between Lycopersicon esculentum
x L. peruvianum.  This desirable cross has been made numerous times by plant
breeders, but the resulting F1 hybrids are extremely rare.  A small percent
of research time is committed to greenhouse tomato production.  As the coordinator
of the department anatomical laboratory, some time is available to provide
technical assistance to graduate students who are conducting anatomical
research as part of their thesis.  Additional research include pollen physiology,
mechanisms of fruit set, blossom end rot of tomato and pepper, plant anatomy,

<H3><CENTER> THE USE OF ROWCOVERS IN THE HOME GARDEN</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Late frosts, low yields, a short growing season and insect damage are four
common problems that home gardeners would rather do without. Fortunately,
the development of rowcovers has added a new dimension to the eco-gardener's
management strategy. Rowcovers are available in a variety of materials,
including both plastics and fabrics. They can enhance yields of some crops,
while producing an early harvest on others. They may offer a few degrees
of frost protection, and when properly used, they can effectively block
the feeding activity of some insects.<BR>
<BR>
<B>EXTENDING THE SEASON</B><BR>
<BR>
The use of protective coverings to produce a miniature greenhouse effect
is certainly not a new idea. A popular practice among some European growers
in the early 1900's was to place glass bell jars over individual plants.
It was reported in 1910 that there were over 2 million of these jars being
used in the Paris vicinity alone.<BR>
<BR>
Less expensive paper materials were eventually developed which replaced
the bell jars, and by the mid 1950's &quot;hot caps&quot; or &quot;hot tents&quot;
were being used in several areas of the United States. Although these are
still in use in home gardens today, many gardeners are enthusiastic about
the advantages that rowcovers have to offer.<BR>
<BR>
The ideal rowcover would be one which is inexpensive, prevents air temperatures
from falling below freezing at night, increases growing degree-days, and
avoids excessively high temperatures and humidity that can have a negative
impact on growth and flower development. If you have already done some experimenting
with rowcovers on your own, you probably have already found that no such
ideal material exists at this time. In fact, there are no rowcovers that
can offer more than a few degrees of frost protection. Their major benefit
is associated with more rapid growth by increasing daytime temperatures,
not with frost protection.<BR>
<BR>
Cooler rowcover materials can be selected so that the risk of damaging high
temperatures is minimized, but keep in mind that cooler materials will not
increase growth and yield as quickly. You may want to use a cooler tunnel
or hot caps on most of your plants, and a warmer but riskier product for
earliest yields on a few plants. An approximate ranking of row cover types
from warmest to coolest would be: <BR>
<BR>
TEMP 			HOTTEST ------------------------------------------------------------&gt;COOLEST<BR>
COVER 			Clear &gt;&gt;		Spunbonded = White &gt;		Woven = 	Clear  &gt;&gt;
White <BR>
MATERIAL 		w/holes		fabrics 		 w/holes		 fabrics 		slitted 	slitted <BR>
<BR>
Most plastic rowcovers are supported by wire hoops. After the crop is planted,
10 gauge hardened galvanized wire pieces (36 in. long for 4 ft. plastic,
48 in. for 5 ft. plastic) are bent in the shape of an arch and placed in
the soil at 3-4 ft. intervals. Do not place hoops directly over the plants
so that you can create slits for ventilation or irrigation if necessary.
The height of the tunnel is determined by the height of the crop to be grown.<BR>
<BR>
Floating rowcovers made of lightweight spunbonded or woven fabrics can be
placed loosely over the plants without wire supports. The edges can be held
down with soil or stones. These are easier to apply, and are the choice
for small gardens. Fabric materials can be used again unless they have been
damaged or ripped.<BR>
<BR>
Proper ventilation is essential, particularly with the hottest materials.
Growers drill holes in the rolls of plastic prior to application; home gardeners
may do this or slit plastic after it has been rolled out. Allowing excessive
heat buildup is the most costly and most common error with first-time rowcover
users. As a general rule, if outside air temperatures approach 80 degrees
F., additional ventilation should be considered. In years with unseasonably
warm temperatures, covers do more harm than good.<BR>
<BR>
Normally, rowcovers are removed from vegetable crops 3-4 weeks after transplanting,
and from Junebearing strawberries at the beginning of bloom to allow bees
to pollinate. You may want to allow plants to acclimate gradually by increasing
the size of slits over a 3-7 day period prior to complete removal.<BR>
<BR>
<B>INSECT CONTROL</B><BR>
<BR>
For insect control, rowcovers must go on before the insects are present.
Also, rotate the location of crops that attract insectpests that overwinter
in the soil. If you don't you may increase insect problems by trapping the
insects with their food source. For row covers to be effective barriers
to insects, they must be sealed at the sides and ends of the rows, (i.e.,
edges covered with soil) so that insects cannot crawl under them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SPECIFIC CROP RESPONSES<BR>
<BR>
Heritage Red Raspberry:</B> Rowcovers are applied after pruning plants to
the ground in March, and are removed 2 months later. The response to rowcover
may vary between years, but in general, the use of rowcover can help to
enhance the early production of the crop. This is beneficial since the harvest
of 'Heritage', a late season raspberry, is often prematurely terminated
by frost.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Junebearing Strawberries:</B> Rowcovers can enhance both early production
and yield of strawberries. In gardens experiencing high winds, cold temperatures
and inconsistent snowfalls, mulch the strawberries with straw in the late
fall. Remove the straw after March 1, and cover the plants immediately with
the rowcovers. Place rowcovers over the plants in the late winter. Remove
the covers as soon as the plants begin to blossom in the spring, or the
rowcovers may interfere with pollination. Use spunbonded materials; plastics
may enhance earliness to the point of creating problems with late spring
frost.<BR>
<BR>
Rowcovers can also reduce injury by tarnished plant bug. Due to accelerated
flowering, the insects are present after the susceptible stage of development.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Muskmelon:</B> The most success using tunnels on vegetable crops has
occurred with muskmelon. Ventilated clear plastic is often used. A 7-10
day jump on the season with an increase in yields can be attained. Melons
are not particularly sensitive to the high temperatures which sometimes
develop with the clear plastic tunnel. Remove tunnels when the plant begins
to flower.(Also see vine crops)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Summer Squash:</B> Similar to melons, it is one of the easiest and most
responsive crops to grow under tunnels.(Also see vine crops)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cucumber:</B> More sensitive to high temperatures than melons, the cucumber
can still show a very positive response to tunnels. When temperatures are
cool, a clear tunnel with holes may be best, but ventilated white plastic
or fabric tunnels, however, are safest.(Also see vine crops)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Pepper:</B> Flower abortion and loss of early yields can occur under
high temperatures, so adequate ventilation is critical. Early growth and
early yield can be successfully obtained with ventilated white plastic.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tomato:</B> In general, rowcovers are not recommended for this crop.
Loss of early yields due to high temperature is the major problem; although
vegetative growth and total yield may be enhanced, early fruit are frequently
small or absent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cole Crops, Lettuce, Spinach, Celery:</B> Rowcovers increase early production
with these crops. Most are well-suited to floating rowcovers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Spinach, Beets, and Chard:</B> Rowcovers can help provide protection
from leafminers. Place over the newly seeded crop and remove at harvest
(spinach) or when plants outgrow them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vine Crops:</B> Rowcovers can exclude striped cucumber beetle which can
vector bacterial wilt. Rowcovers need to be removed at flowering time for
pollination to occur.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>NATURE'S BOTANICAL INSECTICIDE ARSENAL </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Botanically-derived insecticides have gained favor in recent years, due
in part to the perception that, because they originate from plant material,
they are more safe or &quot;natural&quot;. These pesticides are often used
for growing crops organically, according to guidelines set forth by certification
programs. However, it is important to be aware that they are pesticides,
and that they fall under the same state and federal regulations as synthetic
pesticides. All pesticides must be labelled for the specific pest(s) on
the particular crop(s) for their use to be legal. If the use is not stated
on the label, then the pesticide is not legal to employ.<BR>
<BR>
It is important to realize that produce grown using botanical insecticides
is not &quot;pesticide free.&quot; Botanical pesticides also leave residues,
can be disruptive to natural enemies, and may be toxic to humans. Therefore
the same precautions must be taken in the use of these materials as with
synthetic pesticides. Relying heavily on the use of any pesticide is a rash,
unecological practice. Conversely, using botanical insecticides prudently
when needed can aid the gardener.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately for the home gardener, traditional outlets such as garden centers
and nurseries are increasingly stocking botanical insecticides; they are
more readily available in small containers than in commercial quantities.
Pyrethrum based insecticides are widely available but the supply may be
limited. Check with your local supply source to see which they carry and
what they can special order.<BR>
<BR>
The following are some commercially available botanicals:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sabadilla:</B> This compound was first used in the sixteenth century,
and grew in popularity in this country during the second World War when
other botanicals such as pyrethrum and rotenone were in short supply. The
insecticidal dust is made from the seeds of a small perennial bulb in the
Lily family. The toxic components are lacking in other plant parts (roots,
bulbs, stems and leaves). Commercial supplies come from South and Central
America. It is interesting that the toxic constituents actually become more
powerful after storage; fresh sabadilla extracts have not proven to be a
strong insecticide. Sabadilla is a broad spectrum contact poison, and may
have some action as a stomach poison also. Sabadilla is toxic to honeybees.
It is most effective against leafhoppers and true bugs. It degrades rapidly
on exposure to air and sunlight, leaving very little residual toxicity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ryania:</B> The insecticidal properties are contained in the stems and
roots of Ryania speciosa, a South American shrub. Although it acts as a
stomach poison, ryania often depresses the insects feeding initially, so
that it undergoes a long period of inactivity before death. Its residual
period is longer than the other botanicals. Relative to rotenone, ryania
is moderate in acute or chronic oral toxicity in mammals; this is partly
why much attention has been given to this insecticide in recent years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Rotenone:</B> This important, widely used insecticide is derived from
several tropical leguminous plants, including derris, cube and timbo. These
plants range from the Far East to the Amazon Valley of South America. Many
plant species have been shown to contain rotenone. In general, the rotenone
principles are contained in the roots, which are dried and powdered to be
used as a dust. Liquid rotenone is available commercially.<BR>
<BR>
Rotenone was originally employed by Native American and other indigenous
cultures to poison fish. It should by no means be considered &quot;non-poisonous&quot;
to animals; in fact, it has been shown to be fatal to mammals if inhaled
over extended periods, and may cause numbness of the lips and tongue if
exposure during application is constant. Dermatitis may result if rotenone
comes in contact with the skin, but it does not appear to be absorbed through

Rotenone is effective against a wide range of insects and has a short residual
life. It acts as a stomach poison and as a contact insecticide. It is not
toxic to honeybees, but will kill some beneficial insects. It is registered
for use against a number of chewing insects on many vegetables and some
fruits. Different brands and formulations of rotenone are labelled for various
pests; <B>always check the label before purchase to ensure that the product
is legal for the intended use.<BR>
<BR>
Pyrethrum and Pyrethrins:</B> Pyrethrum is the natural product that comes
from the ground up dried flower head of the African chrysanthemum, <I>Chrysanthemum
cinerariaefolium</I>. Pyrethrins refer to the insecticidal compounds that
occur in pyrethrum. Pyrethrins affect the insect on contact, creating disturbances
in the nervous system which eventually result in convulsions and death.
Low doses, however, often cause temporary paralysis from which the insect
may recover. Pyrethrum has almost no residual activity, breaking down rapidly
on exposure to sunlight, air or moisture. One study in 1937 demonstrated
that finer powders are more rapid in action on insects, but deteriorate
more quickly upon exposure to light. Activators (like PBO) or other &quot;synergists&quot;
are occasionally added to pyrethrins to extend their use, but many of these
are not approved by organic certification programs. The insecticidal activity
(if any) of these extenders varies.<BR>
<BR>
Pyrethrum and pyrethrins are widely available, but supplies may be limited.
They are effective as broad spectrum insecticides and will control pests
such as aphids, whiteflies, stinkbugs, and mites. Be sure the brand that
you purchase is labelled for use on the crop and pest in question. Like
rotenone, pyrethrum and pyrethrins should be used with caution. Pyrethrum's
hazard to humans lies mainly in the form of allergic reactions and dermatitis.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>A GUIDE TO THE NUTRIENT VALUE OF ORGANIC MATERIALS </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Many home gardeners want to grow fruits and vegetables with organic sources
of fertilizer. Considering the many benefits of the addition of organic
materials, this subject warrants attention. Manures and composted plant
materials add organic matter. This aids in moisture retention, helps reduce
compaction and can buffer extremes in pH. It also helps maintain the structure
and nutrient holding capacity of the soil. <BR>
<BR>
However, the nutrient level of organic materials is lower, rate of release
is slower, and levels of minerals may vary and are not balanced. The information
below will help you interpret differences in nutrient content and relative
availability of organic materials. <BR>
<BR>
Fruits and vegetables often have high nitrogen demands, and it can be difficult
to provide sufficient nitrogen from an organic source throughout the growing
season of the crop. In addition, availability of nitrogen late in the season
can make perennial plants such as raspberries and apples susceptible to
winter injury. It is a challenge to provide plants with a readily available
organic nitrogen source early in the growing season, yet have it less available
in late summer. <BR>
<BR>
Much variability exists in the composition of similar organic materials.
For example, manure with straw will have a different nitrogen composition
than pure manure, and the rate of nitrogen release may be slower because
of the higher amount of carbon in the straw. The table lists the approximate
composition of various organic materials, and the nitrogen, potassium and
phosphorus that can be provided from them. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>IMPROVE YOUR SOIL WITH COVER CROPS </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
At the end of the growing season you may be ready to rest, but your garden
is not. One final effort can make a big difference: cover cropping. Even
small gardens will benefit from the use of cover crops, or &quot;green manures&quot;.
Tilling, weeding, harvesting and foot traffic of most home gardens tends
to destroy soil structure. Planting cover crops is an easy way to revitalize
the soil, and help soil tilth and subsequent plant growth. Cover crops are
planted in vacant space and worked into the soil after they grow instead
of being eaten. They provide a number of advantages to the otherwise wasteful
use of space during your garden's off-season. <BR>
<BR>
Cover crops help to retain the soil, lessen erosion, and decrease the impact
of precipitation on the garden by slowing the runoff of water. They also
reduce mineral leaching and compaction, and suppress perennial and winter
annual weed growth. The top growth adds organic matter when it is tilled
into the garden soil. The cover crop's root system also provides organic
matter and opens passageways that help improve air and water movement in
the soil. <BR>
<BR>
Success in the growth of cover crops requires proper selection of the kind
of cover crop, correct timing of seeding, and good management techniques.
There are many traditional cover crops to select from, including annual
ryegrass, winter rye, winter wheat, oats, white clover, sweet clover, hairy
vetch and buckwheat. Grasses are easier to grow than legumes such as clover
because they germinate more quickly and do not require inoculation. Small
seeded crops are more difficult to establish than large seeded types such
as oats and buckwheat. In poorly drained areas, grasses may be easier to
get started. Winter rye and ryegrass grow in a very dense habit and are
much more effective at shading out weeds than oats or small seeded legumes.
Availability of seed and cost are other important considerations. <BR>
<BR>
If sections of the garden are free during late spring or early summer, clovers,
fescue or buckwheat can be planted. If garden space is available in August,
barley, annual ryegrass, oats, and clover can be successfully established.
The last date when cover crops can be planted in New York will vary with
the region, but most New York gardeners should plan to plant cover crops
by the end of September. By the beginning of October, only rye and winter
wheat can be productively started. <BR>
<BR>
Cover crops such as annual ryegrass, oats, and buckwheat do not overwinter.
These crops are the easiest to work with when spring arrives since their
tops have died back curing the winter. Perennial ryegrass and winter rye
produce a massive amount of top growth in the spring and may be difficult
to incorporate. However, perennial grasses are an advantage in wet areas,
since the soil will dry more rapidly than a soil with winterkilled crops.
If this is the case, before the leaves grow too tall in the spring they
should be cut back once with a mower or scythe. <BR>
<BR>
Given all of the above information, how does one choose? For New York conditions,
annual ryegrass should be considered first for a garden cover crop. It is
a vigorous grower with an extensive root system that occupies the same root
zone as the garden plants. Winter rye is another good choice that is best
for late planting. <BR>
<BR>
To plant a cover crop, rake the garden area smooth and remove debris or
large stones. Broadcast the seed according to the rates on the chart below.
Lightly rake again, and water in the cover crop with your hose set at a
fine mist. <BR>
<BR>
The following chart provides an overview of the cover crops at a glance.
Seed can be purchased at your local garden center or farm store. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>COMPANION PLANTING</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Most people think of plants as very passive organisms. They grow almost
unperceptively, and only once a year do they flower or produce edible products.
However, plants are very active in ways that are not so obvious to the casual
observer. For example, plants change the chemistry of the soil, and influence
the types of microorganisms that grow there. They actively compete with
other plants for space. Some will poison their neighbor's offspring to maintain
a competitive advantage, while others change the environment in ways that
benefit other species. Plants wage a constant battle with insects, relying
heavily on chemical warfare.<BR>
<BR>
Naturalists have known about these properties of plants for thousands of
years. For example, about 2,000 years ago the Roman agriculturalist, Varro,
declared &quot;Large walnut trees close by, make the border of the farm
sterile.&quot; Chemicals in oak leaves retard the development of insects
that feed on them. Some insecticides are derived from plants; examples include
rotenone, sabadilla and ryania. But not all effects of plants are deleterious
on other organisms. Alfalfa and clover enrich the soil with nitrogen that
they capture from the air. Certain trees move groundwater to the soil surface
where shallow-rooted plants can grow even under droughty conditions. Groups
of plants which grow well together are called &quot;companions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the best historical example of companion planting is the &quot;Three
Sisters&quot; in which corn, beans, and squash are planted together in a
hill. Native Americans developed this system to provide food for a balanced
diet from a single plot of land. Each of the crops is compatible with the
others in some way. The tall corn stalks provide a support structure for
the climbing beans. The beans do not compete strongly with the corn for
nutrients since as legumes, they can supply their own nitrogen. Squash provides
a dense ground cover that shades out many weeds which otherwise would compete
with the corn and beans.<BR>
<BR>
Modern agriculture tends to rely heavily upon specialized machinery and
synthetic inputs, and have rendered companion systems such as the &quot;Three
Sisters&quot; obsolete. Obviously, it would be difficult to harvest corn,
beans and squash simultaneously with a machine, especially when they are
not planted separately in rows. However, interest is growing in using these
special properties of plants to our advantage when growing food. Home gardeners,
unencumbered by the need for specialized equipment or row crop production,
have rediscovered some of the beneficial interrelationships among plants.
This knowledge, coupled with a long tradition of folklore, is being utilized
to improve home garden production.<BR>
<BR>
<B>HOW CAN THESE SPECIAL PROPERTIES OF PLANTS BE USED?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Selecting a cover crop</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Certain cover crops concentrate specific nutrients in their tissues. Deeply
rooted plants move nutrients from the subsoil to the aboveground parts,
and when the plants decompose, the nutrients become available for subsequent
crops. Potassium levels can be increased significantly by selecting a good
preplant cover crop. Buckwheat, grain rye, and sudangrass are good preplant
covers.<BR>
<BR>
Plants in the legume family are capable of gathering unusable nitrogen from
the air and converting it into usable nitrogen in root nodules, with the
help of special bacteria. Legumes increase soil fertility as they decompose,
thus releasing the stored nitrogen. An alfalfa sod that is plowed under
will provide 150 to 200 lbs of nitrogen per acre the following year, 60
to 80 lbs the year after, and 30 to 40 lbs the year after that. In fact,
any cover crop that is plowed under will release nitrogen as the crop decomposes.
This is the origin of the term &quot;green manure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Many plants produce substances that are toxic to other plants. The study
of this phenomenon is called &quot;allelopathy.&quot; Varro's observation
was explained by the discovery of a substance called juglone - a natural
herbicide produced by the roots of walnut trees. Many plants have allelopathic
effects including sunflowers, cucumbers, oats, alfalfa, rye and tobacco.
When these crops are planted prior to other crops, weed pressure is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Enhancing environmental conditions for growth</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Maple trees can move groundwater from their lower roots to the upper roots,
where it is exuded into the soil. Herbaceous plants can use this groundwater
when conditions are dry. Shade tolerant plants often grow better under the
trees than away from them.<BR>
<BR>
Certain garden plants grow better if provided with some shade, while others
need to be elevated above the ground to capture sunlight. Leaf lettuce grows
well in the shade provided by taller crops. Rhododendrons and azaleas thrive
under pine trees. Corn growers will often seed clover between rows so it
will germinate after the corn is established. The clover grows throughout
the fall and winter after the corn is harvested, increasing soil nitrogen
when it decomposes the following spring.<BR>
<BR>
Grasses often are planted between rows of perennial crops such as fruit
trees. The grass alleys cool the soil, prevent erosion, improve water penetration,
exclude weeds, and harbor beneficial insects. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Reducing pest damage</I></B><BR>
<BR>
Most plants produce defensive chemicals that help fend off insects and diseases.
These chemicals may be insect poisons, feeding deterrents or have fungicidal
properties. The roots of some French and African marigolds contain a substance
which is toxic to certain types of nematodes. Nematodes are soil inhabiting
microscopic roundworms that damage many species of plants. Certain nematodes
can be eliminated from a site by growing a thick crop of marigolds for one
season prior to planting the vegetable or fruit crop, or by interplanting
marigolds between crop rows.<BR>
<BR>
Destructive insects often locate their food by smell. Many plants, especially
culinary herbs, produce strong scents which may confuse insect pests looking
for a host to feed on. Garden vegetable plants such as garlic, onions, chives,
and herbs such as catnip, horehound, wormwood, basil, tansy, and mints all
produce scents which seem to repel insects or mask the scents which attract
insects. A certain level of insect protection can be achieved by carefully
interplanting some of these as companions to vegetables.<BR>
<BR>
Many insect pests have specific food preferences while others feed on a
wide assortment of hosts. Even those species which feed on a wide variety
of hosts, such as Japanese beetles, have preferences for certain plants.
It is possible to plant a preferred host as a trap crop near the plant that
is being protected. Once the insects have settled on the &quot;trap&quot;
crop, they can be killed periodically by spraying, without having to treat
the protected plants.<BR>
<BR>
Many insects are helpful because they eat or parasitize harmful insects.
Most species of wasps and spiders are beneficial as are ground beetles,
praying mantids, lady bugs, pirate bugs, and several species of flies. It
is possible to attract beneficial insects by planting flowers near the garden.
Dill, parsley, carrot, coriander, angelica, and parsnip feature flat topped
clusters of small flowers that have strong fragrances. They also seem to
attract large numbers of beneficial insects, particularly predatory wasps
and flies. This characteristic makes them good candidates for companion
planting.<BR>
<BR>
<B>HOW CAN HOME GARDENERS UTILIZE COMPANION PLANTING?<BR>
<BR>
HERE ARE SEVERAL PRACTICAL STEPS:</B><BR>
<BR>
Avoid monoculture in terms of space and time. A one-hundred foot long row
of broccoli presents a large target for a cabbage moth that is flying by,
but the same number of cabbage plants scattered over several thousand square
feet, and interplanted with other crops, is less obvious and attractive
to the insect. Pests which routinely plague large, commercial plantings
of crops may never be a problem in the diversified home garden. <BR>
<BR>
Know thy friends and avoid killing them inadvertently. Learn to recognize
beneficial insects as well as the pests, and note which plants are attractive
to beneficial insects. Less than 1% of insects are garden pests.<BR>
<BR>
Plant dill, marigolds, chives, onions, parsley, basil and other flowers
throughout the garden. Allow parsley, carrot and celery to remain in the
ground over the winter. They will produce flowers the second season and
attract beneficial insects. Also, plant strong smelling herbs among vegetable
crops.<BR>
<BR>
Try some combinations that folklore says are effective companions. Chives
could be planted at the base of roses to repel aphids, garlic could be planted
at the base of peach trees to repel borers; basil planted among tomatoes
may repel tomato hornworms; nasturtiums grown near squash may repel squash
bugs; tomatoes planted among asparagus may repel asparagus beetles; and
marigolds, mint, thyme, or chamomile may repel cabbage moths. Radishes make
excellent trap crops for cucumber beetles among squash and cucumbers. Radishes
also attract flea beetles when planted near cole crops. Garden borders planted
with low growing thyme or lavender may deter slugs. Tansy and pennyroyal
repel ants.<BR>
<BR>
Observe your plantings carefully, and write down combinations that seem
to work for pest control and growth enhancement. Communicate your observations
with others. Try to replicate your observations or have others try the same
combinations. Testimonials that are shared by many observers often turn
out to be valid. Scientists have not spent much time looking at these relationships
among plants and their community; furthermore, the number of possible combinations
is enormous. You can be the first one to discover a new set of compatible
plants!<BR>

<H5><I>BAD SCIENCE<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, much of the popular literature that discusses companion planting
is based upon some very bad science, in particular, the &quot;sensitive
crystallization method&quot; which was originated by Dr. Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer
in the 1930's. Dr. Pfeiffer was a student of Dr. Rudolf Steiner, the founder
of &quot;Biodynamics.&quot; The sensitive crystallization method utilizes
chromatography to discover why plants make good or bad companions.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Pfeiffer made chromatograms of many different plants, both individually
and in combination. He concluded that mixtures of plants which formed clear
and bright chromatograms were mutually beneficial, while mixtures that formed
cloudy or dull chromatograms were antagonistic. Thus, the notion that &quot;carrots
love tomatoes&quot; but &quot;beans dislike fennel&quot; is based upon an
analytical laboratory procedure and not on direct observation of the plants
in nature. No legitimate scientist believes that this method can determine
compatibility among plant species.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Pfeiffer also made chromatograms of many other substances including
chemical fertilizers and compost. According to Louise Riotte in her book
Carrots Love Tomatoes, &quot;the chemical (fertilizer) yielded chromatograms
that were dull and lifeless but the ones made from the compost were brilliant
with color.&quot; Ms. Riotte continues by asking &quot;Could this have been
because of the living microorganisms continued in the compost? This supposition
seems logical.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the supposition is not the least bit logical from a scientific
viewpoint, and has no relevance for determining plant nutritional needs.
It is this type of bad science that has created a hostility between the
scientific community and many proponents of biodynamic gardening. </I></H5>

<P><CENTER>MINIMUM EFFORT ORNAMENTALS</B></CENTER>
<P>	Low maintenance plantings are in vogue these days.  As homeowners' lives
become more and more hectic, the desire to plant trees and shrubs that require
minimal care is increased.  Fortunately, there are many available ornamentals
that are not troubled by a huge pest complex, and that do appear pleasing
with little care.  However, a little planning in advance is still necessary
for developing an attractive planting that is likely to last for many years.
 Even the easiest-to-care-for ornamentals still have basic needs that must
be met before they will thrive.  Therefore, matching the site limitations
or opportunities to the plants' requirements will go far toward achieving
&quot;low maintenance&quot; status.  Before you can make the best choice,
you need to assess your site, both above and below ground.<BR>
<BR>
	The following information will help you to assess your site before choosing
the best plants for the location you have in mind.  Examples of plants are
given, but the resources at the end will provide you with more in-depth
lists of recommended ornamentals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>BELOW GROUND CONSIDERATIONS<BR>
<BR>
<I>Restricted Rooting Space</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	Are there underground obstacles to consider?  Do you see noticeable compaction
near driveways and sidewalks?  This potential restriction of the rooting
zone very much limits the amount of water, nutrients, and oxygen available
to the plant.  The addition of organic matter will provide more suitable
soil conditions for growing annuals and perennials.  Drought tolerant trees
such as Japanese Tree Lilac (Syringa reticulata) do reasonably well in compacted
soils.  However, since roots typically grow no deeper than three feet and
can spread to two or three times beyond the dripline, a large space should
be allowed before planting.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Soil Texture</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	What is the texture of your soil?  Is it light, dry and sandy, or is it
a heavy, clay soil that tends to take a long time to drain?  Perhaps you're
fortunate, and have a well-drained loamy soil.  This important piece of
information will help you to select ornamentals that are well-adapted to
your soil conditions.  While some are tolerant of a wide range of conditions,
others perform best in more specific locations.  For example, the American
Hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana) is a small tree worthy of planting, and
although it will tolerate some intermittent drought, it prefers moist, shaded
soils.  <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Soil pH</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	The pH is a measure of how acid or alkaline the soil is; a simple pH test
can determine your site's characteristics.  Most urban soils have a high
pH (nearer to neutral or more alkaline in nature) due to the limestone containing
materials in the street environment; rural and suburban soils vary greatly
throughout the state.  The Hedge Maple (Acer campestre), Thornless Hawthorn
'Ohio Pioneer' (Crataegus punctata inermis 'Ohio Pioneer') and Swedish Mountain
Ash (Sorbus intermedia) are all examples of low maintenance small trees
that will tolerate a high pH soil.  Tallhedge (Rhamnus frangula) is an upright
shrub that will tolerate alkaline soil.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Drainage</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	Poor drainage due to compaction, underground obstacles, or the inherent
nature of the soil can easily be determined before you make the wrong selection.
 Place an open-ended coffee can where you want to plant; pour water in and
observe the time it takes to drain.  If the water hasn't drained at least
one inch in an hour,  you may want to modify the drainage in the area by
using raised beds or supplemental drains, or choose species that can tolerate
&quot;wet feet.&quot;  The London Planetree (Platanus x acerifolia) is an
example of a tall (70-100 ft.) tree which can tolerate either wet or dry
soil.  Astilbe (Astilbe species) is a perennial that will tolerate moist
sites.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Road Salt</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	Many homeowners are unpleasantly surprised to discover that some of their
favorite roadside trees, such as the Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) and Red
Maple (A. rubrum) are actually very sensitive to salt injury.  On the other
hand, Honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos) and Callery Pear (Pyrus calleryana)
can tolerate salt. In an area of high road salt or sidewalk salt applications,
appropriate species can be planted to minimize damage later on.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ABOVE GROUND CONSIDERATIONS<BR>
<BR>
<I>USDA Temperature Zones</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	All trees chosen for your planting should be cold hardy.  Areas near large
lakes and oceans (e.g., the Finger Lakes, Ontario, Erie, Long Island) tend
to be somewhat buffered from severe temperatures, while urban environments
often fluctuate more in temperature due to heat from buildings.  Buildings
in cities often provide some shelter from drying winds;  plants in containers
are more susceptible to cold winter temperatures than those in the ground.
 If this seems confusing, a good rule of thumb is to choose plants that
conform to your zone or lower (colder temperatures).  There is a USDA zone
map in the Recommended Urban Trees publication listed in the resource section.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Exposure</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	Take a close look at how much exposure to wind your site receives.  Is
it protected from winds?  Excessively windy sites will often place stress
on plants with large leaves, which leads to unsightly leaf tatter.  Also,
plants in these sites may need supplemental watering so they do not dry
out as quickly.  Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) is a medium to large tree
which is quite wind resistant.<BR>
<BR>
	Think about exposure to light as well.  Shady sites determined by the sun
and shade patterns around buildings, as well as nearby trees, may limit
the choice of plants.  Most trees and shrubs require full sun, but a few
such as Katsura Tree (Cercidiphyllum japonicum) tolerate partial shade.
 Bleeding Heart (Dicentra species) is a perennial that will do well in partial
shade.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Building Set-Back, Overhead Wires</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	The presence of physical barriers to plant growth above ground, such as
a narrow building set back from the street and/or overhead wires, requires
the choice of a tree or shrub which will not interfere with these structures.
 Columnar trees or those with low mature heights (less that 30 feet) can
be used in these situations.  There are many small trees and shrubs to choose
from (see resource list at the end of this fact sheet); an example of a
columnar tree is Princeton Sentry Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba 'Princeton Sentry').<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Surfaces that Surround Buildings</I></B><BR>
<BR>
	Concrete, asphalt, car tops, mirrored building surfaces, etc., increase
the reflected and irradiated heat load on a tree, which can cause it to
heat up and lose water from its leaves at a faster rate than normal.  Drought
resistant plants should always be selected in those circumstances.  A good
example of a drought tolerant tree is the Yellow Chestnut Oak (Quercus muehlenbergii).
 Coneflower (Rudbeckia speciosa) is a perennial that will tolerate dry,
hot conditions.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>GROWING STONE FRUITS IN NEW YORK</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
	Peaches, plums, cherries and apricots are known as &quot;stone fruits&quot;
because they have similar hard &quot;pits&quot; or stoney seeds.  Native
wild plums and cherries were gathered by the Iroquois and Algonquins, and
the other common stone fruits have been grown for more than 300 years in
New York State, but they are a minor part of our important fruit industry.
 Skill and luck are both required to harvest a good crop of these fruits
in New York, because we are at the northern edge of their suitable climate
region.  Winter and spring cold injury to the flowers, buds, roots and trunks
is common.  Many of our soils are too shallow, wet or infertile for stone
fruits, and there are several diseases and insects likely to damage the
trees and fruit.  Despite these problems, many New Yorkers take a chance
on these fruit crops, because the rewards are great when you beat the odds!
  Ripe stone fruits are delicate and perishable, so they taste best when
they are grown, marketed and consumed locally.   For those who think the
risks are worth the rewards of home grown fruit, here are some suggestions
to improve your chances of success.<BR>
<BR>
<B>COLD INJURY</B><BR>
<BR>
	Peaches are the least winter hardy stone fruit; flower buds are often killed
by winter temperatures below  -15&#176;  F, and entire trees can be killed
below -25&#176;  F.  Only a few regions in New York have winters usually
mild enough to be safe for peaches--along the deep Finger Lakes and Great
Lakes, on Long Island, and in the lower Hudson Valley.  The other stone
fruits are more resistant to winter cold--almost as hardy as apples.  However,
all stone fruits are prone to frost injury during bloomtime, because they
flower a few weeks earlier than apples. The hazards of deep-freeze or spring
frost injury increase at sites farther away from the major lakes, northward,
and upward in elevation.  The safest sites are on slopes near the lakes
or along valley side-slopes, but not on bottom lands where coldest air often
settles.  Protected microclimates against south-facing slopes or walls of
substantial buildings also provide some relief from cold, but the daily
temperature fluctuations in these microclimates can be extreme, which creates
additional problems for the trees.  Stone fruit trees have rather thin bark,
and a protective coat of white latex paint on trunks and lower branches
is helpful to prevent &quot;sunscald&quot; or &quot;southwest injury&quot;
caused by rapid temperature oscillations on clear, cold winter days. <BR>
<BR>
	Some varieties are more cold-tolerant or bloom later than others.  The
popular 'Redhaven' peach has proven its ability to survive northeastern
winters since it was introduced back in the 1940s, and it produces fruit
of good quality.   About a dozen newer peach and apricot varieties have
been developed by Canada's Harrow Research Station--they all have names
beginning &quot;Har-&quot; (for example, 'Harrow Diamond', 'Harcot', 'Harbrite',
 'Harrow Beauty').  These are excellent varieties for home growers, because
they were selected for good fruit quality, cold hardiness and improved disease
resistance.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOIL REQUIREMENTS<BR>
</B><BR>
	Stone fruits are notoriously fussy about soil moisture and fertility. 
Where the soil is saturated for long periods during the dormant season,
or for more than a few days continuously during the growing season, trees
will not thrive.  The best sites are upland gravelly or sandy loams.  Soils
with high clay or silt content can be improved somewhat for stone fruits
by installing sub-soil drainage lines or surface water diversion ditches.
 Mounding up the area where trees will be planted into raised beds several
feet above grade is also helpful.  Peach trees require ample soil nitrogen
and water during the growing season. It is essential to keep them growing
vigorously because most of their fruit is produced in lateral buds on one-year
old shoots.  Water during the month before harvest is also important to
develop adequate fruit size.  Since most stone fruits ripen during mid to
late summer, there is often a long post-harvest period when you can let
a few weeds grow and the soil dry out periodically to &quot;harden off&quot;
the trees.  This moderate stress will slow down the new shoot growth in
early autumn, allowing the woody shoots, trunk and roots to store carbohydrates
and other nutrients in preparation for the next winter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>PEST MANAGEMENT</B><BR>
<BR>
	Many birds, mammals, insects, fungi, and bacteria compete with humans for
the tender, nourishing stone fruits. The two most serious diseases of all
stone fruits are brown rot  and perennial cankers.  The brown rot fungus
(Monilinia fructicola) infects blossoms in spring, and fruit at harvest
time.  Symptoms are blighted flowers and twigs, and powdery grey-brown spores
erupting from ripening fruit.  When rains occur during bloom and near harvest,
this disease is a real problem.  Removal of all rotten and mummified fruit
from the orchard to break the pest's life cycle is the most important control
strategy for brown rot.   Several fungicides provide effective control if
applications are precisely timed.  Perennial canker occurs when injured
bark or wood is invaded by certain fungi (Leucostoma and Cytospora) or bacteria
(Pseudomonas). The term &quot;canker&quot; actually refers to the symptoms
of this disease--festering, oval areas with concentric rings of dying or
dead bark tissue on limbs and trunks, and extensive oozing of amber-colored
gum.  Minimizing injuries such as pruning cuts and freeze injury during
the dormant season, and maintaining adequate soil drainage, pH and fertility
are essential for canker control.  Black knot (Apiosporina morbosum) can
be a real problem on neglected plum trees, but it can be controlled in home
plantings by persistent removal of the green/brown swellings on the twigs
as soon as they become visible after leaf drop.<BR>
<BR>
	Two insects cause the most serious injury to stone fruits--tarnished plant
bug (Lygus lineolaris), and plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar).  Both
attack and disfigure the fruit, causing it to rot, and often drop prematurely.
 These pests are very difficult to control without insecticides during the
post-bloom period.  Tarnished plant bugs feed on many plants, especially
clovers and other legumes, and they move up into trees causing the most
damage during the weeks during and after bloom.  Removal of infested fruit
from the orchard during the &quot;June Drop&quot; or allowing livestock
to eat fallen fruit will help, but major losses are common in unsprayed
trees. <BR>
<BR>
	Birds, opossums and raccoons love to eat stone fruits, and can steal your
whole crop in just a few nights.  The most effective control for both pests
is wrapping the entire tree in plastic netting.  This should be done as
soon as the fruit begin to color up and soften, at least several weeks before
harvest.  The netting must completely enclose the tree canopy, and be secured
firmly around the trunk.  Netting also protects tree limbs and fruit spurs
from breakage and damage by raccoons.  If carefully applied and removed,
most netting can be reused for many summers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>POLLINATION</B><BR>
<BR>
	Peaches, nectarines (which are just fuzzless peaches), and most apricots
are fully self-compatible and do not require a genetically different tree
to provide pollen.  Tart cherries and the European type plums or prunes
such as 'Stanley' which are well adapted to New York conditions are partially
self-compatible, but will usually set better crops with a different variety
blooming nearby.  Almost all sweet cherries are self-incompatible--there
must be two different varieties of certain types to provide effective pollen.
 Fortunately, there are two sweet cherries--'Stella' and 'Lapins'--that
can pollinate themselves and all other sweet cherry varieties.  There are
usually plenty of wild bees, flies, beetles and other insects to transfer
pollen among the profuse and colorful blooms of stone fruits.<BR>
<BR>
<B>TREE TRAINING AND PRUNING</B><BR>
<BR>
	The wood of stone fruits is flexible and often breaks when trees are heavily
cropped.  This limb breakage can be avoided by spreading branches outward
with braces or weights to create a crotch angle around 60&#176; from the
vertical trunk.  The best time to do this is during the first several years
of tree establishment, so that the whole tree has an open center or vase
shaped canopy.  This tree form also improves light and air circulation inside
the canopy, minimizing brown rot and perennial canker problems.  Unlike
other tree fruits, stone fruits can be pruned at petal fall in late spring,
ideally during warm dry weather.  This late pruning reduces perennial canker
infections in pruning cuts, allows you to remove winter-killed branches,
and makes it possible to adjust your pruning to compensate for the occurrence
of bloom-time frost damage.  Cherries, plums and apricots require relatively
little pruning--usually some thinning out of densely clustered inner branches
or old damaged branches will be sufficient.  Peaches benefit from  more
drastic pruning, with extensive thinning-out and heading-back cuts to stimulate
a flush of new shoots which will set the subsequent summer's crop.  This
timing allows the trees to heal cuts quickly and resist the canker pathogens.
 When pruning any fruit tree, make your cuts parallel to the branch base,
close but not into the raised &quot;collar&quot; of bark callus which circles
the base of each branch. Try not to damage this callus ridge, because it
is where the wood's healing process actually begins.<BR>
<BR>
	In years when Nature does not thin your peach crop with a winter deep-freeze
or a late frost, it may be necessary to hand thin peaches.  When the natural
June fruit drop is over, remove enough peaches to leave a hand's breadth
between the fruit along each branch--the remaining fruit will be bigger,
tastier, and the tree will suffer less branch breakage.  It is usually not
necessary to thin the other stone fruits by hand, although plums may occasionally
benefit from it in years when there is a heavy fruit set.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>HARVEST</B><BR>
<BR>
	To enjoy the fruits of your labor you must know when to pick them.  Skin
color is not very reliable indicator of ripeness in peaches or plums.  As
peaches begin to ripen, the background skin   color-its base color beneath
the superficial blush--gradually changes from green to yellow or orange.
 At the same time, the fruit swells rapidly in width, perpendicular to the
plane delineated by the two surface ridges along its flanks.  The peach
develops its full aroma, and softens to the touch.  It is usually best to
harvest fruit selectively, several times on each tree over a period or a
week or more.  Once peaches ripen fully they should be picked and used promptly,
because they become rather perishable and very susceptible to brown rot.
 <BR>
<BR>
	Plums swell, develop a dusky wax bloom, soften to the touch and sweeten
to the taste as they approach ripeness.  Cherries deepen in color, swell
and soften, and their sugar content increases rapidly.  Both these fruits
become susceptible to splitting if rained upon around harvest.  Once the
skins are split, the fruit must be eaten or processed quickly, before they
are invaded by brown rot spores.<BR>
<BR>
	Growing stone fruits is a gamble in New York, but many home gardeners consider
it worthwhile anyway.  They are compact and attractive trees in the landscape.
 Their profuse blooms of fragrant, colorful flowers are a joy early in spring
even if they are nipped later by frost.  They will attract birds and other
wildlife to your yard, and there is often enough fruit for all to share.
 Above all, you can't buy the superlative taste and tenderness of a home-grown
stone fruit at the supermarket.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>A GARDENER'S CALENDAR FOR PEST AND NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
The best landscapes reflect a partnership with nature. Lawns and gardens
define a home for us, offer sanctuary to plants, birds, insects and other
living things, and are part of a larger community and environment including
waterways, parks and forests. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) is a way
of making thoughtful decisions using scientific knowledge, experience, signs
of pest problems and plant symptoms to minimize unwelcome insect, disease,
weed and other pest intruders - and a way to avoid unnecessary pesticide
applications. Judicious choices in planning and maintaining the landscape
include pest-resistant plants and proper cultural practices for planting,
pruning and fertilization. Careful observations of established plants are
key to detecting problems early, making appropriate diagnoses and providing
proper 'therapy' where necessary. A few problems can threaten the life of
a plant and are particularly important to learn to recognize early in order
to take prompt action, such as hemlock woolly adelgid on hemlock and Dutch
elm disease on American, Camperdown and other elms. As always, when using
any pesticide, including insecticidal soap, BT, horticultural oil or others,
use the right material for the particular problem at the proper time. Avoid
overdosing, spraying during windy periods and contaminating waterways. Wear
proper clothing and follow label directions.<BR>
<BR>
Become a garden detective and learn what plants say through the language
of the landscape, starting with the following IPM guide to timely plant
health care techniques through the horticultural year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>JANUARY</B><BR>
<BR>
Inspect stored bulbs, tubers and corms for rot or infestation. Discard those
showing signs of decay or insect damage.<BR>
<BR>
Check houseplants brought in for winter: inspect under leaves for infestations
of whitefly and spider mites; check between leaves and stems for white,
cottony mealybugs, and look under leaves and on stems for scale insects.
Apply insecticidal soap or other material, crush or brush off as appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
Check for tan gypsy moth egg masses on tree trunks and branches. Scrape
or brush off and destroy.<BR>
<BR>
Remove and destroy infested foliage on arborvitae and juniper to control
leafminer. Look for browned foliage that is hollowed out to detect the problem.<BR>
<BR>
To control bagworm on shrubs and trees, look for the small stick-covered
'bags' and remove by hand.<BR>
<BR>
Select pest-resistant cultivars or species where possible when planning
the year's garden. Choose varieties appropriate to the site. Catalogs often
list plants with pest resistance or check with your local Cornell Cooperative
Extension office.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FEBRUARY</B><BR>
<BR>
Inspect hemlocks for woolly adelgid. Plan to apply a dormant horticultural
oil treatment in April if the cottony egg masses are found at the base of
needles.<BR>
<BR>
Check for tan gypsy moth egg masses on tree trunks and branches. Scrape
or brush off and destroy if possible.<BR>
<BR>
Select pest-resistant cultivars or species where possible when planning
the year's garden. Choose varieties appropriate to the site. Catalogs often
list plants with pest resistance or check with your local Cornell Cooperative
Extension office.<BR>
<BR>
Check houseplants and stored bulbs as in January.<BR>
<BR>
<B>MARCH</B><BR>
<BR>
Horticultural oil applications at dormant rates are usually applied from
late March through early May, depending on plants to be treated and weather
conditions. Check product labels and contact Cooperative Extension for specific
details.<BR>
<BR>
Using sterile growing mix for starting garden seeds reduces problems with
damping-off fungi. Avoid overwatering, which encourages root rots.<BR>
<BR>
Prune out and destroy dark, swollen black knot galls on twigs of cherry
and plum before budbreak.<BR>
<BR>
Check for tan gypsy moth egg masses on tree trunks and branches. Scrape
or brush off and destroy if possible.<BR>
<BR>
Inspect bark of lilac, cherry, plum and peach for powdery white prunicola
scale infestations and plan horticultural oil applications if needed. A
brush is sometimes useful for mechanically rubbing the insects off.<BR>
<BR>
Check trunk and rough branch areas of white pines for cottony white flecks
of pine bark adelgid. Plan horticultural oil treatment if needed.<BR>
<BR>
Horticultural oil treatments for maple bladder gall mite, spider mites on
evergreens and scale on shrubs and trees can be applied; check labels for
specifics on appropriate weather conditions.<BR>
<BR>
Prune or peel off and destroy tent caterpillar egg masses. Favorite hosts
include cherry, crabapple and apple. Look for the shiny, dark brown egg
masses about 1&quot; wide wrapped around small twigs.<BR>
<BR>
Prune off and destroy brown shoot tips killed by Nantucket pine tip moth
on Japanese black, mugo, scots, Austrian and other 2- and 3-needled pines.
Damaged tips are brown and hollow in the center from the feeding of the
caterpillars.<BR>
<BR>
On trees, shrubs, fruiting bushes and vines, prune off and destroy cankered
twigs and any branches showing dieback. Prune shortly before budbreak, or
wait until just after leaves have expanded.<BR>
<BR>
Thin bramble plantings (raspberries, blackberries, etc.) to increase air
circulation and reduce stem and leaf disease problems.<BR>
<BR>
<B>APRIL</B><BR>
<BR>
Renew mulch on landscape beds and around trees and shrubs to 3-4&quot; depth
for good weed control. Landscape fabric can also be used as a barrier underneath
mulch.<BR>
<BR>
Where plants have a history of infestation, apply horticultural oil treatments
to control spider mites on evergreens such as hollies and spruces and on
certain other trees, shrubs and vines, including apple, honeylocust and
grape. You may be able to see the tiny red eggs of these mites on twigs
or bud scales with a hand lens.<BR>
<BR>
Inspect mugo and other pines for defoliation caused by the caterpillar-like
larvae of pine sawfly, which often feed in large groups. For limited infestations,
prune off and destroy infested shoots or hand pick sawflies. Extensive infestations
may require insecticide applications.<BR>
<BR>
Remove young tent caterpillars and their webs by hand. Look especially on
favorite hosts such as apple, crabapple and cherry. Some insecticides can
also be applied.<BR>
<BR>
Inspect honeylocust for early pod gall midge and plant bug damage. New leaflets
appear red and swollen from pod gall midge. Plant bug feeding on new growth
causes new leaflets to be distorted or fall off. Severe infestations may
require insecticide treatment.<BR>
<BR>
Plant a trap crop of radishes in late April to reduce infestations of cabbage
root maggot, which causes brown tunneling through roots.<BR>
<BR>
On junipers and red cedars, prune out the red-brown, round or spindle-shaped
swellings (cedar-apple rust galls) on twigs and small branches.<BR>
<BR>
<B>MAY</B><BR>
<BR>
Prune cherry and peach at bloom to help minimize Cytospora canker, a common
disease problem affecting branches and trunks of these trees.<BR>
<BR>
Avoid crowding plants when planting. Better air circulation between plants
helps leaves dry faster and reduces severity of many foliar diseases that
are promoted by long wet periods.<BR>
<BR>
Cut out and destroy brown, damaged leaders on white pine and spruce before
late July to control white pine weevil.<BR>
<BR>
Look for small holes in oak foliage, and the small, hairy caterpillars that
indicate early gypsy moth problems, in late May to determine whether treatment
is needed. Biological control with naturally derived BT (Bacillus thuringiensis)-based
insecticides works best against small caterpillars.<BR>
<BR>
Check for lacebug activity on andromeda: look for whitish flecking from
feeding damage on leaves; turn over foliage to hunt for the appropriately
named lacebugs and evidence of their dark, shiny droppings.<BR>
<BR>
Remove and destroy azalea leaf galls on azalea before they turn white and
release spores. The galls appear as swollen, pale green curled leaves.<BR>
<BR>
A first, light application of fertilizer can be applied to turf around Memorial
Day. Slow-release materials provide nutrients over a longer period than
conventional fertilizers. A soil test can help determine proper rates to
use.<BR>
<BR>
Remove tent caterpillar nests by hand and destroy. Some insecticides can
also be used.<BR>
<BR>
Watch for early signs of 'flagging' or dying limbs on elms that warn of
possible Dutch elm disease. Affected limbs should be pruned off immediately.<BR>
<BR>
Remove infested leaves on columbine to help control columbine leaf miner.
Continue throughout summer.<BR>
<BR>
In dry weather, prune out fire-blighted twigs from apple, crabapple, cotoneaster
and pyracantha. Sterilize pruners between cuts. Fire blight, a bacterial
disease, causes flowers, leaves and tips of branches on these plants to
droop, die and turn brown. Prune several inches below damaged areas. Since
other problems may have similar symptoms, a diagnosis may be helpful if
the injury is widespread.<BR>
<BR>
<B>JUNE</B><BR>
<BR>
Pick up fallen apple and peach fruit to control apple sawfly, plum curculio
and brown rot of peaches. <BR>
Summer rates of horticultural oil can be used for many insect problems,
depending on plants and weather conditions. Check product labels and Cornell
Cooperative Extension for more information.<BR>
<BR>
Remove infested leaves on columbine to help control columbine leaf miner.
Continue throughout summer.<BR>
<BR>
Use flotation cans to monitor chinch bugs in turf in early June: sink a
8-9&quot; diameter can in infested areas, fill with warm water and wait
5 minutes, refilling if needed. Over 20 chinch bugs floating to the top
suggests a problem.<BR>
<BR>
Cut out and destroy brown, damaged leaders on white pine and spruce before
late July to control white pine weevil.<BR>
<BR>
Inspect shrubs and trees for aphids. Check branch tips and under leaves
for the small insects. There are many kinds, often causing little damage.
A few types may cause leaves to become distorted (e.g. snowball aphid on
viburnums) or heavy infestations can reduce plant vigor. Pruning, a blast
of water, insecticidal soap or other insecticides can be used if needed.<BR>
<BR>
Water plants early in the day to allow above-ground parts to dry quickly
and reduce likelihood of disease.<BR>
<BR>
Trim off and destroy yellowed tulip leaves to help control tulip fire, a
fungal disease causing flowers to die prematurely. Remove heavily infected
plants.<BR>
<BR>
When notching in leaf edges is noticed, intrepid gardeners can venture out
at night with a flashlight to handpick black vine weevils from leaves of
rhododendron, azalea, hydrangea, yew, holly, astilbe and bergenia (to name
a few). Heavy infestations may require insecticide treatments starting in
mid-June.<BR>
<BR>
Check and prune out scale infestations on euonymus and pachysandra. Turn
over leaves and inspect stems for the white or greyish scale insects. Infested
branches can be pruned out in May or treated in early June, when the small,
young crawler stage appears. Crawlers are visible with a handlens and look
like tiny scales.<BR>
<BR>
Handpick and destroy leafminer-infested foliage on holly. Look for leaves
with zigzag or blotchy patterns from the insect mines. American, inkberry
and winterberry hollies have miners specific to each.<BR>
<BR>
Check underneath rose leaves with holes to find small, yellow-green aptly
named roseslugs. Handpick or treat if needed. They can cause substantial
defoliation in a short time.<BR>
<BR>
From late June to August, set three red sticky sphere traps in each apple
tree to control apple maggot flies, which tunnel through apples and cause
fruit to be distorted.<BR>
<BR>
Check for cottony maple scale on dogwood and maple. Turn over leaves and
look underneath for the white, cottony scales and egg masses. Use summer
rates of horticultural oil if necessary and if conditions permit.<BR>
<BR>
Set out white sticky cards to trap blueberry maggot flies in late June.<BR>
<BR>
Prune or 'tip' brambles in dry weather only. This will minimize the chance
of disease organisms invading open wounds and improve air circulation to
help foliage and stems dry faster.<BR>
<BR>
<B>JULY</B><BR>
<BR>
Remove and destroy mined leaves to help control leafminer in columbine,
sweet pea and verbena.<BR>
<BR>
Remove and destroy Japanese beetles from roses, grapes, crabapples, lindens
and other favorite hosts where possible. The beetles can be knocked into
a can of soapy water, especially in evening when they are more sluggish.
Large plants and severe infestations may require insecticide treatment.
Some plants and varieties are less damaged than others.<BR>
<BR>
Handpick and destroy black or grey blister beetles from tomatoes, eggplant,
clematis and aster. Use gloves when handling blister beetles or knock beetles
into a can of soapy water.<BR>
<BR>
Cut out and destroy brown, damaged leaders on white pine and spruce before
late July to control white pine weevil.<BR>
<BR>
Check for the powdery masses of white prunicola scale infestation on trunks
and twigs of lilac, flowering and fruiting cherry, peach and plum. Treat
with summer rates of horticultural oil or other insecticide in early July.
Scales can also be scrubbed off. <BR>
<BR>
Check fruit, flowering and shade tree twigs and grapes for the shiny, brown
hemispherical European fruit lecanium scale. Treat with summer rates of
horticultural oil if necessary and conditions allow.<BR>
<BR>
Inspect euonymus twigs and foliage and hemlock foliage for scale infestation.
Apply summer rates of horticultural oil if needed and conditions allow.<BR>
<BR>
Prune out and destroy brown, hollowed tips of Japanese black, mugo, Austrian
and other two- and three-needled pines damaged by Nantucket pine tip moth.<BR>
<BR>
Water trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants well during dry periods, but avoid
wetting foliage for long periods, which favors leaf diseases. Drought-stressed
plants may be more prone to disease, dieback or other problems. At least
1&quot; of water and/or rain per week may be needed.<BR>
<BR>
A thick (3-4&quot;) layer of mulch over the root zone helps maintain moisture
and controls weeds. Keep mulch away from direct contact with stems.<BR>
<BR>
Prune off and destroy the pineapple-shaped galls on spruce while green and
before they open, to help control spruce gall adelgids. <BR>
<B><BR>
AUGUST</B><BR>
<BR>
Water trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants well during dry periods. Up to
1&quot; per week of water or rain may be needed.<BR>
<BR>
Monitor turf for white grubs in mid-August: lift 1' x 1' sections of turf
every 30' or so and inspect the roots for grubs. Look carefully for the
C-shaped grubs, which will be quite small (1/4&quot;) at this time. More
than 7-10 grubs per section suggests a potential for noticeable damage.
Treat sod if necessary in mid-late August.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEPTEMBER</B><BR>
<BR>
Pick up dropped fruit under apples to help control apple maggot and under
peaches to control brown rot.<BR>
<BR>
The second fertilizer application for turf, if needed, is made around Labor
Day.<BR>
<BR>
<B>OCTOBER</B><BR>
<BR>
Clean up plant leaves, stems, fruit and debris to control many problems,
including anthracnose diseases of trees, apple scab disease, iris borer,
leaf spot on daylily, powdery mildew on phlox, leaf blotch on horsechestnut,
Herpobasidium leaf blight on honeysuckle, powdery mildew and leaf spot on
Boston Ivy, tar spot on maple, leaf blister on oak, mummy berry on blueberry,
black rot and downy mildew on grape.<BR>
<BR>
Prune out and destroy brown twig terminals and fallen cones on Austrian,
Scots, mugo and red pine to control Diplodia tip blight.<BR>
<BR>
Paint white latex on trunk and scaffold limbs of cherry and peach fruit
trees to control Cytospora canker disease.<BR>
<BR>
Take soil samples from turf areas and plant beds to determine next year's
appropriate fertilizer and lime recommendations. Kits and information are
available from Cornell Cooperative Extension.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NOVEMBER<BR>
</B><BR>
Remove plant debris and leaves to help control chrysanthemum and hollyhock
rusts, bacterial wilt of hydrangea, cherry leaf spot, and others mentioned
in October.<BR>
<BR>
Rake up and destroy pyracantha fruit to help control scab disease.<BR>
<BR>
Mulch strawberries for winter protection and to help control weeds.<BR>
<BR>
Apply the third and final fertilizer application to turf shortly after Thanksgiving.<BR>
<BR>
<B>DECEMBER</B><BR>
<BR>
Collect and bury large-stemmed weeds and flower stalks and debris to control
borers in flowering herbaceous plants.<BR>
<BR>
Check tree trunks and limbs for tan gypsy moth egg masses. Scrape or brush
off and destroy if possible.<BR>
<BR>
Look for the small 'bags' hanging from shrubs and trees and remove by hand
to control bagworms.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>ATTRACTING INSECTS' NATURAL ENEMIES </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
When you garden ecologically, you try to keep insect pests below levels
where they will cause unacceptable damage, rather than try to get rid of
all of them. Preserving natural enemies may be the most important and readily
available biological control practice you can undertake in your battle of
the insects. As you rely on natural enemies to help you, you need to foster
them by providing their needs. One method consists of increasing the diversity
of plants in or near the garden to attract more beneficial insects to the
area.<BR>
<BR>
Natural enemies, or &quot;good bugs&quot;, can provide a safe, environmentally
friendly means of suppressing pests. Most insects that live in or near our
gardens are not harmful; in fact, many are beneficial! Insects' natural
enemies can be predators or parasitoids. Predators such as lady beetles
and lacewings are mainly free living species that consume many prey during
their lifetime. Another important group of predators are the spiders; scientists
are just beginning to recognize the importance of spiders as natural enemies
and in some countries they are being brought in to help control insect pests.
<BR>
<BR>
Parasitoids, which include many wasps and flies, are more specialized than
predators; the immature stage actually develops within the body of a single
insect, ultimately killing it. The adults are free living and often visit
flowers for nectar and pollen.<BR>
<BR>
Select plants for your garden that are known to lure insects' natural enemies
to help you attract and conserve these garden helpers. Two large groups,
or families of plants, are excellent &quot;lures&quot; - the parsley family
(Umbelliferae) and the sunflower or daisy family (Compositae). <BR>
<BR>
You can spot members of the Umbelliferae family by their umbrella-shaped
clusters of small 5-petaled flowers. The overall appearance is often a large
flat head of white or yellow flowers; Queen Anne's lace is a good example.
The flower head provides a place to land for many insects, especially beneficial
wasps. Using a variety of these plants that bloom at different times can
make your garden look attractive, too. A number of culinary herbs in this
plant family including parsley, dill, caraway, cilantro or coriander, and
fennel. Some of these herbs are very attractive to syrphid and tachinid
flies, assassin bugs, lacewings and parasitic wasps. One caution - these
plants will spread quickly if left to go to seed, so remove flower heads
after they stop producing nectar, but before seeds mature. Also, some are
biennials, so you won't see flowers appear for a year. <BR>
<BR>
The Compositae family is characterized by flower heads that are actually
made up of many small flowers growing together. Many flowers are composed
of rays around a disk-like center. Many well-known ornamental flowers including
marigolds, dahlias, daisies, asters, cosmos, calendula, coreopsis, tansy,
yarrow, zinnia, and sunflowers are in this family. Flowering often lasts
over a long period of time and there is usually more than one flower per
plant. This provides a slow flow of nectar over a long period for the insects.
Ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps and some predaceous wasps are attracted
to plants in this family. Soldier beetles, flower beetles, and some lady
beetles will feed on pollen in addition to feeding on insects. Dandelions
offer early spring pollen to some of these insect predators.<BR>
<BR>
Legumes such as clovers and vetch also attract beneficials. They add nitrogen
to the soil, provide good shelter and moisture for insects, and may even
serve as a source of alternative prey for natural enemies. Beneficial insects
such as ground beetles, rove beetles and robber fly larvae are often found
in the soil. <BR>
<BR>
Cover crops offer protection to natural enemies when our annual garden plants
are not actively growing. Often, beneficial insects move over from the cover
crops as these crops begin to die back, feeding on &quot;bad&quot; insects
that are in turn consuming the desirable garden plants. Buckwheat is a good
one because it not only provides shelter, but has flowers which attract
flies, ladybugs and pollinating bees. One caution, however, is that it does
self-seed readily! A small permanent planting of buckwheat near the garden
allows immature natural enemies to complete development without seeding
up your garden.<BR>
<BR>
If attracting - and keeping - the &quot;good guys&quot; to your garden is
what you would like to do, try planting a few of the &quot;lure&quot; plants
from the parsley and sunflower families this year! <BR>

<H3><CENTER>HOMEGROWN APPLES IN NEW YORK</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
New York is a major state in US apple production, and in many ways our soils
and climate are perfect for growing this hardy fruit. Even so, apples are
difficult to grow successfully in the Northeast because many insect and
fungal pests find them as nourishing as people do. Home gardeners can grow
apples with little pruning or pesticide spraying, enjoying their flowers
and shade, watching the remarkable diversity of wildlife that feed on their
fruit and then harvesting what's left for juice or preserves. Apple trees
will usually bear for half a century or more with minimal care, but they
require considerably more attention and management if regular harvests of
fruit without major pest damage are desired. This bulletin offers some suggestions
for growing apples without excessive hassles and pesticides.<BR>
<BR>
<B>VARIETY SELECTION</B><BR>
<BR>
Hundreds of apple varieties are available from nurseries, but some are especially
suitable for home gardeners. Disease resistance is a major factor to consider
because common store-bought varieties require numerous fungicide sprays
to control the &quot;major&quot; apple diseases of scab, powdery mildew,
fireblight, and cedar-apple rust. New and traditional varieties resistant
to these diseases include 'Pristine,' 'Redfree,' 'Freedom,' 'Liberty,' 'Priscilla,'
'Jonafree,' 'Golden Russet,' 'Enterprise,' and 'Goldrush'-listed in order
of their harvest time, from mid August to early November. These varieties
will produce usable fruit without fungicide sprays, although they may be
blemished by other &quot;minor&quot; fruit diseases prevalent in the warmer
and more humid regions of the Northeast. <BR>
<BR>
Storage ability is another important varietal trait for home gardeners.
Apples that ripen in late summer or early fall usually will not keep for
more than a month, even in refrigeration. Many of the later varieties that
ripen in mid-October to November-traditional varieties like 'Northern Spy,'
'Winter Banana,' and 'Roxbury Russet,' or newer varieties like 'Keepsake,'
'Idared,' 'Enterprise,' and 'Goldrush'-can retain good eating quality for
up to five months in a root cellar or refrigerator. Ideal storage conditions
are temperatures slightly above freezing, with 90-95% relative humidity.
Most varieties can also be sliced and dried, or canned to provide year-round
eating of home-grown fruit. For long-term storage, apples should be picked
about a week before they ripen fully-softening, sweetening and developing
their full characteristic flavor and aroma-and only fruit without insect
or disease damage should be stored.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOIL AND SITE REQUIREMENTS</B><BR>
<BR>
Apples are very adaptable to different soils and climates, and usually don't
require fertilizer in home gardens. They can survive almost anywhere except
lowland swamps or high mountains, but they will grow and fruit better in
sites with moderately well drained loamy soils and a frost-free growing
season of at least 135 days. Trees in open sunny locations will produce
larger, better colored and more flavorful fruit, with fewer disease problems.
Most soils provide enough water and nutrients for apples if weeds beneath
trees are suppressed by mulching, cultivation, or herbicides. Weed control
is especially critical during the first 5 years after planting; for mature
trees regular mowing is sufficient to keep meadow voles, rabbits, and climbing
weeds like poison ivy or Virginia creeper in check. <BR>
<BR>
<B>PEST MANAGEMENT</B><BR>
<BR>
Several insect pests usually require control even on disease resistant apple
trees. A dormant oil plus a copper fungicide like Bordeaux mixture applied
at &quot;budbreak&quot; (usually mid-April) will help reduce over-wintering
disease and insect pests. Additional insecticide sprays at &quot;pink tip&quot;
just before bloom, at &quot;petal fall&quot; after bloom, and then two weeks
after petal fall will control the most common and serious fruit damaging
pests-plum curculio weevil, codling moth (the proverbial &quot;worm&quot;
in your apple), and leaf-roller moths. Apple maggot is the other major pest
problem, and usually lays its eggs in apples from mid July to mid August.
In small orchards, apple maggot can be &quot;trapped out&quot; by hanging
several red wood or plastic balls in each tree in mid July, and baiting
them with a feeding attractant and a sticky substance such as 'Tanglefoot.'
Two properly timed insecticide sprays will also control apple maggot. <BR>
<BR>
If you decide to use pesticides on your fruit trees, it's important to choose
an insecticide which is least toxic to people, pets, and helpful biocontrol
species of birds and insects. Imidan and Carbaryl are often recommended.
Proper timing is also essential for effective chemical control. Local Cooperative
Extension offices often have newsletters or electronic bulletin boards providing
information about fruit pest life cycles and control timing for each region.
Of course you may also want not to use any pesticides and let nature take
its course. Without any insect management usually 90 to 98% of apples will
be infested or blemished-but some of that blemished fruit is good for sauce
or preserves, and even 5% of a typical crop on a big apple tree may be enough
for fresh eating and storage.<BR>
<BR>
<B>POLLINATION</B><BR>
<BR>
Apples are genetically self-incompatible, so each variety requires another
variety or some wild apple trees or a crab apples nearby to provide pollen.
Without a source of compatible pollen and bees to carry it from tree to
tree, the fruit will not &quot;set.&quot; Even with good pollination, most
of the fruitlets will spontaneously abort and fall during the &quot;June
drop.&quot; This process is beneficial because much of the fruit that falls
is damaged or seedless, and would not develop into an edible apple. Ideally,
every other &quot;spur&quot; (the stubby side shoots that bear fruit) should
have an apple by mid June. If there is more than one apple per spur, or
if every spur has a fruit, the excess fruit should be hand thinned before
the end of June. Thinning the crop to one apple on every other spur will
increase fruit size at harvest and prevent trees from developing an &quot;on
and off&quot; biennial bearing pattern with too much crop one year and little
or none the next.<BR>
<BR>
<B>TREE TRAINING AND PRUNING</B><BR>
<BR>
Apple trees require periodic pruning to remove weak, diseased or heavily
shaded branches, but excessive pruning delays the onset of flowering and
fruit production in young trees, and causes too much vegetative growth and
shade in mature trees. For young trees it is best to develop a single vertical
trunk, and position selected side branches evenly out along and around the
main trunk at an angle of 30 - 45 degrees from the horizontal. Branches
of young trees can be bent into desired positions and held there with string,
trellis wires or spreader bars. Once a new ring of wood is formed (usually
by late June) these strings or spreaders can be removed, although you may
want to use the same strings and trellis to hold up young branches that
are heavily cropped so they don't droop or break under the weight of fruit.<BR>
<BR>
There are many different rootstocks for apple, and they produce a range
of mature tree sizes from 8 to 30 feet. Dwarfing rootstocks offer many advantages-smaller
trees that bear fruit several years after planting, room for more varieties
when space is limiting, easier and more effective pest control with hand-held
sprayers, less need for pruning, and larger, better quality fruit. Dwarfed
trees are just as long-lived and cold-tolerant as big trees, but they require
more attention to weed control, water and nutrition, and are less tolerant
of low-fertility soils, because they divert more resources into fruit than
roots, trunk and shoots. It is essential to use a pole or trellis to support
trees on dwarfing rootstocks.<BR>
<BR>
<B>HARVEST</B><BR>
<BR>
Harvest time for apples is determined by variety, weather conditions during
the growing season, and intended uses for fruit. Different varieties mature
and ripen from early August to mid November. As they mature, apples increase
rapidly in size, green flesh and skin colors change to white or yellow,
and the characteristic red or orange blush or stripes develop. Starch breaks
down into sugars, fruit become less acidic or tart, seeds turn brown, the
flesh softens, and the characteristic aroma of each variety develops. Warm,
sunny days and cool nights promote these maturation processes, while rainy,
warm weather delays them. All of these changes are used to determine when
apples are ripe or ready for harvest. For long-term storage, fruit should
be picked a week or so before they ripen, while for processing or immediate
consumption they should be left to ripen fully until they attain peak flavor
and eating quality.<BR>

<BR>
Vegetable varieties for home garden use should be well adapted for New York
conditions, offer relatively high quality, be dependable, possess disease
and insect resistance when possible, and have a relatively long harvest
period.  For many of the crops, it is recognized that other varieties not
listed may be satisfactory or might perform even better under certain conditions.&nbsp;
Varieties are listed in order of maturity, from early to late.  A key to
the abbreviations is given on page 6.  Varieties new to this list are followed
by an asterisk.<BR>

The fruit sold at Cornell Orchards is of the highest quality, produced by
the most advanced growing techniques. The number of apple varieties available
at the Orchards is unmatched at any retail outlet. Several varieties are
also blended to make what we consider the best cider anywhere. Cornell Orchards
does not compete on price with local producers; we try not to undercut other
growers in the area. <BR>
<BR>
Although our fruit is not organically produced, we do use the latest techniques
of integrated pest management for control of insect, disease, and weed problems.
Even though the fruit you buy may have been part of an experiment such as
research on new varieties, fertilizers, and storage techniques, nothing
will have been done to compromise the safety of the food. If testing a new
pesticide is part of a study, all the fruit from that study is eventually
destroyed and none is ever sold. 
<H4>Teaching...</H4>
Several departments use Cornell Orchards as a teaching facility. Here students
have an opportunity to observe first-hand the challenges of fruit growing.
Pomology students prune trees and berry bushes, entomology students look
for insects among the strawberries, pathologists search for disease symptoms
in the apples, agricultural engineers observe equipment in operation, and
ecology students study the interrelationships among the soil, living organisms,
and crops. <BR>
<BR>
Local schools also use Cornell Orchards for teaching. Approximately 3,000
elementary school students visit the packing house during apple harvest
and observe cider making. Each summer, junior and senior high school students
from throughout the state visit as part of the 4-H program. 
<H4>Research...</H4>
We are especially proud of the research conducted at Cornell Orchards. The
discovery that apples could remain fresh and crispy for a year if given
low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, and cool temperatures was made right here.
Today most of the world's apples are stored with basic technology developed
at Cornell some 50 years ago. Of course, refinements of this technology
are occurring constantly. <BR>
<BR>
The Cornell Orchards has become a campus center for interdisciplinary research
and long-term experiments. For example, one experiment in place for several
years is examining the effects of vegetation management in the orchard on
the physical and chemical properties of the soil. In addition, interactions
among vegetation and plant diseases, insect pests, beneficial insects, voles,
and nematodes are being studied. The effect of all of these factors on the
apple tree and the quality of fruit is being unraveled. <BR>
<BR>
Another study is examining factors that can reduce the effects of a soil
disease in raspberries. As part of an integrated pest management approach,
genetic, cultural and biological controls are being tested simultaneously.
Most exciting is the test of a special type of naturally-occurring fungus
that appears to suppress the growth of the disease-causing fungus. We are
using Mother Nature's own organisms to help us reduce disease. With a similar
intention, research is being directed at using cover crops, such as marigolds,
to reduce nematodes, diseases, and weeds instead of costly fumigation prior
to planting. <BR>
<BR>
The latest varieties of disease-resistant apples, strawberries, raspberries,
blueberries, gooseberries, and currants are tested at Cornell Orchards.
Developing fertilization programs for these crops is a major area of emphasis.
Here at the Orchards, our research on resveratrol, a purported cholesterol-lowering
compound found in grapes, has been the subject of much recent media attention.
<BR>
<BR>
The Cornell Orchards is not as large as it once was because of encroaching
university development. As a result, much fruit research is now conducted
at a farm along the shore of Cayuga Lake in Lansing. In addition, cooperative
research occurs with the New York State Experiment Station at Geneva. However,
research and teaching will continue at Cornell Orchards for the foreseeable
future. <BR>
<BR>
Cornell Orchards is the primary research and teaching facility for fruit
in the Department of Fruit and Vegetable Science in the College of Agriculture
and Life Sciences at Cornell University. <BR>
<BR>
The Objective of the research conducted here is to help the fruit industry
remain competitive while producing high quality fruit for the consumer with
minimal environmental impacts. <BR>
<BR>
As a working orchard located conveniently close to campus, Cornell Orchards
serves as an important teaching tool for many classes other than horticulture.
Since the research and teaching conducted there involves fruit production
and storage, large amounts of fruit become available for sale each year.
The sale of fruit helps the Department of Fruit and Vegetable Science run
its teaching, research, and extension programs. <HR SIZE="9">Return to <A HREF="sites.html">Department

The Homer C. Thompson Vegetable Research Farm was purchased by the College
of Agriculture of Cornell University in 1961. The purpose of the farm was
to provide plots for research, teaching, and extension related to vegetables.
The initial purchase consisted of about 100 acres, with another purchase
of about 56 acres added a few years later. There have been smaller additions
since--about 47 acres in 1981 and 4 acres in 1987. <BR>
<BR>
Of the 207 acres in the present farm, roughly half is unsuitable for crop
research because of poor drainage or other problems. The Department of Fruit
and Vegetable Science is the biggest user of the tillable acreage, with
about 50 acres in plots. Other departments with significant plot areas include
Entomology and Plant Pathology. Plant Breeding has used a small amount of
land on occasions. <BR>
<BR>
The original farms consisted of dairy enterprises that were not especially
intensive or modern. Buildings were in poor repair. As money became available,
old fence rows and hedges were removed, some buildings were torn down, electric
pumps and underground mains for irrigation were installed, two machinery
sheds and a plastic greenhouse were erected, and on the better fields stones
were mechanically picked and hauled away. In 1975 an excellent field laboratory
was built on the site of a former farm house. Pesticide storage was added
in 1992. <BR>
<BR>
A major need is for machinery storage. It is hoped that pole barns can be
constructed in the near future to meet this need. When this is done, the
dilapidated buildings that are presently used for much of our machinery
storage will be torn down. <BR>
<BR>
There are two major soil types on the tillable parts of the farm. The dominant
one is a Howard gravelly loam--except for its stones an excellent soil for
vegetable research. It does require irrigation, but Fall Creek is available
to provide a reliable source of water. There are also about 15 acres of
an Eel silt loam. The major problem with the Eel is that it is subject to
flooding. However, it provides a second soil so that experiments are not
restricted to a single soil type. <HR SIZE="9">Return to <A HREF="sites.html">Department

This area was assigned to the Department of Vegetable Crops at the time
of its inception shortly after World War I. It is one of the few sites near
the campus where the soils are sandy, well drained and adapted to growing
vegetables. Then and now it serves both the teaching and research functions
of the department. Due to its unique topography, the area is remarkably
free from frost both in the spring and in the fall. There are seven acres
of land available, half of which can be used for experimental plots. The
soil is an Arkport sandy loam, ideal for vegetable production when irrigation
is available. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the early experiments that are now considered &quot;classics&quot;
were conducted at this location. Such subjects as depth and frequency of
cultivation, pruning and staking of tomatoes, nutrition of muskmelons, and
sucker removal from sweet corn were concerns of the day and in the fall
the experiments were viewed by students of a generation ago who were studying
vegetable crops. <BR>
<BR>
The farm was worked by horses until after World War II. The buildings were
designed to house horse drawn equipment at the ground level. The basements
of the west and center buildings were designed for &quot;common&quot; storage
of crops such as potatoes, cabbage, carrots, beets, and celery. Such factors
as crop variety, temperature, humidity, container, and method of handling
were investigated. Results were compared with those from mechanically refrigerated
storages in the basement of East Roberts Hall. <BR>
<BR>
The north side of the road was exceptionally rolling. Because of erosion,
its usefulness was limited. Also the ridges were drier than the valleys.
In the early 1950s the entire north side was leveled by means of bulldozers
and earth movers. The &quot;average&quot; grade was raised somewhat by bringing
in soil from the nearby pasture. One of the hollows was filled to a depth
of 13 feet in order to make it level. Because of the nature of the original
soil deposit, a delta at the edge of a lake, there was no more variation
vertically than horizontally. However, natural internal drainage patterns
down through the soil were disturbed by the grading process and caused trouble
in the deeper filled areas. Deep tillage, cover crops, tile drains, and
heavy applications of strawy manure were utilized to minimize and gradually
overcome the poor drainage spots. After six or seven years, the area became
fully usable because the poorly drained spots had disappeared. <BR>
<BR>
The plots are used by the Department of Fruit and Vegetable Science and
the Department of Plant Breeding. <HR SIZE="9">Return to <A HREF="sites.html">Department

The North American Strawberry Growers Association (NASGA) was organized
in 1977 and incorporated as a non-profit corporation by progressive strawberry
growers and leading small fruit researchers. Their purpose was to support
USDA and state/provincial research programs, develop educational seminars
and publications, promote development of equipment, varieties and cultural
methods to improve efficiency for the strawberry industry - including grower
applied research, and promote beneficial legislation. <BR>
<BR>
Today NASGA represents more than 500 members in 40 states, 10 provinces
of Canada and 15 countries. NASGA continues to be a grower-based association
strongly rooted in the original philosophy that ongoing research will provide
knowledge to strengthen and improve strawberry production and marketing.
Publications include a research journal, proceedings, and newsletter. <BR>
<BR>
To accomplish this mission NASGA: 
<UL>
  <LI>commits 25% of dues to research (NASGA has granted over $350,000 in
research dollars) 
  <LI>publishes the journal Advances for Strawberry Research (which is purchased
by libraries world-wide) 
  <LI>formed a foundation to generate increased funds for research (NASGA
has increased funding to more than $50,000 per year) 
  <LI>sponsors an educational winter conference and publishes a newsletter
for members 
  <LI>supports issues critical to the well-being of strawberry growers through
an active legislative committee.

<H2> Autumn Garden-making Reminders: </H2><P><H3> Autumn is a great time to make plans - or continue planning - for a harvest festival, thanksgiving celebration, or other gathering. </H4> <BR><FONT SIZE=4> Here's an example: some communities plan elaborate potato festivals. All the food served is made from potatoes; children play potato games; how-to's for potato growing are presented; historical society exhibits on the Irish potato famine and the resulting impact on communities in the U.S. are displayed; blue-fleshed and red-fleshed potatoes enliven traditional dishes; potato chip and french fry-making demonstrations take place; connections to the potato's origins in South America might be made; and so forth. Hold one where you live, or scale it down for your classroom, family or friends.</P>

For information to get you started, we recommend: Eames-Sheavly, M. and Farrell, T. <I>The Humble Potato: Underground Gold. </I>Cornell Cooperative Extension publication, Media Services, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. 142LM17. 1995. <BR><FONT SIZE=2>Potatoes have had a major impact on people, triggering population changes, powering the ancient civilizations of the Incas, and fueling us with French fries today. Learn about the potato through the eyes of three imaginary children, in the pre-Columbian Andes, in Ireland at the time of the potato famine, and in the U.S. today. This project has both horticulture and nutrition activities, and is a fun way to learn about the socio-cultural impact of an important world food crop.

Research is centered on the control of potato tuber initiation.  The approach
is to map the loci that exert genetic control, examine the biochemical and
physiological traits that are associated with each genetic locus, and study
how the traits interact.  By utilizing a combination of genetic and biochemical
techniques, the goal is to help growers and breeders understand how to control
tuberization.<BR>

<BR>
The postharvest program is directed toward reducing losses between harvest
and consumption, and extending the storage life of vegetables. This includes
a consideration of changes in endognous hormone content which may accompany
extended storage life, as in controlled atmosphere storage of cabbage. Chilling
injury of fruit such as tomato and squash is another relevant area of interest,
where another emphasis is on membrane alterations as measured by various
physiological activities.

<UL>
  <LI>You don't buy a newspaper, you buy news. 
  <LI>You don't buy life insurance, you buy security. 
  <LI>You don't buy glasses, you buy vision. 
  <LI>You don't buy awnings, you buy shade. 
  <LI>You don't buy membership in an association... <I>You buy the cooperation
of people in your profession with whom you can join hands to do the things
you can't do alone.</I> 
</UL>
Joining any organization involves a certain commitment especially where
dues are required for membership. This is exactly what the North American
Strawberry Growers Association (NASGA) represents ... those growers, nurserymen,
researchers, extension specialists, and suppliers who want to get the most
out of growing strawberries. This commitment to doing one's best doesn't
guarantee overnight success, but it does mean that you will be exposed to
resources of people and information to put you on the right path toward
personal and financial achievement. <BR>
<BR>
Here's what you can expect to gain from the North American Strawberry Growers
Association: 
<UL>
  <LI>Access to the top strawberry researchers and horticulturists in the
United States and Canada. At our three-day annual <A HREF="meeting.htm">meeting
</A>held in February, there is ample time to speak directly with scientists
and professionals who are vitally interested in your concerns. In 1997 we
will meet in Louisville, Kentucky where we will tour the leading farm marketers
in Starlight, Indiana and attend the National Farm Machinery Show. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Timely publications that give you the latest information on production
methods and new marketing techniques; the newly redesigned and enlarged
quarterly newsletter and &quot;Advances in Strawberry Research&quot;. These
publications are for members only to keep you up-to-date and save you time
and effort searching through university libraries or a multitude of magazines
for what is new and valuable for strawberry growers. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>New ideas developed by other growers. A true sign of a successful
grower is a willingness to share knowledge gained from personal successes
and failures. Such sharing is a major component of our annual meeting. In
addition, our membership directory give you a chance to contact other members
for their advice or support. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>NASGA works for you as a lobby for berry growers on the national level.
Our success depends upon your participation and support. This is a critical
time during which we see university research and extension programs under
very close scrutiny that often results in cutback of financial support.
You can show support as constituents of the strawberry industry by joining
together in NASGA. University, USDA, and Provincial administrators clearly
see our commitment as we contribute over $50,000 toward research projects
this year and publish our own research journal. &quot;Advances in Strawberry
Research&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><A HREF="markting.htm">NASGA Marketing Council </A>
</UL>
If you grow and market strawberries and other small fruits, educate or consult,
or are exploring the myriad dimensions of small fruit growing as a career,
then it is time to recognize that the North American Strawberry Growers
Association is a valuable key to your success! We invite you to join NASGA
and take advantage of new experiences and friendships while strengthening
the solid foundation of information needed to be a successful grower. <BR>

<BR>
The North American Strawberry Growers Association seeks research proposals
to improve strawberry production and marketing. NASGA supports a wide variety
of projects in the United States and Canada. Funds are approved at the annual
meeting in February each year. <BR>
<BR>
Researchers are invited to submit proposals for 1997 funding. The deadline
for proposals, to be submitted to Dr. Marvin Pritts, Cornell University,
is December 15, 1996. The proposals are evaluated by the NASGA research
committee made up of growers and researchers. They provide a priority list
for possible funding to the NASGA board of directors. <BR>
<BR>
NASGA was established to support research of benefit to its grower members.
The Association of leading growers from throughout the United States and
Canada commits 25 percent of the annual dues for research. The NASGA Research
Foundation, established in 1992, provides additional funds. Over $350,000
has been given to support research since 1977. NASGA gave over $50,000 to
researchers in 1996. Researchers are invited to publish in Advances in Strawberry
Research, the NASGA research journal, edited by Dr. John Maas, USDA-ARS
in Beltsville, Maryland. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Research is needed on alternatives to methyl bromide, angular leaf
spot, acclimatization of nursery stock, crop rotation effects, resistance
to anthracnose, and strawberry marketing, to name a few important concerns
of NASGA growers. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Some of the areas currently being investigated include: breeding day-neutral
varieties, pest management, row covers, new herbicides, herbicide residue
persistence in soil, breeding for disease resistance to verticillium wilt
and red stele pathogens, effects of evaporative cooling on yield, use of
individually quick frozen process for new markets, fertilizer uptake and
utilization, improved renovation methods, alternate markets for strawberries
and the list continues to grow. The research committee evaluates research
on a timely basis. Every member is encouraged to provide input to this committee
about individual concerns. The research committee provides a summary of
its activities each year. <BR>

<body>
To spend time and money on solving production problems before you have
determined who will buy your product is now recognized by the farming
community as "putting the cart before the horse."  Under the direction
of Linda Stanley, NASGA has aggressively faced the
farm marketing problems of small fruit and vegetable growers. 
Pick-your-own, farm stands, full retail outlets, local wholesaling, and
festivals are all studied and reported on at our extensive marketing
workshops.
<p>
As a NASGA member you have the opportunity to hear successful
marketers discuss their advertising, promotion, pricing and
their miscalculations as well.  Learn from the success and failures     that have preceded
you.  Wasted advertising money comes out of your pocket.  Do you know
what you are doing wrong - or right?
<p>
<strong>FREE- NATIONAL MARKETING PROGRAMS</STRONG>
<p>
With the support of major companies such as General Foods, Ball Pectin,
and Kraft, NASGA members have received thousands of dollars worth of free
promotional literature for customers. 
Available to members only.  NASGA has produced signs, recipe 
leaflets, postal cards and direct mail flyers ready for imprinting.
All materials are in  <strong>full color </strong>.  The 
Marketing Committee provides you with beautiful and effective
materials to promote your business.

	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Ezra Cornell, an adventurous businessman, and Andrew Dickson White, a respected scholar, shared the bold dream of founding a "truly great university." Cornell, pragmatic and earnest, wanted an institution that would offer instruction in the mechanic arts and agriculture. White, scholarly and broad-minded, yearned to establish a university where"truth shall be taught for truth's sake" in the arts and sciences. White's concept of an elective curriculum was revolutionary at the time. Together they created a nonsectarian university that was the first in the eastern United States to admit women. Their egalitarian vision and their innovative ideas set Cornell apart at its opening, in 1868, and continue to guide the university.</TD>

   <TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Today Cornell includes thirteen colleges and schools. On the Ithaca campus are the seven undergraduate units - the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning; the College of Arts and Sciences; the College of Engineering; the School of Hotel Administration; the College of Human Ecology; and the School of Industrial and Labor Relations - as well as four graduate and professional units: the Graduate School, the Law School, the Johnson Graduate School of Management, and the College of Veterinary Medicine. The Medical College and the Graduate School of Medical Sciences are in New York City. Because Cornell is an Ivy League university and also the land-grant institution of New York State, it is a unique combination of public and private divisions. Stemming from the university's land-grant role are Cornell Cooperative Extension (an education-outreach program for New York State residents) and the notion that the fruits of Cornell research should extend into the public domain. </TD>

   <TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Ezra Cornell's dream to establish "an institution where any person can find instruction in any study" is still honored at Cornell. The university's 13,300 undergraduates and 6,200 graduate and professional students come from all fifty states and more than a hundred countries. Undergraduate students can choose from among four thousand courses, and graduate study is available in about a hundred academic and professional fields, including law, management, medicine, and veterinary medicine.  </TD>

   <TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Interdisciplinary study and research are Cornell hallmarks, as is attention to undergraduate education. The university's 2,300 faculty members are active teachers as well as researchers--Nobel laureates often teach introductory courses--and the lines of traditional disciplines are easily crossed. Engineering students dabble in photography; theater arts students explore the world of computers; physics students learn landscape architecture. This approach also fosters a wide spectrum of interdisciplinary centers and programs. Examples are the Center for the Environment, the Women's Studies Program, the Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER), and the Peace Studies Program.</TD>

	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>SITUATION</H5>

<FONT SIZE=4> <P>Cooperative Extension is faced with the challenge of meeting the educational and informational needs of a large, diverse gardening audience in New York State.  Consumer investment of time and capital in gardening resources is significant. Yet getting reliable information about the selection and care of the many species and varieties of fruits and vegetables is a major challenge for the home gardener. The availability of an ever-changing melange of garden products, services, equipment, cultural practices and even new fruit and vegetable varieties adds a perplexing dimension to this decision-making process.</P>

<P>Many teachers and researchers feel that problems exist with the school
curricula, and these problems affect the way that children learn.  First, a focus on horticultural science is severely lacking. For example, one survey revealed that 70% of six-year-olds did not even consider plants to be living organisms!  Although photosynthesis could be the most important biochemical process on earth, relatively few children have an understanding of it.  Secondly, more effort should be made to provide educational experiences in a multicultural context. Young people are more motivated when the curricula reflect their cultures, experiences and perspectives.</P>

The task of linking all these variables into the process of planning and design of horticulture education is the interdisciplinary challenge for the fruit and vegetable outreach program.

<H4>PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES </H4>

<FONT SIZE=4> <LI>To have youth and adults acquire basic skills in gardening.</LI>

<LI>To develop an awareness and enthusiasm among youth for horticulture careers and career planning skills, and to provide youth with scientific principles which are the foundations of those skills.</LI>

<LI>To increase awareness and enthusiasm for horticultural science among youth and adults, and increase teacher/leader comfort with science.</LI>

<LI>To encourage youth and adults to be spokepersons for ecological gardening.</LI>

<LI>To incorporate a study of plants and horticultural methods used by various
human societies into curricula.</LI></TD>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=1 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Pruning Currants and Gooseberries</H5>
<FONT SIZE=3> Prune currants and gooseberries, when the plants are dormant in late winter or early spring. Remove any branches that lie along the ground as well as branches that are diseased or broken.
Ribes species produce fruit at the base of one-year-old wood; the greatest production occurs on fruiting spurs of two-and three-year-old wood. After the first year of growth, remove all but six to eight of the most vigorous shoots. At the end of the second growing season, leave several one-year-old shoots, and several two-year-old canes. At the end of the third year, approximately four canes of each age class should remain. By the fourth year, the oldest set of canes should be removed, and the new canes allowed to grow. This system of renewal ensures that the plants will remain productive because young canes always replace those that are removed. A strong, healthy, mature plant should have about eight bearing canes, with younger canes eventually replacing the oldest.

<TR></TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <FONT SIZE=4> Plants are wonderful! They provide us with so much beauty in our lives, and can improve even the most gray, dismal, concrete surroundings. Children seem to be drawn to beautiful and interesting plants, and they enjoy being outdoors. However, despite the most terrific reasons for giving attention to plants, the facts is, many curricula neglect plants, and tend to favor animals.  We are, after all, animals ourselves - perhaps some find the subject of animals more interesting, or more easy to approach. There also exists the notion that plants don't "do anything."</TD>
	<TD VALIGN=top ALIGN=center ><A HREF=" MES.html "><IMG SRC="bug.gif89" HSPACE=75 ALT=[Gardening] ></A><BR> Back to Gardening Page </TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  But plants are important, and it is critical that children gain both an understanding of plant function, and an appreciation for all that they do for us.  We eat them, wear them, live in shelters made from them, breathe oxygen that they have provided - even write on them, fuel our cars and homes from their decaying remains, and use products made from them each and every day. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Gardening is an exciting, approachable way to teach kids about plants.  A good gardening program doesn't need to be one more thing thrown on your plate; by integrating it into the curriculum, gardening can be easy and interdisciplinary.  Interdisciplinary projects enhance young peoples' ability to make connections among isolated facts, and to find meaning among facts. A <I>U.S. News and World Report</I> article (January 1993) pointed out that some interdisciplinary pilot projects in New York and Los Angeles schools even improved school attendance, and decreased drop-out rates. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  The following are examples of ways to integrate gardening into your program, whether it's a formal classroom situation, home school, or informal education program.  These are just examples; you will certainly think of others ideas that are appropriate for your age group, and for your educational setting.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Social Studies/History/Geography</H5>
<FONT SIZE=4> How do you teach about social studies by looking to plants?  In my mind, this is the most fascinating connection of all.  Let's take three examples: the "Three Sisters" (corn, beans, and squash), potatoes and rice.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Native peoples in the Americas have been growing corn, beans and squash together for centuries; in some areas, they have been grown together for thousands of years.  Native people discovered that the crops grew well when interplanted, and there are many reasons for this.  The corn provides support for the beans, the beans provide nitrogen for the other two crops, and the squash or pumpkin keeps weed populations under control, with its broad spreading habit and large leaves.  Legends, practices, and ceremonies have evolved around these plantings, and many good foods have been prepared, too.  In fact, native peoples were eating so much corn that they referred to themselves as being made from corn.  Exploring the importance of these crops to native peoples - and now, to people all over the world - can provide a very different perspective of the farmers who gave the gift of corn to the world.  Young people have stereotypes of "Indians," and are often surprised to discover that the sweet corn and popcorn, tortilla chips, and other similar foods are a gift from native Americans.  What a unique way to explore native culture!</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  Kids love French fries and potato chips, and eat them by the handful, but how many children realize that potatoes are native to what is now Peru and Bolivia?  Potatoes were brought by Spanish conquistadors to Europe, where it took a long time to convince people that they were indeed edible.  They eventually became an extremely important crop in Ireland and Russia.  The Irish potato famine came about in the 1840's when late blight affected the potato crop.  At that time, people were living on about 10 pounds of potatoes each day, so when the crop began to fail, people either starved, or emigrated to the U.S.  Again, a fascinating portion of history is directly linked to an important food crop....one that is easy to explore in a garden!</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <FONT SIZE=4> Which grain is eaten by more people in the world that any other?  Rice!  This can be an interesting way to explore the peoples of Southeast Asia.  Like the native peoples of the Americas and their corn, many of the cultures of Southeast Asia have evolved ceremonies and practices over centuries and centuries, related to rice culture.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Language Arts</H5>
<FONT SIZE=4> One of the easiest ways to connect language arts to the garden is by keeping a garden journal.  This is a practice (already widely utilized by many teachers) that helps young people organize their thoughts, get into the habit of keeping records, and practice their writing and communication skills.  Reading stories can be fun and educational; your library has a surprising number of kids' books related to gardening.  Consider carrying out a drama or writing garden-inspired poetry.  Reading poetry can be a way to learn more about people's feelings about plants.  Consider this verse, contained within a popular song from Vietnam:</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  <I>In the heat of mid-day, I plough my field
<BR> My sweat falls drop by drop like rain on the ploughed earth
<BR>Oh, you who hold a full rice-bowl in your hands
<BR>Remember how much burning bitterness there is
<BR>In each tender and fragrant grain in your mouth!</I></TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  You may want to involve your children in making a booklet that describes your gardening program to share with area businesses. Have them write about how beautiful the garden is, or what they are learning from it. As you approach potential funders or volunteers, sharing this work from the children will set your program apart from others, while also giving them a good exercise in communication/language skills. Another idea is to make a garden calendar, and involve the children in each step. They can research what to include on the calendar for each month, and carefully write entries into each month. Sell it as a school or classroom fund-raiser.  Marketing this product - or marketing produce at the school or at a farmer's market - is another excellent communications exercise.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Creative Arts</H5>
<FONT SIZE=4> The possibilities are enormous when it comes to creative arts.  Make beautiful planting sticks, decorated elaborately with shells, yarns, feathers, etc.  Use these to make planting holes, then give them a dual use as poles for runner beans.  Make plant markers with common and Latin names, and make signs for north, south, east, and west.  Scarecrows are fun and creative.  Leaf rubbings, drawing and paintings are a natural series of activities that can evolve from looking closely at plants.  In fact, as children begin to look closely as they are drawing plants, they will even discover more about them.  Other activities include making solar blueprints, toad houses, root view boxes, solar dryers and rain gauges.  Make edible art by fixing elaborate trays of colorful vegetables, or make funny faces and other "vegetable art" with produce that is over-mature or otherwise no good for consumption.</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Music </H5>
<FONT SIZE=4> This may seem like a real stretch, but it isn't!  Many of our American heritage songs and our folk music "roots" reflect our love for the land, and for the garden.  Learn the lyrics to songs such as <I>Oats, Peas, Beans and Barley, This Land is Your Land, Pick a Bale o' Cotton, America the Beautiful, </I>or <I>The Garden Song  </I>(Inch by Inch, Row by Row).  Discuss what the songs say about us as a people.  Sing a song at a harvest dinner!  If you grow gourds, you may want to make drums and rattles from them.  Music is a different experience when children make the instruments, and are involved with every stage of a small performance.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Science </H5>
<FONT SIZE=4> This might be the easiest connection of all. Important science process skills come alive when children are gardening: observing, raising questions, predicting, finding relationships, designing investigations, inferring, and communicating. Garden science includes exploring seeds, finding out more about plants' basic needs, learning about plants as food makers, learning more about soil, discovering about plant reproduction, exploring diversity in the plant world, and learning about interdependence - how much we, in particular, depend on plants.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Math </H5>
<FONT SIZE=4> There are many opportunities to work math into gardening. Here are a few ideas: weigh the largest and the smallest vegetable; estimate the number of peas in a pod; count the # of kernels on an ear of corn; compare heights of children to the heights of plants; measure the volume of dried popcorn, pop the corn, and measure the volume again; triple a recipe and make it in class; and figure out the numbers and kinds of seed and transplants needed. Laying out the garden also involves math. Taking data and measurements is such an obvious connection, but perhaps the most meaningful math link is that, in this case, there is a reason for doing the math!</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Earth Stewardship </H5><FONT SIZE=4> Here's a great chance to move beyond the garden, and begin thinking about the school grounds as a whole.  Composting and recycling has very practical implications for your garden, but it also teaches kids about being more conscientious, and about being responsible with resources.  Gardening can take a barren piece of property and transform it in a way that's more appealing to animal life, too.  Some earth stewardship ideas:  make bird houses from bottle gourds; "adopt-a-spot" near the gardens, on the school  grounds, and offer to keep the area clean and free of debris; compost school kitchen wastes; learn more about beneficial insects, and how to encourage them to visit; and develop an educational gardening display on a theme in cooperation with a local nature center.

	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Nutrition and Health </H5> <FONT SIZE=4> With the new food pyramid, we are all becoming more aware of how important plant foods are in our diets.  Growing these foods is an easy way to get kids to eat more of them!  You may want to plan a garden of healthy snacks.  Other nutrition connection ideas include testing foods for nutrients, and grinding fresh grains, making bread, and comparing to store-bought bread.  A fun activity is to provide young people with many different colorful vegetables.  (You can prepare them in advance by cutting them into pieces, or have kids help you).  Give them each a plate, and ask them to make a beautiful "painting" from the vegetables.  After they have finished, and after the paintings have been looked at, they can eat their creations (it's nice to have some dips on hand).  You'll be surprised at how quickly they devour vegetables that you wouldn't dream they'd eat otherwise!

	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Physical Education </H5> <FONT SIZE=4> Gardening is the number one hobby of adults in the U.S. Teaching kids about gardening at a young age introduces them to a hobby that can help to keep them active and healthy for the rest of their lives. Working in a garden is good physical activity. Learning how to handle tools and lift and carry properly is an important part of gardening.

	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Social Concerns/Community Service </H5><FONT SIZE=4>  By its very nature, gardening is a cooperative, collective experience.  In a culture that places so much emphasis on competition, it can be refreshing to work as a group to design, plant, and care for a garden, and then harvest the bounty together.  You can share your project with the community by donating produce to a local food pantry or soup kitchen; take flowers to a nursing home; involve children with special needs in your project; and hold a harvest dinner for volunteers and donors to say thank you.

	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5> Computer Technology
</H5><FONT SIZE=4>  It's becoming increasingly easy to combine gardening and computer technology - all you need to do is look at the overwhelming number of resources on the World Wide Web to see how. Involving older youth in helping you sift through the resources for those of value can be a good learning experience for both of you. There are also a number of interesting youth-related projects that can be found on-line. An example is an ethnobotany monitoring project that encourages young people to carry out research by interviewing elder members of their communities for information about medicinal plants. The youth then key this information into the computer, where an on-line botanist assists them with researching information about the plants that came up in the interviews. This is an interesting blend of new technology and ancient wisdom.

<FONT SIZE=4> Find out why pizza is good food; find out how to make pizza more healthful; make tomato sauce and compare to store-bought; grind the wheat* and make the crust; find out more about whole wheat vs. white flour.  In general, the pizza garden presents a good way to explore where our food comes from.  Kids eat a lot of pizza, but most haven't clue about the historical, nutritional, etc. aspects of pizza.
<BR>*Be aware that a fungus called ergot infects some grains.  Eating ergot infected grain can cause ergotism, which can have mild to severe repercussions ranging from altered behavior to death.  If you use your home-grown wheat, it would be wise to have someone check it over for the characteristic blackened, swollen ergot-infected grains (they look a bit like mouse droppings).

<H3> The School Garden Book </H3>
<H4> C.M. Weed and P. Emerson.</H4>
<H5> NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1909</H5

<BR><I> The following excerpts are included here to provide a sense of the historical community of which school gardens are a part. The information applies as much today as it did in 1909 - same concerns, same roadblocks, same victories. </I>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> From the point of view of this book the school garden is any garden in which a boy or girl of school age takes an active interest. It may be simply a tiny seedling growing in a little flower-pot indoors or an extensive series of garden crops growing in a large garden outdoors....The gardens to be considered from this point of view may be collective or individual, or both; they may be indoors or outdoors, or both; they may be at the school or the home, or both. In all of these cases the plants to be grown are much the same and the methods involved in growing them are similar. Yet, a short preliminary discussion of special plans and methods to be used in connection with these various kinds of gardens may be worthwhile.</TD>
	<TD VALIGN=top ALIGN=center ><A HREF=" MES.html"><IMG SRC="bug.gif89" HSPACE=75 ALT=[Gardening] ></A><BR> Back to Gardening Page </TD>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><H5> In-door Gardens</H5>
Few objects add so much to the attractiveness of a school-room, or a living-room in the home, as a good window-box filled with beautiful flowering plants. In the great majority of cases such a box will be much more successful as well as a great deal more attractive than are the unsightly flower-pots which are so commonly used for growing plants indoors.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left>Five things are required by a living plant - food, warmth, moisture, light and air: granted these, a plant should live and thrive in almost any sort of situation. The proportions in which different plants require these five essentials vary decidedly, and in growing flowers in the house we must understand the conditions required by the particular plant we are dealing with. In general, the necessary conditions are most easily given by means of window-boxes, which may be placed near the window that an abundance of light and air may readily be obtained. And it is not at all necessary that this window-box should be a crude, unsightly affair: it should rather be a carefully made, attractive object, harmonizing with the interior of the room and adding to its general effect. It is worthwhile to go to some trouble and expense in order that the receptacle for such a little garden indoors should be so attractive that it may always be used with satisfaction.  </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left>ƒVery attractive boxes may be made of old cedar woodƒsuch boxes are particularly useful for starting seedlings, as well as for holding flower-pots in which bulbs or other plants are growing. They have the great advantage that they can be turned end for end at frequent intervals and thus cause the leaves and blossoms of the plants growing them to take on a symmetrical appearance. There is also an advantage in the fact that in very cold weather such boxes can easily be removed from the window.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> In general, such window-boxes will be in the nature of collective gardens, representing the interest of the whole school. As a rule the only individual gardens practicable indoors will be those grown either in special small boxes or in flower-pots. Such individual gardens are practicable in the case of a number of plants which may be grown from seeds, as well as in the case of spring flowering bulbs and various plants which are grown from cuttings. The paper flower-pots, which may be obtained from any florist or seedsman, are in many respects more desirable that the ordinary pottery ones. They have special advantages in their cheapness, in the ease with which they may be stored away in little space, in the small amount of room they take up when place side by side in a window-box or on a plant-shelf, and especially in the fact that evaporation does not take place from the sides of the pots as it does in the case of the ordinary flower-pots. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> These paper pots are not easily broken, so they can be carried safely from the school to the home by little children, and they are so inexpensive that any school can afford to provide them for the use of the pupils. The smaller sizes cost but twenty-five cents per hundred. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Out-door Gardens</H5>
Passing now to the outdoor gardens, we come, of course, to a field in which the range of possibilities varies with the conditions of almost every school. It is true, however, that even under the most adverse conditions some kind of collective garden at least is possible. If it is nothing more than an outside window-box, it may easily become of important service in the work of the school. In collective gardens short rows or parts of longer rows may be planted by individual pupils in connection with a plan for a complete whole, in which the part done by each pupil shall serve as a unit. For any gardens but the very smallest this will probably be found a more satisfactory method than to have the collective garden planted without distinguishing the part done by each pupil. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> The school which has an opportunity for each pupil to have an individual garden is fortunate indeed. The size as well as the crops to be grown will depend, of course, upon the conditions and the interest shown by the teacher and pupils. Such crops may be planned for the entire season or for only the early part of the seasonƒ.
</TD>
	<TD VALIGN=top ALIGN=center ><A HREF=" MES.html"><IMG SRC="bug.gif89" HSPACE=75 ALT=[Gardening] ></A><BR> Back to Gardening Page </TD>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> The final end of the school garden is the home garden. In any community the success of the school garden movement after it has been in operation for a number of years will properly be measured by its results in bringing about a general love for flowers and plants as shown by the gardens and home grounds of the pupils that have been in attendance. In the case of the home gardens the opportunities, of course, are infinitely varied, but here again it will almost always be possible for a pupil who so desires to have some sort of garden. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> The tools necessary for school garden work are neither elaborate nor expensive. A spade, a hoe, a rake, and a trowel are perhaps the most essential parts of the garden outfit; and it is very desirable that they be supplemented by one or two good forms of weeders, a garden line, and a watering-can, the latter especially in those cases when watering from a hose is not practicable. When once supplied these tools will, of course, last indefinitely, and pupils should always leave them thoroughly clean and hung in the proper places. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> If the only visible results of the school garden work are found in the crops grown, the garden has only served a part of its purpose. It should supply the material for a considerable proportion of the school work in drawing and English, and may very well help to vitalize the work in arithmetic and geography. At least one garden booklet should be made by every pupil who has anything to do with the garden, this booklet to contain the drawings and language records of the pupils. In the following pages this phase of the work has been constantly kept in mind, and some of the illustrations are transcripts from such garden records or suggestions for helping to make them. A pocket note-book for each pupil will be desirable, in order that the memoranda of dates may be made at the proper time.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Plans and Problems</H5>
School gardens should present in concrete form the best ideals for home gardens and grounds. It is desirable, therefore, that the design and planting plans for the surroundings of a new school, or for the betterment of an old school-yard, should be prepared by a landscape gardener employed for the purpose. Where this is not yet possible, a superintendent or principal should take special pains to study the conditions of a school-yard and its surrounding homes, then apply the principles of general landscape gardening as presented in the completed development of school grounds elsewhere. The work of carrying out these plans should be done by the pupils, in the course of a series of years, that they may properly profit thereby, and protect as their own these improvements.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> In general, lawns bordered by shrubbery and hardy flowering plants, with vines clothing the walls of the school building, should characterize the school grounds next the street, a type of good home grounds. The outdoor school gardens are best placed at the side of the school buildings, when a sunny exposure is possible there, separated from ample playgrounds in the rear with their bordering shade trees. For many schools and teachers, however, the practical problem must be that of accomplishing results with little encouragement at first and under difficult conditions. But there, too, a fine and fit idea, wisely set forth in practicable plans according to which one may work, is essential to economy of effort and to full success.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> All difficulties may be overcome. Where school-yard space is very limited, it is likely that homes are likewise crowded in close tenements. Then outside window-boxes, porch and shed tops, should be utilized. Or the sunny borders of the playground may be planted, being protected by a low, stout, rail from encroaching play. In return, the remaining play space may be multiplied by home-made apparatus. It is surprising how many children find amusement on a long four-inch plank tilt, or swarm up and down climbing ladders, poles and ropes. So, if ground space is already limited, carry either gardens or play into the air.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> A school garden need not be in the school-yard, although most parts of one are best placed there. Adjoining back yards and near-by vacant lots may be used. Wherever adjacent houses encroach on gardens, it will be found that much valuable soil now lies fallow. The former owners have departed, and present tenants either do not know the gardener's art, or lack time and inclination to apply it. But they will often accord to a school the privilege of using a weedy back yard or neglected garden. Its management the first year determines the continuance of the privilege. If a back yard is small, it may still supply space for a propagating bed of perennials, or opportunity to experiment with various annual flowers and to raise seedlings for distribution to home gardens. A larger yard or a vacant lot may be divided into individual garden plots, so that every pupil of a class or grade may have independent practice under school supervision.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> Many school-yards have been graded with gravel and ashes to form playgrounds, so that lack of good soil is an obstacle to making a garden. This condition frequently requires rather costly measures. Some soils may be enriched by liberal manuring, and for this purpose fertilizers may be obtained free of expense from near-by stables, even in a city. Some schools have made a start on a small scale with soil brought from the woods and from home gardens in little bags by the children. Thoroughgoing work, however, implies the purchase of soil in liberal quantity. While this should be provided by school authorities, some communities are not yet ready to approve such public expenditure. Experience shows that in such cases it is possible to raise funds easily by school entertainment or by a subscription taken among the parents. To use the money to the best advantage, one should watch for the opportunity to secure the soil from a contractor when a cellar is being dug on a lot with good soil in the neighborhood of the school. It is wise to place the soil deeply, say twenty inches in depth, rather than in a shallow layer in order to secure a larger garden. Plants will live in shallow soil, but they thrive in thoroughly cultivated deep soil.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> In some communities public sentiment may still class school gardening as a useless fad. This hostility may be changed. The hearty endorsement and cooperation of superintendent and school board is a first requisite. The aid of the press may be secured to praise the work elsewhere, to call for its introduction, to approve heartily the first efforts in the community, to call for its active development and for the substantial aid of the authorities. In connection with a parents' association, or an improvement club, a public meeting may held to present values and methods, for school gardening only needs to be fairly presented to win ample support.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> At times hoodlums discourage school gardening by uprooting and overturning plants and flower-boxes in sheer vandalism. This has been overcome in many places by persistent effort until general pride in the results secured affects even the members of street gangs and insures their appreciation. Such a victory is well worth the patience, skill, and labor it costs, for it means that home grounds and gardens will be respected as never before, because of the finer public spirit developed and spread through the children to every neighborhood and home.

<H3> Hints and Helps for Young Gardeners: A treatise designed for those young in experience as well as youthful gardeners </H3>
<H4> H.D. Hemenway </H4>
<H5> Hartford, Conn: published by the author, 1906</H5

<BR><I>The following excerpts are included here to provide a sense of the historical community of which school gardens are a part. The more you read, the more you can see that the information applies as much today as in 1906 - same concerns, same roadblocks, same victories. </I>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> <H5>Chapter 1: Introduction</H5>
In America, garden work and elementary agriculture as a means of education has been successfully demonstrated for nearly a score of years. Many of its enthusiastic advocates believe it has already past its experimental stage, and should be included in the curriculum of every well-organized school.</TD>
	<TD VALIGN=top ALIGN=center ><A HREF=" MES.html "><IMG SRC="bug.gif89" HSPACE=75 ALT=[Gardening] ></A><BR> Back to Gardening Page </TD>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left>On the other hand, there are conservative educators, who still look upon it as a fad. Many others, probably the larger number, believe in it, but for the lack of efficient teachers, and equipment, hesitate to advocate introducing the School Garden. </TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> Several institutions in the country have already begun to train teachers and the School Garden movement is making rapid progress. The time is not far distant, when practical, elementary agriculture, and gardening will be taught in many schools. It develops the children physically as well as mentally and in the open air often creating a love for things, which keep the city boy off the street corners during the summer, and teaches the country child the business-like, up-to-date methods in agriculture and gardening.</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> It not only educates the head, the heart, and the hand, but it aids in the practical application of reading, writing and arithmetic. Gardening increases and develops the power of observation. It makes a person quick to grasp ideas and to put these ideas into action. These are important foundations for success in any line of business. It develops moral character.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> Few things, if any, develop a love of industry better than a well-kept garden. Ever changing nature lures us on to help some pet plants to grow until we love the work.
</TD>
	<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left> Establishing a School Garden may change the entire healthfulness of a neighborhood. The school grounds, themselves, may be better planned and more healthful, but the best effect may be at the homes. The School Gardener soon wants a garden at home. No matter how small the yard, there is room for a garden for the boy or girl, <I>even if it has to be established in a soap-box. </I>There is much waste room often used for ashes, tin cans, or rubbish in many yards. What was once unsightly, unsanitary, and unproductive, becomes a resort of beauty and utility for a whole family. It opens up a source of revenue, creates a love of industry, and respect for property, and is often the beginning of better things. The gardener becomes a better American citizen.

<BR></BR><H4> Keeping your school board, board of directors or trustees, or other governing council, informed of your project will go a long way in garnering support for your project. You may want to request to be put on the agenda for a meeting, then share a letter such as the one below as you briefly update them on your project. Highlight your achievements in bullet form, and be concise and to-the-point; they will find it a refreshing change from the usual long-winded speech. Include any news clippings or other media exposure you may have gotten. Show a video you've taped from the evening news - this, too, goes a long way in making an impression. </H4>

<P>On April 20, 1996, we will be breaking ground for a project that has been in the planning process for several months - our XYZ Elementary School Garden. We want to share our excitement with you, as well as keep you informed of our progress. To date, we have:

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=3 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4> <BR><LI>met regularly through the Garden Committee to plan and design the
garden, and to divide up responsibilities. 

<BR><LI>defined the objectives for our garden.

<BR><LI> designed a garden plan that will be very attractive, yet low in
maintenance. It is also a plan that can be added to in the future, if we choose to expand the project.

<BR><LI>received a grant of $300.00 from a corporation for our project. We
were one of only 50 schools in 12 states to receive the grant. 

<BR><LI>raised additional funds through special events such as
roller-skating and line-dancing.

<BR><LI>introduced the idea to the faculty, the principal, the PTA, and the
groundskeeper to request their support.

<BR><LI>conducted a workshop for teachers interested in school gardening.

<BR><LI>identified parents and community members who will assist with the
project.

<BR><LI>begun to secure additional donations and discounts of materials.
<P>The "bed-raising" date is Saturday, April 20, at 9:00 a.m. We are going to construct a 250 square foot raised bed near the creative playground. Please feel free to stop by that day!

<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=3 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  We are pleased that you would like to adopt the Elementary School Garden for one week during the summer! It will be easy to do, and of course, it's always a joy to be near the creative playground. 
<P>There are two main things that we hope to accomplish with this "adoption." For one thing, families can water the garden; raised beds dry out much more easily than other garden sites. If we have a dry spell in the summer (let's say more than a week or ten days without rain), the plants will need a good soaking. The groundskeeper is setting up the nearby water faucet with a key, so we can access it easily. You'll need to get the key - we can help you with that. We will have a hose on hand, and are currently looking into the best way to house it. You'll also need to find out when the previous caretaker watered the garden.
<P>Our other goal is to be visible. School gardens that have a great deal of community involvement are less likely to be vandalized. Although it would be best to water during the morning, it would be nice if you could show up at least a couple of evenings during the week, just to have a look around. We're hoping that if the garden actively appears to have people caring for it, it will be left alone.

<P>There shouldn't be a weed problem because of the raised beds, but if you see a stray weed, yank it!

<P>If you have questions, please call us [fill in your names!]

Here is a sample agenda for presenting the school garden project to the PTA for their support. It may look simple - and it is. The point is to take only a brief amount of time to excite people, gain their interest and support, and make some important points that will have an impact on both teachers and parents.</H4>

<P>1. Keep it easy, and choose a great design - no intensive labor for students or teachers!

<P>2. Strong ties to the curriculum - no add-ons. 
Science connections are obvious, but also can tie to creative arts, math, social studies, language arts, nutrition, physical education, social concerns, etc.

<P>3. Importance of garnering parent and community support 

<P>4. Opportunities for expanding the project: grant-writing, community partnerships, inter-generational opportunities, etc.

On the day of your big bed-raising or garden site preparation, you'll want plenty of helping hands. Perhaps some people won't be able to come, but would like to help in other ways. A letter like this went home with all of the children of XYZ elementary school, one week before the big day. It gave us a very good sense of how many people we could count on, and provided names for follow-up help.</H4>

	<TD COLSPAN=3 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  <B>The XYZ Elementary School Garden</B>

<P>On April 20, 1996, many parents, teachers and children came to the XYZ Elementary School to build beds for our primary school garden. It was a busy morning, with about 100 people mixing soil, building the raised beds, and then filling the beds with soil. We got a great deal accomplished in a short period of time!

<P>Lots of planning went into that event. The Garden Committee met regularly to plan and design the garden, and to divide up responsibilities. We designed a garden plan that will be very attractive, yet low in maintenance. It is also a plan that can be added to in the future, if we choose to expand the project. We received a grant of $300.00 from a corporation for our project and were one of only 50 schools in 12 states to receive the grant. We raised additional funds through special events such as roller-skating, line-dancing, and other special events.

<TR></TR>
<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=3 VALIGN=top ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=4>  <P>Before actually building the beds, we met with the faculty, the principal, the PTA, the school board, and the groundskeeper to request their support, and conducted a workshop for teachers interested in school gardening. 

<P>Special thanks go to the people who secured all the materials and coordinated the event, those who rounded up food for the hungry workers; to the parents, teachers and children who worked and provided food; to the principal and groundskeeper for their support; to those who taped the event for the evening news; to the local restaurants for food and beverage donations; and to garden centers and lumber supply stores for donations and discounts of soil, soil amendments and building materials. Special thanks to the individual who is taking all the plants chosen by each grade level and coming up with a beautiful design for each grade. 

<P>Everyone's contribution is greatly appreciated, and will pay off when our children can enjoy this lovely garden!

When you meet as a garden committee, be prepared with a suggested outline of responsibilities. Generating these at the meeting will eat up precious time. You can always modify as you go along, but having something in hand is much more efficient. This will provide a sample of one meeting's agenda.</H4>

<H2> August Garden-making Reminders: </H2><P><H4> September may be considered  a "winding down" time in the garden, but like fresh school clothes and the promise of another, crisper season, September is a time of new beginnings in the garden.  </H4> <BR><FONT SIZE=4> If you're working with a school, this is a great time to organize a garden-making, or garden-maintenance, committee.  Parents are eager and willing and it's a good time to get them to commit to working with teachers and students to take care of the garden, help weave it into the curriculum, or to plan special events.  In fact, a great way to involve everyone right off the bat is to plan a fall event.  Whether it's a harvest dinner, an afternoon of bulb planting, a community "bed building," or garden dedication, your event will go more smoothly and will be much more
 if many people are involved.</P>

Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University (STOU) is an open university which employs 
the distance education system. STOU is well-known for its quality education and has 
received many awards and honors from various international agencies.  STOU is 
considered to be one of the leading open higher education institutions in the Asia 
Pacific Region.

<p>
In the distance education system where there are no formal classrooms, the University 
relies on various media to provide instruction to students, including textbooks, workbooks, 
television and radio programs, cassette tapes and video tapes, practical training and 
skill training as well as tutorials at STOU Study Centers and locations organized by the 
University.  Each type of media has its own unique strong points.   The University tries 
to continually improve and develop various formats and methods in the use of media 
in order to provide quality teaching and learning in accordance with technological changes.  
The success of the University in providing higher education, and the success of the students 
in completing their studies and becoming quality graduates who benefit both society and 
the country, all depends on its effective management of information and communications.

<p>
Using Internet is another way in which the University is developing new formats 
and methods in communications. Apart from being useful to the University in teaching 
and learning, it also expands the global perspective of an information society. The use 
of Internet is not STOU's first or final step in developing information technology.  The 
University will continue to move forward in order to make Sukhothai Thammathirat Open 
University an institution of higher learning which provides educational opportunities to 
all mankind.

<dd>The Asian Management Award provides a dual interface: both acquisition and dissemination 
of  technology in seven management areas in six key Asian nations.<p>

<dd>The first step in this process is called the search - or nomination - process.  A number of 
methods are employed to identify organizations which demonstrate excellent  management.  
Almost 4 million people are invited to nominate organizations by direct mail and advertisements 
in international and national publications.<p>

<dd>Management associations, advertising agencies and communications organizations are also 
invited to participate in the nomination process.  The AIM alumni and governors conduct focus 
group sessions to identify worthy organizations - a computer program has even been written that 
identifies all enterprises which pay a specified level of taxes or more - and AIM and its alumni 
conduct a review of leading companies in each of the six countries.<P>

<dd>In the second step, all nominated organizations are sent data forms which require substantial 
disclosure of proprietary financial and operational data.  The information provided is verified and 
entered into data bases for quantitative analysis.  Third, the AIM faculty review the data and apply 
pre-established cut-off criteria to short list the most excellent companies in each category in each 
country.  This review draws heavily on the qualitative information demonstrating the level of innovation 
and competitiveness of these organizations.<p>

<dd>The fourth step involves the review of the short listed companies by country-specific boards 
of judges.  The boards generally deliberate over a two-day period and conclude with the selection 
of winners in the seven categories.  The panels request - whenever they feel it is appropriate - more 
information on the organization or the conduct of additional interviews or verification procedures.  
The governing board for the program - consisting of the AIM governors - is then asked to confirm 
the final decisions of the six boards of judges.  This is the fifth step.<p>

<dd>Step six is notification of the results of the deliberations to the winning organizations.  The 
awards ceremonies, news conferences and announcement advertisements are planned.  Step 
seven is the culmination of the awards program - the presentation of the awards in formal 
ceremonies.<P>

<dd>As the third year of this program culminated in Thailand, AIM was pleased that efforts to teach, 
influence and inspire excellent mangement had demonstrated the effects both of excellent 
management  techology on the productivity of Asian organizations and the development of 
Asian managers.<P>

<dd>"The purpose of education, we are told, is to transmit the culture of a society to its young. In 
accomplishing this, it is hoped that the individual will be armed with knowledge, strength of 
judgement and moral virtues, as well as the ability to make a living, and in the process, preserve 
the heritage of the nation and the achievements of previous generations.<p>

<dd>Our first winner is an institute of higher learning that for 14 years has made a critical contribution to 
transmitting the culture of Thailand to its young and opportunity to the not-so-young. The first 
distance education university or open university in Southeast Asia, the University was conceived 
and developed by Thai educators.<p>

<dd>Since 1980, over 805,000 students have enrolled in the University without ever setting foot on 
campus.  The University's radio and television programs reach almost five million Thais all over 
the country every week.<P>

<dd>And it has graduated almost 200,000 students -- from all walks of life --  who received their education 
via mail, radio, and television --  including the multi-awarded <b><font color=#ff0000> Law for the General 
Public</font></b>.  Over 90%  of students enrolled in the University obtain work. And many enter 
graduate schools in Thailand or abroad.<p>

<dd>In 1995, institutions and universities from 79 countries were nominated for the 
          <a href="/Award/icde.htm">COL-ICDE</a> Institutional Award of Excellence 
          and Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University (STOU) was selected as the 
          sole recipient of the award for its achievement in the following categories: 
<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#8000FF>Expanding Educational Opportunities</font></b>
<dd>Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University (STOU) holds to the principle of lifelong 
          education and aims to improve the quality of life of all Thai people.  As a response 
          to individual and societal needs, the University strives to increase the educational 
          qualifications of working people and expand educational opportunities for secondary 
          school graduates. To fulfil these needs, the University has devised a distance 
          education system that employs correspondence media, radio and television programs, 
          and other methods to enable students to study without having to enter a formal classroom
          setting.
<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#8000FF>Development of Instructional Techniques in Distance Education</font></b>
<dd>STOU employs a distance education system that transfers knowledge and 
          experience to students by arranging curricula that integrate related materials and 
          experience into self-instructional packages known as course blocks.  This approach 
          enables students to study independently using educational multimedia consisting of 
          practical instructional materials, instructional cassette tapes, radio and television 
          programs, and new technologies such as, Computer-Assisted Instruction and distance 
          education via satellite.

<b><font size=+1 color=#8000FF>Development of Distance Education on the National or Regional Level</font></b>
<dd>STOU was instrumental in ensuring the establishment of the Asian Association of Open 
          Universities (AAOU) and the Distance Education Regional Resource Center (DERRC).  
          AAOU is a regional organization which was established to promote and develop the distance 
          education system in Asia. DERRC is the regional resource center of the AAOU  which was 
          established to promote the sharing of resources and to develop a distance education database. 
          STOU demonstrated its commitment to the work of AAOU and DERRC by providing facilities 
          and staff for the secretariats on the STOU campus in Thailand.
<dd>The Ministry of University Affairs assigned Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University (STOU) 
          to be responsible for the &quot;Improvement of Distance Education at Hanoi Open University
          &quot;. This is a Thai foreign aid project to Vietnam under the auspices of the Department of 
          Technical and Economic Cooperation (DTEC).
<dd>The presentation of the COL-ICDE Award of Excellence took place at the 17th ICDE World 
          Conference held in Birminghan, England on June 26, 1995.  Professor Dr. Nipone Sookpreedee, 
          Vice-President for Development, represented STOU at the awards presentation ceremony to 
           receive the COL-ICDE Institutional Award of Excellence plaque.

<b><font size=+1 color=#ff0000>EDUCATION UNDER THE DISTANCE EDUCATION SYSTEM</font></b><br>
<dd>STOU employs a system of teaching which enables students to study by 
themselves without having to enter conventional classrooms.  This system of teaching 
is known as the "Distance Teaching System".
<dd>The Distance Teaching System is a teaching system which presents students in 
different localities with the opportunity to study by themselves in accordance with their 
individual preparedness, personal convenience and personal interests. Instruction is
given through the use of multimedia packets comprised of textbooks, workbooks, 
cassette tapes, video tapes, various reading materials, radio and television programs, tutorials and 
practicums in Local Study Centers.
<dd>The University follows an integrated approach to course development in that
material is brought together in the form of an instruction set which is called 
a <a href="/Tour/Distance/coursebl.htm"><i>"course block"</i></a>.
<dd>To enable students to study efficiently by themselves, the University employs an 
educational service system to relay knowledge, content materials, and experience as follows:

<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#ff0000>Self-Instructional Materials:</font></b><br>

<table>
     <tr>

     </tr>
</table>
</center>

<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Textbooks.</font></b>  Course  textbooks contain explanations on the courses, course 
subjects, title list of teaching units, study methods and lesson plans so students have to 
study every unit of the textbook in detail as well as complete the exercises of each unit.
<br>
<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Workbooks.</font></b> Workbooks contain instructions on how to use the workbooks, 
details of the teaching units, self-evaluation before and after studying, spaces for 
recording important information, for doing exercises and reports, together with 
answer sheets for each unit.
<br>
<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Cassette Tapes.</font></b> The University produces cassette tapes for some courses, 
in the form of lectures and discussions, as well as other formats, which are not a 
duplication of radio programs produced for the same courses.
<br>
<dd>In addition, books and supplementary reading materials are placed in 
<a href="/tour/educat~1/stu_cen.htm#cor">STOU Corners </a> in all provinces.<br>

<center>
<img src="/Gifs/book2.gif">
</center>

<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#FF0000><b>Educational Radio Programs</b></font></b>
<dd>STOU provides educational services in the distance education system
 through the use of correspondence media and radio and television broadcasts.  Each 
semester STOU produces 10 radio programs of 20 minutes' length in a variety of formats 
such as interviews, documentaries,  drama and docu-drama.  The content of each program 
is designed to enrich course blocks.
<br>
<dd>STOU radio programs are broadcast daily through the radio network of
 the Public Relations Department by UHF system from the main transmitting station in 
Bangkok to 11 sub-stations.

<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#FF0000>Educational Television Programs</font></b>
<dd>STOU uses television as a supplementary media to its academic courses. For each 
academic course there are 3 thirty-minute educational television programs produced in 
different formats such as dramas, discussions, interviews and documentaries.
<dd>STOU sends tapes of the programs to local stations all over the country for broadcasting.

<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#FF0000>Education Through Audio-Visual Aids</font></b><br>
<dd>Audio-visual aids refers to media which makes use of pictures, sounds, 
or both, drawings, photographs, charts, posters, slides, cassette tapes and video 
tapes produced especially for use in tutorials and educational services.
<br>

<b>The four major audio-visual aids employed by STOU are:</b><br>

     </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Tutorial Cassette Tapes.</font></b>  These are cassette tapes which have been 
recorded with supplementary teaching materials and are used for those courses 
which do not offer tutorials due to an insufficient number of enrollments.
<br>
<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Tutorial Video Tapes.</font></b> These are video tapes related to those courses 
which do not offer tutorials.  There are approximately 4-6 hours per course block. 
<br>
<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Movies.</font></b> They are used for teaching different 
courses in accordance with the needs of each subject. They are 16mm movies with 
the soundtrack on the film and are placed in Study Centers as a service to STOU 
students.  Movies can also be used as part of television programs.
<br>
<dd><b><font color=#0000ff>Tutorial Packages.</font></b> These are audio-visual aid packages used in an
 integrated form to help tutors teach with greater efficiency.  Tutorial kits 
consist of audio-visual materials, transparencies, charts, slides/tapes and other 
media which will help tutorial instructors teach in the same direction and control the 
standard and efficiency of teaching.  If instructors do not have the tutorial kits, they 
may not teach in the same direction, as the time provided for tutorials is short and 
encompasses materials for many units.

<dd>Tutorials are academic services provided for STOU students.
Tutorials are conducted by faculty members and instructors in their respective
subject matter.  Tutorial sessions aim to broaden the students' perspectives in
their particular disciplines along with providing explanations to any problems and
questions the students may have concerning examinations.  STOU's
tutorial services are not compulsory, and are provided free of charge.  Students
attending the tutorials receive documents and audiovisual materials to aid
in their understanding of the subject matter.  The document and audiovisual
materials are designed as summaries and outlines of the particular subject matter,
and are comprised of charts, models, and visual demonstrations for
various course blocks.  The objectives for employing these media in STOU
tutorials are to improve learning and maximize accomplishment in the students.
Before entering tutorials, students should receive documents to prepare themselves for
any possible problems, and to encourage questions concerning the program of study.

<p>
<dd>STOU organizes tutorials in various formats.  In most cases, two tutorial sessions are given 
in a semester; however, some courses do offer three tutorial sessions.  Each session consists of a 
five-hour educational program.  STOU also  arranges practical training and skills enhancement 
tutorials to promote practical experience in career-oriented courses.  All tutorials are normally 
held on Saturdays and Sundays at Study Centers.  Students taking tutorials can check their 
particular tutorial site and schedule through STOU newsletters that are distributed approximately 
one month before tutorials begin.

Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University  was established as a state university in
order to provide Thai people with increased educational opportunities at the university 
 level.  It is an open university which uses a <a href="/Tour/Distance/distance.htm">
distance education system</a>.

<p>
 His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Rama IX, bestowed the name<B> <I>Sukhothai 
Thammathirat Open University</I></B> in honor of King Rama VII, one of whose titles
 before his accession to the throne was <a href="/Tour/kingvii.htm"><B><I> Prince Sukhothai Thammaraja</I></B></a>.

<P>
The University was officially established by Royal Charter on <I>September 5, 1978</I>,
 under the name of <I>Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University</I>.  
The University has thus designated <I>September 5 of each year</I> as<I> the 
commemorative date of the University’s founding</I>.  As the 11th state university, 
Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University has all the honors and privileges 
of other universities.

<br clear=left>

<p>On October 24, 1978, His Majesty issued Royal Mandates appointing the first group 
of University Council members and appointing <B>Professor Dr Wichit Srisa-an</B> 
as the first Rector, effective January 7, 1978. Subsequent Royal Mandates were issued 
reappointing Professor Dr. Wichit Srisa-an to a second and third term as Rector. The 
present Rector of Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University is <B>Professor 
Dr Iam Chaya-Ngam</B> who was appointed to the post, by Royal Mandate, on November 
19, 1987.

<p>On December 1, 1980, after approximately two years of preparations, STOU 
received its first batch of students. At that time there were three Schools of Study--the School 
of Liberal Arts, the School of Educational Studies and the School of Management Science.

<p>
In 1982, the University was expanded to receive students in the School of Law, the School of 
Health Science, the School of Economics, the School of Home Economics and the School of 
Agricultural Extension and Cooperatives.  The School of Political Science and the School of 
Communication Arts were opened in 1983 and 1984 respectively.

<p>
<dd>In the open education system, students generally study by themselves at home, and do not 
have the opportunity to solve problems in their education by consulting with their instructors or 
schools.  There is also not much opportunity to study among friends.  This can lead to students 
having a feeling of isolation from the University because of the lack of opportunities to build 
friendships with other students. Therefore, STOU has foreseen the need to organize local activities
 for students, so that they can build friendships and assist one another in their respective fields of 
study, and in other areas of their lives. The Student Clubs thus provide useful overall benefits for 
students. Sukhothai Thammatirat Open University has a policy of supporting such student 
activities through the promoting and founding of Student Clubs.<p>

<dd>The establishment of student club's began in 1991. Presently, there are a total of 77 clubs 
located in 76 provinces throughout the Kingdom.  Members of student clubs may conduct any
number of activities according to the objectives of the club, so long as they are in accordance with
STOU's policies.  STOU appoints Student club Advisors from the university's academic schools 
and offices to provide guidance, and assist student clubs throughout the Kingdom.  The Student
Club Advisors take responsibilty for guiding and assisting various student club activities.

<p>
<dd>The Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University Association was granted authorization to be established from the 
Office of the National Culture Commission on March 20, 1984.  The STOU Association was subsequently 
registered at the Police Special Branch Division On March 22, 1984.  The STOU Association has also received 
permission to be an organization under the patronage of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha 
Vajiralongkorn on March 24, 1989.

<dd>STOU has provided a suitable location for the STOU Association to base its operations at the 
<a href="/Tour/General/build_15.htm">Sukhosamosorn Staff Club</a> in the University's grounds.

<dd>STOU also promotes membership in other University associations that conduct local activities based on the 
same model as those of student clubs.  The STOU Association Services Committee has therefore made plans 
for the establishment of Graduate Clubs.

<dd>The Graduate Clubs have a duty to serve as representatives for STOU Associations in each province. The 
Graduate Clubs also serve as a center for STOU Association's members in the various provinces concerned.  
The Graduate Clubs have a Public Relations Coordinator, represented by the University's symbolic colors of 
green and gold, appointed by the club's Chairman in each province.

<dd>At present, there are 73 Graduate Clubs throughout the country, with 3 more being established.

<dd>Course block is a complete entity in itself and is worth at least six University credits.  
Each course block is divided into 15 units, each of which requires approximately 12 hours 
of study time.

<p>
<b><font size=+1 color=#0000ff>Production of Course Blocks</font></b>
<dd>The production of course blocks is based on the principle of course integration. That is, an attempt is
 made to integrate different  academic areas into specific groupings or categories which will facilitate the
 student's ability to synthesize and apply the knowledge acquired and which will be easy to study on one's 
own. The establishment of the different Schools has been carried out along the lines of career and professional 
development rather than being discipline-oriented. In order to conform to the principle of course integration as 
mentioned, the curriculum is thus divided into "course blocks", each of which carries 6 semester credits. A four-year 
bachelor's degree program is composed of 22-24 course blocks (132-144 credits).  The reason that STOU has 
set up the 6-credit course exclusively rather than subdivide into smaller courses is based on two major principles, 
namely:

<p>
<dd><b><font color=#ff0000>Academic Principle :</font></b> Setting up the course blocks in the manner described facilitates course 
integration, that is, it makes it easier to integrate course content in an interdisciplinary fashion more completely 
than would be the case if smaller, less-encompassing courses were used. In terms of learning, this approach 
is appropriate for the distance education system since it enables the students to concentrate rather than diffuse 
their study efforts; for in any one semester, they will not have to study more than three courses.   
<dd>For example, if a student studies in a university which applies the credit system, the student will have to 
register for at least 18 credits per semester to enable him/her to complete the course in 4 years. If each course 
has 2-3 credits, the student will have to study 6-9 subjects while students of STOU have to study only three 
course blocks per semester to have the same value. 
<dd>The use of the course blocks allows the standards and quality of the teaching/learning process to be 
supervised to a high degree. This is because the production and development of courses is done by <b>course 
teams</b>.  Academic standards are thus the responsibility of a group of academics rather than individual instructors. 
Aside from this, the use of course blocks also facilitates the establishment of supplementary media such as 
radio, television and tutorials. Particularly when there is a limited amount of time, it is easier to produce 
interesting programs related to the course blocks than would be the case if numerous smaller courses were 
used. When the curriculum structure featuring this course block system is considered solely from the academic 
viewpoint, four positive aspects can be identified. They are:
<dd>(1) It facilitates academic integration; <br>
<dd>(2) It facilitates self-study;<br>
<dd>(3) It facilitates the supervision of academic quality and standards; and,<br>
<dd>(4) It facilitates the use of multimedia in the distance education system.

<p>
<dd><b><font color=#ff0000>Administrative Principle :</font></b>  The use of the course block system 
reduces the complexity of administration, making it more economical and efficient. As students are 
required to learn only 1-3 course blocks per semester, they are able to control their own study load, 
and the system is convenient with respect to registration, teaching, and examinations which can be 
given in every province in the country on a single weekend. In addition, the course block system 
helps avoid cases in which a single instructor is the sole authority on a particular subject. This is due 
to the fact that the course block has far more content and activities than could be produced by a single 
instructor on his own with a substantial teaching load. The course block system also helps bring about 
a team approach. Each course team consists of subject or content specialists, an educational 
technologist and an evaluation specialist who are jointly responsible for all phases of course production. 
This naturally results in integrated instructional materials and ensures that the educational system will 
be fully open, for it provides the opportunity for numerous specialists from outside institutions to participate 
in the development of the materials. The excellence which exists in society is thereby utilized 
to the fullest extent.

educational media services to full-time faculty members and other University personnel on the 
University campus, and to students and the general public via our unique networked services in 
the regional and provincial levels.  It has implemented VTLS, an automated library system that 
offers a range of integrated features and interface to Thai language.  Currently, six modules of 
VTLS are installed: circulation, serials control, acquisition, cataloging, journal indexing and 
online catalog.  The plan calls for linking this library automated system with the other 11 
academic libraries in Bangkok Metropolitan area to form "Thailinet" or the "Thailand Library 
Network," which will be one of the major academic library networks in Thailand.

<p>
Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University adheres to the principle of life-long education and aims at developing the quality of life of the general public, increasing the level of knowledge of working people, and expanding educational opportunities for secondary school graduates. In order to meet the diverse needs of individuals and society, the University has established ten Schools offering programs at the master's and bachelor's degree and certificate levels. The University strongly believes that every graduate, regardless of discipline, should have the basic knowledge needed to understand society and the changes constantly occurring within it. This will enable graduates to work efficiently, have a sense of responsibility for the common good, and appreciate the value of culture. The University has delegated to the School of Liberal Arts the responsibility of offering general foundation courses in the areas of language, sociology, the humanities, Thai studies, science, and mathematics to students in all Schools of the University. The School of Liberal Arts has also established programs in Thai Studies and Information Science at the bachelor's degree and certificate levels. In addition, the School organizes certificate programs in English for Specific Careers as an academic service to the general public.  All of these courses and programs are based on an integrated educational approach, enabling students to lead a fuller life and pursue their careers more effectively.
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li>To provide knowledge in the field of liberal arts to those students who wish to broaden their interests beyond their professional courses.

<li>To produce graduates in disciplines that are useful for society.

<li>To provide courses for other Schools of the University.

<li>To integrate and synthesize different fields of study so as to enable individuals in different occupations to apply their learning appropriately.

<font size=+2 color=0000ff><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b></font><br>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>RATIONALE</b></font><br>
<dd>Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University was established to provide education for the general public through an open education system characterized by self-instruction
<p>
<dd>Two criteria were used to determine which fields would be offered in the initial period of the establishment of the University.  One was the needs of society and the other, the readiness of the University to provide education of a standard quality.  The Fifth National Economic and Social Development Plan, the National Educational Development Plan and surveys of public attitudes toward the open university system were employed to assess the needs of society.
<p>
<dd>As for the readiness of the University to offer courses, the experience and aptitude of the personnel to be employed during the initial period were considered.  Much consideration was also given to fields of study appropriate for distance education and the extent to which teaching materials in various fields were available in Thailand at the time.
<p>
<dd>In light of the above criteria, it was considered appropriate to open the School of Management Science offering programs in Construction Management, Business Administration, and Public Administration.
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li>To produce graduates in Management Science in order to enhance economic and social development.
<li>To promote research work in Management Science so as to generate new knowledge and to apply it to national development.
<li>To serve as an academic service center providing knowledge in Management Science to businessmen, government officials, and administrators.
<li>To improve moral and ethical standards in the administration and management professions.

<dd>Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University established a School of Law in response to the demands
of society as evidenced in the research report entitled "Public Attitudes Toward Open Universities"
submitted to the Ministry of University Affairs in 1978.  A survey on society's need for law studies,
conducted by the Law School Project Committee, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University in 1980, further
indicated that 83.11 percent of the respondents would like to further their studies in law.  Accordingly,
Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University has established a policy to support and develop personnel in law
related professions, in both the government and the private sectors, in order that they may have an all-round
knowledge of law and be capable of performing their duties in accordance with the needs of society.  The
University also has a policy to provide continuing education in the field of law for holders of degrees and
diplomas in other areas as well as other interested persons.
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li>To produce highly competent law graduates with appropriate legal experience to meet the needs of society.
<li>To develop personnel in law-related professions so as to possess the type of knowledge, competency and experience suitable to their work and soceity.
<li>To promote legal research and studies in order to keep abreast of changing conditions.
<li>To provide society with academic services by disseminating legal knowledge and giving legal aid relevant to their professional and occupational needs, as well as continuing education at various levels.

<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>RATIONALE</b></font>
<p>
Present government policy recognizes the need for the all round development of health personnel in order to provide quality health services for the Thai population, good health conditions and the achievement of the World Health Organization's global goal of "Health for All by the Year 2000."
<p>
Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, as an institute producing higher education level manpower, has taken into consideration the above mentioned objectives and thus gives its support to producing and developing health personnel who are of a standard befitting their profession and who are capable of providing maximum benefit to the nation. Accordingly, in 1980, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University established the School of Health Science based on the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>Large numbers of public health workers in all fields still have a need for continuing education. Furthermore, under present government policy, there is a need for capable health workers at the Tambol level. It is therefore necessary for health workers to develop themselves by upgrading the level of their basic education. This will lead to professional progress which, when combined with knowledge gained through experience, will ensure the provision of effective public health services.

<li>There remains a need for large numbers of professional nurses in order to provide services to the public. Continuing education is still required for professional nurses, and professional public health head services are still needed at the Tambol level. Furthermore, nursing personnel need to develop themselves by upgrading the level of their basic education and their professional skills. Professional advancements need to be studied  and applied in order to ensure efficiency in services provided to the public.
</ol>
<p>
<dd>The Ministry of University Affairs thus approved the establishment of the School of Health Science with the following programs and study areas.
<ol>
<li>Four-year bachelor's degree program in Public Health Studies with majors in Public Health Administration, and Public Health.
<li>Two-year bachelor's degree program in Public Health Studies with majors in Public Health Administration and Public Health.
<li>Two-year  bachelor's degree program in Nursing Studies with a major in Nursing.
<li>Two-year bachelor's degree program in Public Health Studies with a major in Occupational Health and Safety.
<li>Two-year  bachelor's degree program in Public Health Studies with a major in Community Dental Health.
<li>Two-year bachelor’s degree program in Public Health Studies with a major in Health Laboratory.
<li>Two-year bachelor’s degree program in Public Health Studies with a major in Consumer Protection in Public Health.
<li> Certificate program in Occupational Health and Safety.
</ol>
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li>To provide continuing education for in-service health personnel, so as to promote personal and professional development, thus enabling them to render more efficient services in accordance with the National Health Development Policy.

<li>To produce public health personnel and nurses at the bachelor level to meet the development needs of the country's health-care delivery system and to solve related problems.

<li>To provide public health information and knowledge to the general public so as to raise the health level of individuals, families, and society. 

<li>To carry out research in nursing and public health and to provide advisory services and research support in these areas to interested individuals and agencies.
</ol>

<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>RATIONALE</b></font>
<p>
Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University was established to provide the public with 
self-education through the open education system utilizing distance teaching media. 
Accordingly, schools to be established during the initial period were based principally 
on the needs of society and the  University's capability to provide educational services 
of an accepted standard. The needs of society were identified mainly by taking into 
account the National Economic and Social Development Plan, the National Educational 
Development Plan, and the findings of a survey on the public's attitude towards open 
university education. The University's capability was assessed by considering the 
experience and skill of the prospective personnel initially available, the possibility 
that those disciplines lend themselves to the distance teaching system, and the amount 
of teaching media already in existence. All of this was with a view that a full-time 
educational program could eventually be offered. Since Economics was one discipline 
which fulfilled the above criteria, the School of Economics was established and began 
instruction in 1982.
<p>
The bachelor's degree programs of the School of Economics received the approval of 
the Ministry of University affairs on February 29, 1980.
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li>To meet the needs of society by offering a bachelor's degree program to those
       interested in economics.

<li>To provide an academic service to those whose work concerns economics or to 
       those interested in economics who wish to study specific topics for later practical application 
       or for intellectual satisfaction.

<li>To provide a basic economic course in accordance with the requirements of other 
       schools of the University. 
</ol>

<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>RATIONALE</b></font>
<p>
In accordance with National Economic and Social Development Plans, Thailand is in the 
process of organizing its development activities. lt was envisaged that social development 
would contribute more effectively to the improvement of the quality of life and the professional 
competence of the people. There is an urgent need for a significant increase in an expansion 
of primary social services to improve living standards.
<p>
The establishment of the School of Home Economics was intended to be supportive of the 
national policy with regard to the preparation of qualified personnel capable of serving the 
interests of the country in the field of family development, especially in the rural areas, since 
the family is the fundamental social unit affected by development and affecting development.
<p>
In keeping with the aims of the national policy, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University 
(STOU) has organized undergraduate programs of study in Home Economics which 
emphasize individual and community development. Students will have an opportunity to 
enhance their prospects by increasing their knowledge and skills in improving the living 
standards and the quality of life of the public.
<p>
STOU's Home Economics students are able to choose either Community Nutrition programs 
or Child and Family Development programs. These programs, which are multi-disciplinary, 
integrate knowledge from different fields and from various sources. Course titles and terminology 
often differ from those employed by conventional universities offering similar courses reflecting 
this interdisciplinary approach.
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li>To provide Home Economics programs which are compatible with national needs for 
developing the fundamental requirements of family and social life, especially among rural 
families and low-income groups.

<li>To increase the knowledge, capabilities and accreditation of teachers, development 
officials and related personnel engaged in community development in order to apply the 
principles of Home Economics appropriately in rural development.

<li>To disseminate knowledge of Home Economics to the general public via various media, 
including correspondence or printed materials, radio and television programs, other audio-visual 
aids and back-up tutorial sessions at local and regional study centers.

<li>To initiate local surveys and research activities aimed at upgrading the quality of life 
in the rural areas.

<title>GENERAL INFORMATION</title></head>
<body  bgcolor=#ffffff>
<font size=+2 color=0000ff><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b></font><br>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>RATIONALE</b></font><br>
<dd>As the majority of Thais are engaged in agriculture related occupations, the
Government has established many organizations whose duty is to accept collective
responsibility for agricultural extension in rural areas. Many of the officials employed in
those organizations, however, do not have a high level of knowledge. Most possess
either a Certificate of Vocational Studies, a Vocational Certificate (upper level) in Agriculture
or Commerce, or a Diploma in Agriculture and Cooperatives or its equivalent. As
government officials do not have a sufficient level of knowledge to enable them to adapt
to the various changes taking place through the development of technology, the
improvement of agriculture related occupations remains a difficult task. Furthermore,
the development of agricultural extension manpower by conventional universities at a
rate proportionate to the increase in the farming population and to technological
changes still remains limited.
<p>
<dd>According to a survey, the target group wishing to study in the School of
Agricultural Extension and Cooperatives held Vocational Certificates or Vocational
Certificates (upper level) in Agriculture, Commere or other related fields.  It further
showed that they were government officials working in agricultural and cooperatives
extensions, and personnel concerned with the dissemination of a knowledge of agriculture
to the farming population. Data from this survey, collected from major departments
within the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, indicated that some 15,000,
33,000 and 3,000 staff members of the Department of Agricultural Extension, the
Department of Cooperatives Promotion and the Department of Agriculture respectively,
possessed the above-mentioned qualifications. This combined total of 51,000, does not
include qualified government officials working in other units of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior and other 
Ministries.
<p>
<dd>The School of Agricultural Extension and Cooperatives has an important role
to play in the development of manpower for the country and in bridging the gap
between government officials and the farming population. With an increased level of
knowledge among the farming population, it will be easier for government officials to
disseminate new information on agriculture. Furthermore, the School will help to
develop the general public by increasing their knowledge and understanding of agriculture, 
thus bringing about a better attitude towards agriculture related occupations.  It
will also help to inculcate a love of nature and a desire to conserve nature and the
environment.
<p>
<dd>According to a report submitted to the Ministry University Affairs, the Subcommittee
for Considering, Studying and Establishing Projects for Open Universities, it
was proposed that a School of Agriculture be established. This report, entitled "The
Opinions of the General Public on Open Universities, 1987", also indicated that a large
number of people were interested in courses in agriculture which ranked first among the
ten electives suggested.
<p>
<dd>To implement the proposal of the Sub-committee, and to conform to the
resolutions passed by the Cabinet on November 13,1979, STOU  expanded its operations
to harmonize with Ramkhamhaeng University's admission plan. The University,
therefore, established the School of Agricultural Extension and Cooperatives with the
objectives of producing and developing agricultural manpower to meet the needs of the 
nation.
<p>
<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font><br>
<dd>1) To develop agricultural extension and cooperatives manpower.<br>
<dd>2) To promote research in Agricultural Extension and Cooperatives.<br>
<dd>3) To disseminate knowledge of agriculture and cooperatives to the general public.

<p>
Communication Arts has an important role to play in national development, as communication, the development of understanding, and the use of mass media bring benefits to both the government and the people.
<p>
According to a report submitted to the Ministry of University Affairs in March, 1978, by the Sub-committee for Considering, Studying and Establishing Projects for Open Universities, it was proposed that a School of Communication Arts be established at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University.
<p>
Work in the area of communication is concerned with the application of different types of media to the relaying of news, the dissemination of knowledge, the provision of entertainment, and most important, to the development of a better understanding among the people themselves, and between the people and the government through communication arises knowledge, understanding and unity, along with development in different areas.
<p>
Up until now Communication Arts has been offered as a course in Thailand only in conventional universities and there has been no university offering a curriculum, through the use of the distance teaching system, which aims at helping the public upgrade their knowledge and abilities and improve those skills required in their profession.
<p>
After considering this matter, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University established the School of Communication Arts for the following reasons:
<ol>

	<li> As the University employs the distance teaching system using various types of educational technology, it is fully equipped with the basic facilities necessary to support instruction in the School of Communication Arts. In addition, the Japanese government has supported the establishment of an Educational Broadcasting Production Center at the University which further supports instruction in the School of Communication Arts.
	<li> The establishment of the School of Communication Arts fits in with national needs to develop human resources in mass communication. The Fifth Development Plan for Higher Education specified that a School of Communication Arts be established at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. This project was given high priority.
</ol>
The four-year bachelor’s degree program, together with the three-year bachelor's degree program, received the approval of the Ministry of University Affairs on March 20, 1984.
<p>

<font size=+1 color=ff0000><b>OBJECTIVES</b></font>
<ol>
<li> To produce graduates and develop human resources in the fields of journalism, radio, television, film, advertising and public relations.

<li> To promote research in communication arts.

<li> To disseminate knowledge on communication arts to the public in general.
</ol>
