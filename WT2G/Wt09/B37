        RELEASE OF VULTURE TO MARK RON ARAD'S CAPTIVITY



IN an unusual gesture to mark the eighth anniversary of the capture of IAF
navigator Ron Arad, a vulture will be released  back into the wild today.
Ron's mother, Batya Arad, will release the bird which she named "Freedom"
(Hofesh).

The event was initiated by the Ron Arad Association, the Society for the
Protection of Nature in Israel and the Tisch Family  Biblical Zoo in
Jerusalem.

"The vulture soaring in the sky above us will symbolize freedom.  It will
remind all those it passes over that Ron has not  yet been set free and that
we are waiting for all the prisoners of war and missing soldiers," said Ohad
Ha'tzofeh , manager of  SPNI's project for the return of vultures to nature.

Freedom is a three-year-old male vulture which was brought to the Biblical Zoo
a year ago with an injury.  After treatment it  was transferred to the Carmel
as part of the SPNI project which readies vultures for release from captivity.

The vulture will be the 12th to be released through the project which is
supported by the Yad Hanadiv fund.

A small satellite transmitter will be attached to Freedom's back.  The signals
are received from anywhere on earth and will  help SPNI staff track the
vulture's movements.

Several vultures freed by SPNI in the past have ended up in Syria. SPNI
director-general Yossi Leshem said the groups  involved "see great symbolism
in the project and hope the vulture carries a message of freedom and peace
across the border".

Freedom's release is the first in a series of events commemorating the
anniversary of Arad's capture.

        VULTURE FLIES FOR RON ARAD



BATYA Arad, mother of missing IAF navigator Ron Arad, yesterday released a
three-year-old vulture back into the wild, to  commemorate the eighth
anniversary of Ron's capture.  The vulture, named Freedom, was the 12th to be
released as part of a joint  project by the Society for the Protection of
Nature in Israel and Yad Hanadiv to reintroduce the birds to the wild in the
Mt.  Carmel area.

Arad said that, as the vulture soared to freedom and flew back to its nest,
she hopes to see her son return to his home.

The Arad family and families of other MIAs are scheduled to meet with US
Secretary of State Warren Christopher today to ask  him to bring up the
subject of her missing son with the Syrians, Arad said.

        CEREMONY MARKS EIGHTH YEAR OF ARAD'S CAPTURE



"AN entire people will celebrate your return home," former president Chaim
Herzog promised missing Air Force navigator Ron  Arad yesterday, in an
emotional ceremony in Tel Aviv to mark eight years since his capture.

"When you come home, Ron Arad, to your wife and daughter, to your family and
your people who are waiting for you with  uplifted eyes, you won't believe
your eyes: An entire people will celebrate your return home.  An entire people
will join you in  the feeling of joy and freedom," Herzog said.

Thousands of people holding signs and candles participated in the event at the
Tel Aviv Museum.

Herzog said he could "testify firsthand that over the years a supreme effort
has been made by the Israeli governments to  locate and free our missing
fighters.  The sad fact that these efforts have not borne fruit yet does not
indicate any easing up.   We must continue to tenaciously and steadfastly
pursue the goal until we achieve it".

Arad's brother, Chen, said the Syrians had a role in Arad's situation, and
told the crowd tearfully: "I say that only through  your pressure can we see
to it that there will be no peace without Ron's return".

        MIA'S PARENTS APPEAL TO FIRST LADY



YONA and Miriam Baumel, parents of missing soldier Zecharia Baumel, yesterday
presented Hillary Clinton with a silver copy of  their son's military ID tag.

Half of the original metal disc had been given to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in December  1993.  At the time, Arafat had
promised to provide additional information on Baumel and the two soldiers
listed as missing with  him in the battle of Sultan Yakub, Zvi Feldman and
Yehuda Katz.  The battle took place in Lebanon on June 11, 1982.

"Half the dog-tag is half the story," Yona Baumel said.  "We know that Arafat
and [Syrian President Hafez] Assad have  information about our son and the
other MIAs.  Receiving such information should be one of the conditions for
holding future peace  talks".

Explaining the presentation of the copy of his son's dog-tag to Clinton,
Baumel said: "This dignified memento will remind her  of the fact that there
is still an American citizen being held captive in the Middle East.  There can
be no genuine peace until  all our soldiers return home".

Zecharia Baumel holds joint American and Israeli citizenship.

The Baumels said they appealed to Hillary Clinton as a mother and hope she
will use her influence with the president to get  him to act on the missing
soldiers' behalf.

A second dog-tag was also presented to the wife of the president, engraved
with the names of all six MIAs: Rahamim Elsheikh,  Yosef Fink, Zecharia
Baumel, Zvi Feldman, Yehuda Katz, and Ron Arad.

IDF.  Missing Person.  Ron Arad.  Information.

        VIENNA: NO NEWS ON LOCATING MIAS.      AUSTRIAN PRESIDENT DUE HERE
SUNDAY TO REPORT ON CONTACTS.



AUSTRIAN President Thomas Klestil is due to arrive here on Sunday for a
two-day visit, marking the first visit to Israel by  an Austrian head of
state, Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday.

Klestil is expected to inform Israeli officials that Vienna's most recent
contacts with Iran have failed to find any new  information on IDF navigator
Ron Arad and the other soldiers missing in Lebanon.

In Vienna, Klestil declined to tell visiting Israeli journalists exactly what
information on the missing Israelis he would  bring to Jerusalem from
Austria's Arab and Iranian contacts but said "unfortunately, there is nothing
new".

A source close to the president told The Jerusalem Post yesterday that in
recent high-level talks in Teheran, the Iranian  government "had nothing new
for us, but they gave us answers in a different way".

The source said the Iranians assured the Austrians that they had "really tried
again with their people [in Lebanon] but found  nothing".

Klestil's arrival comes as Israeli-Austrian relations have been on the
upswing, following six years of bilateral strain due  to the alleged Nazi
activities of Klestil's predecessor, Kurt Waldheim.  Officials note that
Austria has been active in  multilateral peace talks in such issues as energy,
environment, and water.

The Austrian president will be joined in Israel by Foreign Minister Alois
Mock, Education Minister Rudolf Scholten,  Environment and Youth Minister
Rauch Kallat, as well as Austrian businessmen.

During his stay, Klestil will address the Knesset, visit Yad Vashem, and
inaugurate a teachers' training center in Jerusalem.   Apart from meeting
senior Israeli officials, Klestil is also reportedly planning to meet
Palestinians.

Also scheduled to arrive here next week for an official visit is Senegal's
foreign minister, who will be the guest of Foreign  Minister Shimon Peres for
four days.

In Paris yesterday, Israel and the Indian Ocean nation of Comoros formally
established diplomatic relations ties.  Comoros is  the third member of the
Arab League to do so.  The decision to establish ties reportedly followed very
rapid contacts that lasted  just several days.

        CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION BRIEFS IDF, FAMILIES ON MIAS


THE US congressional delegation investigating the fate of three
IDF soldiers missing in action since the Sultan Yaakub battle in June
1982 returned from Lebanon yesterday and briefed IDF officers on their
findings.

The American team, dispatched to the area after Syria promised
the US to assist in finding any clue leading to new information,
reportedly brought back with them soil samples from a village near
Sultan Yaakub, where they visited.

Local villagers apparently said that in 1982, Palestinians in the
area boasted that they "recently buried three Israeli bodies".  The
army would not comment on the briefing.

The delegation also met with the families of the three soldiers.
Israel Radio reported that they told the families that they were
receiving the full cooperation of both Syria and Lebanon, and hoped
that in a few weeks they would get some concrete results.

However, Amal leader Nabih Berri said yesterday that he would
refuse to meet the US congressional team.

"Out of respect for American law that bans US citizens from
visiting Lebanon, I can't meet these people," Berri, also speaker of
the Lebanese parliament, was quoted as saying on Lebanese radio
stations.

Hizbullah has made it clear on several occasions that it is
prepared to discuss the whole prisoners and MiA issue with
"international and humanitarian organizations," but not with the US
which it described as overtly pro-Israeli.

A Hizbullah leader, Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, was quoted by newspapers
yesterday as saying that if all the MiAs, and especially Ron Arad,
were in Hizbullah hands "the matter would have taken a different
course."

"But we have said all along that we know nothing about Arad.  We
have two Israeli soldiers in our hands and the conditions for their
release are known to all concerned," Kaouk was quoted as saying.

Kaouk maintained that Syria had not put any pressure on Hizbullah
to meet the US congressional team, despite the recent visit to
Damascus by Hizbullah secretary-general Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah which
coincided with the arrival of the Americans in the Syrian capital.

In their editorials, several Lebanese newspapers mocked the US
humanitarian mission, describing the congressional team's fact-finding
visit to the area as a "charade."

The newspapers, including those known to be pro-Syrian, have
accused the US of ignoring Lebanese being held by Israel.

Some politicians, echoing the general feeling, were reported to
have called on the Lebanese government to refuse to have anything to
do with the US mission.

        FAMILIES OF MISSING SOLDIERS HOPE KLESTIL WILL BE KEY TO FINDING SONS



FAMILIES of the Israeli soldiers missing in action in Lebanon said last night
that Austrian President Thomas Klestil might  well be the person who helps
them locate the whereabouts of their loved ones.

"Dr. Klestil has excellent ties with Iran and Syria and he could be the man to
help us solve the problem," Yona Baumel,  father of MIA Zacharya Baumel said
last night.  He was speaking to reporters after the Austrian president met
with members of  families of the five men who have been missing since 1982.
Klestil also held a separate meeting with members of the family of  navigator
Ron Arad, before hosting a reception at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.

Baumel said that Klestil had begun working on the issue already when he was
deputy foreign minister and had continued over  the years, holding several
meetings with the MIAs' families.

"We have the utmost confidence in his integrity.  He has proven to be
instrumental, a good friend and a superb diplomat,"  Baumel said, adding that
the Austrian head of state had worked discreetly behind the scenes.

Asked whether there was a possibility of a prisoner exchange in which the MIAs
would be involved, Baumel said: "No comment".

        GERMAN PAPER: RON ARAD IS ALIVE IN IRAN



RON Arad is alive and being held by Iran, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,
one of Germany's premier newspapers claims in a  story published today.

It says that negotiations between Israel and Iran on his release are being
mediated by Germany and have reached an advanced  stage.

"We have no information on this.  I don't know anything about this," Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's spokesman Oded Ben-Ami  told Reuters.

Senior security officials said "no new signs of life" have been received
regarding Arad.  Other officials involved in  attempts to locate Arad refused
comment.

The F-4 Phantom in which Arad was back-seater was shot down over Lebanon in
October 1986.  Both the pilot and Arad ejected  successfully.  The pilot was
rescued by Israeli helicopters but Arad was spotted coming down in an
Amal-held area and he was taken  prisoner.  His whereabouts have remained a
mystery since.

The paper said that German State Secretary Berndt Schmidtbauer has been
mediating between Israel and Iran.  According to the  story, Iranian and
Israeli negotiators sit in separate rooms and relay information through the
German.

The paper says that Tami Arad visited Bonn in the last year, and recently
received a video and a letter attesting to the fact  that her husband is
alive.

It claims that in exchange for Arad's release, Iran is demanding the release
of kidnapped Lebanese Shi'ite leaders Mustafa  Dirani and Sheikh Abdel Karim
Obeid, and Hamas leader Shiekh Ahmed Yassin.

Israel, said the Allgemeine Zeitung, is demanding Iran cease its support of
Hizbullah and extremist Palestinian Islamic  groups.

The paper disclosed that Iranian intelligence chief, Ali Falahin, visited
Germany on several occasions in the last year.

        'GERMAN PAPER DUPED, ARAD VIDEO NOT NEW'



RON Arad's family did indeed receive a videocassette and a letter recently -
but they were copies of the original video and  letter sent to them several
years ago that indicated the missing navigator was alive, an informed source
said last night.

The Iranians thus succeeded in duping the German newspaper, Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, the source said.  The paper  reported yesterday that there
had been new signs of life from Arad in the form of a letter and video to his
wife, and that the  German State Secretary Berndt Schmidtbauer is mediating
between Israel and Iran for his release.

Arad was shot down over Lebanon in October 1986 and was spotted parachuting
into an Amal-Shi'ite area.

Almost every Israeli official asked about the matter yesterday denied that
Israel received any new signs of life from Arad,  but German government
officials confirmed that talks were held in Bonn.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin described as "baseless" the revelations on
negotiations between Israel and Iran.

"I know of German inquiries with the Iranians on Arad's fate and whereabouts,
but they have resulted in nothing," Rabin said  yesterday.  "No negotiations
are currently being held between Israel and Iran.  We consider him alive and
we hold the Iranians  responsible for his fate". Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
criticized the newspaper report yesterday as being harmful.

In Bonn, meanwhile, Government spokesman Dieter Vogel confirmed that Germany
held talks with Iran on the issue, but refused  to add any details.

        IRAN: WE FAILED TO FIND RON ARAD



BONN - Iran tried to locate missing airman Ron Arad at the request of Germany
but failed to find him, the Iranian Embassy  said yesterday.

The embassy denied a German newspaper report that Iran and Israel held secret
negotiations about Arad, whose plane was shot  down on a bombing mission over
Lebanon in October 1986.  Israel believes Arad is being held in Iran.

In a statement faxed to reporters, the Iranian Embassy did acknowledge that
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked Iran to  look for Arad.

"On the basis of a request by Chancellor Kohl, [Iranian] President Hashemi
Rafsanjani gave an order that there be a search  for Ron Arad.  The search was
unsuccessful," the embassy said.

No details were given of where, how or when the search was conducted.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported Tuesday that Israeli and
Iranian negotiators have been talking about  Arad from separate rooms at the
German Chancellery, with German mediators going back and forth between them.

The Iranian Embassy said that part of the story is wrong: "There were neither
direct nor indirect discussions between Iranian  and Israeli diplomats".
Israel on Tuesday confirmed that Germany had been talking with Iran about Arad
but said the discussions had produced no  information about where he is or
whether he is alive.

State-run Teheran Television, monitored in Cyprus, said in a commentary that
"the Iranian nation and the Islamic world are  wholly accustomed to such
lies". Teheran Television suggested that the German report aimed to paint Iran
in a conciliatory light, and show that it had given  up its staunch opposition
to talks with Israel.

        IRANIAN EXILE '100% CERTAIN' ARAD IS ALIVE



An Iranian exile living in Los Angeles told Channel Two News last night that
he was "100 percent certain" Ron Arad was alive  and being held in Iran.

Meanwhile, Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Ori Orr said
yesterday that Israel does not know exactly  where Ron Arad is, "but we know
that Iran has the key - and more than that - to finding and returning him".
Orr said there was nothing to reports in a German newspaper about a new tape
and letters indicating Arad was alive, adding  such information was
irresponsible.  "We believe the Germans did this because there are many
complaints against them in the West,  especially in the US, about their
maintaining relations with the Iranians, so to justify this they said they are
also helping the  Israelis," Orr said.

        EXILED IRANIAN: ARAD SUFFERING BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY



MISSING airman Ron Arad is suffering in an Iranian jail, an exiled Iranian
told Channel Two yesterday.

The Iranian, Manasher Mutamer, told Channel Two that he worked for Iran's
intelligence agency from 1985 until 1994, when he  left the Islamic state.

A month before Mutamer left Iran he visited a jail in the Iranian city of
Esfahan where he saw a foreign prisoner that jail  officers told him was Arad,
he said.

"Regretfully his physical condition was very poor  ...  his mental condition
was very poor.  They move him every few months.   They are trying to break him
emotionally and in spirit," Mutamer said.

"I have a message for his wife and for his mother and that is: your husband
and your son is alive  ...  He is holding on  despite the suffering," Mutamer
said.

Information.

        RABIN SAYS IRAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ARAD'S FATE.      TWO GERMANS
PROVIDE MORE DETAILS.



IRAN is responsible for the fate of missing airman Ron Arad, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin declared last night, following two  more reports that he is
being held in Teheran.

"We have a basis to believe that Arad is being held by official Iranian
circles, although it is not clear where," Rabin told  reporters in Jerusalem,
after addressing a UJA mission from Dallas, Texas.




"The Iranians have not given concrete information to either the French or the
Germans," Rabin said, "So we cannot say  anything definitive.  But it is clear
that Iran is responsible  ...  Ron Arad was known to be alive about a year
after his  capture.  We regard Iran as the address for returning him home safe
and sound". He said he understood the distress of the Arad family because of
the conflicting information about Ron.

Yesterday, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zietung reported that a Turk who is now
a German citizen, and was held until recently  in an Iranian jail, said he was
told by guards that "an Israeli pilot is held in Ward 209, where all maximum
security prisoners  are held". Wuda Olef Skota told the paper that he was
never told the Israeli's name, or his condition.  The paper continued to claim
that German-mediated negotiations between Israel and Iran on the release of
Arad were held in Germany.

Meanwhile, another German citizen, Helmut Shimkos, who was imprisoned in the
same prison, revealed more details about the  whereabouts of Arad yesterday.
Shimkos, an engineer, was jailed on suspicion of spying for the CIA.

"In 1991, I was sitting with two Americans, one of whom was a pilot who had
some flight magazines.  The warder then asked us  if we had some magazines to
give to another pilot in the prison," he told Channel One.  "That made us
suspicious and so we asked  around to find out who this could be.  But we
didn't find out anything and we didn't imagine then that it could be Ron
Arad". An official government statement released here said the possibility of
Arad being held in an Iranian jail "can be neither  refuted nor corroborated,
since there are no signs of life given in the testimonies by people who claim
to know". Arad's wife Tami said she would not have anything to say until her
husband returns, Channel One reported.

Asked about last year's establishment of a committee to look into the fate of
all the MIAS, Rabin said: "It is good that  someone that does not deal daily
with the subject checks if the path we have chosen is right". The official
statement also said that Iranian authorities have been holding Arad for more
than six years and are responsible  for his fate, health, and safe return.

"This determination we make is based on reliable and concrete information.
Iran has systematically refrained from disclosing  any information on Ron
Arad, while falsely denying that it has any information concerning him," the
statement said.

The Prime Minister's Office, meanwhile, denied that a visit by an aide to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has any connection to Arad.   The aide, Joachim
Bieterlich, arrived yesterday and is scheduled to meet today with Rabin and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.

Officially, he is here to discuss commercial issues, but diplomatic sources
said that he is here to prepare for a possible  Kohl visit.  The sources said
he will be asked to convey a message expressing Israel's dissatisfaction with
expanding economic  ties between Germany and Iran.

Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Wazi said yesterday that
Iran was willing to sign the Nuclear  Proliferation Treaty with minor
corrections, among them that Iran be eligible to receive advanced nuclear
technology from  developed countries.

Joachim Betterlich.  Visit.  Israel.

        GERMAN ENVOY OFFERS NO NEWS ON ARAD



A SENIOR German envoy brought no new information to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin yesterday on the whereabouts of missing  navigator Ron Arad, a senior
German official said.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's foreign policy adviser Joachim Betterlich met with
Rabin yesterday ostensibly to plan the June visit  of Kohl, but Arad's fate
was also discussed during their meeting.

Betterlich's visit was scheduled before the spate of articles in the German
press about Arad.

A statement issued by the Prime Minister's bureau spokesman after the meeting
said issues surrounding Arad's fate are outside  the purview of Betterlich's
authority.

German officials have made clear that Arad is the subject of a German-Iranian
dialogue.

In remarks to reporters after meeting Rabin, Betterlich said people should
separate the "humanitarian" issue of Arad from  German-Iranian relations.
Senior Israeli officials have voiced displeasure that Bonn agreed last year to
a major rescheduling of  Iranian debt, charging this eased the economic crisis
facing Teheran and thereby weakened Western pressure on the regime.

During the Rabin-Betterlich meeting, the premier raised the possibility of
Germany assisting Jordan in the construction of  dams along the Yarmouk and
Jordan rivers.  When asked afterwards if Germany would consider Rabin's
appeal, a senior German  official replied "we have to look into it".

Information.  Media.  Israel.

        'GERMANY PRESSURING IRAN FOR ARAD'S RELEASE'.      NEWSPAPER SAYS IRAN
MAY LOSE GERMAN CREDITS.



FRANKFURT - Germany might withdraw government-backed trade credits for Iran if
Teheran does not arrange the release of Ron  Arad, the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zietung newspaper said yesterday.

Israel and Iran have been negotiating indirectly every two weeks in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's offices in Bonn, but the talks  have been broken off
temporarily, the newspaper said.

The Iranian government denied the newspaper's previous report that German
mediators were shuttling from one room to another,  facilitating the indirect
negotiations.

Israeli officials had acknowledged German contacts with Iran were made and
issues important to Israel were raised.

But Israeli officials had suggested the previous leaked report was intended to
distract attention from the German Economics  Ministry's decision last week to
reinstate government-backed credits worth $102 million for exports to Iran.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zietung said in its latest story, to appear in
today's edition, that the credits were part of a  phased plan to drag
concessions out of Iran on the Arad case, and Germany would consider
withdrawing the credits if Iran didn't  put enough pressure on the radical
group believed holding him.

Arad has been missing since his aircraft was shot down over Lebanon in 1986.

After the last Frankfurter Allgemeine Zietung report, Israel said it believed
Arad was alive in Iran, but denied it had  received any evidence of that
through the German mediation.

The Iranian government issued a statement saying that, at Kohl's request, it
had conducted a search for the airman, and had  not found him.

The main stumbling block in the indirect negotiations, the newspaper said, was
that Arad is held by a group directed by  radical Islamic clergy rather than
by Iranian government authorities.

The newspaper quoted unnamed German government sources for most of its story,
and also cited Israeli intelligence sources  saying that Israel had certain
knowledge for months that Arad was alive and in Iran.

Israel has criticized Germany indirectly for maintaining economic ties with
Iran, despite admonitions from Washington that  Iran should be shunned as a
country promoting terrorism.  Germany justifies its policy as a way to keep
contacts open and try to  turn Iran away from dangerous acts.

        PERES: NO NEW INFO ON RON ARAD



FOREIGN Minister Shimon Peres, returning from a visit in Germany, said
yesterday that there is no new information concerning  the whereabouts of
missing air force navigator Ron Arad.

Peres said Israel had asked the Germans to take a number of steps to try to
locate Arad.  "Germany and Chancellor [Kohl]  responded to our request, but
unfortunately nothing came out of it". Recent newspaper reports said Arad is
being held in an Iranian jail, and the German government had been in contact
with Iran  over his fate.  Germany only confirmed that it had made inquiries
into the matter.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said last month that Israel is convinced that
Arad was being held by official Iranian circles,  although it is not clear
where.

"We on working on the matter non-stop," said Peres, "and we are checking into
every hint to see if we can find where he is,  what is happening to him and if
it is possible to bring him home".

        'SYRIAN JEWS MAY POSTPONE DEPARTURE'


A SPOKESMAN for the local Syrian Jewish community yesterday
welcomed Syrian President Hafez Assad's references to peace with
Israel but expressed concern that it could lead to Syrian Jews
postponing their departure from that country.

"We heard new music from President Assad.  This is the first time
he has both implicitly and expressly spoken of peace," said Dr. David
Silvera of the Organization of Syrian and Lebanese Jews in Israel.

"But, while I am encouraged as an Israeli, as someone with roots
in Syria, I am afraid that the very thought of peace will mean that
not all the Jews will want to leave right away," Silvera said.

"Those who have sense will take their visas and go  ...  I just
hope that the really rich Jews - some 300 or 400 - will not want to
wait till they can sell their property as part of a deal under
conditions of peace," he said.

Parents of the IDF soldiers missing since the Lebanon war were
more circumspect about Assad's pronouncements, saying they are hoping
to get information from State Department official Dennis Ross, who was
due in Israel last night.

"We had hoped there would be some mention of the MiAs, some
positive statement, in the press conference [held by presidents
Clinton and Assad] but we are very practical," said Yona Baumel.

Taking advantage of the upsurge in interest in Syria's role in
the peace talks, the families of the MiAs are launching publicity
campaigns abroad.

Miriam Baumel, Zacharia's mother, left yesterday for the US,
where she will appear at rallies on campuses, organized by the
international students organization for the MiAs.  The Baumels will
later travel together to Washington and Ottawa to meet senior US and
Canadian government officials.

Meanwhile, Chen Arad is in London trying to garner support to
free his brother, navigator Ron Arad.

Hundreds of demonstrators in London gathered opposite the Iranian
Embassy yesterday to protest Arad's captivity.

        RABIN SEES KOHL IN SURPRISE TRIP TO BONN



PRIME Minister Yitzhak Rabin held three and a half hours of talks with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn last night,  which included an effort to
improve the atmosphere between the two countries in the light of reports about
the whereabouts of  downed navigator Ron Arad.

Kohl was reportedly furious over charges by Israelis that German press
disclosures about Bonn's efforts to secure Arad's  release were motivated by
Bonn's effort to offset increased German economic ties with Iran.  Arad is
believed to be held by Iran.




In a statement issued last night, Rabin's spokesman, Oded Ben-Ami, said Rabin
is very appreciative of Germany's efforts,  including personal attempts by
Chancellor Kohl, to secure the release of Arad and other missing IDF
servicemen.

Ben-Ami said Rabin also thanked European nations, including Germany, for their
contribution to solving Jordan's water  problems.

Rabin's abrupt departure had set off speculation about progress on the release
of Arad.  Germany has been a go-between with  Teheran.

"Germany, and the chancellor personally, in accordance with our requests, made
efforts [to release Arad.] In the meantime, I  cannot report any
developments," Rabin said on Channel 1 before leaving for Germany.

Germany, which paid for two Dolphin-class submarines that Israel wanted in
recent years, recently agreed to finance half of a  third sub.

Among the issues discussed last night were Bonn's plans to finance dams for
Jordan, in order to alleviate that country's  water shortage.  The
construction of dams was stipulated in the Israel-Jordan peace treaty of last
October.

Rabin has also been very active in seeking US debt relief to Jordan.  This all
is part of the premier's broader signal to  Arabs, including Syria, that peace
with Israel will yield a peace dividend.

In announcing yesterday's meeting, a statement released by Rabin's bureau said
the premier would be discussing the Middle  East peace process, bilateral
ties, and matters related to the European Union (EU).  Israel has been
unsatisfied with the terms  put forward by the EU for an upgraded free-trade
agreement.

While the trip had been planned for two days, the premier's office only
announced the visit an hour before Rabin's departure.

Rabin was accompanied by his military aide, Maj.  -Gen.  Danny Yatom.  He is
to return early this morning.

Foreign Minister Shimon Peres warned yesterday against raising hopes about
Arad's return.

"We appreciate Germany's help," Peres said, but Israel is not partner to all
the speculation on the subject.

Arad.  Missing Person.  Iran.

        RABIN, KOHL HEAL RIFT OVER ARAD REPORT



PRIME Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday divulged no details about his sudden
trip to Germany on Wednesday to meet with  Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Conspicuously absent was any new information on the whereabouts of downed air
force navigator Ron Arad.

Rabin confined himself to saying what is generally known, namely that Bonn has
been a pivotal go-between in seeking the  release of missing Israeli
servicemen.  The premier termed "nonsensical" an Israel Television report that
he flew to Bonn after  the chancellor slammed the phone down during a stormy
conversation.

"The visit to Germany is the beginning of a new foreign relations policy,
whereby we are asked to exchange information with  the leaders of countries
that work with us, and that is the reason for my brief and substantive visit
to Germany," Rabin told  reporters at a memorial ceremony for Yigal Allon at
Kibbutz Ginossar.

Perhaps as part of this new policy, Bundeswehr Chief of Staff Klaus Naumann
arrived here yesterday on a quiet, but official  visit.

German officials in Bonn told Reuters yesterday that Rabin and Kohl had
patched up their differences over a report concerning  Bonn's help in seeking
missing Israeli soldiers.

The squabble, officials said, was over a story leaked to Germany's Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, which said last  month Bonn had negotiated on
Israel's behalf with Iran for Arad's release.

However, Rabin and Kohl did express wide disagreement over expanding
German-Iranian relations, diplomatic sources here said  yesterday.

According to the sources, Rabin criticized Bonn's policy of "constructive
dialogue" with Iran, saying it legitimized Iran's  belligerent policies and
weapons buildup.  Kohl explained Germany's policy as an attempt to avoid
excluding Iran from the  international community and thus pushing it to
further extremism.

Germany's expanding commercial ties with Iran were also discussed, but the
sources said Kohl reminded Rabin the US and Japan  have more extensive ties
with Iran than Germany.

The German officials said Rabin came to Bonn to "clear the air". In Jerusalem,
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee  chairman Ori Orr, who had
criticized Germany's behavior, agreed.

"The main aim was to clear the air and improve relations with Germany," Orr
told Israel Radio.

German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said the talks were part of routine
informal contacts.

"Rabin thanked the German government for the efforts it has made with various
states in the Middle East to determine the fate  of missing Israeli soldiers,
especially that of Ron Arad," Hausmann said in a statement issued early
yesterday.

        RED CROSS WON'T BARGAIN FOR ISRAELI MIAS



THE International Committee of the Red Cross would refuse to bargain for
Israeli prisoners of war, dead or alive, in contacts  with the Lebanese
because this contradicts accepted international procedure, ICRC President
Cornelio Sommaruga said yesterday.

Sommaruga was speaking after a three-hour meeting with family members of
Israeli MiAs, some of whom also met with German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl
yesterday during a flurry of diplomatic activity on the MiAs.

During the meeting with Sommaruga , Yona Baumel passed on new information
"recently received from a certain area in Lebanon"  about his son, Zacharia,
and the other Sultan Ya'acoub MiAs in the hope that the Red Cross could verify
it.  Baumel said that this  information contradicts the claims by PA Chairman
Yasser Arafat that all the soldiers are dead.

Baumel is due to meet with senior Israeli military sources today to discuss
the information, which he says was obtained  through private channels.

Sommaruga told Tami Arad, wife of missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad, that he
has a watch on which are engraved the names of  his six children, "but when I
look at it I remember my seventh, Ron Arad". Sommaruga, here as a guest of the
Israel Council for Foreign Relations and the UN Association in Israel, said:
"We will do  what we can to help the families, but there are great
difficulties in this part of the world, especially with the different
factions in Lebanon". Sommaruga held out some hope for some.  The Red Cross
head promised to intervene with Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who is
jailed in Israel, in an effort to have the body of Ilan Sa'adon, kidnapped and
murdered inside Israel, returned, Israel Radio  reported.

Other parents were reportedly very critical of the international body's steps
until now.

Last night Sommaruga reiterated his "compassion for the millions of victims of
the Shoah ... and the other millions who  perished in World War II.  Our
failure to speak out at that time was a moral defeat". Kohl, who also met with
Arad's family, reportedly said that German investigations into Arad's
whereabouts had not revealed  anything new.  Germany had tried to get
information on Arad's whereabouts at Israel's request.

Members of other MiA families said they were waiting to hear whether the
chancellor would meet with them during his visit.

        AUSTRALIA TO KEEP 'NAGGING' ON BEHALF OF RON ARAD



AUSTRALIA will continue to make inquiries on behalf of missing navigator Ron
Arad, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans  said yesterday at a news
conference in Jerusalem.

Evans noted that he had spoken to the Iranians in 1993 and 1994.  "I'm happy
to go on nagging away on this issue," he  declared, "not because I have any
particular expectation that our voice will be better heeded than anyone
else's, but it is  important, I think, that the international community
continue to keep that issue alive as an issue, in the hope that sooner or
later there can be some resolution".

Regarding Australian opposition to the resumption of French nuclear tests in
the Pacific, Evans said his country will not  attend any of the Bastille Day
functions at ministerial level.  "It is inappropriate when we are so extremely
critical of the  French decision to resume tests," he said.  He added that
Australia is not planning to cut off diplomatic relations with France.   "We
would be reluctant to do that because of the large policy issues," he
explained.  "We need to maintain a persuasive dialogue  on the nuclear issue
itself".

        HIZBULLAH DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF RON ARAD'S WHEREABOUTS



BEIRUT - The Hizbullah said yesterday it was not holding missing airman Ron
Arad, and it also vowed to secure the release of  250 Lebanese jailed by
Israel.

"Israel cares only for one soldier, Israeli pilot Ron Arad, whom we are not
holding and whose whereabouts or kidnappers we  don't know," Sheik Naim
Kassem, Hizbullah's deputy secretary general, said in remarks published
yesterday in the London-based Al- Hayat.

Israel contends it has information that Arad is still alive and is believed to
be in Iranian hands.  However, the Iranian  government and Hizbullah have
repeatedly denied this.

Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said recently that his government does
not have accurate information on whether Arad is  dead or alive.

Meanwhile, Kassem said there were "real difficulties" in securing the freedom
of Lebanese prisoners held in a detention  center in Israel and in the
security zone in south Lebanon.

"We are making political and media contacts to secure their release," he said.

Israel released some Lebanese prisoners this year from the Khiam Detention
Center in the security zone.  About 250 are still  held, accused of aiding
anti-Israeli terrorists.

        RON ARAD'S MOTHER: I FEEL BETRAYED



BATYA Arad, the mother of missing navigator Ron Arad, said yesterday she feels
betrayed by the government's apparent decision  to release the hijacked
Iranian jet and its passengers.

"The Arad family believes that after nine years in which Ron's whereabouts
remain unknown, yet are linked to Iran, it is  implausible that Israel would
not take advantage of a situation involving Iranian nationals to advance Ron's
cause," she said in a  radio interview.  Arad has been missing since his
Phantom was downed over Lebanon in 1986.

Although Iran denies any knowledge of Arad's whereabouts, it is widely
believed here that the Iranians know where he was for  part of the time and he
may have been held either in Iran or by Iran in Lebanon.

"Mr. Rabin talks about a humanitarian gesture.  I'd like to see these gestures
work both sides.  Today I feel betrayed by my  government," Batya Arad said.

Ron Arad's brother Chen told Army Radio that Israel "should use use this
opportunity to create some kind of connection with  the Iranian government".
Tsomet MK Pini Badash sent a telegram to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
demanding that the more than 170 Iranians be exchanged  for Ron Arad.  "This
is an opportunity we have to take advantage of," Badash told The Associated
Press.  "It's our chance to get  Arad back".

        IRANIAN AIRLINER RETURNS TO TEHERAN; HIJACKER TO BE HANDED TO RED
CROSS



ISRAEL allowed the hijacked Iranian passenger plane to leave Uvda Air Force
Base for Teheran last night, with all of its  occupants except the hijacker.

The Kish Air Boeing 707, which landed here Tuesday morning, took off from Uvda
at 7:22 p.m., and was escorted by two air  force jets for the duration of the
flight over Israeli air space.  The plane headed northwest to the
Mediterranean, north to  Turkey, and then eastwards to Iran.

The veteran airliner landed in Tehran around midnight Iranian time, but
passengers were not allowed to leave the airport,  sources in Tehran told the
Associated Press.  Passengers and crew were taken to an empty terminal used
only for special flights,  the sources said.




The hijacker, Jabari Rizah, a 30-year-old flight attendant, will be brought
today before the Eilat Magistrate's Court for a  remand hearing.  Israel will
most likely reject his request for political asylum, but will not extradite
him to Iran.  According  to a Foreign Ministry international law department
official, Rizah will probably be handed over to the International Red Cross.

"I assume [the Red Cross] will not send him back to Iran, because although he
clearly committed an act of terrorism, sending  him back would expose him to
torture and condemn him to death.  I think the Red Cross would assist him in
finding an alternative  asylum venue," the official said.

Israel did not grant political asylum to the five passengers who had requested
it Tuesday, and they embarked the plane last  night together with the other
169 passengers.

The plane's departure was scheduled for late yesterday morning, but a problem
with the door covering the landing gear was  discovered as passengers were
boarding.  Repairs were performed by technicians throughout the afternoon.
Immediately prior to  takeoff last night, a minor engine problem was also
detected and fixed.

The departure was cleared by the security cabinet yesterday morning.  In a
special session held at Prime Minister Yitzhak  Rabin's office in Jerusalem, a
unanimous decision was reached to release the jet, the passengers and the
cargo.  The cabinet also  issued a general condemnation of air piracy and
hijacking, and said the release of the plane demonstrated Israel's compliance
with  international treaties "despite the Iranian regime's hostility toward
Israel". Earlier in the day, Batya Arad, the mother of missing navigator Ron
Arad, and his brother Dudu, arrived in Uvda and met with  the passengers.

Arad handed the passengers brochures describing her son's nine-year ordeal and
the efforts to determine his whereabouts, as  well as Iran's complicity in his
fate.

"I speak to you as a mother to mothers.  Please do not be ashamed or scared to
relay my request to your government," Batya  Arad told Iranian women, with the
help of an interpreter.

Arad and her son later covered the jet's doors and parts of the fuselage with
blue "Free Ron Arad" stickers.  A large banner  bearing the "Free Ron Arad"
slogan was also hung between two mobile escalators leading to the plane's
door.

Iran yesterday denounced Israel's interrogation of the passengers as a
conspiracy against the Islamic republic, Reuters  reported.

Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, interrupted by chants of "Death to
Israel," told parliament that it was a disgrace  that Israel was using the
passengers to seek information on Arad.

        RALLIES HELD IN LONDON, TEL AVIV SHOW SUPPORT FOR RON ARAD



RALLIES for the release of missing IAF navigator Ron Arad were held
simultaneously in London and Tel Aviv yesterday, nine  years to the day after
he was shot down over Lebanon.

Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, Arad's mother, brother, uncle, and dozens of
members of the Israel Association for Ron Arad  participated in the Tel Aviv
rally.

Sarid said that over the past nine years, Arad has become not only the son of
one particular family, but the son of every  family in the country, and that
the battle for his freedom is the battle of the entire nation.

"Faith and hope, that is our message," he said.  "Ron Arad will return to us
one day".

The London rally, opposite the Iranian Embassy in Hyde Park, was attended by
MPs, public figures, and hundreds of people.   Chen Arad delivered a message
to the embassy, asking that Iran work for his brother's release.

MP John Marshall told the rally that "what has happened to Ron Arad is an
international scandal". The ambassador asked the London police not to allow
the rally, but his request was rejected.

Giant screens in London and Tel Aviv enabled participants in each rally to see
and hear what was going on at the other.

        RABIN PRAISES UN FOR SUPPORTING 'HISTORIC TURNING POINT'



PRIME Minister Yitzhak Rabin was the 22nd speaker to step up to the podium at
the United Nations yesterday, and he was a man  of many voices.

"I appear before you as the prime minister of the State of Israel, and as the
representative of the entire Jewish people," he  told the hushed heads of
state gathered in the hall of the General Assembly.

"I stand before you as a representative of those for whom the creation of the
United Nations came too late.  I come here  today in the name of the six
million Jews whose lives were turned into ashes," he said.  "We will never let
them be forgotten". Saying he was bringing a dream "from Jerusalem, the
eternal capital of the State of Israel and heart of the Jewish people,"  Rabin
asked the UN to fulfill the words of Isaiah: "Neither shall they learn war any
more". In a speech on the closing day of the commemorations of its 50th
anniversary, Rabin said the UN hall had witnessed hurtful  and unjust
decisions and "absurd" resolutions against Israel.  But, he said, "just as we
came to you to protest, we now come to  praise". He paid tribute to the
organization that 48 years ago gave Israel the opportunity for independence,
and he thanked the  international community for its encouragement "at the
historic turning point which is unfolding on our little plot of land," the
agreements with the Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt.

The prime minister offered special congratulations to PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat, who was seated in the assembly, "for being  partners with us in this
achievement". While he reminded the United Nations that the road to peace is
long, he said that Israel is determined to continue on its  course until there
is peace in the entire region.

Saying terror is "the world's cancer," Rabin called on all nations to fight
terror.  "This is a fight we cannot afford to  lose". And he called for
compassion.  One day after Rabin asked Argentine President Carlos Menem to use
his influence with Syria to  determine the fate of missing navigator Ron Arad,
he asked the UN for assistance in finding the missing in action and in
returning  prisoners of war.

Rabin was scheduled to receive the "Intrepid Freedom Award" at a gala last
night aboard the onetime US aircraft carrier  Intrepid, now a museum docked on
the Hudson River.  The award, in recognition of an individual's defense of
freedom and democracy,  was previously given to US presidents Ronald Reagan
and George Bush, Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister of Britain, and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

        MAJOR OFFERS TO HELP FIND RON ARAD


BRITISH Prime Minister John Major yesterday offered to help in
the search for Ron Arad, missing since October 1986.

The offer came during a visit to his London residence by Arad's
wife Tami, and his brother Chen, which was arranged by the head of the
Free Ron Arad Campaign, Ilan Hachami.

Major told the Arad family he did not believe that Britain alone
could take effective action and suggested a British-initiated
multi-national approach through the European Community.

He agreed to approach EC member states to undertake joint action
in an attempt to locate Arad and secure his release.

        KHAZAKH PRESIDENT ARRIVES FOR STATE VISIT



NURSULTAN Nazaerbayev, president of the predominantly Moslem republic of
Khazakhstan, began a two-day state visit here  yesterday, expressing the hope
that his country's economic ties with Israel would be further strengthened.

During a meeting at the Knesset with speaker Shevah Weiss, he said his country
would be opening an embassy here shortly.  He  is expected to announce this
today.

At a brief meeting last night with Foreign Minister Ehud Barak, Nazaerbayev
promised to make inquiries with Teheran as to the  fate of missing navigator
Ron Arad.  The Khazakh president said that though his country maintains
excellent ties with Iran, it  posed no conflict with its ties to Western
countries, including Israel.

Accompanied by a 110-member delegation - including his foreign minister and
four other cabinet ministers, senior government  officials and economic
experts - Nazaerbayev was welcomed here in the morning by President Ezer
Weizman and cabinet members at a  ceremony at Beit Hanassi.

"I am optimistic that we shall succeed in furthering the good economic ties
between us," Nazaerbayev said.

The ceremony was momentarily disrupted when two soldiers standing to attention
in the honor guard fainted.  They were treated  on the spot.  The two were
said to have been suffering from flu, which was exacerbated by the long wait
in the sun.

During the visit, an accord ensuring that economic agreements will be carried
out is due to be signed.  This follows  misunderstandings between Israeli
investors, notably Shoul Eisenberg, and the Khazakhstan authorities, Israel
Radio reported.

After laying a wreath at prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's grave on Mt. Herzl,
Nazaerbayev toured Yad Vashem, where he wrote in  the guest book: "The
Fascists and those who hate human beings reject the right to live granted to
man by God.  Mankind has to be  on its guard to prevent racism and fascism".
Last night, Weizman and his wife, Reuma, hosted a state dinner in honor of the
guests.

Lebanon.  Hassan Nasrallah.  Ron Arad.

        ISRAEL: 'NO' TO NASRALLAH'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE IDF BODIES FOR
PRISONERS



ISRAEL has rejected Hizbullah's latest offer to return the bodies of missing
soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh as well  as 19 South Lebanese Army
soldiers, in return for the release of all Lebanese prisoners held in Israel
and the El-Khiam jail in  the security zone.

Defense Ministry officials said on Friday that the offer made publicly by
Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah contained  nothing new.

"There is nothing to talk about with them until we know where Ron Arad is,"
Deputy Defense Minister Ori Orr told Channel 2.   "Ron Arad will be part of a
comprehensive deal.  The Fink and Alsheikh families are aware of the
situation".

Furthermore, the move was seen as part of the psychological war by Hizbullah
and the Lebanese authorities against the SLA and  its commander Gen. Antoine
Lahad.

Nasrallah, in his press conference on Friday, reiterated the organization's
claim that it knows nothing of Arad's  whereabouts.  He maintained that if
Hizbullah did have information regarding Arad it would make use of this to try
for an  exchange.

What the Hizbullah chief did offer was the same as in the past - a deal to
return the bodies of Fink and Alsheikh in exchange  for Sheikh Abdel Karim
Obeid and Mustafa Dirani.

Nasrallah also offered to release 19 SLA soldiers being held prisoner by
Hizbullah as well as the bodies of other SLA  soldiers in return for the
freeing of all Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in the El-Khiam jail
inside the zone.

Officials in Israel said that if Nasrallah was really serious about an
exchange he would have made overtures via secret  diplomatic channels and not
publicly.

Some sources said it appeared Hizbullah was coming under pressure to resolve
the prisoners and MIA issue and was trying to  put responsibility on Israel
and the SLA.

        ISRAEL, OMAN TO POST TRADE DELEGATIONS



OMAN will open a trade delegation in Ramat Gan in the next several weeks,
Israeli officials said at the end of Prime Minister  Shimon Peres's visit to
that state.

Israeli diplomat Oded Ben-Haim, who works in the Foreign Ministry's economic
division, will be posted to head Israel's trade  office in the Omani capital
of Muscat in the next few weeks, the officials also said.  They added that
Israel's trade delegation  will operate as a de facto diplomatic mission.

Speaking to reporters on the plane from Oman to Qatar, Peres said he raised
the fate of downed navigator Ron Arad with Omani  Sultan Qaboos Bin Said
al-Said at a dinner that the Omanis held Monday night.  Though he said he was
hesitant to discuss any Iran- related matters due to Omani sensitivities,
Peres said he decided to raise the issue given the good ties that exist
between Oman  and Iran.

Oppressed on Earth.  Lebanon.  IDF.  Grapes of Wrath.

        HIZBULLAH: RON ARAD SHOULD BE TRADED FOR ARAB PRISONERS



BEIRUT - An anonymous telephone caller claimed on Friday that the Organization
of the Oppressed on Earth would kill Ron Arad  within 48 hours in order to
avenge the deaths of Lebanese civilians killed by IDF shellfire on Thursday.

"We will execute Ron Arad in 48 hours to avenge the Zionist enemy's barbaric
atrocities.  We will film the execution and  distribute videotapes to the
media," the caller told the Agence France-Presse office in Beirut.

AFP said the caller spoke in Arabic and hung up after reading the terse
statement.  There was no way to authenticate the  call.

Hizbullah expressed doubt about the existence of the Oppressed on Earth group.

"If such a group exists and if it really holds Ron Arad, we think he should be
traded for Arab prisoners held by Israel, not  killed," a Hizbullah official
said.

It was the first time the group had claimed it was holding Arad - who has been
missing since since his F-4 Phantom fighter- bomber was shot down in south
Lebanon in 1986 - and the first time the group has been heard from since 1991.
In 1989, the Shi'ite  Moslem extremist faction kidnapped and killed US Marine
Lt.  -Col.  William Higgins.

Western intelligence reports have linked the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth to Hizbullah, which constantly has denied  it has any information on
Arad's whereabouts.

Israeli officials have said Arad is the only one of six servicemen missing in
Lebanon who is still alive.  They repeatedly  have claimed that Iran holds
him.

Prime Minister Shimon Peres declined to comment on the threat, saying "any
talk will serve no purpose.  It will only cause  difficulty". But Health
Minister Ephraim Sneh, in a counter-threat apparently directed at Iran, said
"whoever is threatening will be held  responsible for the consequences". The
IDF Spokesman also issued a statement on Friday saying, "Senior security
sources emphasize that Iran is responsible for  [the] welfare, health, and
safe return of Ron Arad". In another development, a caller claiming to speak
for a hitherto unheard of group, the Jabal Amel Mujahedeen (holy  warriors),
demanded in a call to a Beirut radio station and the Kuwait News Agency
offices in Beirut that British and US nationals  leave Lebanon by 9 a.m.
yesterday.  The caller said the order was made at the behest of Hizbullah
chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.

But a Hizbullah official emphatically denied his group was behind the call.
He accused Israel of spreading rumors, saying  the alleged ultimatum was
invented to scare off Western reporters covering the Israeli operation in
Lebanon.

        NETANYAHU, CLINTON WILL DISCUSS ARAD



PRIME Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said yesterday  that the effort to release
captured navigator Ron Arad  will continue and the subject will be raised in
his  forthcoming talks with US President Bill Clinton. He was  speaking after
meeting with members of the Arad family.

Netanyahu also met yesterday with MKs from the  Democratic Arab Party who told
him they were pleased to  hear that he planned to continue the peace process.
"There are differences of opinion about how to achieve  peace, but we shall
open up channels and speak and see  how these can be resolved," Netanyahu told
the Mks.

        US SENATORS DISCUSS ISRAELI MIAS WITH SYRIANS


BEIRUT - Members of the US Senate's intelligence subcommittee
visited Syria to learn the fate of six Israeli servicemen missing in
Lebanon, and had contacts with radical Palestinians and Iranian-backed
Moslem militants, informed sources said yesterday.

The sources, close to Hizbullah, said the five-man US delegation
was headed by Sen. Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, and
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.

According to government officials in Jerusalem, the delegation's
visit is not the result of the recent meeting between US Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and Syrian President Hafez Assad.  The trip
was planned far in advance and is not directly connected to the MiAs,
they said.

Syrian officials said in Damascus that the US delegation met
Assad during the unpublicized three-day visit.  But they declined
comment on the reported meetings with radical factions.

The Lebanese sources did not specify which radicals the Americans
reportedly met during their low-profile trip, which coincided with
visits to Damascus by senior Iranians and their Lebanese allies.

Beirut newspapers reported yesterday that the Americans were
believed to have met with officials of the Teheran-backed Hizbullah.

The Lebanese sources said the Americans' meetings were arranged
by the Syrians, adding the meeting with the unidentified Palestinian
radicals took place in the presence of Syrian officials at the
congressional team's request.

The US delegation left Damascus Friday and flew to Jerusalem.

Israel Radio yesterday quoted DeConcini and Specter as saying
that Assad had assured the US delegation full Syrian cooperation in
determining the fate of the missing Israelis and was ready to press
forward with the peace talks.

Hizbullah holds two of the missing Israelis, Yossi Fink and
Rahamim Alsheikh.  They were captured in a guerrilla ambush in south
Lebanon on February 17, 1986.

Hizbullah has never made any public statement about their
condition.  But Israeli officials say they have evidence that the men
are dead.

Of the other four MiAs, Israel is reasonably sure that air force
navigator Ron Arad is still alive.  He was captured after his F-4
Phantom fighter-bomber was shot down during a raid on Sidon on October
16, 1986.

The other three remain unaccounted for.  Sgt.  Zachary Baumel,
Sgt.  Zvi Feldman and Cpl.  Yehuda Katz went missing in a tank battle
with the Syrians at Sultan Yacoub in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley on June
11, 1982, five days after Israel invaded Lebanon.

Sarah Honig adds

The US should tell Assad that his "demand for an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan is unrealistic," Likud leader Binyamin
Netanyahu told the visiting members of the US Senate's intelligence
subcommittee at the end of the week upon their arrival in Israel.

Netanyahu argued that the American contribution would be to "make
it clear to Assad that his precondition of an Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan is unrealistic, since Israel's citizens would never agree to
cede the Golan."

        CHRISTOPHER MEETS WITH MIA FAMILIES


THE US Congressional mission that will investigate the fate of
the six missing Israeli soldiers will leave for Damascus within the
next few weeks, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the
families of four of the MiAs at a meeting in Jerusalem yesterday.

Christopher met with the parents of Yehuda Katz, Zvi Feldman and
Zecharia Baumel, missing since the battle of Sultan Yacoub in 1982,
and separately with Tami Arad, wife of navigator Ron Arad, the IDF
navigator shot down over Lebanon six years ago.  He did not meet with
the families of Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, whom Arab sources
have said are dead.

"The secretary said he had no new information, but that the
Syrian government has offered to facilitate the investigations of the
congressional team," Yona Baumel, Zacharia's father, told a press
conference after the meeting.  "He did not give us the date when the
team would leave, but we expect it will be after the New Year
holidays, Christopher came across as a very warm and humane person."

Baumel said that it was understood the Syrians would provide
logistical assistance to the team and help it make contact with those
who may be holding the MiAs.

"This is more than a sign.  It is the first time since June 11,
1982, that a diplomat has brought us good news," said Yossi Katz,
Yehuda's father.  "We have waited so long, and I believe the mystery
will now be solved." He said the families had the sense that the
solution would be "positive."

Tami Arad refused to meet the media, saying that "the secretary
of state will speak for me."

Zvi Feldman's mother Pnina asked Christopher to take a letter to
Syrian President Hafez Assad on his return to Damascus.

"My motherly instincts tell me that my son is alive, and I
believe that the only one who can help me now is you, Mr. President,"
she wrote.  "I cannot even start describing to you the agony during
these years, day by day  ... We are ready to travel anywhere in the
world for a piece of information."

Miriam Baumel told The Jerusalem Post that "we have had to learn
to speak unemotionally in public.  Since I couldn't cry over all the
years that my son has been missing, when Zac is in my arms, am I going
to flood him!"

She took to task those persons who are "adamant against contacts
with the PLO," saying: "If they were in our position, I'm sure they'd
think differently.  We must not concern ourselves with political
matters, but with the redemption of the prisoners."

Meanwhile, a massive poster campaign has been mounted throughout
the Tel Aviv area by the International Association for Missing Israeli
Soldiers and the National Union of Israeli Students.  "In the spirit
of peace, release our boys," say the posters which show the eyes of
the six missing soldiers.

Ads have also been placed in the local press and posters have
been sent to embassies and Jewish institutions in Europe and North
America.

        RABIN: RETURN OF BAUMEL'S IDENTITY TAG IS IMPORTANT


THE handing over by the PLO of the IDF identification tag of
missing Israeli soldier Zacharia Baumel is "a first significant step,"
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said yesterday in Brussels.

"It is concrete evidence that there is a way to uncover further
information about [MiAs] Zacharia Baumel, Yehuda Katz and Zvi
Feldman," Rabin said.

"I regard this as the first part of a process of reaching clear
clarification about the future of the three soldiers," who were
captured in Lebanon in June 1982.

Baumel's tag was brought to Rabin from Tunisia by his special
envoy, Jacques Neriah, and was due to be brought here late last night.
The three men have not been heard from since their disappearance
during the battle for Sultan Yacoub.

The tag was received broken down the center, which, by IDF
convention, indicates the soldier was killed.  The tag, however, could
have been broken as a ploy by Baumel's captors or by the PLO.

Interviewed on the Mabat news broadcast last night, Yona Baumel,
Zacharia's father, demanded the PLO return the second half of the ID
tag.

He claimed that in 1984, the PLO had produced a wax copy of the
whole tag, proving that the tag, in its entirety, had been in PLO
hands.  The half-disk being handed over now was meant to mislead, he
said.

On Monday, Rabin said he would link any release of Palestinian
security prisoners to receipt of information on the MiA's.

Of the three other missing soldiers, navigator Ron Arad, shot
down in October 1986, is believed to be alive and in Iranian hands,
while Yosef Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh, captured in February 1986,
reportedly died, though their bodies were never recovered.

Rabin telephoned Baumel's father, Yona, to inform him that the
tag was being forwarded.

"We're more optimistic now than we've been in the past," Baumel
told The Jerusalem Post last night.

"The fact that Zacharia's tag will reach us only today is not
important.  We're not sentimental about things like that.  It's not a
holy relic.  It's as good in the prime minister's hands as in ours."

Dr. Ahmed Tibi, a top adviser to Yasser Arafat, said the PLO head
had received a request from Rabin for the tag during their meeting in
Cairo.

"The chairman [Arafat] regards this as a humanitarian act of the
first order and we are doing everything possible to help with this
painful problem," Tibi told Israel Radio.

Baumel, who on Tuesday held a press conference to call for
confidence-building measures from the PLO, said:"This is an
encouraging first step on the part of the PLO.  They must understand
that if they continue in this vein, they'll be doing more justice to
their Palestinian brethren because there are many more of them waiting
to return to their loved ones."

A high-ranking source in a Moslem extremist organization in
Lebanon said yesterday that Ron Arad is alive and held by the Iranian
or Syrian Intelligence services.  In an interview with the French News
Agency in Lebanon the source said that the solution to the issue will
be found only through close coordination between Syria and Iran.

        BREAKTHROUGH SAID IMMINENT ON RON ARAD


BEIRUT - A breakthrough is imminent in secret talks focusing on
missing air force navigator Ron Arad, a senior pro-Iranian source said
yesterday.

"Secret talks regarding the issue of Arad and Arab prisoners are
currently underway between more than three parties," the source said.
"I expect a breakthrough in the issue of Arad soon."

The source declined to name the parties involved in the talks or
the location but other sources said such talks would definitely
include Hizbullah, Iran, Syria and possibly the US.

Senior pro-Iranian sources in Lebanon said in the past Arad,
whose plane was shot down over south Lebanon in 1986, was in Syrian
hands.

Hizbullah has repeatedly offered to exchange the remains of two
IDF soldiers for about 250 Lebanese held by Israel and the South
Lebanon Army.

The captives Israel holds include Hizbullah cleric Sheikh
Abdul-Karim Obeid, kidnapped in south Lebanon in 1989.

        FAMILIES: RELEASE OF ARAB PRISONERS SHOULD BE CONDITIONAL ON
RETURN OF MIAS


FAMILIES of missing IDF soldiers last night called on the
government to refrain from releasing any Arab prisoners until their
sons are returned, or information on the whereabouts of their remains
is released.

"We have reached a moment of truth," Yona Baumel, the father of
missing soldier Zecharia Baumel, told reporters.

"If the Israeli government allows the release of thousands of
prisoners, we will have missed our only opportunity.  We want
Palestinian families along with our families to pressure their leaders
to release the information about our sons.  We want them to know that
it is not out of cruelty that we ask that the prisoners are kept in
prison, but the need to know what happened to our sons."

Dogtags with the names of their missing family members hung from
the necks of those gathered at the evening tribute ceremony dedicated
to the six Israeli MiAs. A tag even dangled from the neck of newborn
baby Noam Yosef Haddad, named after his uncle, MiA Yosef Fink.

The event was sponsored by the International Association for
Missing Israeli Soldiers and the National Union of Israeli Students.

Egyptian ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny attended the tribute and
was photographed next to a picture of missing navigator Ron Arad,
although he did not address the audience, and refused to answer
reporter's questions.

Bassiouny caused a stir last week and was criticized by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin when he said publicly that he knew that Arad
was still alive.

Joel Leyden, a spokesman for the Association, beseeched reporters
not to pester Bassiouny with questions, saying that "his presence at
this event speaks for itself."

President Ezer Weizman sent a message of support to the event's
organizers and said he and the rest of the country "share the dreadful
grief" of the families of Arad, Baumel, Fink, Yehuda Katz, Zvi
Feldman, and Rahamim Alsheikh, all of whom were captured or kidnapped
on Lebanese territory.

Baumel, Katz, and Feldman have been missing since they
disappeared in the battle of Sultan Yakoub in June of 1982, while
Fink, Levi and Arad were each seized in 1986.

Yona Baumel told The Jerusalem Post that the families are
convinced that the PLO is holding "historical information" that could
help them trace their son's whereabouts, and that they are pressing
the government to obtain that information.

He also wants the government to investigate the claim by a
Jordanian journalist that his son and his colleagues are being held by
a Palestinian group, not by Iranian-backed forces, as well as
statements by PLO members claiming that they possess a map detailing
where the bodies of the missing Sultan Yacoub soldiers are buried.

Malchia Heiman, Katz's sister, said she did not understand how
the peace process could move forward until the demands of the MiAs'
familes were met.

"You can't get to peace until the war is over," she said.

        'ARAD IN LEBANON'


RON Arad is alive and in Lebanon, according to Egyptian
Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny.

Bassiouny, interviewed on Channel One, said he does not know
where Arad is being held or by whom.  He said his government had been
asked to help bring about Arad's release and is trying its best to
bring him home.

Asked if he is certain Arad is in Lebanon and not somewhere else,
Bassiouny said he knows he is alive.  "I am the Egyptian ambassador,
not the Lebanese ambassador," he said.

        TAMI ARAD PURSUING SECRET EUROPEAN LEADS


TAMI Arad is somewhere in Europe today, presumably pursuing new
leads that will help secure the release of her husband, IAF Captain
Ron Arad, missing since 1986 and believed held in Lebanon by
Iranian-controlled forces.

She said yesterday in New York that she could not divulge the
European country she was headed to last night, nor the people she
would meet with today. She will return to Israel tomorrow night.

Asked whether her European visit would involve Syrian
connections, Tami said she has no contact with Syrians, but that her
husband's case is on the agenda under discussion by the Israeli and
Syrian delegations in Washington.

Referring to the PLO announcement in Cairo two weeks ago that her
husband is alive, she said, "Now that we know for sure he is alive, we
have to work very fast.  I don't know what condition he is in.  We
don't have a lot of time."

Tami wrapped up a week-long visit to Canada and the US yesterday,
where she met with government officials and school groups to press for
aid in securing her husband's release.

Monday she canceled a meeting with UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to honor a last-minute invitation to meet with Vice
President Al Gore.

Asked why she chose Gore over the secretary-general, Tami said
she had always wanted to meet the vice president, and was convinced
that he would help her.

She had hoped to meet with President Bill Clinton, but said she
"understands that is not so easy." She also met yesterday with
Cardinal John O'Connor, head of the Catholic Church in America.  He
promised to intercede with his contacts in Lebanon and Syria, and said
he would write to Syrian President Assad.

        DOUBTS SURROUND PLO OFFICIAL'S REPORT THAT RON ARAD IS IN SYRIA


THE security establishment is checking the credibility of a
report that missing IAF navigator Ron Arad is alive and being held in
Syria, and that Zacharia Baumel, Yehuda Katz, and Zvi Feldman, the
three soldiers captured during the Sultan Yakoub battle, are dead and
were buried in a Jewish cemetery in Damascus.

This information was conveyed to members of the Israeli
delegation to the Taba talks by Col.  Nazar Amar, a leading Fatah
intelligence official, over lunch on Tuesday.

A high-ranking IDF officer yesterday said there is a great deal
of doubt the report is accurate, and chances are that it is mistaken.
Nonetheless, he said, the report is being taken seriously.

The security establishment refused to respond officially to
Amar's remarks.

The IDF officer said that when Amar was told Israel had
information that Arad was in Iranian hands, he said that was
inaccurate because the Syrians would never agree to hand an Israeli
prisoner over to the Iranians.

Yona Baumel, Zacharia's father, yesterday told Israel Radio that
information from sources in Syria and Lebanon indicates that at least
two of the three Sultan Yakoub prisoners are still alive.

Chen Arad told Army Radio that, to the best of his knowledge,
there are no contacts between Israel and Syria over the fate of his
brother.

He said that he "is happy that there are also people on the
Palestinian side who realize the importance of the subject, and the
relation between my brother and the release of Palestinian prisoners."

But Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told ITV's Mabat news that he
"is not aware of a single important diplomatic meeting in which the
prime minister or I was involved at which the subject of Ron Arad and
the other missing was not raised."

        IRAN TESTS MISSILE CAPABLE OF HITTING ISRAEL


IRAN yesterday confirmed it conducted a week-long missile
maneuver in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz amid growing
anxiety among Western officials over the increasingly close ties
between Bonn and Teheran.

The announcement by the state-run Iranian News Agency (Irna) that
the missile maneuvers had occurred followed a report in the
influential Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat that Iran and North Korea were
planning to test-fire a missile capable of hitting Israel.

The report, quoting unnamed sources in Teheran, was denied by
Iran, but the Associated Press reported Western sources saying that
North Korea first test-fired the missile - a "stretch" version of the
old Soviet Scud - over the Sea of Japan last June.

Irna said last week's missile maneuvers, code-named Saeqe-3
(Thunderbolt), were conducted under the supervision of missile command
headquarters with forces of the coastal missile brigades and the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards.

The forces carried out commando exercises and repulsed mock land
and air chemical attacks, said Irna, while subsequent maneuvers will
involve electronic warfare and defense.

In London, a senior Western diplomatic source expressed outrage
at German government claims that its ongoing dialogue with the head of
Iranian intelligence is based on "humanitarian issues," particularly
the case of missing Israeli airman Ron Arad.

Officials in Bonn have suggested that a central feature of the
talks has been the case of Arad, who was captured after bailing out of
his stricken plane over South Lebanon on October 16, 1986, and is now
believed to be held in Iran.

However, the diplomatic source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Jerusalem Post that Bonn was cynically using the
Arad issue as a cover for its real agenda, which includes burgeoning
high-tech trade and intelligence coordination.

This view was reinforced by the news magazine Der Spiegel, which
quoted German intelligence sources as saying that Bonn's claim to be
pursuing "humanitarian issues" was "an outright lie."

According to Der Spiegel, the German intelligence service has
sold high-tech equipment, including powerful computers, to Iran and it
has provided a two-month training course for Iranian intelligence
agents over the past two years.

German exports to Iran last year totaled $5 billion, compared to
$3 billion from Japan and $1 billion each from Britain and Italy.  The
United States was the sixth-largest exporter to Iran, having sold
$746.6 million worth of goods.

Officials in Europe and Washington note that German companies
were the most important suppliers of components for Iraq's
non-conventional weapons program, and there is widespread concern that
its exports to Iran involve dual-use equipment that is destined for
the development of Iran's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.

        COMRADES-IN-ARMS HOLD VIGIL FOR MIA'S


SILENTLY holding banners reading "Bring our friends back," some
40 comrades of the three soldiers missing in action since the Lebanon
War battle of Sultan Yakoub in 1982 gathered outside the Prime
Minister's Office yesterday as the cabinet was meeting inside.

"It's not a protest, and certainly not a demonstration," said Avi
Rath, one of the organizers.  "It's a vigil - an apolitical gathering
by their friends and comrades who haven't forgotten them.

"Over the years, we have moved on and built our lives, gotten
married and had children, but they have remained in the same place,"
he said.

Although the tank battalion in which Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman,
and Yehuda Katz served has since been disbanded, their comrades remain
in touch with their families and push for information on their fate.

"All this time, we have been told there is no information because
we don't have relations with the Arab countries.  Now we have
relations with the PLO, so why wasn't information on the MIAs made a
precondition before [Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin flew off to shake
hands with [PLO chairman Yasser] Arafat?" said Rath.

The vigil was hastily planned over the weekend after news broke
about today's planned release of Palestinian prisoners.

Apart from the right of the families to know what happened to
their sons, all soldiers need to know that the country is behind them,
Rath said.  "We were raised on the belief that you didn't leave a
soldier on the battlefield.  But what has happened during these 11
years?  It's bad for morale."

Although the vigil was arranged by the comrades-in-arms of the
missing tankers, the placards also mentioned IAF navigator Ron Arad.

Meanwhile, the Hadassah World Organization yesterday released a
seven-minute video cassette containing a plea for information for the
families of all the missing.  The video is aimed at raising awareness
about the subject, particularly in the US.

"What do you mothers feel like when your child suddenly
disappears for an hour or two or half a day?  My son didn't go missing
for hours.  He has been missing from his home for years, and I don't
know anything at all about his fate," says the mother of Zvi Feldman
on the video.

The video was made by the studios at Hadassah Technological
College and is being distributed to hundreds of thousands of Hadassah
members in the US.

At the request of the Baumel family, the video will also be
distributed to other Jewish organizations abroad, including student
groups.

        RABIN CONFIRMS MASS RELEASE OF PRISONERS IS PART OF DEAL


A LARGE number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees will be
released as part of the negotiations with the PLO, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin told reporters last night after addressing Israeli Arabs
in Nazareth.

At a earlier airport press conference upon his return from a tour
of China, Indonesia, Singapore, and Kenya, Rabin linked such a
prisoner release with the release of missing IAF navigator Ron Arad
and definitive information about three other soldiers missing since
the Lebanon War in 1982.

Last night, Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin confirmed that
it was decided last week to allow 5,000 Palestinians a year to enter
the territories as part of a family reunification program.  "This
decision ... was just taken," he said.

Beilin noted that the decision should not be confused with the
entry of Palestinians displaced by the Six Day War which, as the
agreement with the PLO stipulates, will be subject to negotiation.

"The general direction is to release detainees and prisoners,"
Rabin said in Nazareth.  "We have to discuss criteria and phases.  We
are not talking about one here and one there.  Rather, we are talking
about large numbers.  All this has to occur as part of the
negotiations to implement Gaza/Jericho First."

This was Rabin's most explicit statement to date on a planned
prisoner release.  In the talks in both Taba and Cairo last week, PLO
officials called for the release of an estimated 11,000 prisoners.  At
Taba, it was agreed that a subcommittee on security would be formed,
which would include the release of prisoners on its agenda.

Last week, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said that many prisoners
should be released, since Israel and the PLO are entering a new era.

A few weeks ago, officials had said that Israel would seek to
move those Palestinians who are being held for murdering Israelis to
different prisons.  However, after meeting with Rabin in Cairo earlier
this month, PLO leader Yasser Arafat said he obtained an agreement not
to move any prisoners during the negotiations.

The General Security Service and police said they have
categorized the prisoners according to the type of crimes they
committed and how much of their sentence they have already served.
Last week, Palestinian prisoners launched sporadic hunger strikes to
publicize their case.

Organizers of the PLO police force recruitment office in eastern
Jerusalem have made it clear they would view time served in Israeli
prisons as an advantage when considering whom to hire.  They have
indicated that a record would make a policeman more respected, as well
as demonstrating proven discipline.  The recruiters ask all candidates
to list any time spent in Israeli jails and if they served on a
"prisoner committee."

In a related development, Rabin indirectly rebuked Beilin last
night for publicly admitting to exchanging informal views on the final
status of the territories during his meeting with Arafat in Tunis last
week.

Rabin termed any discussion of final status a "grave mistake,"
since the interim period is a "test for the future." Deputy Defense
Minister Motta Gur, the government's liaison with the settlers, last
week charged that Beilin's remarks undercut his effort to assure
settlers that no boundaries have been drawn.

Beilin told The Jerusalem Post that he called on Arafat to stop
talking about an independent Palestinian state and talk about a
PLO-Jordanian entity instead.  He recalled telling Arafat that the
Labor Party had passed a resolution in 1991 committing itself to a
Palestinian-Jordanian entity.

"I told Arafat that talk about an independent state creates
antagonism in Israel," Beilin said.  "Since the PLO is committed to a
confederation with Jordan, it should speak accordingly.  By doing so,
it would get the public here to begin interpreting and defining
'confederation.'

"While Arafat said he agreed with me, he did not commit himself
to refrain from using the term 'independent state' because King
Hussein's position remains unclear."

Meanwhile, in his report to the cabinet yesterday about talks
with PLO officials in Cairo last week, Peres said that Israel-PLO
economic talks will be launched in Paris early next month.  Officials
in the Prime Minister's Office said the leading candidate to head the
Israeli delegation is Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, and there is
speculation that the Palestinian head will be Ahmed Koreih (Abu Ala),
the PLO's leading financial official.

Officials in the Prime Minister's Office also cited Peres as
saying the PLO is proposing an end to the secondary Arab boycott in
exchange for a commitment not to restrict Palestinian exports from the
territories into Israel.

There has been concern among Israeli farmers that Palestinian
agricultural exports could undermine the price of local produce.

          Autonomy.  Time.

        UNSEEMLY HURRY


FOREIGN MINSTER Shimon Peres yesterday promised full speed ahead
in meeting the timetable laid down in the Israel-PLO Declaration of
Principles.  Asked if the deadlines for the withdrawal from Gaza and
Jericho were workable - starting it by December 13, and completing it
by April 13 - Peres said: "Yes, we should make supreme efforts to meet
the times and, if possible, we shall try to do it earlier." The
government's enthusiasm to commit itself to such tight time
constraints is both puzzling and worrying.

The issues facing the negotiators in Taba and Cairo are not
problems which can be solved on the spur of the moment.  And, as Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin pointed out when he signed the declaration of
principles, even most of the details already agreed upon are vague in
the extreme.

Despite Rabin and Peres' strenuous denials, many people have no
doubt that the end result of these talks will be the establishment of
a Palestinian state in the territories.  Meretz MK Avraham Poraz even
called on the government yesterday to start planning compensation for
Jewish residents of the territories who will not wish to live under
the rule of PLO leader Yasser Arafat.  With the stakes so high, it
would be comforting to know that Israel's negotiators are keeping
their eyes on the agreement and not on the clock.

Aside from such minor technicalities as whether the Jericho area
from which the IDF will withdraw is to be 345 square kilometers as the
Palestinians demand, or 25 square kilometers as Israel has proposed,
government negotiators are also facing strong demands to free 10,000
Palestinians prisoners as a "goodwill gesture" to help get the talks
rolling.

Throughout all the negotiating process the government, and
particularly Shimon Peres, has insisted that since Israel holds all
the cards, it has to be the side to give, without receiving even the
merest hint of reciprocity from the Palestinians and the Arab states.
Despite Israel's recognition of the PLO with all that that implies,
the Arab boycott, for example, is still firmly in place.

If Israel is to make speedy gestures, then so should the other
side.  As MK Aryeh Deri insisted yesterday, there is no better place
to start than for the PLO to use its good offices to secure the
equally speedy release of missing IAF navigator Ron Arad and relay
news of the other Israeli soldiers missing in action since the Lebanon
War.  There is no logical reason for Israel alone to set the pace and
make all the running.

        RON ARAD LETTER CIRCULATING IN CONGRESS


A letter on behalf of Ron Arad and the three other missing
Israeli servicemen is currently circulating in the US Congress.  The
letter is sponsored by Congressman Gary Ackerman (D-NY), a senior
member of the House Foreign Affairs committee and chair of the
subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.

According to a staffer in Ackerman's office, the letter already
has more than 100 congressional signatures, but will continue to be
circulated until the end of next week in hopes of gathering another
100 names.  It will then be delivered to President Clinton and
Secretary of State Christopher.

        FORMER US HOSTAGE SPEAKS OUT FOR ARAD


NEW YORK - Former AP correspondent Terry Anderson, America's
longest-held hostage in Lebanon, spoke out for the release of Ron Arad
and other missing Israeli servicemen yesterday in New York in front of
the US Mission to the UN.

The news conference, organized by Rabbi Avi Weiss and the
Coalition for Jewish Concerns, was timed to coincide with the UN World
Conference on Human Rights being held this week in Vienna.

Anderson, who was freed in December 1991 after six-and-a-half
years in captivity, feels that the US government could press harder
for information on the missing servicemen.  Now that all American
hostages in Lebanon are free, it is "obvious and understandable," he
said, that Americans have lost interest in the remaining captives.

Weiss noted that Anderson himself was freed after Israel released
hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.  In return, Weiss said, the US has
a "moral obligation" to help secure the release of Israeli MiAs, or
obtain information as to their fate.

UN efforts to obtain information on the Israeli MiAs have so far
failed, and Anderson said that he has been unable to find out anything
through his various sources.

Iran's UN ambassador told him Iran has no information either, but
is "trying."

Anderson noted, however, that Iran's control over the
fundamentalists in Lebanon is "less than perfect," and the Hizbullah
itself is engaged in constant power struggles and fluidity.  The men
guarding his cell in Lebanon changed faces often, and although they
denied they were holding Ron Arad, they also denied holding American
hostage Frank Reed, "and he was chained up next to me," Anderson
remarked.

American Jewish leaders have launched a major public campaign to
press for the release of the four Israeli soldiers missing in action
in Lebanon.

The newly formed National Committee for Israeli MiAs, convened by
the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations,
plans an array of public activities and private initiatives on behalf
of the missing servicemen.

        FRANCE TO CONTINUE EFFORTS FOR MIAS


France will continue its efforts to locate all Israeli MiAs,
according Tammi Arad, wife of Ron Arad, who met visiting French
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday.

Juppe, whose government has relatively strong economic ties with
Iran, said the MiA issue "is a complicated drama," and promised to
continue France's diplomatic efforts, both in Iran and Syria, until
questions are answered.

Juppe also met with Pirhiya Heiman, the sister of Yehuda Katz,
who said that Juppe told her that on his recent visit to Syria he
brought up the issue, but understands that more than regular
diplomatic action is required.

        WEIZMAN APOLOGIZES TO FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS MISSING IN ACTION


PRESIDENT Ezer Weizman met yesterday with the Baumel, Feldman,
and Katz families and expressed regret for not mentioning the names of
their sons who are missing in action to the president of the
International Red Cross.

"The new president was widely quoted in the media recently as
saying that when he speaks about Israeli soldiers missing in action,
he is referring to navigator Ron Arad, but not to our son and the
other two soldiers, Zvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz, who are missing with
him," said Miriam Baumel, mother of Zacharya Baumel.

Weizman promised the families he would do everything possible to
determine the fate of the three soldiers, who disappeared in battle at
Sultan Yaakub in Lebanon 11 years ago.

        EUROPE CALLS FOR ARAD'S RELEASE


The European Parliament in Strasbourg unanimously passed a
resolution last Thursday calling for the release of IAF navigator Ron
Arad.

Foreign Ministry officials say the measure is significant because
it was organized by the Greens faction, which has often been critical
of Israel in the past.  An accompanying proposal condemning Israel's
human rights policy in the territories was defeated.

Arad was downed in 1986, and Israel suspects that Iran knows of
his wherabouts but refuses to divulge details.

Arad's family met with European parliamentarians earlier this
year.

        WEIZMAN ASKS ICRC HELP ON ARAD


PRESIDENT Ezer Weizman yesterday asked the International
Committee of the Red Cross to step up its efforts to obtain
information on missing IAF navigator Ron Arad.

"For the Israeli public, Ron Arad has become a symbol of the
possibility of reaching meaningful agreements with our Arab
neighbors," he told ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga in a meeting.

During the course of the meeting, Weizman raised the question of
Arad several times.  "It is not reasonable," he said, "that in more
than six years there has been no precise information on his fate,
especially when we are conducting peace talks with countries like
Syria and Lebanon, which control the areas in which Hizbullah - which
is responsible for Arad - operates."

        WESTERN FIRMS AIDING RON ARAD


Western companies with ties to Iran have begun to work for the
release of missing IAF navigator Ron Arad, according to Malcolm
Hoenlein, executive director of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations.

He said that at the request of the Presidents Conference, the US
government had asked the companies to use their influence on Arad's
behalf.

        SHEVARDNADZE TO DISCUSS ARAD WITH IRANIAN FM


THE fate of missing IAF navigator Ron Arad will be raised by
Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze when he meets Iran's
foreign minister here later this month.

The issue of Israeli MiAs was also discussed during his recent
visit to Teheran, Shevardnadze said.

"We agreed that negotiations on the subject would continue.  I
cannot elaborate at this point," he said.  "The subject is too
delicate."

He added that if the Arab-Israeli conflict could be amicably
solved, he believed Israel could reach agreements with Iran on the
spread of stability in the region.

Shevardnadze was speaking to a group of Israeli journalists on a
Jewish Agency-sponsored tour of the CIS.  The meeting with
Shevardnadze was given prominent coverage in the local media.

Shevardnadze also expressed a readiness to mediate in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.  This, he said, would be "one of the major
issues" to be discussed with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who is to
visit Tbilisi in the near future.

"We have had previous discussions on this and other matters," he
added.

He expressed appreciation to Israel and to the local Jewish
community for their help with Georgia's struggle for independence, but
he stressed that Israel had not sent "even one weapon to Georgia."

Asked whether he is planning to visit Israel, Shevardnadze said,
"I am ready to come if Israel so wishes.  First we will have Peres's
visit here.  Please pass on my greetings to the people of Israel, with
whom we have much in common."

Referring to recent reports of Israeli arms arriving in Georgia,
charge d'affaires Yoav Behiri said that the Israeli government is
totally opposed to this.  "Neither explicit nor tacit approval has
been given to such a sale," he said.

If allegations that tycoon Ya'acov Nimrodi has sent arms to
Tbilisi are true, it is believed the deal may have been arranged
through other countries.

        TAU HOLDS RALLY FOR RON ARAD


About 2,000 people participated in a solidarity gathering
yesterday at Tel Aviv University on behalf of captured IAF navigator
Ron Arad, who was downed during a mission over southern Lebanon more
than six years ago.  Student organizers of the gathering showed a film
clip of Arad's captors rushing toward him as he parachuted to the
ground.

        HIZBULLAH LEADER REJECTS APPEAL TO RELEASE ARAD


HIZBULLAH deputy secretary-general Sheikh Naeem Qassem yesterday
rejected Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid's appeal to secure his release in
exchange for IAF navigator Ron Arad.  Qassem released a statement that
Obeid made the offer under pressure from his captors, according to
Israel Television.  Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah added that the
Hizbullah was not holding Arad.

Obeid, who has been held by Israel since being snatched from his
home in Jibsheet village in south Lebanon by IDF paratroopers in July
1989, said in the interview that the time had come for "action not
words."

In his first interview since being captured by the IDF, a bearded
and polite Obeid spoke to CBS's 60 Minutes anchorwoman Leslie Stahl in
a prison visitors room.

"He was not reluctant to be interviewed," Stahl told the camera.
"But he would not look at me." Obeid apologized to Stahl, explaining
that, as a devout Moslem, he could not look directly at a woman.  "But
he knows his future is linked to Ron Arad," Stahl continued.

Prime Minister Rabin appeared on the CBS show, explaining that
Obeid's capture was orchestrated to set up a prisoner exchange for Ron
Arad and other IDF hostages.  "It hasn't worked so far," Rabin
admitted.

Negotiator Uri Lubrani also made an appearance, explaining that
Israel hoped last year that its freeing a large number of Hizbullah
prisoners would bring about the release of Arad and other captured IDF
soldiers.

"It was a terrible, terrible disappointment," Lubrani said of the
failed gesture.

But Obeid is now lending his support to the tactic, making
several direct appeals to Hizbullah during the CBS interview.

"To those holding the navigator Ron Arad, I am addressing my
brethren in Lebanon," he said, looking directly at the camera.  "It's
enough talk.  It's time for action  ...  Everyone should definitely be
sent back to be reunited with his family."

Obeid told Stahl he is now opposed to the taking of hostages.
"Judaism and Islam are against it," he said.  He said he is well
treated in prison.  Although TV and radio are forbidden, he gets
newspapers, even if sometimes they are a month old.

Stahl then suggested that his prison conditions are undoubtedly
much better than Arad's.  The missing navigator's wife, Tami, also
appeared on the show, saying she could identify with Obeid's wife.
"She is just a wife," Tami said.  "But she knows from watching this
show that he is all right.  I know nothing [about Ron.  ]"

Rabin later revealed that Arad's capture was the result of an
incorrectly dropped Israeli bomb.  "Something was wrong with the
detonator," Rabin explained.  "When it dropped, Arad's plan was
damaged."

Former American hostage Terry Anderson offered his views, saying
that Israel's role in the release of all Western hostages has not been
properly acknowledged.  "Israel cooperated and moved things forward,"
Anderson noted.

Stahl later pointed out that when President George Bush appeared
on television to thank those countries which pressed for the release
of American hostages, he thanked Syria and Saudi Arabia, "but he
didn't even mention Israel."

At one point, Stahl asked Obeid about his involvement in the
kidnapping and execution of US Colonel William Higgins, whose hanged
body was photographed and publicized by his Lebanese guerrilla
captors.  The anchorwoman told Obeid she had photos that showed his
home was used to hold Higgins.

"What you are doing is not so much a TV interview as an
interrogation," Obeid responded sharply.  "I was not involved in his
capture or interrogation."

Stahl then asked Obeid about a tape CBS has showing him
"exhorting people to kill Israelis." Did that fairly represent his
views?

"Yes," Obeid answered.  "I do not deny I support military
operations against Israel, in Israel."

When he goes home, Stahl pressed, will he continue to preach the
destruction of Israel?  "Yes," he said shortly.  "The answer is
definitely, yes."

          Arad.  Interview.

        CBS ALLOWED TO INTERVIEW DETAINED SHEIKH OBEID


SHEIKH Abdel Karim Obeid, held by Israel since his abduction
three years ago, was due to appear at 2 a.m. this morning on CBS
television on a program dedicated to the captured Israeli navigator
Ron Arad.

The unusual permit to interview the detained sheikh can be
regarded as another step in the ongoing efforts to free Arad, and to
obtain the bodies of two IDF soldiers, Rahamim Alseik and Yossi Fink.

IDF soldiers abducted Sheikh Obeid and his two aides, Ahmed Obeid
and Hashem Fahs, from his home in the southern Lebanese village of
Jibsheet on July 28, 1989.

A senior defense source said last night that the negotiations a
year ago to release the Western hostages held in captivity by Moslem
fundamentalists in Lebanon would probably never have succeeded without
Israel's help and support.  The source added that Israel regards the
release of Western hostages as unfinished business until Arad is
returned safely.

He added that the world should make those states that can help
achieve Arad's release - Syria and Iran - understand that as long as
the navigator is held, those countries will not be omitted from the US
State Department's list of countries that support terrorism.

Asked why Israel continues to hold detainees without letting the
Red Cross see them, in violation of international law, the source said
that visits are allowed only for some of the detainees.  For the
others, however, visits by the Red Cross will not be permitted until
Red Cross officials are allowed to visit Arad.

Ori Slonim, a lawyer active in the negotiations to free Israel's
captured soldiers, said "We have six prisoners and MIAs in Lebanon.
They are the three soldiers from the Sultan Ya'akub battle - Zehari'a
Ba'umell, Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldmann - two fallen soldiers, Rahamim
Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, whose bodies have not yet been returned to
us, and navigator Ron Arad, whom published reports claimed is still
alive.

"A very intense and continuous effort is made to trace and get
back all the IDF prisoners and MIAs," Slonim added.  "This effort will
not stop until the last of them will be returned.  We all admire the
families who in their brave behavior encourage all of us who do the
work."

        PARENTS OF THREE MISSING IDF SOLDIERS MEET WITH UN CHIEF


NEW YORK - UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali assured the
parents of three IDF soldiers missing in Lebanon since 1982, that he
will continue to do his utmost to locate their sons and have them
returned to Israel.

The families, in turn, said they were heartened by the
Boutros-Ghali's warmth and sincerity, and believed he was doing all he
could to secure their sons' release.

Boutros-Ghali spent half-an-hour yesterday with the parents of
Zvi Feldman, Zachary Shlomo Baumel and Yehuda Katz, three IDF soldiers
presumably captured by Syrian forces on June 11, 1982, during the
battle in the area of Sultan Yacoub.

Although there has been no indication since then as to whether or
not the three are still alive, some people, including the soldiers'
families, believe they were the three Israeli soldiers paraded through
Damascus streets that same day in a "victory march."

Yonah Baumel, Zachary's father, said that although press reports
suggest there is more hope for Ron Arad's safe return than for the
soldiers captured at Sultan Yacoub, he believes the opposite is true.

"We have more information about our boys being alive than Ron
Arad," Baumel said.  "We have received a wealth of information,
including some very important reports, over the last few months,
indicating that our boys are alive."

Wednesday night, representatives of the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations in Washington, DC, were told
that "top American officials" had received "indications" that Ron Arad
was alive.  UN Ambassador Gad Ya'acobi said he had no further
information on that report.

Ya'acobi, who helped arrange the families' meeting with
Boutros-Ghali, said the secretary-general showed great sensitivity to
the families' plight.

"I know he is doing his utmost," Ya'acobi said.  "He is using
every contact he has; he is pursuing this in the most sincere way."

Ya'acobi added that Boutros-Ghali repeated his earlier assurances
that he would take personal responsibility for the release of all
captured Israeli soldiers, alive or not.  The ambassador also noted
Boutros-Ghali mentioned all the missing Israelis by name.

Ya'acobi said further pressure on Boutros-Ghali would be
counterproductive, saying, "We need to give him a chance to continue
this effort as he sees fit, if we really want to help these families.
I am in constant contact with him, and he will report back to me."

The Baumel, Feldman and Katz families requested yesterday's
meeting through the IDF, which arranged it via the Foreign Ministry.
The families arrived in New York Wednesday, and will fly back to
Israel Saturday night.  While in New York, they are meeting with
several Jewish leaders and are to appeal to the American Jewish
community to pressure Washington to find their sons.

Yosef Katz, father of Yehuda, said yesterday's meeting was more
encouraging than a similar meeting he had last year with former
secretary-general Javier Peres de Cuellar.  "Boutros-Ghali is a
warmer, more sincere man, who will take our request seriously," he
said.  "I think our trip was successful."

"He seems a warm man, who can really help," said Pnina Feldman,
Zvi's mother.  "I hope he can help.  I told him that our country pays
a great price through its sons.  Already, for 10 years, I have heard
nothing."

The three families appeared quietly yet firmly optimistic about
Boutros-Ghali's efforts.

"My son must be somewhere," Yosef Katz declared.  "Somebody is
keeping him.  Somebody knows of his location.  No doubt the Syrian
authorities bear the responsibility."

Noting that in last week's Tora portion, Sarah is blessed with
the miraculous delivery of a son, Katz said, "So we hope that my wife
Sarah will be given back her son."

Memo: After nearly 12 years of waiting, searching and lobbying, three
      families of MiAs are learning how to protest.

        PARENTS OF MIAS ARE 'TIRED OF BEING ORPHANS'


ELLI Kagan remembers Day One.  She arrived outside the Prime
Minister's Office in Jerusalem on Sunday to find Yona and Miriam
Baumel starting their hunger strike without water, without signs -
just an elderly American couple on the edge of despair over their
missing soldier son.

Kagan and her friend, Simcha Mirvis, brought water, recruited
yeshiva students and spent all night drawing posters.  The following
day the vigil began with teenagers lined across the street holding
signs and urging motorists to honk their horns.

"People are concerned about this because as foreigners who want
to make aliya we want to have trust in our government," said Kagan, a
student activist from the US.

After nearly 12 years of waiting, searching and lobbying, the
Baumels and two other families are learning how to protest.

They are angry at what they say is the government's ineptitude in
the search for their sons, who were captured at the battle of Sultan
Yacoub in the Lebanon war and then never heard from again.

Moreover, the families are furious that the government now plans
to release thousands of Palestinian prisoners without demanding that
Israel learn of the fate of the MiAs.  Once the prisoners are
released, the families say, the government will have given away its
last bargaining card.

"We have come to the end of our tether," Miriam Baumel said.
"We're tired of being orphans."

The effort focuses on four soldiers still declared alive by the
government.  Zecharia Baumel, Zvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz were all
captured in the battle of Sultan Yacoub.  Ron Arad, an Air Force
navigator, bailed out of his Phantom jet and was captured in 1986.

The remaining two MiAs, Rahamim Alsheikh and Yosef Fink, were
declared dead after the government received evidence by Hizbullah
through the United Nations in 1992.

The Baumels insist the government actually regards all the MiAs
except Arad as being dead.  Miriam Baumel said she has seen this
purported policy in the way the IDF and government respond to the
families of the soldiers missing at Sultan Yacoub.

One example was just before Pessah.  The families organized a
symbolic seder for the missing soldiers.  Miriam Baumel says nobody
from the Defense Ministry or Foreign Ministry attended.  This, she
said, despite the arrival of government representatives at ceremonies
held only for Arad.

"We have proof that the military differentiates between us
[Sultan Yacoub MiAs] and Arad," she said.

Officials dispute her claim.  "The security establishment and the
State of Israel don't differentiate between the families of the
missing," Defense Ministry spokesman Oded Ben-Ami said.  "They are
doing all they can to represent them."

Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur told the Knesset on
Wednesday that the subject of soldiers missing in Lebanon is raised at
least weekly by Rabin himself.  "We haven't wasted one opportunity,"
he said.

Privately, however, security sources and parliamentarians
familiar with the issue have concluded that Baumel, Feldman and Katz
are long dead.  "Twelve years and not a word from them or anybody who
can prove to have seen them," said a security source, who did not want
to be identified.  "I understand the pain of the families.  But
there's also a reality."

The Baumels insist the answer to their son's fate lies in the
hands of PLO leader Yasser Arafat.  It was Arafat who last year handed
over half the IDF dog tag worn by Zecharia.

The Baumels want Arafat to answer several questions: Where did he
get the dog tag from?  Why did he deny he had it for so many years?
What else does he know about Zecharia and the other MiAs?

The Baumels said the dog tag has been lying in the safe of
Arafat's long-time deputy, Khalid Wazir, or Abu Jihad, for 10 years.
Several years ago, Wazir's widow, Umm Jihad, pledged to release the
dog tag.

Parliamentary supporters of the families of the Sultan Yacoub
soldiers have other questions.  Earlier this month, Wazir's daughter,
Hanan A-Dik, was allowed to enter the territories as part of a deal in
which 49 Palestinians returned to their homes.

"Why is Israel not questioning her?" Likud MK Limor Livnat asked.

The government has been embarrassed by the hunger strike.  On the
first day, Rabin invited the families to his office and heard their
demand that no Palestinian prisoner be released until the fate of
their sons is resolved.  Rabin said he would consider the request.

In Tel Aviv, senior IDF commanders, including the head of the
manpower division, called the parents of Feldman for a meeting as they
demonstrated outside the Defense Ministry.

The family said the army asked them to end the vigil.

The parents have said no. On Wednesday, Yona Baumel, 66 and in
poor health, felt faint from extreme heat and was taken to the
Knesset, where he was given

an infusion by the physician on call.  He was ordered to end his
fast.

Miriam Baumel and the other families said they would continue
their hunger strike.

The Baumels' vigil is a lively affair.  About two dozen
youngsters line the sidewalk outside the Prime Minister's office
holding signs, one of which reads, "Don't leave soldiers on the
battlefield." Many of them hold signs urging motorists to honk.

The motorists, particularly bus and taxi drivers, often do and
the result is an ongoing cacophony that appears to disturb government
officials and their aides.

Occasionally, some of them open the window to see who is making
the racket or shake their heads.

At times, Miriam Baumel, behaving like a peeved grandmother,
tells the demonstrators to pipe down.

But the students seem to be enjoying themselves.  Like Kagan,
most of them are Americans and eager to draw attention to the cause of
the MiAs.

"We're going to raise hell," Kagan said.  "We're ready to sit in
the streets.  There is no excuse for all this waiting.  Twelve years
is 12 years too long."

        SCOWCROFT: ARAD IS ALIVE


US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told a group from
the Conference of Presidents of American Jewish Organizations there
are signals that missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad is still alive,
though he did not elaborate.  The meeting between Scowcroft and the
Jewish leaders was largely a farewell meeting before the change in
administrations.

        YA'ACOBI TELLS UN CHIEF: ISRAEL TO BOOST PARTICIPATION ON ALL
LEVELS


NEW YORK - Israel's new ambassador to the United Nations, Gad
Ya'acobi, presented his credentials to UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali Friday, assuming his place as head of Israel's UN
delegation.

"I see my primary task as working to increase Israel's
participation in UN activities at every level," Ya'acobi told Israeli
reporters after his short meeting with Boutros-Ghali.

During the meeting, Boutros-Ghali reiterated his commitment to
locate and free captured Israeli airman Ron Arad, but he did not
specify what steps he would take, Ya'acobi said.  The two also
discussed UN participation in the upcoming multilateral peace talks to
be held in Europe.

Ya'acobi expressed optimism regarding Israel's increasingly
favorable position in the international community, noting the
"friendly atmosphere" prevailing towards Israel both on Capitol Hill
and at the UN.

Regarding the peace talks, Boutros-Ghali said he would soon
appoint an undersecretary to oversee the entire UN team, which will be
operating at the five working groups meeting concurrently in Europe,
Ya'acobi said.

Ya'acobi added that the UN Secretary-General had told him he had
always been proud of the role he had played in the Egyptian-Israeli
peace agreement, and looked forward to playing a similar role in
Israel's "rapprochement" with the UN.  Boutros-Ghali is to meet with
President Herzog when the latter comes to New York in November to
speak before the Council of Jewish Federations General Assembly.

Ya'acobi indicated he would continue the ongoing efforts to open
diplomatic relations with the 61 UN member states which do not yet
have relations with Israel, and fight the anti-Israel resolutions that
still remain on the UN agenda.

Many of those resolutions, like one condemning Egyptian-Israeli
peace, are irrelevant today, Ya'acobi stressed, and should be thrown
out.  To counter their negative effect, he plans to introduce a
resolution in support of the multilateral peace talks.

Ya'acobi also said Israel will offer increased assistance to UN
educational and technical efforts in underdeveloped nations.  Israel
will send advisers "wherever they are needed," he stressed, and looks
forward to re-establishing itself as a major promoter of responsible
development in the Third World.

        AUSTRALIAN FM TO RAISE ISSUE OF RON ARAD AT UN


The Australian foreign minister plans to raise the fate of
missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad at the UN General Assembly.  This
was reported by members of the Australian Zionist Federation who met
the minister in Melbourne.

In England, Jewish leaders met with Members of Parliament, who
have promised to raise the matter in contacts with the Iranians and at
international forums.

The moves are part of a campaign by Zionist bodies worldwide to
get international support for attempts to free Arad.  Even the newly
formed Zionist Federation in Budapest, the first in the former Eastern
bloc, has joined in the campaign, sending a letter to the prime
minister of Hungary.

A decision was taken by the Zionist Congress when it met in
Jerusalem this summer to mount an international campaign to free the
Israeli MiAs, a Jewish Agency spokesman said.  To this end, the
Organization Department of the World Zionist Organization had been in
touch with federations throughout the world.

        TECHNION TO CAMPAIGN FOR RON ARAD


The Technion students association is going ahead with plans for
an international campaign to press for the release of missing IAF
navigator Ron Arad.

Later this month, petitions calling for Arad to be freed are to
be distributed to student organizations in universities throughout the
world.  The completed petitions are then slated to be sent to the
president of the US and the secretary-general of the UN.

Arad studied at the chemical engineering faculty of the Technion
from 1985-86, and is still classed as a student.  He was called up for
reserve duty in October 1986, and in the same month fell into the
hands of Shi'ite extremists in Lebanon after his plane was shot down.

Meanwhile, scores of youngsters are scheduled to release hundreds
of "Free Ron Arad" balloons at Rosh Hanikra near the Lebanese border
next Friday, and a plane is slated to carry aloft a huge banner
calling for his release.

The activities at Kibbutz Rosh Hankira, being organized by the
public committee for Ron Arad, follow the recent announcement by
Lebanon's delegation to the peace talks that Arad is believed to be
alive.

        BOUTROS-GHALI PLEDGES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RON ARAD


NEW YORK - UN Secretary-General Boutrus Boutrus-Ghali has pledged
to take personal responsibility for the release of captured Israel Air
Force navigator Ron Arad, believed held by terrorists.

In a meeting here with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres last night,
Boutrus-Ghali said he was appointing himself to head the UN committee
on PoWs and MiAs.  He will replace Jean Domenico Picot.

Arad disappeared on October 16, 1986 after his Phantom crashed in
southern Lebanon.  Both Arad and his pilot parachuted out of the
plane, but rescue helicopters were only able to retrieve the pilot.

Boutrus-Ghali promised Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin he would give
Arad's plight his personal attention when Rabin visited the US in
August.  On Tuesday members of the Lebanese delegation to the peace
talks announced that Arad was still alive.

Rabin then ordered the heads of the delegation to talks with the
Lebanese, Uri Lubrani and Yosef Hadass, to immediately ask chief
Lebanese delegate Antoine Chammas to provide all the information he
had on Arad's location and condition.

Peres continued his 10-day whirlwind visit here yesterday,
meeting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the UN Plaza Hotel
early in the morning.  The two ministers focused on increasing German
economic involvement with Israel, ending the Arab boycott, and swiftly
concluding the peace talks.

Kinkel promised Peres that the German government would do its
best to expand German investment in Israel, including establishing a
fund for industrial cooperation and doubling the amount of money
earmarked for a fund for joint scientific research.

Peres explained that Israel cannot accept any delay in
cancellation of the Arab boycott, which Germany had pledged to work
against.  He said Israel is unhappy with the six-month delay in German
compliance with the anti-boycott regulations.

Peres asked Kinkel to push for taking Israel off Germany's "H"
list, a roster of nations with whom Germany refuses to have military
ties.  The German foreign minister explained there were constitutional
difficulties impeding progress on that matter, but he would
investigate when he returned to Bonn.

Kinkel also pledged to investigate Bonn's willingness to include
Israel in the UN's Western European regional bloc, without which
Israel is ineligible for membership on key UN bodies such as the
Security Council.

Peres also discussed the peace negotiations with his German
colleague, particularly the talks with the Syrian and Palestinian
teams.  He explained that the territorial concessions envisioned by
Resolution 242 were only one parameter of a much larger peace vision.

"We promised to freeze the settlements, and we did it without
preconditions," Peres reminded Kinkel.  "That decision still holds."

Peres will take a four-day Shabbat and Rosh Hashana break in his
discussions with nearly two dozen foreign ministers and presidents
here in New York, resuming work on Wednesday morning.

        LEBANESE SAY RON ARAD IS ALIVE; RABIN SEEKS MORE INFORMATION


WASHINGTON - Missing IAF navigator Ron Arad is alive, Lebanese
delegates at the peace talks confirmed publicly yesterday.

In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered delegation
heads Uri Lubrani and Yosef Hadass to immediately ask chief Lebanese
delegate Antoine Chammas to provide all the information he had on
Arad's location and condition, the Prime Minister's Office said last
night.

Rabin said he hoped the Lebanese government is aware of the
seriousness of its announcement, and would be responsible for what was
said.

Chammas said he had no information about where Arad, who has been
missing since being shot down over Lebanon six years ago, is being
held or who is holding him.

"We were were assured ...  that the Lebanese delegation would do
whatever it could to pursue the matter to the best of its ability,"
Lubrani, who has worked on Arad's behalf for years, noted.

Just before the midway recess of the current round of
negotiations, Israel had asked the Lebanese to check on the
whereabouts of Arad and several other IDF soldiers missing in action
in Lebanon.

Last Thursday, the Lebanese told the Israelis that Arad was
alive, but they had no information about the others, senior Israeli
officials said privately.  The officials said that they believe the
Lebanese about Arad.

There have been reports that Arad, who was shot down in 1986, is
being held either in Iran or by pro-Iranian forces in the Bek'a
Valley.  Israel hoped in vain that he would be released last fall when
all American hostages were released in complex negotiations.

In yesterday's negotiations, exploratory talks with Lebanon
continued on an Israeli proposal to hold "military-to-military" talks
on security arrangements as part of the ongoing plenary discussions.
Two Lebanese generals and senior Israeli security officials are
already members of the respective delegations, sources said, but the
Lebanese have yet to agree to specific discussions on military issues.

Senior Israeli officials said privately that they are skeptical
that the Lebanese will agree before the end of this round, unless such
talks are linked to a commitment to adhere to Security Council
resolution 425, which calls for Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.  Israel totally rejects this, saying that 425 can only be
discussed as part of talks on an Israeli-Lebanese peace treaty.

While the atmosphere in the talks with Lebanon has been good,
there were some difficult moments yesterday.  Israel complained about
continuing Hizbullah attacks on Israeli and South Lebanon Army
targets.  After an almost month-long pause during the Lebanese
elections, Hizbullah resumed almost daily assaults last week.

Meanwhile, there is no evidence there will be a breakthrough on
hoped for declarations of principles for peace or a statement on
ending the state of war with Syria before this round of talks recesses
tomorrow.

Chief Syrian delegate Mouwafak Allaf again publicly complained
that the Israeli delegation does not have a mandate to discuss
territory.

Chief delegate Prof. Itamar Rabinovich seconded Rabin's call for
upgrading the level of communication between the two countries.  "For
us, it's not only a more effective channel; it's also a way to
persuade ourselves that Syria is engaged politically, as a nation, a
state, and a society."

In talks with the Palestinians, more effective discussions are
underway now that a much of the daily session is taken up by having
only three members on both sides speak informally about the best way
to proceed.

Israeli officials believe the impasse can be broken when there is
no concern the talks are being tape recorded.

So far, the Palestinians have not agreed to a proposal to
establish subcommittees on the separate spheres of self-government in
the territories.

        RABIN RAPS EUROPEAN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS IN YUGOSLAVIA


NEW YORK - Prime Minister Rabin criticized the international
response to the crisis in Yugoslavia, targeting the inaction of
European countries who have been lobbying for a role in the Middle
East peace process.

"I wonder at some of the reaction of the international
community," Rabin said at the United Nations on Friday, following a
meeting with Secretary-General Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali.  "The
Europeans are volunteering to participate in peace processes all over
the world, and when there is trouble at their doorstep, where are
they?  Where is the European community?"

Rabin met with Boutrous-Ghali shortly after his arrival here on
Friday.

Rabin is to meet tomorrow with President George Bush, hoping to
obtain US administration approval for the $10 billion loan guarantee.
The eight-day visit also includes a scheduled meeting Wednesday with
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton.

In his meeting with Boutrous-Ghali, Rabin brought Tami Arad, the
wife of captured airman Ron Arad, to make a personal plea to deal with
the question of Israeli soldiers who are missing in action.

Arad, who traveled to the US with Rabin's team, asked
Boutrous-Ghali to stand by the commitments of former UN
Secretary-General Javior Perez de Cuellar and try to convince the
Iranians to release her husband.

As she has done in all of her public appearances, she reminded
the UN secretary-general of her six-year-old daughter, Yuval, who does
not remember her father, who was captured when she was only a year
old.  Arad handed Boutrous-Ghali a painting by her daughter.

Israel is also after conclusive proof about the fate of three
soldiers missing from the 1982 campaign of Lebanon, and two soldiers
believed killed in southern Lebanon in 1986 in a Shi'ite Moslem
ambush.

Arad said she asked "the UN secretary-general and the American
government to help bring my husband home."

"I believe that the United States, being the only superpower in
the world today, can pressure the Republic of Iran to release my
husband.  I believe the UN can do it, too.  Mr.  Boutrous-Ghali says
that he himself will take on our case" and will appoint a special
representative, she told reporters.

Boutrous-Ghali responded to Arad by promising that he would do
all that he could to assist in her husband's case.  After emerging
from the meeting, Rabin said that he "did not know what the result
will be" from his entreaty, but that he planned to bring family
members of soldiers missing in action to all such meetings, in order
to put a human face on the MIA issue.

The Israeli soldiers missing in action include Zecharia Baumel,
Zvi Feldman and Aharon Katz.  Israel is demanding the bodies of Yosef
Fink and Rachamim al-Sheikh, both believed to be held by the Hizbullah
organization.

Responding to Rabin's concerns on the MIA issue, Boutrous-Ghali
said that a newly appointed but anonymous UN representative is
currently traveling between Tehran and Afghanistan working on the
problem.

Boutrous-Ghali told Rabin that Dominico Pico, the former envoy of
Perez de Cuellar who had facilitated the release of Western hostages,
had been replaced.  While he said the new appointee was already in the
Middle East pursuing his mission, he did not mention his name.

Boutrous-Ghali revealed the information about the new appointee
after Rabin urged him to appoint a replacement to Pico.

The MIAs and the Bosnian crisis were Rabin's top agenda items at
the UN.  According to Rabin spokesman Gad Ben-Ari, the prime minister
told Boutrous-Ghali that the plight of the Croatians should serve a
lesson to Israel as it seeks peace.

Rabin said that the Croatian plight demonstrates that it is
destructive for any nation to be perceived as weak and vulnerable in
the world today.  Nations that are weak, he said, do not survive.

"We the Jews are more sensitive than anybody else - these
pictures, these stories, remind us of the greatest tragedy in the
history of the Jewish people, the Holocaust," Rabin said.  "Even
though it's on a very small scale, as it looks now, we have to do the
utmost to convince others to do what should be done.  We on our part
are sending humanitarian assistance," he told the press after the
meeting.

Boutrous-Ghali told Rabin that it will take at least three months
to prepare UN forces to calm things down in the area.  He is
pressuring the European countries to take action.

Rabin and Boutrous-Ghali's meeting began as a one-on-one session,
with aides brought into the meeting later.  Rabin told Boutrous-Ghali
that Israel hopes to eventually freeze all settlements in the
territories and prevent the expansion of the existing settlements, but
such a goal must be implemented gradually.  He mentioned that prior to
his departure from Israel, demonstrations against this policy had
taken place.  This was an expression, he said, of Israeli democracy.

Boutrous-Ghali told Rabin that he was as committed to improving
Israel's position within the UN as much as he had been supportive of
improving Israeli-Egyptian ties.  Rabin reiterated Israel's commitment
to the observance of the Camp David accords.

He had praise for the stability of the peace between Israel and
Egypt, but noted that other Arab countries had failed to follow suit.
Rabin said that Syrian leader Hafez Assad is not Sadat, and will never
take the risks for peace that Sadat took.

Boutrous-Ghali expressed dissatisfaction that the UN does not
have a more active role in the peace talks beyond their status as
observers.

        ARAD'S BROTHER: RON IS IN IRAN


Ron Arad's brother said yesterday there was "definite"
information that the missing airman is in Iranian hands.

Chen Arad was addressing a demonstration on behalf of his
brother, an IAF navigator who was captured during a bombing raid over
Lebanon 5 years ago.

Arad may have been captured by Iranian-backed terrorists.  There
has been speculation in the past that he was in Iran.

Israel had hoped Arad would be released as part of a UN-brokered
deal last year, which resulted in the release of all the Western
hostages in Lebanon except for two German hostages.

Israel Radio said over 1,500 people attended the Arad solidarity
demonstration in Givat Ala, the Jezreal Valley settlement where Arad's
wife, Tami, and daughter Yuval live.  Organizers said the
demonstration was to call on "all players in Israel and throughout the
world to help free Ron Arad."

        IRANIAN FM DENIES HIS COUNTRY HOLDING RON ARAD


IRANIAN Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati denied yesterday that
Iran was holding missing airman Ron Arad.

In a rare exchange between an Iranian official and an Israeli
reporter, Velayati was asked by an Army Radio correspondent in
Bucharest whether his country was holding Arad, whose aircraft was
shot down over Lebanon in 1986.

"I don't know how much it is related to the present discussions
that we have, but I categorically deny there is any prisoner from
Israel in Iran," Velayati said.

Senior pro-Iranian sources in Lebanon have said Arad is in Syrian
hands.  Israel has said he is held by Hizbullah or Iran.

        ARENS MEETS WITH RON ARAD'S FAMILY


Israel has done everything possible and devoted its utmost
efforts to finding and securing the release of IAF navigator Ron Arad,
missing since July 1986, Defense Minister Moshe Arens told Arad's
family yesterday.

Arens met with Arad's family after they bitterly complained he
refrained from meeting them for a year, and turned down all their
requests for a meeting.

Arad's mother Batya, brother Chen and wife Tami asserted that
Israel missed ample opportunities to find Arad's whereabouts and
possibly release him during the first year of his captivity, in
1986-87.

The family implicitly charged that while Arad was believed to
have been held by Amal, Israel did not do enough to negotiate his
release because of other interests.

Arad was reportedly handed over to Hizbullah in the late 1980s
for a large sum of money, $300,000 according to foreign reports.  He
was then apparently held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.  There
are no current indications that Arad is alive, but Israel officially
contends he is.

Arens told the family that Israel is handling the issue in the
best possible way, employing the most highly qualified people.

Recently Israel's top hostage and MiA negotiators, Uri Lubrani
and Ori Slonim, resigned for personal reasons amid criticism that
perhaps Israel mismanaged the negotiations.

UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali promised a delegation
from the World Jewish Congress yesterday he is continuing to
"follow-up" the case of missing Israeli airman Ron Arad.

Boutros-Ghali, however, has not received word on Arad's current
status, according to WJC Secretary-General Israel Singer.

The WJC delegation met with Boutros-Ghali at the UN in a meeting
Singer called "very helpful and productive." Also discussed at the
meeting was the fate of the Yemenite and Syrian Jewish communities.

        DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER: IRAN RESPONSIBLE FOR WELFARE OF ARAD


Israel holds Iran responsible for the welfare of air force
navigator Ron Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986, Deputy
Defense Minister Ovadia Eli told the Knesset yesterday.

"The government calls for the continuation of efforts to return
our PoWs and MiAs in Syria and Lebanon, and regards the Iranian
government as solely responsible for [Arad's] well-being, health and
fate," said Eli in response to a motion by Sarah Doron (Likud).

The deputy minister also called on UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to continue the efforts of his predecessor, Javier Perez
de Cuellar to gain the release of Israeli soldiers in the hands of
Syria and Iran.

Israeli leaders, including Defense Minister Moshe Arens, said
there was no connection between Musawi and Arad.  However, a Shi'ite
organization in Beirut reportedly claimed on Tuesday that Arad had
been killed to avenge Musawi's death.

Addressing Arad's captors, Doron said: "If you have a shred of
conscience, you who claim to talk in the name of justice, humanity,
fairness and equality ... allow Ron Arad to give a sign of life,
release him, let him tell his family ... that he is alive."

Doron accused the UN of discriminating against Israel in its
efforts to release Western prisoners.  "The UN distinguishes between
the fate of Western hostages and IDF missing-in-action," said Doron.
"An imbalance has been created regarding the release of captives."

Doron added that Arad had been "sold" by the group holding him to
an organization financed by Iran for $300,000.

        'IRAN RESPONSIBLE FOR FATE OF RON ARAD'


Israel continues to hold Iran responsible for the fate and safety
of captured Air Force navigator Ron Arad, the IDF said last night.

Arad, whose plane was shot down over Lebanon in July 1986, was
reportedly murdered by his Hizbullah captors to avenge the IAF's
killing of the organization's leader Abbas Musawi, according to an
anonymous caller to a Beirut radio station.

The IDF said Arad, who was held temporarily by the Shi'ite
militia Amal, was handed over to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for
money. At one point, several months ago, Israeli security sources
stressed that Arad may even be in Iran itself, but it was never
corroborated.

The government's stand is that Arad is alive, until proven
unequivocally otherwise.  Privately, however, security sources concede
that had he been alive, Hizbullah would have used him as a bargaining
chip.  He was possibly murdered by "local initiative," meaning an
unplanned act of revenge by a guard.

This conjecture cannot be confirmed by official Israeli sources,
but was contended by British intelligence sources on Monday.

Arad's wife, Tami, said she does not believe her husband was
murdered.  "I hope they haven't hurt him and I believe they haven't
hurt him," she told Israel Television last night.

One defense source told The Jerusalem Post that if Arad was
murdered some time ago, the killing of Musawi provided Hizbullah the
pretext to come out and admit it, and portray it as an act of revenge.

        LUBRANI: MUSAWI WAS A DANGER, NOT A PRAGMATIST


The government's coordinator on Lebanon, Uri Lubrani, yesterday
described slain Hizbullah leader Shiekh Abbas Musawi as a dedicated
and dangerous enemy of Israel.

"It's nonsense to describe Musawi as a pragmatist," Lubrani said.
"His so-called pragmatism was the result of Iranian pressure.  If he
had been told to be extreme and hard, he would have been extremely
hard."

"Musawi participated in planning the kidnapping of western
hostages, as well as the holding of IDF soldiers Yossi Fink and
Rahamin Alshiekh," who were subsequently killed.

Lubrani said Musawi had been in charge of Hizbullah activities in
south Lebanon prior to becoming general secretary of the organization.

"He was deeply involved in the Hizbullah's military arm in the
south, where operations were decided upon," said Lubrani.

"Musawi approved all operations, and he is known to have
personally congratulated those who perpetrated these attacks."

Lubrani maintained that Musawi's hatred of Israel was as
unyielding as that of the Moslem fundamentalist organization he
headed.

"The Hizbullah is on record as being dedicated to causing
mischief along the edge of the security zone, inside the zone and
along Israel's northern border," Lubrani declared.

"Musawi was worse.  We have only to look at what he was exhorting
his people to do - to get to Jerusalem.  There's no doubt he was a
dedicated and dangerous enemy.

"He used the term 'cancerous microbes' to refer to Israelis and
often declared he would not cease terrorist activities against Israel
until Jerusalem was liberated.  He stated that Israel had no right to
exist on Islamic soil."

Lubrani noted that Musawi and the Hizbullah generally were
committed to taking whatever steps were necessary to disrupt the peace
process and prevent the signing of any peace treaties with Israel.

"This man was the head of the mafia.  I see his demise as a
severe blow to the Hizbullah and something which might accelerate a
process by which the organization comes to realize that militancy is
no way to act in south Lebanon."

Nevertheless, Lubrani noted that even after "cutting off the
viper's head, the viper still remains," and there was every reason to
expect the Hizbullah to increase its activities.

He maintained that one of the most significant aspects of
Musawi's death was to make it clear to terrorist leaders they were not
immune from attack.

Lubran was adamant that the killing of Musawi would not affect
the peace process, or endanger negotiations to secure the return of
IDF servicemen missing in Lebanon.

Lubrani reiterated Israel's stance that it would deal with
terrorists and terrorism, while continuing negotiations as part of the
peace process.

Regarding the possible effects of Musawi's killing on the fate of
Ron Arad and the other missing IDF servicemen, Lubrani said, "I don't
believe it will have any effect whatsoever."

His comments were echoed by Tami Arad, who is in the US as part
of efforts to promote a prisoners exchange deal.

She was quoted as saying that there was no reason why Musawi's
killing should damage the attempts to secure the return of her husband
and the other missing soldiers.

Tami Arad said her navigator husband has been held by the
Iranians for the past two-and-a-half years and not the Hizbullah.

        TAMI ARAD MEETS WITH VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE


WASHINGTON - Tami Arad met yesterday with US Vice President Dan
Quayle as part of her campaign to lobby the Bush administration to
make active efforts for her husband's release.

Ron Arad, an IDF navigator who was shot down over Lebanon in
1986, is believed to be held either in Iran or by Iranian-backed
elements in Lebanon.

The visit to the United States is Arad's second in the past
several months, fueled by concern that US pressure on her husband's
captors would slow after the December release of the last of the US
hostages held in Lebanon.

Arad was scheduled to fly today to San Francisco to participate
in a large rally on her husband's behalf.  She will return to
Washington later in the week to meet with senators and congressmen on
Capitol Hill.

        BREAKTHROUGH SAID NEAR ON MISSING IDF SERVICEMEN


UN hostage envoy Giandomenico Picco is reported to be on the
verge of a breakthrough in attempts to secure the return of missing
IDF servicemen in exchange for the release of Lebanese detained by
Israel and the South Lebanese Army.

A pro-Iranian source told news agencies in Beirut yesterday that
there had been a breakthrough in the deadlocked negotiations.

His comments followed similar reports emanating from political
and security sources in the security zone in south Lebanon.

These reports said Picco had made progress and that the proposed
hand-over would occur in a neutral country.

Israeli sources, however, played down the reports, saying that
there had been no new developments as far as they were aware.

Israel has been pressing for conclusive information regarding the
fate of IAF navigator Ron Arad, so far to no avail.

Nevertheless, sources in Lebanon said it appeared that the
various recent statements could indicate positioning for possible new
moves.

On Sunday, Hizbullah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi said his
organization was still willing to exchange missing IDF servicemen and
SLA soldiers for Lebanese held by Israel and the SLA.

Hizbullah is believed to be holding the bodies of missing Givati
Brigade soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh.

Meanwhile, Amal leader Nahbi Berri recently reiterated that his
organization is holding the bodies of two missing IDF servicemen.

Berri said Amal was willing to allow Red Cross officials to
examine the bodies in return for the release of 15 Shi'ite women being
held in the El Khiyam jail inside the security zone.

Since 1989, Amal has claimed to be holding the bodies of two
Israelis, without identifying them.

Berri said the bodies were handed over to Amal by the PLO as a
"peace gesture" several years ago.

Israel has demanded that the bodies be first examined by
independent officials.  Berri, however, has demanded the release of
the prisoners as a prior condition.

Last September, Berri called for the release of 28 women
prisoners from the El Khiyam jail in return for information regarding
the identity of the bodies.

        ISRAELI OFFICIALS TO MEET WITH PEREZ DE CUELLAR


The Israeli negotiating team on the MiAs will fly to New York
early next week and meet outgoing UN Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, a Defense Ministry source said last night.

The Israeli officials are scheduled to convey to Perez de Cuellar
- whose term as UN Secretary General expires today - Israel's
lingering and unanswered concerns regarding IAF navigator Ron Arad and
three Armored Corps soldiers missing since June 1982.  According to
the source, they expect to be updated on Perez de Cuellar's latest
activities on the issue.

Recently Israeli officials close to the hostage and MiAs
negotiations criticized Perez de Cuellar for inaction and ineptness in
his treatment of the Israeli MiAs.  Israel, they said, did everything
he asked in terms of gestures by releasing Shi'ite prisoners, yet he
produced nothing in return.

The Israeli officials are hopeful that his successor, Egyptian
statesman Boutros Boutros Ghali, will demonstrate interest in the
issue and come up with information and possibly a solution to the
Israeli MiAs problem.

        LUBRANI DISAPPOINTED OVER ARAD CASE


METULLA - Uri Lubrani, Government coordinator on Lebanon,
yesterday expressed "great disappointment" over the failure of
UN-brokered efforts to secure the freedom of missing IAF navigator Ron
Arad.

"We received only partial satisfaction to what we had expected as
a result of the initiative of the UN secretary-general," Lubrani told
reporters here.  "The case of Ron Arad is not solved yet, and this is
a source of great disappointment to us."

Lubrani said that although secretary-general Javier Perez de
Cuellar had succeeded "to his great credit" in securing the release of
other hostages, he had "failed to bring back Arad.

"I haven't blamed the secretary-general, however, and I will
continue to hope that he and his successor will continue to do
everything they can to propagate this initiative," said Lubrani.

His comments came just 24 hours after de Cuellar's special
hostage envoy Giandomenico Picco concluded his latest mission to the
region, without apparently achieving any tangible results.  De Cuellar
himself retires at the end of this month.

Lubrani stressed that Israel, for its part, would do its utmost
to resolve the case of Arad and the other missing servicemen.

He spoke to reporters following a visit to the security zone in
south Lebanon yesterday, to offer Christmas greetings to South
Lebanese Army commander Gen. Antoine Lahad and Christian dignitaries.
Lubrani was accompanied by OC Northern Command Maj.  Gen.  Yitzhak
Mordechai and senior IDF officers.

Lubrani noted that Israel had no intention of changing its
deployment in the zone or the Christian-controlled Jezzine enclave,
unless a full-fledged peace treaty was signed between Israel and the
"independent sovereign State of Lebanon."

He rejected recently published reports that Israel, in
discussions with Lebanon's delegation to the Washington talks, had
agreed in principle to withdraw its troops from the south.

"The Lebanese delegation is talking about one UN Security Council
resolution, 425.  We, however, are not discussing 425, nor resolution
520, which calls for the withdrawal of all non-Lebanese forces," said
Lubrani.

"We are discussing a full-fledged peace treaty, and as long as
this is not achieved, I don't think that anything concerning our
present deployment (in south Lebanon) will change.

"We have no intention of relinquishing this area nor abandoning
these people whose future, well-being and welfare will be taken into
account when we negotiate a peace agreement with Lebanon."

Lubrani described as absolutely baseless reports of a lowering of
morale among SLA officers and troops due to concern over the peace
talks.  He described the reports as part of the ongoing "psychological
war," adding that the SLA was continuing to do an excellent job.

<h1>Letter To The Iranian Embassy To Great Britain</h1>

<h2><i>The Fellowship For Ron's Arad Release </i></h2>

22 October 1995
<p>

His Excellency, Gholamerza Ansari, Charge D'Affaires<br>
Embassy of Iran, London<p>
                                                                    
Your Excellency    
<p>                                                                   
Nine years have passed since the Israeli , Ron Arad, fell into captivity. We his family, his mother, wife and daughter, who does not remember her father, his brothers and his friends, stand before you physically and in spirit, and ask that you assist us on our appeal to your government for Ron's release and his return to his family in Israel. For years there has been no sign of life from him - no letter, no word of greeting to his family, nothing. How much longer must Ron languish in captivity?
<p>
Throughout the world , walls are falling, countries are engaged in the process of peace POWs and prisoners are being released. Only Ron has not been returned to his family.
<p>
Your Excellency, on Tuesday , 19 September, 1995, 180 Iranian nationals landed on Israeli soil. Israel treated them with every humanitarian courtesy, depriving them of nothing : food in unlimited quantities, toys for the children, warm beds to sleep in . Within 24 hours all of them were returned to thier families: husbands joined thier wives, sons joined thier parents and mothers came back to thier children. Send Ron back to his own daughter who has waited these long years for a sign of life from her father. Don't you think that this reunion is long overdue? Nine yaers is a very long time for a ten-year-old.
<p>
Your Excellency, freedom is the gift of Allah to the human race for all eternity. Please bring this gift to Ron Arad.
<p>
Awaiting information on Ron in your reply, we are.
<p>
Sincerely yours,<br>
The fellowship for the Release of Ron Arad

Dear Sir or Madam
<p>
I received your petition about Mr. ron Arad. While appreciating any humanitarian act to set free poWs, I would like to return your petition to be sent to to the relevant country or authorities and also draw your attention to following points . 
<p>
In according with the teachings of Islam, the Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently called for peace and peaceful coexistance for all human beings, and for the return of PoWs to thier families.
<p>
You will appreciate that there are also many families in Iran who have almost forgotten what joy and happiness are following the captivity or disappearance of thier loved ones in Iraq and in Lebanon. Among them are the families of four Iranians who went missing in Lebanon in 1982.
<p>
The disappearance of missing people (Iranian, etc) should be blamed squarely on the original instigators of war and bloodshed in the Middle East, who also created insecurityand chaos in Lebanon.
<p>
We would like to reiterate the fact that the Islamic republic of Iran has herself been among the first victims of this phenomenon. We pray for all the innocent people held in captivity.
<p>
Finnaly it must be pointed that the Islamic Republic of Iran has no information about the condition or the whereabout of Mr. Ron Arad.
<p>
With kind regards<br>

<h1>The results of the poll carried out by Gallup</h1>
More than 65% of the total Israeli population believe that the Israeli<br> 
navigator Ron Arad is alive. More than 70% think that Israel must make<br> 
negotiations with Syria conditional on receiving information on Ron Arad.<br>
These data arise from a poll taken by the Gallup Institute covering 508 people<br> 
from age 18 and above, representing a country-wide example of the adult<br> 
population in Israel.<br>

<P>A high percentage of those who believe that Ron is alive are in the 18-34 and<BR>
35-44 age groups.In the 45 and above age-group the percentage is lower.<br>

<P>In reaction to these data, Batya Arad, Ron's mother, said: "There is no<br> 
doubt in my mind that the data in the first paragraph are correct.I know<br> 
that Ron is alive."<br>
Regarding the second paragraph Batya said: "Apparently, the education we<br> 
received and passed on to our children, that one does not abandon a soldier<br> 
on the battlefield, is deeply imbedded in the Israeli people, and those<br> 
conducting the negotations to release Ron must take this seriously".<br>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1988</H1>
<P>1988 was an election year in the United States and Israel.  In the U.S. George Bush was elected president while Israeli elections brought on a national unity government with Yitzchak Shamir as Prime Minister and the late Yitzchak Rabin as Minister of Defense.  In France Fracois Mitterand was elected to his second term of office as French president.  Egypt's Naguib Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his "Arabian narrative art".  Bobby McFerrin soothed the world with his song "Don't Worry, Be Happy" and Hollywood brought us "Rain Man".  December of that year brought tragedy to Lockerbee, Scotland with the crash of a Pan Am airplane.

<P>October 16 of this year marked Ron's second year of captivity.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1989</H1>
<P>1989 was the beginning of the end of the Cold War.  The Berlin Wall was opened and Vaclav Havel became president of Czechaslovakia.  5000 protesters were killed in Tiananmen Square in China and 240,000 barrels of oil were spilled into the Prince William Sound by the Exxon Valdez.  Oliver North was convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal and the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

<P>October 16, 1989 marked Ron's third year in captivity.

<B><P>  Shalom, Ron!</B>

<P>  Since 16 October, 1986, the day you did not return from your mission over Lebanon, we have been trying to secure your release, but have not succeeded. Agreements concerning your release were not honored, even after the State of Israel had kept its part of the agreements.

<P>  We are not letting you be forgotten, even for a single minute. No day goes by that we do not make repeated attempts to gain your freedom. The entire people of Israel are recruited on your behalf: youth movements, students, organizations like Wizo, Hadassah and the Freemasons. All over Israel cars drive around with "Free Ron Arad" stickers on the bumpers and rear windows.
<P>  The members of your family have met with Heads of State and Heads of Governments (presidents, kings, prime ministers) to recruit their assistance in gaining your release. The United Nations's Secetary General Boutros Boutros Ghali has promised to give the matter his personal attention and to appoint a special convoy to deal with it. We hope that this promise will be kept. The Iranians continue to deny that they hold your fate in their hands. They have violated all the United Nations and human right conventions, and still have not been expelled from the United Nations.  <P>  On the tenth anniversary of your captivity, we will demonstrate opposite the United Nations building in New York, together with those that support you there. We hope and pray that knowledge of all these efforts comes to your attention and that you draw strength from it. You must be strong, for your loving mother, for your wife who fights for you and for your daugther Yuval, who dreams about you. You have to be strong for your brothers, for us and for the hundreds of thousands of people who signed petitions and for the thousands who have sent letters expressing their support for your cause.

<P>See you soon,


<B><P>Yoske Harari, Chairman.</B>

<P>A LETTER TO RON ARAD FROM THE PILOT THAT FLEW WITH HIM ON THAT FATEFUL FLIGHT

  <P>Ten Years after the plane was brought down, Y, writes a letter to Ron by means of the "Yedioth Achronot" newspaper's friday supplement, "Seven Days".

<P>  "The counter on the roof of the Levinsky Teacher's College climbs daily towards the number 3,650. Even those who predicted the worst did not assess the half of that; after all the four years that the prisoners-of-war had remained in Egypt became our basis for defining eternity.

<P>  Something is wrong with that counter, it counts forwards instead of backwards, and it creates despair. When will we learn what is happening to you? When will we know whom to believe?

<P>  In Israel, every question has at least two answers, from the left and from the right, except you, you are in the middle, the consensus. We don't want consensus, we don't want "Free Ron Arad". (You wouldn't believe the number of stickers there are.) We want you, alive, sane and with us.
Events here are so serious and happen with such frequency, and every piece of news drops off the agenda in a matter of days. But among us, not a conversation is held in which you are not mentioned. With me in particular everything is alive, fresh and open and will not heal until we know....

<P>  There was a time when we could put together bits of information, and imagine you there, even with the beard you grew. Lately, I close my eyes, but I can seem to bring you into focus; where are you? Are you laughing in the light or weeping in darkness.

<P>  Maybe it seems so banal, but knowing you, you're supposed to appear from somewhere with your shy smile, and we all hug you, weeping and laughing, and then you'll get to know your family again, more mature and stronger and wonderful, and you'll be so proud of them. and then we'll sit and talk for hours and days about things that happened, and about friends, and who got what job, and places and politics, and gossip and sports and intifadah and Petra and all the rest of the thunder and lightning.

<P>  And after all that, I'll want to be with you alone for several hours...We still have not debriefed...You certainly have some questions for me, as I have for you. What did you feel, and what did you see, and what did you think after that terrible explosion? How come you didn't pass out, like I did from the "G"? How did you  manage to release us from the burning spin? Why didn't you answer me when we were parachuting down? Just look at what kind of guy you are; you save the crew that has passed out and then when its each to himself, and you have to help yourself, that's when you find time to pass out. You were most probably injured...

<P>  Together, the two of us will complete the puzzle, and then we'll go out and fly (in the Phantom, just this once, Tammy), a joy flight, relaxed with no targets to study, without bombs and missiles, without supplies of ammunition. And, of course the sky will be blue and deep, like it was then, and we'll fly north and south. I want to show you the new roads and interchanges and settlements,
<CENTER>
<P>  And finally, finally, we'll go back to the valley of Jezr'eel and we'll land...

<P>  And that's my greatest wish, Ron, to land with you"

Daddy Ron Arad!
</B></H2>
Since I was very little I congratulate you for your birthday on the radio.
<BR>I don't know you and can't celebrate it for you at home.
<BR>Today you are 38, and I am almost 11.
<BR>You are almost ten years not here.
<BR>I grew and you don't know me at all, nor I you.
<BR>Once I used to sing songs for you. Now I am big enough and I can tell you a few things.
<BR>I wanted you to know that I think about you and really hope that you will come back, have a happy birthday in the place were you are.
<BR>Even though you're a daddy of photographs, you are my daddy, and I hope once you can be a real daddy.
<BR>So the most important thing that you should know is that I didn't forget you and all of my family neither.

<P>Message from the former Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Herzl Bodinger to Ron Arad:
<P>"Hang in there, Ron, we're with you constantly. We remember you, think about you and are doing everything possible to reach you.
<P>We won't stop our efforts until we succeed in bringing you home. The entire Air Force is awaiting your return, and we are all sure that you are strong and believe in yourself. The search for you has never stopped, not even for a minute. So long as you are far away from us we'll go on searching for you, until we find you. There are certainly moments when you feel cut off and very lonely. Maybe you think that we aren't looking for you anymore. If you only knew how devoted we are to you, you would gain courage from that.
<P>Take care of yourself, Ron. Keep up your strength. Try and be as optimistic as possible. We're all concerned about you and are praying for your welfare."

<P>
<B>The speech made at the Memorial Service for Yitzhak Rabin by Batya Arad</B><P>
Ten years have passed since my son, Ron Arad, fell into captivity. Ten years of hope, pain and tears.<P>
Ten years in the course of which I stood face-to-face with you, Yitzhak Rabin, and you did not lower your gaze, and you told us the truth.<P>
There were times when I was very angry at you; but I also loved you very much. Because your eyes were so sad, so full of pain when you had no good news for us, as if Ron were your own son. I know that it takes lots and lots of courage to look a mother like me straight in the eye and tell me what you had to tell me.<P>
But with you, Yitzhak Rabin, we knew the truth. I was angry and I loved. It is no small matter to be angry at a person and to love him at the same time. Only if he is a relative, a son or a husband.<P>
I was angry with you, Itzhak, and I loved you, because you were part of the family.<P>
Sometimes I look at the television screen and wait for the next moment when you come out of the screen and Ron comes up to you and you shake his hand and say, "Ron, the family wasn't silent for a minute".<P>
Ron will yet come back to us. But you, Yitzhak, will not be there. And it is many times more difficult to go on waiting without you're being there with the pain reflected in your eyes, without the tenderness I felt beneath the rough shell, without your truthfulness... without you... Yitzhak.

<P><IMG SRC="/Images/ext-fam.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=137 WIDTH=249 HSPACE=4>During the first period of his imprisonment, when Ron Arad was in the hands of Amal, some indications were received that he was alive, but since the end of 1987 there has been no contact with him. As far as is known to the authorities in Israel, Ron Arad is alive and is being held prisoner by the Iranians. The Iranians have failed to acknowledge their responsibility and contraryy to international law, are preventing Ron Arad from receiving visits by the Red Cross and letters from his family, which is the norm in similar cases in civilized countries.

<P>All appeals to humanitarian and international organizations in an attempt to obtain information about Ron's condition and fate have failed. Attempts by the International Red Cross to meet with Ron or to establish some contact between him and his family have also been unsuccessful, despite the fact that every prisoner has the right to meet with representatives of the Red Cross and to correspond with his family.

<P>Bulgarians rejoiced in Sofia to celebrate the end of the Communist Party's grasp on power. Burmese opposition leader Aung San won the Nobel Peace Prize.  During the summer of 1990 Saddam Hussein invade Kuwait and the powers of the world massed armies on his borders.  Kevin Costner starred in Dances With Wolves whilce Joe Pesci played on of the GoodFellas.



<P>October 16, 1990 marked Ron's fifth year in captivity.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1991</H1>
<P>The year began with the US and it's allies invading Kuwait and pushing Iraq back to her borders while Israel came under attack by Iraqi SCUD missles. Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins kept the world in suspense in Silence of the Lambs. Sanctions are lifted as  South Africa rejoins the family of nations.


<P>October 16, 1991 marked Ron's sixth year in captivity.

<P>
<P><IMG SRC="/Images/tami.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=4>My name is Tami Arad and I was born on June 8, 1961. Since October 1986 I have been waiting for my husband to retum. I am raising our adorable daughter by myself, and we both sorely miss Ron every single day. We are confident that he wig find the strength to endure the very difficult conditions of his long imprisonment. Our faith in his strength gives us a lot
of comfort and it is important to us that Ron know that we are strong, but yearn for his immediate retuurn. There is, after all, nothing more unnatural than total separation, loneliness, the abrupt interruption of a young man's life. And that is what is happening to Ron and to me. I find this separation and the fact that he is not getting the elementary humane treatment that every prisoner is entitled to unbearable. This situation and not having had any letters for so long has led me to try every address, knock on every door, to try and get some sign of life, so that I can send letters and pictures to him and he can receive visits by the Red Cross, and most of all, so that he can return to his family that loves him and is waiting for him.

<P>All of us, his daughter, his mother and I, his wife, are fervently hoping for his swift return.

<h3>Your Choice of Coverage</h3>
<p>The Personal Prudent Buyer Classic Plans give you two options to choose from. Our innovative $20, $25, and $30 Co-Pay 
Plans combine access to the large Prudent Buyer Prefferred Provider Organization (PPO) Network with the advantage of 
NO CALENDAR YEAR DEDUCTIBLES in the Network.</p>
<p>Should you prefer a more traditional deductible plan, Blue Cross offers you the choice of either a $1,000 or a $2,000 
deductible plan that provides the same access to the Prudent Buyer PPO Network as the Co-Pay Plans.</p>
<h3>The Prudent Buyer Plan Network and How it Works </h3>
<p>Both the co-pay and deductible plans provide comprehensive major medical benefits for inpatient and outpatient physician 
servies. Blue Cross of California has negotiated discounted rates with a large number of physicians and health care providers 
in California. These providers make up the Prudent Buyer Plan Network.</p>
<p>Providers in this network give Blue Cross subscribers a discount for medical care. These discounted rates are often 20-40% 
less than the providers' usual billed fees.</p>
<p>When you choose a provider from the network, Blue Cross pays a higher percentage of the cost. The cost is lower to begin 
with because of the provider's Prudent Buyer Plan Discount Agreement, and, because the providers have agreed to accept 
this payment, your out-of-pocket expenses will be reduced by 20-40% as well.</p>
<p>There will be hospitals in the network that will require an additional $250 co-payment per admission. These will be hospitals 
that do not meet our Hospital Partnership program. The additional co-payment also will apply when an outpatient visit is 
related to surgery or infusion therapy.</p>
<h3>Out of Network</h3>
<p>If you choose a provider who is NOT part of the network (a non-participating provider), Blue Cross will still provide you with 
benefits, but will pay substantially less, and the bill itself will probably be substantially higher than with Network Participating 
Providers. You will be responsible for any balance due. <b>You will pay a significantly greater share of cost (out-of-pocket 
expense) when you use a non-participating (non-Prudent Buyer Plan Network) provider.</b></p>
<p><strong>Important Note About Non-Contracting Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>Blue Cross has contracts with most hospitals in California under an arrangement called a &quot;standard contract&quot;. There are a few 
hospitals that have neither a standard contract nor a Prudent Buyer Plan Network agreement. A hospital without any Blue 
Cross contract is considered &quot;non-contracting&quot;. <strong>Benefits will NOT be paid for services provided by a non-contracting 
hospital except in the case of a medical emergency.</strong></p>
<h3>Glossary of Terms You'll Need to Know</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Co-Payment</strong> is the amount due and payable by you, the member, to the provider of care </li>
<li><strong>Maximum Co-payment Limit</strong> is the total annual amount of out-of-pocket expense that you are responsible for before 
Blue Cross begins coverage at 100%. It's important to know that the in-network maximum co-pay limit is $2,500 for 
the $20 Co-Pay Plan, $3,000 for the $25 Co-Pay Plan, and $3,500 for the $30 Co-Pay Plan. When out of network 
providers are used, there is a separate out-of-pocket maximum of $3,000 for the $20 Plan, $3,500 for the $25 Plan, 
and $4,000 for the $30 Plan. You will still be responsible for any amount of the bill over the Limited Fee Schedule 
allowance for non-participating providers. </li>
<li><strong>Covered Expense</strong> is the expense you incur for medically necessary services and supplies listed in the benefit sections 
of the Service Agreement you will receive upon approval of your application. For some services, Covered Expense is 
limited to a maximum amount described in detail in the benefit sections of the agreement and in the benefit summary 
pages of this brochure. Covered Expense for non-participating providers is not more than the Limited Fee Schedule 
allowance. </li>
<li><strong>Deductible</strong> is the amount you must pay for Covered Expense before certain benefits are available to you. Your 
Service Agreement will state specifics regarding any applicable deductibles. </li>
<li><strong>Negotiated Fee Rate</strong> is the rate of payment negotiated by Blue Cross with Participating Network Providers under 
the Prudent Buyer Plan Participating Agreement for Covered Expense. </li>
<li><strong>Limited Fee Schedule</strong> is Blue Cross' listing of the maximum amounts allowed for certain specific services provided by 
non-participating providers. When services are recieved from non-participating providers only the applicable amount in 
the Limited Fee Schedule for that provider's services will be considered to be a Covered Expense. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>How the Co-Pay Plans Work*</h3>
<p>Generally, when you use providers who participate in the Network, for most services you are responsible for a percentage, 
depending on the plan you choose, of the Negotiated Fee Rate up to your maximum co-payment limit. You will pay 20% of 
the Negotiated Rate for hospitalization on the $20 Co-Pay Plan, 25% for hospitalization on the $25 Co-Pay Plan, or 30% for 
hospitalization on the $30 Co-Pay Plan, up to your maximum co-payment limit. Maternity coverage (for normal delivery and 
elective abortion) is subject to these hospital co-payments, plus a $1,000 co-payment per pregnancy. There is a 12-month 
temporary exclusion period applicable to this benefit for normal deliveries and elective abortions.</p>
<p>Should you go out-of-network, most services are subject to a $250 calendar year deductible ($20 Co-Pay Plan), $500 
calendar year deductible ($25 Co-Pay Plan) or a $1,000 calendar year deductible ($30 Co-Pay Plan). You then pay a 35% 
co-payment of the Limited Fee Schedule (please see Benefit Summary below) plus any charges over the Limited Fee 
Schedule allowance.</p>
<p><strong>There are, however, certain limited benefits for which specific dollar amounts are listed as the member's 
co-payment. These specific amounts are NOT applied to the maximum co-payment limit (see Benefit Summary 
below). Member responsibility is any amount in excess of the covered charges as stated.</strong></p>
<h3>How the Deductible Plans Work*</h3>
<p>After you've met your calendar year deductible (you choose either $1,000 or $2,000), the deductible plans pay 80% of the 
Negotiated Fee Rate for services rendered by Network physicians and hospitals up to your maximum co-payment limit. 
Covered services for non-network providers are paid at 70% of the Limited Fee Schedule.<br>
<strong>The member is responsible for any charges in excess of the Limited Fee Schedule.</strong></p>
<p>Maternity coverage (normal delivery and elective abortion) is provided, subject to a separate $1,000 deductible (in addition 
to the calendar year deductible) and a 12-month temporary exclusion period.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=2>*Certain services are subject to different co-payments, reimbursements, limitations and waiting periods. Refer to the benefit summary charts 
for more information. Please see the Plan Service Agreement for complete details, benefits, exclusions and limitations.</font><br>
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Utilization Review applicable to Co-Pay and Deductible Plans<br>
Utilization Review:</h3>
<p>This program provides you with valuable information about the medical necessity of services, helping you to avoid both 
unexpected out-of-pocket costs and unnecessary procedures.</p>
<p>An important aspect of this program is &quot;pre-service review&quot;. The following medical procedures must be reviewed for medical 
necessity through a pre-service review: All non-emergency inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facility stays, specified surgical 
procedures (see footnote below for list), all non-emergency outpatient surgeries at a hospital or ambulatory surgical center, all 
organ and tissue transplants, coronary bypass surgery, all infusion therapy and related services, Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(M.R.I.) and Computerized Axial Tomography (Cat Scan).</p>
<p>You are responsible for initiating pre-service review. Whenever pre-service review has not been performed for an admission 
to a hospital, skilled nursing facility or infusion therapy (in any setting), you will be required to pay an additional $250 
co-payment for that admission or therapy. This co-payment is in addition to any other co-payment or deductible specified by 
your Plan.</p>
<h3>Pre-service Authorization:</h3>
<p>In addition to pre-service review, organ and tissue transplants and coronary bypass surgery also require pre-service 
authorization. Your subscriber ID card will have instructions and telephone numbers for pre-service review and authorization.</p>

<h1 align=center>Personal Prudent Buyer<sup><font size=1>&#174;'</font></sup>Choice Plan</h1>
<h2 align=center>for Families and Individuals</h2>
<hr>
<h3 align=center><em>The Choice to make for the most health care coverage choices!</em></h3>
<p>Since 1937 Blue Cross of California has been the state's leading health care service company. We 
have earned a reputation for taking care of our members and protecting them from catastrophic 
medical bills. The Personal Prudent Buyer Choice Plan provides you with this protection plus these 
advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the powerful Prudent Buyer Plan Network. These health care professionals have 
contracted with Blue Cross and CaliforniaCare Health Plans to provide negotiated discount 
rates to Blue Cross subscribers. </li>
<li>Your choice of <em><strong>any</strong></em> licensed physician. Very few individual health plans offer this complete 
freedom of choice! You'll save out-of-pocket expense by using Prudent Buyer Plan Network 
providers, over 39,000 physicians statewide! </li>
<li>Your choice of <em><strong>any</strong></em> hospital that has a contract with Blue Cross. Although any hospital that has 
a contract with Blue Cross will be covered at contracting hospital benefits, you can experience 
significant savings by using one of the 325 hospitals statewide that have joined the Prudent 
Buyer Plan Network. </li>
<li>No claim forms to complete when using Network providers. </li>
<li>Up to $5,000,000 maximum protection. </li>
<li>Prudent Buyer Plan Check Up Center benefits.  </li>
<li>Maternity coverage (subject to additional $1,000 deductible and 12-month waiting period). </li>
<li>Stop Loss protection. When you have paid your yearly deductible PLUS $2,000 in 
co-insurance for covered expenses, CaliforniaCare Health Plans will pay 100% of covered 
expense within the remainder of the Year, but you will remain responsible for any charges in 
excess of covered expense. </li>
<li>Prescription drug coverage (separate $100 deductible). </li>
<li><a href="dipbbro.htm">Prudent Buyer PPO Dental</a> option (please refer to the Prudent Buyer PPO Dental Plan 
brochure for rates and specific benefits and limitations). </li>
<li>Dental Net HMO option (please refer to the Dental Net HMO brochure for rates and specific 
benefits and limitations). </li>
<li><a href="ilibro.htm">WellPoint Life Insurance Term Coverage</a> option. </li>
<li>Emergency care, including ambulance service. </li>

<h3>WellPoint Term Life Insurance Option</h3>
<p>If you are approved for <b>Level 1 medical coverage</b>, you and any covered dependents will also be eligible for 
WellPoint Life Insurance Term Coverage at an additional charge. Life insurance is available in $15,000, $30,000 or 
$50,000 amounts of coverage. Please complete Part 9 on page 6 of the application if you would like to apply for this 
benefit option. Rates are shown below.</p>
<p>Applicants under the age of 19 are eligible for the $15,000 and $30,000 amounts. If the $50,000 policy is selected by 
an approved applicant under age 19, only $30,000 of coverage will be issued. Applicants under the age of one year are 
not eligible for WellPoint Term Life coverage.</p>
<p>Term life insurance is attained age rated, which means the rates will change based upon the applicant's age and the age 
categories as shown on the chart below. The WellPoint Life Insurance Term policy is issued for a one-year term, 
renewable at the option of the policy holder; WellPoint Life may change the rate schedule at the beginning of any annual 
term.</p>
<p>The policy will be canceled automatically on the first of the month of the covered member's 65th birthday. If the 
member's birth date falls on the first of the month, the policy will be canceled on the first of the month prior to the birth 
month.</p>
<p>The term life insurance coverage is subject to the written provisions of the WellPoint Life Insurance Term Coverage 
policy&#134;. </p>
<p>Should you qualify for Level 1 medical coverage and you have applied for the term life option, each Level 1 covered 
member who has chosen term life will be sent a WellPoint Life Insurance Term policy. Please review it carefully for 
complete details of your renewable term life insurance coverage.</p>

<h2>Workers' Compensation UniCARE Integrated &quot;24 Hour&quot; 
Coverage</h2>
<p>Medical expenses are the largest component of Workers' Compensation costs. The Blue Cross of 
California family of companies and UniCARE have made a commitment to reduce these costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed care techniques such as medical case management, medical bill and utilization review 
have the potential of lowering Workers' Compensation costs and premium. </li>
<li>Personal nurse contact will help in early return to work and lower vocational rehabilitation 
costs. </li>
<li>The personal contact, managed medical care facilitation and early return to work emphasis will 
help reduce litigation and associated costs. </li>
<li>Access to Blue Cross of California family of companies' medical networks ensures heath care 
and cost effective rates while reducing unnecessary treatment and expense. </li>
<li>One insurance source for both medical and workers' compensation helps eliminate duplicate 
claim filings on the workers' compensation and group medical carriers. This helps reduce costs. </li>
<li>Ease of Administration. The compensation premium can be billed and paid with one check on 
the Blue Cross of California monthly group medical billing. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Obtain a UniCARE Integrated 24 Hour Workers' Comp Quote</h3>
<p>1. Meet with the business client and complete the BCC &quot;UniCARE Supplemental Workers' 
Compensation Coverage Addendum Application&quot;. This form may be found in the BCC &quot;24-Hour 
Coverage Program for Small Businesses&quot; brochure, form number WL 70 01. </p>
<p>When completing the above applications to obtain a Workers' Comp quote, be sure and provide all 
requested information (i.e., loss runs, experience modifications, etc.)</p>
<p><b>Always</b> provide the <b>name</b> and<b> group number</b> of the Blue Cross Small Group Medical case with 
which the UniCARE Integrated 24 Hour Workers' Comp is to be combined. If the Group is applying 
for the BCC Small Group Medical and UniCARE Workers' Comp at the same time, send<b> all</b> 
applications to your Area Small Group underwriter or General Agent.</p>
<p>2. Fax or mail the above completed application to UniCARE or a Blue Cross Small Group General 
Agent. Provide a copy of P &amp; C license or 24-Hour I.E.A. certification.</p>
<p>3. UniCARE underwriters will review and fax back to you or the Small Group General Agent, the 
UniCARE Integrated 24 Hour Workers' Comp proposal.</p>
<h3>How to Enroll the Workers' Comp Group</h3>
<p>Enrolling the group into UniCARE Workers' Comp is very easy. Just obtain a check for the amount of 
the Deposit Premium and mail it to UniCARE or the Small Group General Agent with a copy of the 
UniCARE proposal.</p>
<h3>Administrative Procedures</h3>
<p>1. When UniCARE processes the Workers' Comp group, UniCARE will mail the policy to the agent 
or Small Group General Agent for delivery to the client.</p>
<p>2. UniCARE will mail the Workers' Comp claims kit to the client and call the client to review claims 
procedures.</p>
<p>3. UniCARE has designed the program for minimum agent involvement once the group has purchased 
the Workers' Comp. This allows agents to use their time to develop new sales.</p>
<h3>UniCARE Basic Underwriting Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>New businesses will be considered </li>
<li>No groups with out-of-state employees </li>
<li>Most industries will be considered for 24-Hour Coverage </li>
<li>Premium deposit check in the exact amount quoted must be submitted when applying for 
coverage </li>
</ul>

<h2>Group Dental Coverage</h2>
<p>Employees may select either the Dental Net Plan (a dental HMO) or the Prudent Buyer Dental Plan.</p>
<p><b>The Prudent Buyer Dental Plan for Groups of 3-50 Employees</b> Coverage provided by WellPoint Life Insurance 
Company, administered by Blue Cross of California</p>
<p>Although you choose your dentist, it is to your benefit to choose a Prudent Buyer dentist. WellPoint Life and Blue Cross of 
California have negotiated discounted rates with a large number of dentists in California. These dentists make up the Prudent 
Buyer Plan dental network.</p>
<p>When you choose a dentist from the network, the cost is lower to begin with as a result of the dentist's Prudent Buyer 
Discount Agreement. Your out-of-pocket expenses will be significantly lower when you use a Paricipating Dentist.</p>

<h3>Making the system work for you, Personal CaliforniaCare.</h3>
<p>Underwritten by CaliforniaCare Health Plans, administered by Blue Cross of California.</p>
<p>Good health is a way of life in California. Because we know how important maintaining your health is 
to you, the Personal CaliforniaCare Plan was developed to help you stay well - and to give you the 
right level of care when you need it.</p>
<p>CaliforniaCare is a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan developed by Blue Cross of 
California and CaliforniaCare Health Plans to provide you with health care that won't cost you a lot of 
money. A Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, is a network of doctors and hospitals that 
have contracted with a health care services provider to offer its members comprehensive health care 
without the paperwork and expense of conventional health care plans. By contracting with physicians 
and hospitals we can provide you with comprehensive health care for a set fee, no matter how many 
times you visit your physician.</p>
<p>CaliforniaCare also offers you a choice in your HMO. The CaliforniaCare Plan offers all the 
comprehensive benefits of an HMO plan with no deductibles and low co-payments. CaliforniaCare 
Saver Plan offers the same outstanding benefits at a lower cost with a $1,500 annual deductible.</p>
<h3>Personal CaliforniaCare makes it easy . . .</h3>
<p>First, select a Participating Medical Group (PMG) or Independent Practice Association (IPA) for 
yourself and each covered family member. The PMG(s) and/or IPA(s) chosen must be within a 30 
mile radius of your home. Because of our extensive network of providers, there's a good chance you'll 
find one located nearby.</p>
<p>Next choose a Primary Care Physician from the PMG(s) or IPA(s) selected on your application. 
Covered family members may pick any physician within the PMG or IPA they have chosen. The 
Primary Care Physician will be the person to call first whenever medical care is needed - from routine 
visits to emergency situations. That's all there is to it! If you need specialized treatment, your Primary 
Care Physician coordinates the referral.</p>
<h3>And much more! </h3>
<p>Please see below for a brief summary of covered services. For some services there is no charge to the 
member and for other services there is a co-payment (the amount that is due and payable by the 
member to the PMG, IPA, hospital or other provider of care). Your co-payment is always 
pre-determined and stated in your Service Agreement.</p>
<p>The chart below is intended as a reference to help you decide whether or not Personal CaliforniaCare 
is right for you. All benefits are subject to the exclusions or limitations summarized later in this 
brochure and as described in full detail in your Service Agreement that you will receive from Blue 
Cross if you are accepted for coverage under this plan.</p>

the decision as to when each new illness or injury began. Services for rehabilitative care may be administered either concurrently or 
consecutively. <strong>Note:</strong> Additional professional rehabilitative services, requested by your Primary Care Physician, may be authorized, 
but only if your Medical Group decides that these services are Medically Necessary and likely to result in significant improvement to 
the member's condition. Your Medical Group will authorize a specific number of additional visits.</font></p>

If a member is admitted for an impatient stay directly from the hospital emergency room, the member's co-payment is waived.</font></p>
<p><font size=1><strong>Prescription Drug Coverage</strong><br>
WellPoint Pharmacy (an affiliate of CaliforniaCare Health Plans and a subsidiary of Blue Cross of California) has developed an 
outpatient drug formulary - a listing of drugs that the avaliable medical literature shows are clinically effective and safe while 
reasonable in cost. The goal of this formulary is to identify and promote the apropriate prescribing of pharmaceuticals that are both 
therapeutically appropriate and cost-effective choices. Non-formulary drugs may be obtained through your pharmacy, but are 
reimbursed based upon the guidelines shown above.</font></p>
<p><font size=1>This prescription drug plan covers Generic drugs <b>only</b>, unless a Generic equivalent does not exist, or if your Physician requests no 
substitutions.</font></p>
<p><font size=1>If the Drug Limited Fee Schedule is equal to, or less than, the co-payment listed above under &quot;Non-Participating Pharmacy&quot;, there 
will be no reimbursement.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><sup><font size=1>&#167;</font></sup><font size=1>There are hospitals that will require an additional $250 co-payment for admission. These are hospitals that do not meet all the 
criteria of our Hospital Partnership program, but are included in the network should the member choose to incur the additional 
co-payment. The additional co-payment also applies when an outpatient visit is related to surgery or infusion therapy.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=1><b>Payment will only be made for the number of visits and the medical care that is specifically authorized by your PMG 
or IPA. You are responsible for payment for services rendered that are not authorized by your PMG or IPA. It is 
important that you use the PMG you select upon enrollment for all your health care needs.</b></font></p>
<p><font size=1>This is a brief summary of benefits only. It is not a contract. All benefits referenced above are subject to any applicable exclusions 
and/or limitations in your Blue Cross Service Agreement and are contingent upon member eligibility at the time services are 
rendered.</font></p>

<p>6. If you have chosen the <a href="ilibro.htm">term life</a> option, DO NOT submit an initial premium payment for life 
coverage. If you and/or any dependents are approved for Level 1 coverage and you have selected the 
term life option, you will be billed for the appropriate life insurance premium payment.</p>
<p>7. If your enrollment is approved, you will receive information about Summary Billing (applicable to 
bi-monthly or quarterly billing) if you have applied for dental and/or term life options with your medical 
coverage. Summary Billing offers you the convenience of combining all of your Blue Cross accounts 
(medical/dental/life) onto one bill.</p>
<p>8. If you have selected monthly checking account deduction, the premium for all products selected, 
including dental and/or life, will be deducted from your checking account on the first of the month.</p>
<p>9. Please follow the instructions carefully on the first page of the application.</p>
<p>Your coverage begins only when your application has been approved by Personal CaliforniaCare 
underwriting and an effective date had been assigned. </p>
<h3>Review Your Coverage for 10 Days with No Obligation!</h3>
<p>Once your CaliforniaCare Service Agreement arrives, examine it carefully. If for any reason you are 
not satisfied, simply return the policy within ten days and your dues payment will be refunded in full.</p>

<h2>Other Facts About Personal CaliforniaCare</h2>
<h3>Individual Enrollment Applications</h3>
<p>An Individual or Family who applies for membership in the Personal CaliforniaCare plan must submit 
an Individual Enrollment Application that will be reviewed by CaliforniaCare Health Plans 
Underwriting. If the applicant does not qualify, based upon the underwriting standards, for the 
particular coverage applied for, enrollment will not be approved. But, if that happens, the applicant 
will be told about other coverages and/or programs for which he/she does qualify. Coverage may be 
provided by one or more companies affiliated with Blue Cross of California.</p>
<h3>End of Coverage </h3>
<p>Coverage under this plan remains in force as long as the required subscription charges are paid on 
time and as long as the member remains eligible for coverage. </p>
<p>Coverage stops when a member becomes ineligible because of age, Medicare eligibility, residency 
requirements, or divorce. In the case of Medicare eligibility, Blue Cross provides a variety of 
Medicare supplement plans; in the case of divorce, the member losing eligibility may request separate 
coverage. Blue Cross may also change or terminate coverage, including changing rates with 30 days 
prior written notice. However, Blue Cross does not change coverage or rates unless the change 
applies to all covered persons of the same class.</p>
<h3>Arbitration</h3>
<p>Any dispute between you and Blue Cross of California/CaliforniaCare Health Plans must be resolved 
by binding arbitration, if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims 
Court. Any such dispute will be resolved not by law or resort to court process, except as California 
law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Under this coverage, both you and Blue 
Cross of California/CaliforniaCare Health Plans are giving up the right to have any dispute decided in 
a court of law before a jury.</p>

<h1>Personal CaliforniaCare Rates</h1>
<h3>How to Determine Your Rates</h3>
<p>Identify the marital status and family category to which you belong as well as the county you reside in. 
Next, identify your age or your spouse's age (if younger) as of the date the application is signed. This 
will give you your corresponding monthly rate. Multiply the monthly rate by two if you have chosen 
bi-monthly billing and by three if you have chosen quarterly billing. Please note: There is a separate 
rating category for children only plans, age 0-18.</p>

routine check-ups, cleanings, fillings, crowns and dental surgery.</em></p>
<p>The Prudent Buyer Dental Plan was designed with two goals in mind. The first and foremost is to promote good dental 
hygiene and preventive care, recognized as important elements in a total health care package. The second goal is to 
provide you with the dental care you need in a convenient, cost-conscious manner, thus providing many dental services 
at reduced or no out of pocket cost.</p>
<p>The plan features Preventive and Diagnostic Care at little or not cost, low-cost Basic Care, and a benefit schedule that 
can help you offset the high cost of Major Care dental work. Please read the following information for details on how 
the plan works, specific benefit information and certain exclusions and limitations that apply.</p>
<p><font size=4><strong>HOW THE PRUDENT BUYER DENTAL PLAN WORKS</strong></font><br>
<strong>The Prudent Buyer Dental Plan Network</strong> is made up of a large number of dentists in California who have agreed to 
provide services at negotiated rates to Prudent Buyer Plan members. When you choose a Participating Plan dentist, you 
pay nothing for Preventive and Diagnostic Care, such as regular check-ups, cleanings and X-rays. Other benefits are 
provided for specified basic and major dental care (see Benefit Schedule below).</p>
<p>The Plan lets you know up front in flat dollar amounts how much the Plan pays for the covered services. This means 
that you are able to easily calculate how much you will have to pay once you have determinted your dentist's fee for the 
specific procedures listed.</p>
<p>It is to your benefit to use a Participating Plan dentist because Blue Cross of California and WellPoint Life Insurance 
Company have negotiated the amounts that Prudent Buyer Plan members are charged for services. You may choose a 
Non-participating dentists, and the Plan still provides benefits,<em> but your out of pocket expense may be greate</em>r as the 
negotiated fees do not apply to Non-participating providers. <em>You are responsible for any charges in excess of stated 
benefit</em>.</p>
<p>The Participating Plan Network is large, and your current dentist may already be part of the Network. So be sure to 
check the Prudent Buyer Dental directory before you choose a dentist. It could save you money.</p>
<p><strong>Calendar Year Deductible</strong> is the amount of out-of-pocket expense for which you are responsible before your 
benefits are available. The Calendar Year Deductible is $50 per person, with a maximum of 3 calendar deductibles per 
family (total $150). The deductible is waived for the Preventive and Diagnostice Care<em> only</em> at Participating Plan 
dentists.</p>
<p><strong>Calendar Year Maximum Benefit:</strong> All dental benefits are limited to a maximum payment by WellPoint Life of 
$1,000 for expense incurred by each enrolled member during a calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Wating Periods:</strong> There is no waiting period for Preventive and Diagnostic Care. Coverage for Basic Care begins after 
three continuous months and for Major Care after 12 continuous months of coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> WellPoint Life Insurance Company's professional Dedicated Customer Service Units are available 
to answer any questions you may have about your policy, and to assist you in your customer service needs. The 
toll-free number is listed on your Prudent Buyer Dental Plan identification card that you will receive once your 
enrollment is approved.</p>
<p><font size=4><strong>BENEFIT SCHEDULES</strong><br>
</font><b>Coverage is provide</b><em><b> only</b></em><b> for the services specified below.</b></p>
<p>To use the following schedules, first determine your dentist's fee, then look up how much the Plan pays. You can then 
easily calculate how much you will have to pay for the specific services after your deductible has been met (where 
applicable). The dollar amounts are maximums. The Plan pays either the specified amount, or the actual amount charged 
by your dentist, whichever is lower. <em>You are responsible for any charges in excess of stated benefit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Preventive &amp; Diagnostic Care</strong><br>
Coverage begins upon approval of your application. You are limited to two oral examinations and two dental cleanings 
per member, per year. The calendar year deductible is waived for these services<em> only</em> when rendered by a Participating 
Plan dentist.</p>

<h3>Your Choice of Coverage</h3>
<p>The Personal Prudent Buyer Classic Plans give you two options to choose from. Our innovative $20, $25, and $30 Co-Pay 
Plans combine access to the large Prudent Buyer Prefferred Provider Organization (PPO) Network with the advantage of 
NO CALENDAR YEAR DEDUCTIBLES in the Network.</p>
<p>Should you prefer a more traditional deductible plan, Blue Cross offers you the choice of either a $1,000 or a $2,000 
deductible plan that provides the same access to the Prudent Buyer PPO Network as the Co-Pay Plans.</p>
<h3>The Prudent Buyer Plan Network and How it Works </h3>
<p>Both the co-pay and deductible plans provide comprehensive major medical benefits for inpatient and outpatient physician 
servies. Blue Cross of California has negotiated discounted rates with a large number of physicians and health care providers 
in California. These providers make up the Prudent Buyer Plan Network.</p>
<p>Providers in this network give Blue Cross subscribers a discount for medical care. These discounted rates are often 20-40% 
less than the providers' usual billed fees.</p>
<p>When you choose a provider from the network, Blue Cross pays a higher percentage of the cost. The cost is lower to begin 
with because of the provider's Prudent Buyer Plan Discount Agreement, and, because the providers have agreed to accept 
this payment, your out-of-pocket expenses will be reduced by 20-40% as well.</p>
<p>There will be hospitals in the network that will require an additional $250 co-payment per admission. These will be hospitals 
that do not meet our Hospital Partnership program. The additional co-payment also will apply when an outpatient visit is 
related to surgery or infusion therapy.</p>
<h3>Out of Network</h3>
<p>If you choose a provider who is NOT part of the network (a non-participating provider), Blue Cross will still provide you with 
benefits, but will pay substantially less, and the bill itself will probably be substantially higher than with Network Participating 
Providers. You will be responsible for any balance due. <b>You will pay a significantly greater share of cost (out-of-pocket 
expense) when you use a non-participating (non-Prudent Buyer Plan Network) provider.</b></p>
<p><strong>Important Note About Non-Contracting Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>Blue Cross has contracts with most hospitals in California under an arrangement called a &quot;standard contract&quot;. There are a few 
hospitals that have neither a standard contract nor a Prudent Buyer Plan Network agreement. A hospital without any Blue 
Cross contract is considered &quot;non-contracting&quot;. <strong>Benefits will NOT be paid for services provided by a non-contracting 
hospital except in the case of a medical emergency.</strong></p>
<h3>Glossary of Terms You'll Need to Know</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Co-Payment</strong> is the amount due and payable by you, the member, to the provider of care </li>
<li><strong>Maximum Co-payment Limit</strong> is the total annual amount of out-of-pocket expense that you are responsible for before 
Blue Cross begins coverage at 100%. It's important to know that the in-network maximum co-pay limit is $2,500 for 
the $20 Co-Pay Plan, $3,000 for the $25 Co-Pay Plan, and $3,500 for the $30 Co-Pay Plan. When out of network 
providers are used, there is a separate out-of-pocket maximum of $3,000 for the $20 Plan, $3,500 for the $25 Plan, 
and $4,000 for the $30 Plan. You will still be responsible for any amount of the bill over the Limited Fee Schedule 
allowance for non-participating providers. </li>
<li><strong>Covered Expense</strong> is the expense you incur for medically necessary services and supplies listed in the benefit sections 
of the Service Agreement you will receive upon approval of your application. For some services, Covered Expense is 
limited to a maximum amount described in detail in the benefit sections of the agreement and in the benefit summary 
pages of this brochure. Covered Expense for non-participating providers is not more than the Limited Fee Schedule 
allowance. </li>
<li><strong>Deductible</strong> is the amount you must pay for Covered Expense before certain benefits are available to you. Your 
Service Agreement will state specifics regarding any applicable deductibles. </li>
<li><strong>Negotiated Fee Rate</strong> is the rate of payment negotiated by Blue Cross with Participating Network Providers under 
the Prudent Buyer Plan Participating Agreement for Covered Expense. </li>
<li><strong>Limited Fee Schedule</strong> is Blue Cross' listing of the maximum amounts allowed for certain specific services provided by 
non-participating providers. When services are recieved from non-participating providers only the applicable amount in 
the Limited Fee Schedule for that provider's services will be considered to be a Covered Expense. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>How the Co-Pay Plans Work*</h3>
<p>Generally, when you use providers who participate in the Network, for most services you are responsible for a percentage, 
depending on the plan you choose, of the Negotiated Fee Rate up to your maximum co-payment limit. You will pay 20% of 
the Negotiated Rate for hospitalization on the $20 Co-Pay Plan, 25% for hospitalization on the $25 Co-Pay Plan, or 30% for 
hospitalization on the $30 Co-Pay Plan, up to your maximum co-payment limit. Maternity coverage (for normal delivery and 
elective abortion) is subject to these hospital co-payments, plus a $1,000 co-payment per pregnancy. There is a 12-month 
temporary exclusion period applicable to this benefit for normal deliveries and elective abortions.</p>
<p>Should you go out-of-network, most services are subject to a $250 calendar year deductible ($20 Co-Pay Plan), $500 
calendar year deductible ($25 Co-Pay Plan) or a $1,000 calendar year deductible ($30 Co-Pay Plan). You then pay a 35% 
co-payment of the Limited Fee Schedule (please see Benefit Summary below) plus any charges over the Limited Fee 
Schedule allowance.</p>
<p><strong>There are, however, certain limited benefits for which specific dollar amounts are listed as the member's 
co-payment. These specific amounts are NOT applied to the maximum co-payment limit (see Benefit Summary 
below). Member responsibility is any amount in excess of the covered charges as stated.</strong></p>
<h3>How the Deductible Plans Work*</h3>
<p>After you've met your calendar year deductible (you choose either $1,000 or $2,000), the deductible plans pay 80% of the 
Negotiated Fee Rate for services rendered by Network physicians and hospitals up to your maximum co-payment limit. 
Covered services for non-network providers are paid at 70% of the Limited Fee Schedule.<br>
<strong>The member is responsible for any charges in excess of the Limited Fee Schedule.</strong></p>
<p>Maternity coverage (normal delivery and elective abortion) is provided, subject to a separate $1,000 deductible (in addition 
to the calendar year deductible) and a 12-month temporary exclusion period.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=2>*Certain services are subject to different co-payments, reimbursements, limitations and waiting periods. Refer to the benefit summary charts 
for more information. Please see the Plan Service Agreement for complete details, benefits, exclusions and limitations.</font><br>
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Utilization Review applicable to Co-Pay and Deductible Plans<br>
Utilization Review:</h3>
<p>This program provides you with valuable information about the medical necessity of services, helping you to avoid both 
unexpected out-of-pocket costs and unnecessary procedures.</p>
<p>An important aspect of this program is &quot;pre-service review&quot;. The following medical procedures must be reviewed for medical 
necessity through a pre-service review: All non-emergency inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facility stays, specified surgical 
procedures (see footnote below for list), all non-emergency outpatient surgeries at a hospital or ambulatory surgical center, all 
organ and tissue transplants, coronary bypass surgery, all infusion therapy and related services, Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(M.R.I.) and Computerized Axial Tomography (Cat Scan).</p>
<p>You are responsible for initiating pre-service review. Whenever pre-service review has not been performed for an admission 
to a hospital, skilled nursing facility or infusion therapy (in any setting), you will be required to pay an additional $250 
co-payment for that admission or therapy. This co-payment is in addition to any other co-payment or deductible specified by 
your Plan.</p>
<h3>Pre-service Authorization:</h3>
<p>In addition to pre-service review, organ and tissue transplants and coronary bypass surgery also require pre-service 
authorization. Your subscriber ID card will have instructions and telephone numbers for pre-service review and authorization.</p>

<h2 align=center>for Families and Individuals</h2>
<hr>
<h3 align=center><em>The Choice to make for the most health care coverage choices!</em></h3>
<p>Since 1937 Blue Cross of California has been the state's leading health care service company. We have earned a 
reputation for taking care of our members and protecting them from catastrophic medical bills. The Personal Prudent 
Buyer Choice Plan provides you with this protection plus these advantages: </p>
<ul>
Access to the powerful Prudent Buyer Plan Network. These health care professionals have contracted with Blue 
Cross and CaliforniaCare Health Plans to provide negotiated discount rates to Blue Cross subscribers. <li>Your choice of <em><strong>any</strong></em> licensed physician. Very few individual health plans offer this complete freedom of choice! 
You'll save out-of-pocket expense by using Prudent Buyer Plan Network providers, over 39,000 physicians 
statewide! </li>
<li>Your choice of <em><strong>any</strong></em> hospital that has a contract with Blue Cross. Although any hospital that has a contract with 
Blue Cross will be covered at contracting hospital benefits, you can experience significant savings by using one of 
the 325 hospitals statewide that have joined the Prudent Buyer Plan Network. </li>
<li>No claim forms to complete when using Network providers. </li>
<li>Up to $5,000,000 maximum protection. </li>
<li>Prudent Buyer Plan Check Up Center benefits.  </li>
<li>Maternity coverage (subject to additional $1,000 deductible and 12-month waiting period). </li>
<li>Stop Loss protection. When you have paid your yearly deductible PLUS $2,000 in co-insurance for covered 
expenses, CaliforniaCare Health Plans will pay 100% of covered expense within the remainder of the Year, but 
you will remain responsible for any charges in excess of covered expense. </li>
<li>Prescription drug coverage (separate $100 deductible). </li>
<li><a href="dipbbro.htm">Prudent Buyer PPO Dental</a> option (please refer to the Prudent Buyer PPO Dental Plan brochure for rates and 
specific benefits and limitations). </li>

<hr>
<p><font size=1><strong>Prescription Drug Coverage</strong><br>
Blue Cross has developed the Outpatient Prescription Drug Formulary, which is a listing of drugs for use by your Prudent Buyer Plan physician, that 
indicates clinically efective drugs that are reasonable in cost. The goal of the Formulary is to identify and promote the appropriate prescribing of 
pharmaceuticals that are therapeutically appropriate and cost-effective choices. The Formulary does not limit your drug benefit as described above. 
However, only Drug Formulary medications are available through the mail- order drug service. Your Prudent Buyer Plan physician has a copy of the Drug 
Formulary and can select a Formulary medication for your particular condition. Medications not listed on the Formulary may be obtained through your 
pharmacy, if it is presently covered by your Prudent Buyer Plan Benefit Agreement. </font></p>

<h1>How to Save Money by Using the Prudent Buyer Plan Network (PPO)</h1>
<h2>Choosing your physician:</h2>
<p>It is to your benefit to use a Prudent Buyer Plan physician or hospital. Blue Cross of California has negotiated discounted rates with a large number of physicians and health care 
providers in California. These providers make up the Prudent Buyer Plan Network.</p>
<p>Providers in this network give Blue Cross subscribers a discount for medical care. These discounted rates are often 30-40% less than the providers' usual billed fees.</p>
<p><b>Your doctor is probably already a member of the Prudent Buyer Plan network</b>. The Prudent Buyer Plan Network is comprised of 39,874 physicians and 326 hospitals in 
California.</p>
<h2>Choice:</h2>
<p>When you choose a provider from the network, Blue Cross pays a higher percentage of the cost. The cost is lower to begin with because of the provider's Prudent Buyer Plan Discount 
Agreement, and because the Providers have agreed to accept this payment, your out-of-pocket expenses will be reduced by 30-40%.</p>
<p>You also have the option of choosing physicians or hospitals (see note) which are not part of the network.</p>
<p>If you choose a provider who is NOT part of the network (a non-participating provider), Blue Cross will still provide you with benefits, but will pay substantially less, and the bill itself 
will probably be substantially higher than with Participating Providers. You will be responsible for any balance due because these providers have not accepted any discount arrangement. 
<b>Your out-of-pocket expenses will be a lot more when you use a non-participating provider.</b></p>
<h2>Simplicity:</h2>
<p>When you use a Prudent Buyer Provider, you have<b> no claim forms</b> to fill out!</p>
<p><b>You will pay a significantly greater share of cost when you use a non-participating (non-Prudent Buyer Plan) provider.</b> </p>
<h2>Choosing a Hospital</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b> Blue Cross contracts with most hospitals in California with an arrangement called a standard contract. However, a few hospitals have neither a standard contract nor a Prudent 
Buyer Plan agreement. A hospital without any Blue Cross contract is considered non-contracting.<b> Benefits will NOT be paid for services provided by a non-contracting hospital 
except in the case of a medical emergency.</b></p>
<h2>Prior Authorization:</h2>
<p>Utilization Review and Procedures provide you with valuable information about the medical necessity of services so that unexpected out-of-pocket costs and unnecessary procedures 
can be avoided. Only service we determine to be medically necessary can be covered.</p>
<p>All hospital (inpatient) stays, outpatient surgeries at a doctor's office or an ambulatory surgical center and organ and tissue transplants must be reviewed for medical necessity through a 
pre-service review. <b>To initiate a pre-service review, call 1-800-274-7767.</b></p>
<h2>Inpatient:</h2>
<p>You must obtain pre-service authorization for an inpatient stay in either a participating or a non-participating hospital. If authorization is not obtained or if you select a non-preferred 
hospital, you will be responsible for an additional $250 co-payment.</p>
<h2>Inpatient/Outpatient:</h2>
<p>The following procedures require a pre-service review: all inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facility stays; all infusion therapy and related services; all organ and tissue transplants; all 
coronay artery bypass sugery; MRI, CAT Scan, Bunionectomy, Septoplasty, Uterine Myomectomy, Hysterectomy and Pelvic Laproscopy. Member is responsible for initiating the 
pre-service review. Member must initiate the pre-service review three working days prior to the procedure to avoid an additional $50 co-payment for an unauthorized outpatient 
procedure and a $250 additional fee for hospital admissions not preauthorized by Blue Cross. Call 1-800-274-7767 to initiate your pre-service review.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This is only a brief summary of the benefits and limitations of your plan. This is not a contract. See your Evidence of Coverage and Disclosure Form for complete details. All benefits are 
subject applicable exclusions and limitations in your Evidence of Coverage and are contingent upon member eligibility at the time services are rendered.<br>
Note: Additional $250 fee for hospital admissions not pre-authorized by Blue Cross does not apply to the member's co-payment maximum. </p>
<h2>Notes for Prudent Buyer Classic Plans</h2>
<p><b>1. Calendar Year Co-payment:</b> Co-payment percentages apply to Covered Expense. Because non-participating providers may charge more than the Covered Expense, your total 
costs could exceed your co-payment. Participating Providers will not charge more than the amount Blue Cross recognizes as the Blue Cross Negotiated Fee. Covered Expense (as 
defined) for a non-participating hospital will not exceed the Limited Fee Schedule to a maximum of $540 per day, depending on the area. <b>Benefits will not be paid for services 
received from a non-contracting hospital, except in the case of medical emergency.</b></p>
<p>1A.<b>Co-Insurance Limit:</b> When member has satisfied calendar year co-payment maximum, Blue Cross will pay 100% of Covered Expense incurred within the remainder of the year. 
Member's annual out-of-pocket expense will be significantly higher with Non-Participating Providers. Non-participating physicians may bill amounts over the Limited Fee Schedule. The 
amounts over the Limited Fee Schedule are not considered Covered Expense and do not apply toward your co-insurance limit. Remember, Participating Physicians and providers have 
agreed to accept the Blue Cross discounted fee as payment in full.</p>
<p><b>Covered Expense</b> is the expense you incur for Covered Services (medically necessary services or supplies listed in your Evidence of Coverage), but not more than the maximum 
amounts stated in your Evidence of Coverage. For non-participating providers, the Covered Expense may be significantly lower than the provider's charges.</p>
<p><b>2. Blue Cross of California complies with Health and Safety Codes Section 1399.63 and Assembly Bills 1672 and 3655.</b></p>
<p><b>When a group is accepted and the Blue Cross coverage is replacing that of another carrier within 180 days,</b> all persons validly covered by the prior carrier and in a class of 
persoans eligible for coverage under the Blue Cross program will be covered without regard to &quot;actively at work&quot; or &quot;not hospital confined&quot; requirements. (See Enrollment Guideline 
Page).</p>
<p><b>For persons becoming covered as part of the take-over from the prior carrier:</b></p>
<p><b>a)</b> the time they were covered by the previous carrier will be credited toward the Blue Cross waiting period for coverage of pre-existing conditions;<b> b)</b> there will not be any co-insurance 
credit, nor will there be any credit for the prior carrier's prescription drug deductible.<b> c)</b> Blue Cross will not provide coverage for a condition causing one of such persons to be totally 
disabled as of the date of Blue Cross take over since benefits would be available for the continued treatment of such a totally disabling condition under the prior carrier's extension of 
benefits clause (required by California law).</p>
<p><b>3. The Blue Cross Negotiated Fee</b> is the rate of payment that Blue Cross has negotiated with the Participating Provider under a Prudent Buyer Participating Agreement for Covered 
Expense furnished to Prudent Buyer Plan Members. (<b>Please note:</b> Covered Expense for a non-participating provider is strictly limited and may leave the member with significant 
out-of-pocket expense).</p>
<p><b>4. The Limited Fee Schedule</b> is the maximum amount that Blue Cross Companies consider as Covered Expense when you receive care for treatment from a non-participating 
provider. The Limited Fee Schedule is subject to any applicable rates or level of payment contained in the Benefit section of your Prudent Buyer Policy.</p>
<p><b>5. Participating Hospitals</b> will require an additional $250 fee per admission. These hospitals do not meet all the criteria of our hospital partnership program, but are included in the 
network should you choose to incur the additional co-pay.</p>
<p><b>6. Non-Contracting Hospitals:</b> Benefits will NOT be paid for services provided by a non-contracting hospital except in the case of a medical emergency.</p>
<p><b>7. Physical/Occupational Therapy:</b> If Blue Cross determines that an additional period of rehabilitative care is both Medically Necessary and likely to result in significant improvement 
to the Member's physical impairment during that period of additional care, Blue Cross will authorize a specific number of additional visits. These additional visits will be covered only if 
they are authorized by Blue Cross in advance.</p>

<h1>Small Group CaliforniaCare <font size=2>&#174;'</font> HMO</h1>
<h3>Helping You to Stay Healthy</h3>
<p>CaliforniaCare provides you with convenience with minimal out-of-pocket expense. CaliforniaCare HMO coverage offers 
you and your employees personalized health care at a reasonable cost, very little paperwork and benefits that help your 
employees and their families stay healthy.</p>
<p>The CaliforniaCare HMO has more than 18,277 physicians and 306 participating hospitals statewide.</p>
<p>Members can each choose their own personal physician from any Participating Medical Group (PMG) or contracting 
Independent Physician Association (IPA). Employees can find a participating PMG or IPA located right in their community. In 
most cases, family members have the option of selecting providers from different IPAs or PMGs when enrolling.</p>
<p>These physicians are responsible for managing all of your employees' health care needs. They will provide medical care and 
refer members to specialists as needed. As with any HMO, all care must be provided or referred by your PMG/IPA except in 
the case of medical emergencies.</p>
<h3>How to Use CaliforniaCare HMO</h3>
<p><b>1. Using a Provider Directory:</b> When enrolling, choose a Primary Care Physician (PMG) from a Participating Medical 
Group or a contracting Independent Physician Association (IPA) in your area.</p>
<p>A <b>Participating Medical Group (PMG)</b> has different specialties under the same roof, often including laboratories and X-ray 
facilities. Each family member may select their own Primary Care Physician or IPA.</p>
<p>An <b>Independent Physician Associate (IPA)</b> is a physician who practices in his/her own private office. These physicians are 
part of a larger network comprised of many physicians. Each physician has his/her own code number in the directory. Each 
family member may select their own physician from within that network. Each family member must list their selected 
physician's code number on the application.</p>
<p><b>2. Call First:</b> When you need medical care, call your Primary Care Physician first and schedule an appointment before 
coming in.</p>
<p><b>3. Referrals:</b> To receive HMO benfits, you MUST get approval from your Primary Care Physician BEFORE you see any 
other health care providers.</p>
<p><b>4. In an emergency:</b> a) Call your Primary Care Physician. Follow your physician's advice. b)In extreme emergencies, call an 
ambulance or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. c) You MUST call your Medical Group or IPA within 48 hours 
of receiving initial emergency care. They will coordinate your follow-up care.</p>
<p><b>5. Never ignore a bill.</b> Should you receive a bill, make a copy for your records and send the original with a brief explanation 
to the CaliforniaCare coordinator at your PMG or IPA. Don't throw it away.</p>
<p><b>6. Ask the CaliforniaCare Coordinator:</b> The CaliforniaCare coordinator can help you coordinate payment if you receive a 
bill and answer your general questions.</p>
<p><b>7. Prudent Buyer and CaliforniaCare Hospitals:</b> In the future, there will be hospitals that will require an additional $250 
charge per admission. There will be hospitals that do not meet all of the criteria of our hospital partnership program, but are 
included in the network should you choose to incur the additional co-pay. We will notify you when this occurs.</p>

<p><em>This is a summary of the benefits and limitations of your plan. It is not a contract. All benefits 

are subject to applicable exclusions and/or limitations found in your Policy. </em><em><b>See your Policy for 

complete details.</b></em> </p>

<h2>Notes for Prudent Buyer Basic Hospital Plan</h2>

<p><b>1. Maximum Out of Pocket Expense: </b>When your co-payments for covered benefits from 

Participating Providers in a calendar year reach $2,000 (in addition to your $1,000 deductible), your 

plan will pay 100% of the Negotiated Fee incurred with Participating Providers (except for limited 

benefits for nervous and mental and skilled nursing facility) and 100% of the Covered Expense for 

non-participating providers for the remainder of that year.</p>

<p><b>Co-insurance:</b>Co-insurance is the percentage of Covered Expenses for which you are responsible 

after you have satisfied your deductible. The percentages listed are the percentages the plan pays. 

Non-participating providers may charge substantially more than the Covered Expense. Participating 

Providers are not permitted to charge more than the amount Blue Cross Companies recognize as the 

Negotiated Fee. Covered Expense payment, as defined for a non-participating provider, will not 

exceed the Limited Fee Schedule.</p>

<p><b>2. Replacement Coverage: Your plan complies with the Health and Safety Codes Section 

1399.63 and Assembly Bills 1672 and 3655.</b></p>

<p><b>When a group is accepted and this plan is replacing that of another carrier within 180 days</b>, 

all persons validly covered by the prior carrier and in a class of persons eligible for coverage under this 

plan will be covered without regard to &quot;actively at work&quot; or &quot;not hospital confined&quot; requirements;</p>

<p><b>For persons becoming covered as part of the take-over from the prior carrier: a)</b> the time they 

were covered by the previous carrier will be credited toward this plan's waiting period for coverage of 

pre-existing conditions; <b>b)</b> amounts credited toward the prior group carrier's medical deductible can be 

credited toward this plan's deductible, with documentation. There will not be any co-insurance credit 

<b>c)</b> This plan will not provide coverage for a condition causing one of such persons to be totally disable 

as of the date of this plan's take over since benefits would be available for the continued treatment of 

such a totally disabling condition under the prior carrier's extension of benefits clause (required by 

California law). For purposes of replacement health coverage under AB 1672, Blue Cross will pay 

secondarily for any person on disablility covered by the previous health plan for that disabling 

condition.</p>

<p><b>3. Negotiated Fee-</b> is the rate of payment that Blue Cross of California has negotiated with the 

Participating Provider under a Prudent Buyer Participating Agreement for Covered Expense furnished 

to persons insured under a Prudent Buyer Plan.</p>

<p><b>Covered Expense</b> is the amount that you incur for covered services which are Medically Necessary 

services or supplies which are listed in your policy. Covered Expense can be no more than the 

maximum amounts stated in your policy.</p>

<p><b>4. The Limited Fee Schedule</b> is the maximum amount that Blue Cross Companies consider as 

Covered Expense when you receive care for treatment from a non-participating provider. The Limited 

Fee Schedule is subject to any applicable rates or level of payment contained in the Benefit section of 

your Prudent Buyer Policy.</p>

<p><b>5. Non-Contracting Hospitals:</b> Benefits will NOT be paid for services provided by a 

non-contracting hospital except in the case of a medical emergency.</p>

<h2>Facts You Should Know About Your Plan</h2>

<p><b>Utilization Review</b></p>

<p><em>Utilization Review and Procedures provide members with valuable information about the 

medical necessity or services so that unexpected out-of-pocket costs and unnecessary 

procedures can be avoided.</em></p>

<p><b>Inpatient:</b> Member must obtain pre-service authorization for an inpatient stay in either a participating 

hospital or a non-participating hospital. If authorization is not obtained, member will be responsible for 

an additional $250 deductible.</p>

<p><b>Inpatient/Outpatient:</b> The following procedures require a pre-service review: all inpatient hospital 

stays; all infusion therapy and related services; all organ and tissue transplants; all coronary bypass 

surgery; MRI, CAT scan, Cystourethroscopy, Arthroscopy of the Knee, Bunionectomy, Septoplsty, 

Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Uterine Myomectomy, Hysterectomy and Pelvic Laproscopy. Member is 

responsible for initiating the pre-service review. Member must initiate the pre-service review three 

working days prior to the procedure to avoid an additional $50 co-payment for an unauthorized 

outpatient procedure and a $250 additional fee for hospital admissions not preauthorized by Blue 

Cross.</p>

<p><b>To initiate and pre-service authorization,</b> please call the Blue Cross Review Center at 

1-800-274-7767. The number is printed on your subscriber I.D. card for easy reference.</p>

<p><b>Prudent Buyer and CaliforniaCare Hospitals</b></p>

<p>In the future, there will be hospitals that will require an additional $250 charge per admission. These 

will be hospitals that do not meet all of the criteria of our hospital partnership program, but are 

included in the network should you choose to incur the additional co-pay. We will notify you when 

this occurs.</p>

<p><b>Authorization for Organ and Tissue Transplants</b></p>

<p>Organ and tissue transplants must be pre-authorized to determine if the transplants are medically 

necessary, not experimental, and if the facility is an approved, designated transplant center.</p>

<p><b>Extension of Benefits</b></p>

<p>Upon becoming disabled, a limited extension of benefits becomes availble if coverage terminates and 

the member is totally disabled. The extension covers only the totally disabling condition for a limited 

time.</p>

<p><b>Third Party Liability</b></p>

<p>If a member is injured, the reponsible party may be legally obligated to pay for medical expenses 

related to that injury. Blue Cross may recover benefits it has paid for those medical expenses, up to 

the amount paid by Blue Cross.</p>

<p><b>Loss Ratio</b></p>

<p>As required by law, we are advising you that Blue Cross of California's incurred loss ratio for 1994 

was 76.3 %. This loss ratio was calculated after provider disounts were applied. The provider 

discounts on an aggregate exceeded 20% of billed charges.</p>

<p><b>Arbitration</b></p>

<p>Any dispute between you and (Blue Cross of California/CaliforniaCare Health Care Plans/WellPoint 

Life) must be resolved by binding arbitration, if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limit of 

the Small Claims Court, not by lawsuit or resort to court process, except as California law provides 

for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Under this coverage, both you and Blue Cross of 

California/CaliforniaCare Health Care Plans/WellPoint Life are giving up the right to have any dispute 

decided in a court of law before a jury.</p>

Medicare SELECT II PLUS</h1>
<h3 align=center><em>A Sweeping New Approach to Medicare Supplemental Coverage</em></h3>
<hr>
<h3>Medicare and Blue Cross - Both Sides of the Story</h3>
<p>When it comes to Medicare, it's important that you know both sides of the story, the advantages and disadvantages of 
relying only on Medicare to provide for your health care needs.</p>
<p>This is clearly stated in &quot;The Medicare 1994 Handbook&quot; published by the Health Care Financing Administration 
(HCFA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: &quot;Medicare pays for many of your health care 
expenses, but <em>it does not cover all of them.</em> It is important for you to know what Medicare does and does not pay 
for.&quot; It also says: &quot;There are new options for buying insurance benefits that supplement Medicare's coverage, known as 
'Medigap' policies.&quot; In addition, the &quot;1995 Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare,&quot; developed jointly by 
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and HCFA, makes reference to a new Medicare 
supplement health insurance product called &quot;Medicare SELECT.&quot;</p>
<p>How does this affect <em>you?</em> - Before Medicare will pay for any of the medical services you want or need, you must first 
pay the Medicare deductibles. When combined with the Medicare coinsurance you are also required to pay, you could 
be out hundreds, even thousands of dollars after any benefits are paid by Medicare! These are bills <em>you</em> are expected to 
pay.</p>
<p>Our ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II</strong> and ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II PLUS</strong> plans can help pay the bills that 
Medicare doesn't and provide you with protection from the ever-increasing gaps in Medicare. </p>
<h3>The Advantages are <em>Yours</em> With ClaimFree Medicare SELECT II and ClaimFree 
Medicare SELECT II PLUS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only a <strong>$5 co-pay for office visits</strong> to any Prudent Buyer Physician. The same advantage of an HMO - without 
the &quot;gatekeeper&quot; role. </li>
<li><strong>Freedom to use the doctor of your choice</strong> from nearly 40,000 Prudent Buyer Physicians, <strong>including 
specialists.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Eliminates out-of-pocket costs for the Medicare Part A $716 deductible </strong>when you use a Participating 
Medicare SELECT Hospital; or if you are admitted as an inpatient immediately following an emergency room 
visit for medical emergency at any hospital, anywhere in the U.S. </li>
<li><strong>Pays the Medicare Part B $100 annual deductible</strong> when you use Participating Prudent Buyer Providers. </li>
<li><strong>Benefits for Medicare Part B coinsurance</strong>, no matter which provider you choose. </li>
<li><strong>No cost to you for Medicare Part B excess charges</strong> when you use a Participating Prudent Buyer Physician, 
or any doctor who accepts Medicare assignment. </li>
<li><strong>Full conventional Medicare benefits at all providers</strong>, inside and outside the state - anywhere in the U.S. </li>
<li>A <strong>prescription drugs benefit</strong>, including convenient mail order, is available with ClaimFree <strong>Medicare 
SELECT II PLUS. </strong></li>
<li><strong>You get to keep your Medicare card </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> your right to basic Medicare benefits too!</strong> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Freedom of Choice</h3>
<p>You've earned the right to have a choice of the doctor or hospital you want to use, and we respect that right. Our 
ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II</strong> and ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II PLUS</strong> plans offer you access to the 
Prudent Buyer network, as well as any Medicare-participating physician and any Medicare-approved hospital in the 
state. You are covered whether or not you use a Prudent Buyer Physician, but you may pay more out-of-pocket if you 
go to a non Prudent Buyer physician. </p>
<h3>Prudent Buyer<sup><font size=1>&#174;' </font></sup>Network of Participating Doctors</h3>
<p>The Prudent Buyer network offers you the choice of a wide variety of physicians conveniently located throughout the 
state to help you with all of your health care needs. Since approximately 40,000 physicians are Participating Prudent 
Buyer Providers, ther's a good chance that your current physician is already a member of our network.</p>
<p>This is the largest network in the state, with over one half of all physicians in California being Prudent Buyer 
Participating Providers. In fact, Blue Cross of California members saved in excess of 1 billion dollars in 1994 as a result 
of the Prudent Buyer network discounts for hospital and physician bills. </p>
<h3>Medicare Select Participating Hospitals</h3>
<p>In addition to the above, as an extra benefit to you, there is a network of Medicare SELECT Participating Hospitals 
throughout the state that <em>have agreed to waive the Medicare Part A deductible</em> when Medicare SELECT members 
are hospitalized in these facilities. </p>
<h3>Protection Against Excess Charges</h3>
<p>Under Part B of Medicare, you could have &quot;out-of-pocket costs if your physician or medical supplier does not accept 
assignment of your Medicare claim and charges more than Medicare's approved amount. The difference to be paid is 
called the 'excess charge.'&quot;*</p>
<p>However, ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II</strong> and ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II PLUS</strong> can save you the expense 
and worry about paying significant out-of-pocket costs because of gaps in Medicare. When you utilize the services of a 
Participating Physician, you are protected against excess charges. All you pay is a $5 co-pay for office visits. </p>
<h3>ClaimFree Service</h3>
<p>You may never have to fill out another claim form ever again. Blue Cross of California has created a way to put an end 
to the frustration caused by burdensome and tedious claim forms. It's called ClaimFree service, and we are the only 
health carrier in the state that provides you with this worry-free automatic claims payment service for both parts A and 
B of Medicare.</p>
<p>The way it works is simple. When providers bill Medicare, a computerized display of the information is automatically 
sent to Blue Cross of California for Processing. We then pay your doctor or hospital directly. This results in your 
medical bills being processed faster and more accurately. </p>
<h3>In Network Versus Out of Network Services</h3>
<p>When you receive services from a Participating Prudent Buyer Physician, Pharmacy or other medical supplier, or 
participating medicare SELECT Hospital, this is referred to as &quot;In Network,&quot; and you receive additional benefits as 
specified in the Outline of Coverage that follows.</p>
<p>When you receive services from any other physician, hospital, pharmacy or medical supplier that is not a member of the 
Prudent Buyer network, this is referred to as &quot;Out of Network.&quot;</p>
<p>Please note that there are financial and other advantages to making use of In Network services available to you through 
the Prudent Buyer network. But remember, the decision to use or not use In Network services is up to you, so you're 
not locked in. </p>
<h3>Provider Directories</h3>
<p>You will receive a directory listing the Participating Providers in your area when you sign up for your Prudent Buyer 
Plan. </p>
<h3>Affordable Medicare SELECT Plans</h3>
<p>CaliforniaCare Health Plans/Blue Cross of California products are designed to meet the health coverage needs of 
people who are enrolled in both Parts A and B of Medicare. </p>
<h3>ClaimFree Medicare SELECT II and <br>
ClaimFree Medicare SELECT II PLUS<br>

<h3>Prescription Drugs Benefit with<br>
ClaimFree Medicare SELECT II PLUS</h3>
<p>Outpatient drugs needed to treat serious illness often add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars annually. <em>Medicare 
does not cover any outpatient prescription drug costs.</em></p>
<p>ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II PLUS</strong> can save you money by offering coverage to help pay for prescription drugs, 
through a Participating Pharmacy and/or mail order, at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Many prescription drugs are available in generic form, which is more cost-effective for you. By law, generic drugs and 
brand name drugs must meet the same standards for safety, purity, strength and quality. </p>
<h3>Benefits When You Use A Participating Pharmacy</h3>
<p>When you use a Participating Pharmacy (more than 80% of all California pharmacies), you simply show the pharmacist 
your personal Blue Cross of California Prescription Drug Card. You have no claim forms to fill out. Pleas see the 
Co-payment Schedule chart. </p>
<h3>Mail Order Program</h3>
<p>If you wish, you may choose to order maintenance prescriptions through our convenient Mail Order Program. Please 
see the Co-payment Schedule chart below. Note: The Mail Order Program is limited to certain drugs, generally the 
Blue Cross of California drug formulary. The list of available drugs is subject to change from time to time without prior 
notification. </p>

<p><font size=1>*After a combined $250 yearly prescription drug decuctible, you pay only 50% of a discounted rate for each prescription and/or refill (up to 60-day 
supply). There is a combined yearly maximum of $3,000 for prescription drugs.</font> </p>
<h3>Nonparticipating Pharmacy</h3>
<p>When using a Nonparticipating Pharmacy, you will be responsible for the payment in full for each prescription at the 
time the prescription is filled. There are no benefits or reimbursements when you use a Nonparticipating Pharmacy. </p>

<h2>Outline of Medicare Supplement Coverage and Premium Information</h2>
<p>Use this outline to compare benefits and premiums among policies. </p>
<p>Medicare supplement coverage/policies of this category are designed to supplement Medicare by covering some 
hospital, medical and surgical services that are partially covered by Medicare. Coverage is provided for hospital 
inpatient charges and some physicians' charges, subject to any deductibles and coinsurance provisions which may be in 
addition to those provided by Medicare, and subject to other limitations which may be set forth in the policy. </p>
<h3>Policy Replacement</h3>
<p>If you are replacing other health coverage, do NOT cancel it until you have actually received your new contract and are 
sure you want to keep it. </p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This contract may not fully cover all of your medical costs. Neither CaliforniaCare Health Plans/Blue Cross of California 
nor its agents are connected with Medicare.</p>
<p>This outline of coverage does not give all the details of Medicare coverage. Contact your local Social Security office or 
consult &quot;The Medicare Handbook&quot; for further details and limitations applicable to Medicare. </p>

California. You will receive your CaliforniaCare Health Plans/Blue Cross of California Agreement once you enroll. It is 
important that you READ YOUR AGREEMENT CAREFULLY upon receiving it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Before enrolling in ClaimFree <strong>Medicare SELECT II</strong> or ClaimFree<strong>Medicare SELECT II PLUS</strong>, 
please call customer service, toll-free at <strong>1-800-333-3883</strong> to find out if there is a Participating 
Medicare SELECT Hospital in your service area. These plans are intended only for people age 65 or 
older, who are enrolled in both Parts A and B of Medicare.</p>
<h3>Member Billing</h3>
<p>Premiums will be billed to you by one of the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you enroll between the 1st and 14th of the month, your coverage will be effective on the 15th 
of the month. The first premium bill you will receive will be for one-and-a-half (1&#189;) months. 
Thereafter, Blue Cross of California will bill you every two (2) months. </li>
<li>If you enroll between the 15th and 31st of the month, your coverage will begin on the 1st of the 
following month. Blue Cross of California will bill you bimonthly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your coverage is effective the 1st or 15th of the month after approval, unless otherwise requested.</p>
<p>If you are replacing another Medicare supplement policy, your coverage will be effective the date that 
your other plan ends.</p>
<p>Blue Cross of California reserves the right to reject your application. If your application is rejected, 
you will be notified in writing and any payment will be refunded. </p>
<h3>Monthly Checking Account Deduction</h3>
<p>With the Blue Cross of California Monthly Checking Account Deduction Program, you can have your 
monthly Blue Cross dues withdrawn directly from your checking account on the sixth (6th) day of 
each month. When you receive your bank statement and cleared checks, your Blue Cross of 
California monthly checking account deduction will be included.</p>
<h3>Convenience of Summary Billing</h3>
<p>Summary Billing offers you the convenience of consolidating your billing with any other Blue Cross of 
California <em>senior plan member,</em> such as a spouse or relative. This means that we can combine 
separate billings onto a single statement, even if you and the other person(s) are enrolled in different 
Blue Cross of California <em>senior plans.</em></p>
<p>The result is less paperwork for you because one statement, one check and one envelope does the 
job. Summary Billing is also available if you choose the monthly checking account deduction option. </p>
<h3>Guaranteed Renewable</h3>
<p>Blue Cross of California Medicare supplements are guaranteed renewable.</p>
<p>After the first one (1) month's payment, the term of this coverage is for two (2) months, if you have 
chosen bimonthly coverage, or monthly, if you have chosen monthly checking account deduction. It 
renews automatically, subject to the right of Clue Cross of California to change subscription charges. 
Any such changes would be made only upon 30 days written notice to all persons covered under the 
same plan as you.</p>
<p>We will not cancel your coverage, except for the reasons listed below; </p>
<ul>
<li>If we discover any concealment of material facts upon enrollment </li>
<li>If you do not pay your subscription charges, your coverage will end automatically without 
notice from us </li>
<li>You cease to be covered under both Parts A and B of Medicare </li>
<li>You enroll in a Medicare Coordinated Care Plan </li>
</ul>
<p>A Coordinated Care Plan (also sometimes referred to as a Medicare-at-Risk Plan) are special Health 
maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Competitive Medical Plans (CMPs) that seniors eligible for 
Medicare may be able to join. They essentially combine Medicare benefits with supplemental benefits. 
People who join must generally get all health care from providers affiliated with the plan, and they do 
not receive regular medicare benefits for services obtained outside the plan. </p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>In accordance with California law, Blue Cross continuously reviews the quality of care provided to 
you under this contract. Under Blue Cross' quality of care review system, Participating Providers are 
credentialled regularly, and the quality of the care they provide is reviewed on both a concurrent and 
prospective basis. Because members may obtain care from any Nonparticipating Provider they 
choose, Blue Cross is unable to review the credentials of such Nonparticipating Providers or to 
include tham in prospective and concurrent review programs. nevertheless, Ble Cross review the 
services provided by all providers, both participating and nonparticipating retrospectively. </p>
<h3>30-Day Right To Examine</h3>
<p>If you're not satisfied with your coverage, for whatever reason, just send back your Policy within 30 
days of receiving it. The insurance will be canceled and your premium will be promptly refunded - no 
questions asked. What could be safer than that? </p>
<h3>Medicare Changes</h3>
<p>Blue Cross of California will send an annual notice to you 30 days prior to the effective date of 
Medicare changes, which will describe these changes and the changes in your Medicare supplement 
coverage. </p>
<h3>Guaranteed Acceptance</h3>
<p>Acceptance of your application is guaranteed if you are 65 or older and apply within six (6) months of 
your initial enrollment in Part B of Medicare. You must already be enrolled in both Parts A and B of 
Medicare to apply for this plan. Acceptance for this coverage is also guaranteed if you are transferring 
from certain Blue Cross of California non-Medicare supplement plans, and preexisting conditions will 
be waived. </p>
<h3>Complete Answers Are Very Important</h3>
<p>When you fill out the application for the new contract, be sure to answer truthfully and completely all 
questions about your medical and health history. The company may cancel your contract and refuse to 
pay any claims if you leave out or falsify important medical information; this would not apply if you are 
in your guaranteed acceptance period described above. Review the application carefully before you 
sign it. Be certain that all information has been properly recorded. </p>

<h3 align=center><em>The Plans of Choice for Medicare Supplemental Coverage</em> </h3>
<hr>
<h3>Medicare and Blue Cross - Both Sides of the Story</h3>
<p>When it comes to Medicare, it's important that you know both sides of the story, the advantages and disadvantages of relying only on Medicare to provide for your health care needs.</p>
<p>This is clearly stated in &quot;The medicare 1994 Handbook&quot; published by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: 
&quot;Medicare pays for many of your health care expenses, but <em>it does not cover all of them.</em> It is important for you to know what Medicare does and does not pay for.&quot; It also says: 
&quot;There are new options for buying insurance benefits that supplement Medicare's coverage, known as 'Medigap' policies.&quot; In addition, the &quot;1995 Guide to Health Insurance for People 
with Medicare,&quot; developed jointly by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and HCFA, makes reference to a new Medicare supplement health insurance 
product called &quot;Medicare SELECT.&quot;</p>
<p>How does this affect <em>you?</em> - Before Medicare will pay for any of the medical services you want or need, you must first pay the Medicare deductibles. When combined with medicare 
coinsurance you are also required to pay, you could be out hundreds, even thousands of dollars after any benefits are paid by Medicare! These are bills <em>you</em> are expected to pay.</p>
<p>Our ClaimFree Standard Plan A, ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Plan</strong> and ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan</strong> can help pay the bills that Medicare doesn't and provide you with 
protection from the ever-increasing gaps in Medicare. Plus, you receive the following benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>Affordable Medicare supplement and Medicare SELECT plans. </li>
<li>Your right to use the doctor of your choice from nearly 40,000 Participating Prudent Buyer Physicians (and more than 300 Participating Hospitals); or, if you prefer, you may see 
any doctor accepting Medicare patients. </li>
<li>Guaranteed renewable. </li>
<li>No annual maximums for Medicare-covered services. </li>
<li>Virtually no claim forms or confusing paperwork to fill out. </li>
<li>Accurate and speedy claim payments usually made in less than a week. </li>
<li>No waiting period for preexisting conditions. </li>
<li>A prescription drugs benefit, including convenient mail order, is available with the ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan.</strong> </li>
<li>Toll-free dedicated customer service phone number: <strong>1-800-333-3883.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Freedom of Choice</h3>
<p>You've earned the right to have a choice of the doctor or hospital you want to use, and we respect that right. Our ClaimFree Standard Plan A, ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Plan</strong> and 
ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan</strong> offer you access to the Prudent Buyer network, as well as any Medicare-participating physician and any Medicare-approved hospital in the 
state. You are covered whether or not you use a Prudent Buyer Physician, but you may pay more out-of-pocket if you go to a non Prudent Buyer physician.</p>
<h3>Prudent Buyer Network of Participating Doctors and Hospitals</h3>
<p>Th Prudent Buyer network offers you the choice of a wide variety of physicians and hospitals conveniently located throughout the state to help you with all of your health care needs. 
Since nearly 40,000 physicians and more than 300 hospitals are Participating Prudent Buyer Providers, there's a good chance that your current physician or hospital is already a member 
of our network.</p>
<p>This is the largest network in the state, with over one half of all physicians and hospitals in California being Participating Prudent Buyer Providers. In fact, Blue Cross of California 
members saved in excess of 1 billion dollars in 1994 as a result of the Prudent Buyer network discounts for hospital and physician bills. </p>
<h3>Protection Against Excess Charges</h3>
<p>Under Part B of Medicare, you could have &quot;out-of-pocket costs if your physician or medical supplier does not accept assignment of your Medicare claim and charges more than 
Medicare's approved amount. The difference to be paid is called the 'excess charge.'&quot;*</p>
<p>However, ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Plan</strong> and ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan</strong> can save you the expense and worry about paying significant out-of-pocket costs because 
of gaps in medicare. When you utilize Blue Cross of California's Prudent Buyer network, your doctor's charges for Medicare's covered services are <em>paid in full, including the 
Medicare Part B $100 deductible.</em> Even if you receive medical services from a provider that is not a member of the Prudent Buyer network, your doctor's charges for Medicare's 
covered services are <em>still paid in full,</em> except for the Medicare Part B $100 deductible. </p>
<h3>ClaimFree Service</h3>
<p>You may never have to fill out another claim form ever again. Blue Cross of California has created a way to put an end to the frustration caused by burdensome and tedious claim forms. 
It's called ClaimFree service, and we are the only health carrier in the state that provides you with this worry free automatic claims payment service for both Parts A and B of Medicare.</p>
<p>The way it works is simple. When providers bill Medicare, a computerized display of the information is automatically sent to Blue Cross of California for processing. We then pay your 
doctor or hospital directly. This results in your medical bills being processed faster and more accurately. </p>
<h3>In Network Versus Out of Network Services</h3>
<p>When you receive services from a Participating Physician, Hospital, Pharmacy or other medical supplier that is a member of the Prudent Buyer network, this is referred to as &quot;In 
Network.&quot;</p>
<p>When you receive services from any other physician, hospital, pharmacy or medical supplier that is not a member of the Prudent Buyer network, this is referred to as &quot;Out of Network.&quot;</p>
<p>Please note that there are financial and other advantages to making use of In Network services available to you through the Prudent Buyer network. But remember, the decision to use 
or not use In Network services is up to you, so you're not locked in. </p>
<h3>Provider Directories</h3>
<p>You will receive a directory listing the Participating Providers in your area when you sign up for your Prudent Buyer Plan. </p>

<h2>Facts About Your Personal Prudent Buyer Plan</h2>
<h3>Balanced Risk Keeps Your Costs Low</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Review Your Coverage for Ten Days-No Obligation!</strong><br>
Once your Service Agreement arrives, you'll have ten full days to examine and either accept or decline 
by returning your Agreement.</p>
<p>Fairness is the philosophy behind the Personal Prudent Buyer Plans. We believe that the cost of 
covering the expenses of someone with minimal health care needs should not be unfairly offset by 
someone whose health can be predicted to require costly care</p>
<p>The Personal Prudent Buyer Plans offer a solution. The Plans reduce the cost of your coverage by 
making sure that a &quot;risk balance&quot; is maintained. The balance is achieved like this:</p>
<p><strong>1. Individual Enrollment Applications</strong><br>
Each Individual or Family who applies for membership in our Personal Prudent Buyer Plans must 
submit an Individual Enrollment Application that will be reviewed by Blue Cross of California Medical 
Underwriting. If the applicant does not qualify, based on Blue Cross of California underwriting 
standards, for the particular coverage applied for, enrollment will not be approved. But, if that 
happens, the applicant will be told about other coverages and/or programs for which he/she does 
qualify. Coverage may be provided by one or more companies affiliated with Blue Cross of California.</p>
<p>Certain conditions, subject to the Blue Cross of California Companies underwriting guidelines, may 
qualify the applicant for some Level 1 Classic and Basic Plans at a premium that is 20% higher than the 
standard premium. This option may be given rather than moving the applicant to Level 2 or Level 3 
eligibility. Please consult your Blue Cross Companies agent.</p>
<p><strong>2. Waiting Periods/Temporary Exclusions</strong><br>
<strong>a)</strong> There is a specific six-month waiting period before individuals are covered for treatment of any 
condition, disease or ailment for which medical advice or treatment was recommended or received 
within six months preceding the effective date of the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> A member must be enrolled for 12 consecutive months before being eligible for benefits for removal 
or treatment of hernia, hemorrhoids, nasal surgeries, foot and toe surgeries, breast reductions, back 
surgery (laminectomy or diskectomy), blepharoplasty, sterilization (including tubal ligations and 
vasectomy) and hysterectomy (except in case of malignancy).</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> A member must be enrolled for 12 consecutive months before any benefits are payable for 
substance abuse (such as alcohol or drug dependency).</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> A member must be enrolled for 12 consecutive months to be eligible for normal maternity benefits 
or elective abortion benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction of Pre-existing Conditions Waiting Period</strong><br>
The Blue Cross of California Companies provide prior coverage credit toward the pre-existing 
conditions waiting period for those applicants who apply for coverage within 30 days of termination of 
qualifying prior coverage, as prescribed by law. The member is given credit toward the pre-existing 
condition waiting period for the time enrolled on the previous plan. There is no reduction of the 
exclusion period for conditions listed in paragraphs b,c,d, above.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Maximum Deductibles per Family (Classic &amp; Basic Deductible Plans)</strong><br>
Basic Plan - 3 Deductible Maximum<br>
Classic Plans 1000 &amp; 2000 - 2 Deductible Maximum<br>
The first 3 members (Basic Plan) or 2 members (Classic 1000 &amp; 2000) of the family to satisfy the 
Deductible in full will satisfy the entire family Deductible for the remainder of the Calendar Year.<br>
Please see the specific plan Agreement for full details regarding meeting deductibles.</p>
<h3>Maximum Co-Payment (Stop Loss) Protection</h3>
<p><br>
Benefit payments based on use of Prudent Buyer Plan physicians or hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Co-payment (Stop Loss) Protection (Applicable to Classic &amp; Basic Deductible 
Plans)</strong><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>You Pay</b><br>
Your Co-payment until $2,000 is paid + DEDUCTIBLE </p>
<hr>
<p><b>Blue Cross Pays</b><br>
80% until $8,000 is paid, 100% for the remainder of that calendar year)</p>
<hr>
<p>In any Year, after you've met your deductible, Blue Cross pays 80%* of your covered medical 
expenses (or 70% of covered expense billed up to the limited fee schedule for non-Prudent Buyer Plan 
providers) until your maximum co-payment amount is reached. When Blue Cross payments for 
covered services reach $8,000, Blue Cross will pay 100% of covered expenses incurred within the 
remainder of the year. Non-Prudent Buyer Plan providers may bill amounts over the limited fee 
schedule. The amounts over the limited fee schedule are not considered covered expenses and do not 
apply toward your maximum co-payment amount. Remember, Prudent Buyer Plan providers have 
agreed to accept the Blue Cross Discounted fee as payment in full so you can take advantage of the 
maximum co-payment limit provision of your contract by always selecting a Prudent Buyer Plan 
provider.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note: Your prescription drug costs do not apply toward your maximum co-payment 
amount.</strong> Any amount you must pay in <strong>excess</strong> of what Blue Cross pays for a prescription drug claim 
will not apply toward satisfying your maximum co-payment amount.</p>
<p><font size=2>*Services for mental, emotional or functional nervous disorders/alcohol and drug abuse, physical therapy/medicine, 
and acupuncture are paid at a different rate. Please refer to benefit chart</font>.</p>

<h3>Other Facts You Should Know About Your Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Arbitration </strong>- Any dispute between you and Blue Cross of California and/or its affiliates must be 
resolved by binding arbitration, if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small 
Claims Court. Any such dispute will be resolved not by law or resort to sourt process, except as 
California law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Under this coverage, both you 
and Blue Cross of California and its affiliates are giving up the right to have any dispute decided in a 
court of law before a jury.</p>
<p><strong>Loss Ratio</strong> - As required by law, we are advising you that Blue Cross of California's incurred loss 
ratio for 1994 was 76.3%. This loss ratio was calculated after provider discounts were applied. The 
provider discounts on an aggregate exceeded 20% of billed charges.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage</strong> - Coverage under this plan remains in force as long as the required subscription carges are 
paid on time and as long as the subscriber remains eligible for coverage. Coverage ceases when a 
subscriber becomes ineligible because of age, Medicare eligibility, residency requirements, duplicate 
coverage of non-group insurance, or divorce. (In the case of Medicare eligibility, Blue Cross can offer 
another type of coverage.) Blue Cross may also change or terminate coverage for all covered persons 
with the same deductible, plan and rating area, including changing rates with 30 days prior written 
notice. However, Blue Cross does not change coverage or rates unless the change applies to all 
covered persons of the same class.</p>

<h2>Other Facts About Personal CaliforniaCare</h2>
<h3>Individual Enrollment Applications</h3>
<p>An Individual or Family who applies for membership in the Personal CaliforniaCare plan 
must submit an Individual Enrollment Application that will be reviewed by CaliforniaCare 
Health Plans Underwriting. If the applicant does not qualify, based upon the underwriting 
standards, for the particular coverage applied for, enrollment will not be approved. But, 
if that happens, the applicant will be told about other coverages and/or programs for 
which he/she does qualify. Coverage may be provided by one or more companies 
affiliated with Blue Cross of California.</p>
<h3>End of Coverage </h3>
<p>Coverage under this plan remains in force as long as the required subscription charges 
are paid on time and as long as the member remains eligible for coverage. </p>
<p>Coverage stops when a member becomes ineligible because of age, Medicare eligibility, 
residency requirements, or divorce. In the case of Medicare eligibility, Blue Cross 
provides a variety of Medicare supplement plans; in the case of divorce, the member 
losing eligibility may request separate coverage. Blue Cross may also change or terminate 
coverage, including changing rates with 30 days prior written notice. However, Blue 
Cross does not change coverage or rates unless the change applies to all covered 
persons of the same class.</p>
<h3>Arbitration</h3>
<p>Any dispute between you and Blue Cross of California/CaliforniaCare Health Plans must 
be resolved by binding arbitration, if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limit 
of the Small Claims Court. Any such dispute will be resolved not by law or resort to 
court process, except as California law provides for judicial review of arbitration 
proceedings. Under this coverage, both you and Blue Cross of California/CaliforniaCare 
Health Plans are giving up the right to have any dispute decided in a court of law before a 
jury.</p>

<H3>Enrollment Eligibility</H3>

     Once your Service Agreement arrives, you'll have ten full days to examine and either accept or decline by returning your Agreement.<P>
<H3>Balanced Risk Keeps Your Costs Low</H3>
     Fairness is the philosophy behind the Personal Prudent Buyer Choice Plan.  We believe that the cost of covering the expenses of someone with minimal health care needs should not be unfairly offset by someone whose health can be predicted to require costly care.<BR>
     The Personal Prudent Buyer choice Plan offers a solution.  The Plan reduces the cost of your coverage by making sure that a "risk balance" is maintained.  The balance is achieved like this:<BR>
<H3>1. Individual Enrollment Applications</H3>
     Each individual or Family who applies for membership in our Personal Prudent Buyer Plans must submit an Individual Enrollment Application that will be reviewed by Blue Cross of California Medical Underwriting.  If the applicant does not qualify, based on Blue Cross of California underwriting standards, for the particular coverage applied for, enrollment will not be approved.  But, if that happens, the applicant will be told about other coverages and/or programs for which he/she does qualify.  Coverge may be provided by one or more companies affiliated with Blue Cross of California.<P>
<H3>2. Waiting Periods</H3>
     See the specific waiting periods listed above.<P>
<H3>Arbitration</H3>
     Any dispute between you and Blue Cross of California/CaliforniaCare Health Plans must be resolved by binding arbitration if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the Small Claims Court.  Any such dispute will be resolved not by law suit or resort to court process, except as California law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings.  Under this coverage, both you and Blue Cross of California/CaliforniaCare Health Plans are giving up the right to have any dispute decided in a court of law before a jury.<P>
<H3>Coverage</H3>
     Coverage under this plan remains in force as long as the required subscription charges are paid on time and as long as the subscriber remains eligible for coverage.  Coverage ceases when a subscriber becomes ineligible because of age, Medicare eligibility, residence requirements, duplicate coverage of non-group insurance, or divorce.  (In the case of Medicare eligibiligy, Blue Cross can offer another type of coverage.)  Blue Cross may also change or terminate coverage including changing rates with 30 days prior written notice.  However, Blue Cross does not change coverage or rates unless the change applies to all covered persons of the same class.<P>
<H3>Utilization Review</H3>
     All inpatient hospital stays and certain specified outpatient surgeries must be reviewed for medical necessity through pre-service review.  Your subscriber ID card will have instructions and telephone numbers for pre-service review.<P>
<H3>Authorization for Organ and Tissue Transplants</H3>
     Organ and tissue transplants must be pre-authorized to determine if the transplants are medically necessary, not experimental and if the facility is an approved designated transplant center.

<p>*To determine which area you live in, please see the complete list of Area 1 Counties, Area 2 Counties, Area 3 
Counties, Area 4 Counties, Area 5 Counties and Area 6 Counties.</p>
<p>Please remember to review the Outline of Coverage so you'll know about conditions, limitations and exclusions of 
coverage.</p>
<p>Benefits and monthly rates effective March 1, 1996.</p>
<p><strong>How to Determine Your Rate:</strong> Identify the category (Member Only or Member and Spouse) to which you belong, 
as well as the area you reside in. The Member Only rate is based on your age, as of the effective date of the policy. The 
Member and Spouse rate is based on the age of the older spouse, as of the effective date of the policy.</p>
<p><strong>Billing Information:</strong> Your initial premium is one (1) month's payment and will be due upon enrollment. We will bill you<strong> 
</strong><em><strong>bimonthly</strong></em> (every 2 months) thereafter, unless you return your Monthly Checking Account Deduction Authorization 
with your application.</p>
<h3>Prescription Drugs Benefit<br>
With ClaimFree Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan</h3>
<p>Outpatient drugs needed to treat serious illness often add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars annually. <em>Medicare 
does not cover any outpatient prescription drug costs.</em></p>
<p>The ClaimFree <strong>Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan</strong> can save you money by offering coverage to help pay for prescription 
drugs, through a Participating Pharmacy and/or mail order, at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Many prescription drugs are available in generic form, which is more cost-effective for you. By law, generic drugs and 
brand name drugs must meet the same standards for safety, purity, strength and quality. </p>
<h3>Benefits When You Use A Participating Pharmacy</h3>
<p>When you use a Participating Pharmacy (more than 80% of all California pharmacies), you simply show the pharmacist 
your personal Blue Cross of California Prescription Drug Card. You have no claim forms to fill out. Please see the 
Co-payment Schedule Chart. </p>
<h3>Mail Order Program</h3>
<p>If you wish, you may choose to order maintenance prescriptions through our convenient Mail Order Program. Please 
see the Co-payment Schedule chart below. Note: The Mail Order Program is limited to certain drugs, generally the 
Blue Cross of California drug formulary. The list of available drugs is subject to change from time to time without prior 
notification. </p>
<h3>Co-payment Schedule</h3>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 width=100% COLSPEC="L31 L28 L27" HEIGHT="20%">
<tr><th></th><th>Participating Pharmacy</th><th>Mail Order Program</th></tr>
<tr><td>Prescription Drugs Co-payment</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size=1>*After a combined $250 yearly prescription drug deductible, you pay only 50% of a discounted rate for each prescription and/or refill (up to a 60-day 
supply). There is a combined yearly maximum of $3,000 for prescription drugs.</font> </p>
<h3>Nonparticipating Pharmacy</h3>
<p>When using a Nonparticipating Pharmacy, you will be responsible for the payment in full for each prescription at the 
time the prescription is filled. There are no benefits or reimbursements when you use a Nonparticipating Pharmacy. </p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how you could save money when you have incurred a $2,000 charge for services where 
Medicare has established a $1,750 allowable level charge (assume that your Medicare Part B deductible has been 
satisfied):</p>

<h2>Outline of Medicare Supplement Coverage and Premium Information</h2>
<p>Use this outline to compare benefits and premiums among policies.</p>
<p>Medicare supplement coverage/policies of this category are designed to supplement Medicare by covering some 
hospital, medical and surgical services that are partially covered by Medicare. Coverage is provided for hospital 
inpatient charges and some physicians' charges, subject to any deductibles and coinsurance provisions which may be in 
addition to those provided by Medicare, and subject to other limitations which may be set forth in the policy. </p>
<h3>Policy Replacement</h3>
<p>If you are replacing other health coverage, do NOT cancel it until you have actually received your new contract and are

<p>Your initial premium is for one (1) month's payment and will be due upon enrollment. We will bill you bimonthly (every 2 months) thereafter, unless you return your Monthly Checking

<strong>Note:</strong><br>
These plans are intended only for people age 65 or older, who are enrolled in both Part A and B of Medicare. </p>
<p><strong>How to Determine Your Rate:</strong> Identify the category (Member Only or Member and Spouse) to which you belong, as well as the area you reside in. The Member Only rate is based 
on your age, as of the effective date of the policy. The Member and Spouse rate is based on the age of the older spouse, as of the effective date of the policy.</p>

<h3>Member Billing</h3>
<p>Premiums will be billed to you by one of the following ways: If you enroll between the 1st and 14th of the month, your coverage will be effective on the 15th of the month. The first 
premium bill you will receive will be for one-and-a-half (1&#189;) months. Thereafter, Blue Cross of California will bill you every two (2) months. If you enroll between the 15th and 31st of 
the month, your coverage will begin on the 1st of the following month. Blue Cross of California will bill you bimonthly.</p>
<p>Your coverage is effective the 1st or 15th of the month after approval, unless otherwise requested.</p>
<p>If you are replacing another Medicare supplement policy, your coverage will be effective the date that your other plan ends.</p>
<p>Blue Cross of California reserves the right to reject your application. If your application is rejected, you will be notified in writing and any payment will be refunded. </p>
<h3>Monthly Checking Account Deduction</h3>
<p>With the Blue Cross of California Monthly Checking Account Deduction Program, you can have your monthly Blue Cross dues withdrawn directly from your checking account on the 
sixth (6th) day of each month. When you receive your bank statement and cleared checks, your Blue Cross of California monthly checking account deduction will be included. </p>
<h3>Convenience of Summary Billing</h3>
<p>Summary Billing offers you the convenience of consolidating your billing with any other Blue Cross of California <em>senior plan member,</em> such as a spouse or relative. This means that we 
can combine separate billings onto a single statement, even if you and the other person(s) are enrolled in different Blue Cross of California <em>senior plans.</em></p>
<p>The result is less paperwork for you because one statement, one check and one envelope does the job. Summary Billing is also available if you choose the monthly checking account 
deduction option. </p>
<h3>Guaranteed Renewable</h3>
<p>Blue Cross of California Medicare supplements are guaranteed renewable.</p>
<p>After the first one (1) month's payment, the term of this coverage is for two (2) months, if you have chosen bimonthly coverage, or monthly, if you have chosen monthly checking account 
deduction. It renews automatically, subject to the right of Blue Cross of California to change subscription charges. Any such changes would be made only upon 30 days written notice to 
all persons covered under the same plan as you.</p>
<p>We will not cancel your coverage, except for the reasons listed below: </p>
<ul>
<li>If we discover any concealment of material facts upon enrollment </li>
<li>If you do not pay your subscription charges, your coverage will end automatically without notice from us </li>
<li>You cease to be covered under both parts A and B of Medicare </li>
<li>You enroll in a Medicare Coordinated Care Plan </li>
</ul>
<p>A Coordinated Care Plan (also sometimes referred to as a Medicare-at-Risk Plan) are special Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Competitive Medical Plans (CMPs) that 
seniors eligible for Medicare may be able to join. They essentially combine Medicare benefits with supplemental benefits. People who join must generally get all health care from 
providers affiliated with the plan, and they do not receive regular Medicare benefits for services obtained outside the plan. </p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>In accordance with California law, Blue Cross continuously reviews the quality of care provided to you under this contract. Under Blue Cross' quality of care review system, 
Participating Providers are credentialled regularly, and the quality of the care they provide is reviewed on both a concurrent and prospective basis. Because members may obtain care 
from any Nonparticipating Provider they choose, Blue Cross is unable to review the credentials of such Nonparticipating Providers or to include them in prospective and concurrent 
review programs. Nevertheless, Blue Cross reviews the services provided by all providers, both participating and nonparticipating retrospectively. </p>

<h3>Member Grievance Procedure</h3>
<p>We are certain that you will be completely satisfied with your Blue Cross of California plan, but if you should ever have a complaint or problem, please follow the Member Grievance 
Procedure: </p>
<h4>Step 1.</h4>
<p>Contact Blue Cross of California. <br>
You can call us at 1-800-333-3883. <br>
You can write to us at the following addresses: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you reside in Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino or San Diego County, please address to P.O. Box 9043, Oxnard, CA 93031-9043. </li>
<li>If you reside in Los Angeles County, please address to P.O. Box 9053, Oxnard, CA 93031-9053. </li>
<li>If you reside in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara or Santa Cruz County, please address to P.O. Box 9063, 
Oxnard, CA 93031-9063. </li>
<li>If you reside in Any Other Northern or Central County Not Listed Above, please address to P.O. Box 9073, Oxnard, CA 93031-9073. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your grievance will be reviewed and you will receive a response within 30 days.</p>
<h4>Step 2.</h4>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the response, you can submit the grievance to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Any dispute between the Member and Blue Cross regarding the decision of Blue Cross must be submitted to binding arbitration, if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limits 
of the small claims court. This arbitration is begun by the Member making written demand on Blue Cross.</p>
<p>This arbitration will be held before a designated neutral arbitrator appointed by the county medical association of the county in which the services were provided. If the county medical 
association declines or is unable to appoint an arbitrator, the arbitration will be conducted according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>Any dispute regarding a claim for damages within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court will be resolved in such court. </p>
<h3>Arbitration</h3>
<p>Any dispute between you an Blue Cross of California must be resolved by binding arbitration, if the amount in dispute exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court, not by 
lawsuit or resort to court process, except as California law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Under this coverage, both you and us are giving up the right to have 
any dispute decided in a court of law before a jury. Notice of binding arbitration is in the Blue Cross of California Service Agreement.</p>
<p>The arbitration findings will be final and binding. </p>

Provider Organization (PPO) allows insureds to choose their own physician and specialist any time, anywhere within the provider network. Blue Cross of California provides its 
ClaimFree Standard Plan A, ClaimFree<strong> Prudent Buyer Plan</strong> and ClaimFree<strong> Prudent Buyer Platinum Plan </strong>members a network of nearly 40,000 physicians statewide. </p>

of highway passes through an area with some of the best lake fishing
British Columbia has to offer.  There are literally hundreds of
lakes to be accessed from this scenic route.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>Rainbow trout are the most abundant sport fish in
this area.  If outstanding Rainbow trout are &quot;old hat&quot;
for you, then match wits with Brook  or Lake trout, or perhaps
Kokanee in the various lakes of  the region.  Some of the best
fishing experiences are centered in the &quot;Interlakes&quot;
area between four main destinations:  Fawn, Sheridan, Bridge,
and Lac Des Roche Lakes.  These lakes are strategically located
 for those seeking  first class fishing  experiences , whether
a first-time angler or one with a long time love for the sport.
  Within a short distance of the main lakes, there are many small
lakes that offer a person an exciting variety of  fishing challanges.</B>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Complete drive-in resort facilities are available
at these four destination lakes, making them ideal locations for
the serious fisherman, as well as a holiday spot for the whole
family.  The resorts offer services ranging from fully furnished
cabins, RV hook-ups, restaurants, horseback riding, boat rentals,
and wonderful swimming beaches.  Furthermore, do not forget many
wonderful photographic opportunities just waiting to be captured.</B>
<BR>

<P>
<B>The lakes accessible off the <I><B>Fishing Highway,
#24</B></I><B>,</B> are famous for sports fishing because they
are highly productive in terms of  the ability to grow fish. 
These nutrient-rich waters support abundant populations of freshwater
shrimp, the food which enables trout to grow in excess of 12 pounds.</B>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Fawn Lake is the smallest of the featured <I><B>Fishing
Highway, #24</B></I>  lakes.  It has a surface area of 80 acres.
 The rich aquatic insect life supports rainbow trout in excess
of 12 pounds.  The average rainbow weighs in around 3 1/2  pounds.
 The clear water and extensive shallow area make this lake attractive
to the fly fisherman</B>.<BR>

<P>
<B>Sheridan Lake is the largest of the <I><B>Fishing
Highway, #24, </B></I>group, having a surface area of 4,100 acres.
 It has a relatively shallow average depth of 23 feet, which makes
the lake very productive in terms of insect life and BIG
fish.  Rainbow trout grow in excess of 12 pounds, with an average
weight of 3 1/2 pounds.  Brook trout  reach weights of  8 pounds.</B>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Bridge Lake offers the most diverse fishing opportunities.
 A fisherman can coax Rainbow trout, Kokanee salmon, Lake trout,
and Burbot from Bridge Lake waters.  At a size of  3,384 acres,
this lake has consistently produced Lake trout over 20 pounds,
Kokanee over 5 pounds, and Rainbow trout over 5 pounds.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>Lac Des Roche, located at the eastern reaches of
the <I><B>Fishing Highway, #24</B></I>, is another large lake,
covering 1,650 acres.  This  lake of crystal clear waters supports
good populations of Burbot and Rainbow trout averaging 3 pounds,
with top-end weights of Burbot and Rainbow trout reaching 20 and
14 pounds, respectively .  Lac Des Roche is famous for the prolific
mayfly hatches that occur during May and June.</B><BR>

and campsites right on the water. The cozy cabins all have power,
running water, cooking facilities, fridges and wood stoves complete
with fire wood. Running between the cabins is a beautiful stream
which was constructed by the resort owners and the Grizzly Anglers
Club to provide a spawning bed for the rainbow trout. During the
spring months this creek provides a multitude of trout with an
area to deposit their eggs.

<A NAME="ACTIVITIES"><H2>ACTIVITIES</H2></A><BR>There is ample opportunity for all season family fun. The crystal
clear, clean lake water is suitable for swimming and other water
sports. The haunting call of loons provides a beautiful background
music for campfire gatherings during the evening hours.
<P>In the winter months there are many miles of snowmobile trails.
<P>The warm, friendly atmosphere found at this resort keeps many
families coming back year after year.<BR>
<A NAME="ROADCONDITIONS"><H2>ROAD CONDITIONS</H2></A><BR>Highway 24, known as the &quot;Fishing Highway&quot; because of
its' proximity to literally hundreds of prime trout lakes, is
now fully paved. Peaceful Cove Resort is only 1/2 mile off Highway
24 on a well maintained, 2 lane gravel road which easily accommodates
large motor homes and travel trailers. The resort is within one
hours easy drive of hundreds of additional lakes. Your hosts, Harris and
Judy, will be more than happy to provide you with up-to-date fishing
information on Lac Des Roche and other nearby lakes.<BR>

<center><h2>NORTH TWEEDSMUIR PROVINCIAL PARK</h2></center>

<hr>
<b><a name="TWEEDSMUIRWILDERNESSRANCH">TWEEDSMUIR WILDERNESS RANCH</a></b>
<p>
The 115 acre ranch is located in a beautiful setting around Voyageur
Bay of Ootsa Lake.  The bay is well known for its abundance of
Kokanee trout while the main lake and Knox Lake, which is located
across Ootsa from Voyageur Bay, are well known for trophy Rainbow
trout.

<img src="tweeds.gif" align=right width=274 height=187 border=3><p>
The main attractions offered by the ranch are canoe trips into
North Tweedsmuir Park.
<p>
All buildings have verandas overlooking the bay.  The kitchen
and dining room are located in the main ranch house.  The cabins
are primitive, but newly built, and sleep up to eight guests.
 They are equipped with a loft, bunk beds, closets, kitchen cupboards,
table, chairs, propane cookers and lights, a wash basin, and a
wood heater.  The outhouses are approximately 50 meters from the
cabins.
<p>
Transportation to the entrance of the park is approximately two
and a half hours by a 28 foot cruise boat which is suitable for
the dangerous waters of the Ootsa and Whitesail Lakes Reservoirs.
 The canoes are 17 foot &quot;Oldtown Discovery&quot; canoes with
aluminum &quot;Carlisle&quot; paddles.  The stable, fast, and
easy-to-handle sea or ocean kayak has increased in popularity
over the last few years.  This year (1996) we offer you the opportunity
to join our trips in a single sea kayak for an additional charge.
 There are guided trips, unguided, but outfitted, or just rentals
available.  Besides this exciting adventure, the ranch offers
cruise boat trips into Little Whitesail Lake, bordered by the
rugged mountains of the Whitesail Range, boat and canoe rentals,
and excellent guided or unguided fishing.

<h3><a name="CANOEINGINTWEEDSMUIR">CANOEING IN TWEEDSMUIR PARK - A WELL KEPT SECRET</a></h3>

Wilderness enthusiasts in British Columbia are only talking behind
closed doors about the fascinating beauty of the scenery around
Pondosy and Eutsuk Lake in the northern part of the largest provincial
park in British Columbia.  This secret area is protected by a
chain of enormous lakes around the boundaries of North Tweedsmuir
Park.  These man-made lakes are dangerous to navigate for boaters
unfamiliar with the area and for that reason very few people access
this park during the course of a summer.  The &quot;Lady Tweedsmuir&quot;,
a large and strong aluminum jet boat suitable for up to ten people,
now offers access for canoeists and hikers to this fantastic wilderness
area based from the Tweedsmuir Wilderness Ranch.<br>

<h3><a name="NORTHTWEEDSMUIR">NORTH TWEEDSMUIR PROVINCIAL PARK</a></h3>

Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, the largest park in British Columbia,
covers an area of more than 981,000 hectares in the west-central
region of the province, about 480 kilometers by air northwest
of Vancouver.  Roughly triangular in shape, the park is bounded
on the north and northwest by the Ootsa-Whitesail Lakes Reservoir,
on the west and southwest by the Coast Mountains, and on the east
by the Interior Plateau.<br>

<p>
The park was named for the 15th Governor General of Canada, John
Buchan, Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield.  Wildlife is widespread
and fairly prevalent.  In summer and fall, woodland caribou frequent
the slopes of the Quanchus and Chikamin Mountain Ranges.  In other
areas mountain goats, mule deer, moose, black bear, grizzly bear,
and wolves are in evidence.  Visitors to the alpine meadows often
see smaller mammals such as hoary marmots, wolverines, and Siberian
lemmings, as well as various bird species including willow ptarmigans,
gray-crowned rosy finches, and golden-crowned sparrows.  Elsewhere,
members of the grouse family occur in considerable numbers, and
waterfowl are usually plentiful in the swamps and ponds.  Around
the Nechako Reservoir, dead trees provide nesting sites of fish-hunting
ospreys.  Most of the lakes and waterways have populations of
mountain whitefish, rainbow trout, kokanee, and burbot.  Eight
kilometer long Eutsuk Lake, and the picturesque Pondosy Lake are
surrounded by the majestic Coast Mountains, a true paradise for
canoeists and hikers.<br>

In the Ootsa and Whitesail Lakes
Reservoirs, sudden strong winds that funnel down the lakes from
the Coast Mountains can be expected any time.  Windstorms rise
very quickly and can blow unabated for a day or more.  For that
reason, we strongly recommend that you plan and extra day or two
at the beginning and/or at the end of your trip.  Or, just take
the time to relax on the beaches of Voyageur Bay, rent a boat
and enjoy some fishing, or a canoe and practice your paddling
techniques, exploring the lake and getting prepared for your canoe
adventure.<br>

The  WELLS GRAY GUEST RANCH is located at the entrance
to Wells Gray Park, British Columbia's third largest provincial
park.  The Park, encumpassing 520,000 hectares of pristine wilderness, is
well known for its impressive waterfalls, deep blue lakes, and
magnificent mountain ranges of the Shuswap Highlands and Cariboo
Mountains.<IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="ranch.gif" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=3>
<BR><P></P>Halfway between Jasper and Vancouver on the Yellowhead
Highway #5, you will find the village of Clearwater.  Driving
north for 27 km on the Wells Gray Park Road you will see the Wells
Gray Guest Ranch to your left.  This working ranch is running
300 head of cattle, and 70 horses on 250 hectares of land.  Guest
accommodations include four roomy log cabins with ten rooms (each
with private shower and  bathroom facilities), and a comfortable
three bedroom farmhouse.  Guests can dine on catered hearty ranch-style
meals served in the old Ranch house, built in 1946, or prepare
their own meals by making use of the kitchenette available in
each room. <BR>

<P>
In our neighbourhood other ranches like NAKISKA RANCH,
McKAY RANCH, and ASPEN HILL also offer guest rooms in rebuilt
or newly constructed farmhouses and log cabins.  All rooms are
equipped with private toilet and shower facilities.  Some are
also equipped with kitchenettes and verandas with a mountain view.
 The ranches are all located within a three minute drive from
the main buildings of the Wells Gray Guest Ranch (dining room
and Saloon).  In the case of  no vacancies in the main ranch complex,
we can offer this alternative accommodation to interested clientele
for the rates listed, as well as full use of the Ranch facilities.
 All rooms are of at least the same standard as the log cabins
at the Wells Gray Guest Ranch.<BR>

<P>
A campground with ten RV sites, two large group tent
sites, and six camping cabins is also available.  This area features
picnic tables, fire rings, fired wood, BBQ shelter, and a shower
house.  Unfortunately no electrical or sewer hook-up are available.
<BR>

<P>
The &quot;Old West&quot; comes alive in our newly
built BLACK HORSE SALOON where cowboys, neighbours, and guests
get together in the evenings to tell adventure stories and listen
to good country music.<BR>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="salloon.gif" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=3>
<P>
Most popular  SUMMER activities are riding, hiking,
canoeing, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, fishing, boating,
and sightseeing.  Guests are welcome to participate in everyday
ranch life.  For the more adventurous, the ranch offers multi-day
packtrips to Table Mountain Plateau and Clearwater River Valley.
 Weekly backpacking trips, canoeing, and mountain biking trips
are also available.<BR>

<P>
In the WINTER, the area offers excellent cross-country
skiing on various short trails or the 30 km Wells Gray Loppet
Trail.  For the ultimate Nordic experience in the high alpine
winter wonderland of Battle Mountain and the Trophy Mountains,
there is helicopter access available to mountain chalets.  Guest
s interested in the traditional way of transportation in the Canadian
winter, are welcome to join our dog sledding expeditions, or to
conquer surrounding mountain peaks on snowmobiles.

<H3>CROSS COUNTRY SKIING</H3>
Cross country skiers love Wells Gray Park for the
excellent snow conditions and lack of wind.  The opportunities
range from groomed trails for beginners and advanced skiers, to
challenging backcountry skiing for those seeking more daring experiences.

20 km ski to Helmcken Falls with its enormous ice cone, or the
30 km Wells Gray Loppet circle.<BR>

Fantastic backcountry and telemark skiing in the

chalets, which sleep up to 16 people dormitory style, and are
fully equipped with dishes, mattresses, bedding (bring you own
sleeping sheet), library, lights, heat, and propane range with
oven.  The buildings are located in strategic ski locations offering
unlimited choice of terrain, long meadows, open bowls, steep and
deep powder slopes, tree runs, and peak ascents on an average
snow base of four meters.  Access by helicopter is recommended,
ski access possible, but strenuous.  Skiing out is no problem

<B>Don't plan a trip to beautiful <A HREF="clwpage6.htm">Clearwater</A>, B.C. without visiting
our very Scenic Working Ranch.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>We provide guided rides to small groups (4 quests maximum) on
trails of varied terrain.  Our trails include open pasture, woodland,
and hay fields along the scenic North Thompson River.  There is
ample opportunity to see and photograph abundant wildlife such
as mule deer, black bear, and of course, ground squirrels, geese,
ducks, hawks, and bald eagles.  A cougar was spotted in mid May,
at a safe distance of course!<BR><P></P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="shook3.gif" ALT="Shook ranch photo" WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=101 BORDER=5>
This being a working ranch, cows and calves are a big part of
the scenery, especially during the spring and summer months. 
If guests wish, they are welcome to assist with ranch activities
such as moving cows to fresh pasture, checking on breeding groups
or whatever the order of the day has to offer.<BR>

<P>
Depending on the weather we are open from early April to late
October.  A variety of ride times can be arranged.<BR>

<P>
The Shook Family Ranch is located thirty minutes north of Clearwater
and forty five minutes south of Blue River.  It is only ten minutes
easy drive off the scenic Yellowhead Highway.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>FREE, FRESH, ORGANIC FOOD ANY TIME!</H2></CENTER><B>How would you like to grow your own fresh food any
time you wanted to?  Yes, even in the middle of winter!  By following
my simple plans for a <EM>PIT GREENHOUSE</EM>, you can grow vegetables,
flowers and herbs year round.  In addition to being inexpensive
to build, this type of greenhouse requires extremely little energy
to operate.  The only time you will require electricity is if
you wish to operate supplemental lighting.  In extremely cold
climates, you may wish to use some form of supplemental heating
as well but this should not be necessary in most areas.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>The <EM>PIT GREENHOUSE</EM> differs from conventional style
greenhouses in a few very important ways.  Firstly, because it
is earth tempered (surrounded by earth), it's sheltered from the
cold in winter and buffered from extreme heat in warmer climates
or seasons.  Secondly, in addition to collecting heat and light
from the roof of the greenhouse, you are also using the natural
heat stored in the earth.  Finally, you can use any surplus solar
energy generated in your greenhouse for other purposes.  It's
really only limited by your imagination.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>So, the next time you think of spending ridiculous
amounts of money on vegetables which are probably not fresh, think
about picking and eating fresh food FREE, anytime you want it.</B>
<BR>
<P>
<table><table border=0>
<tr><td>The sun's light raises the temperature in the greenhouse <i><b>as well as the surrounding soil</b></i>.  In the cold winter months this stored heat is returned from the heat envelope (red area) you have created surrounding the greenhouse.
</td><td><center><img src="greenhouse.jpg" alt="greenhouse.jpg - 30.2 K" width=400 height=323 align="absmiddle"></center></td><td>I offer plans using three types of construction methods:<ol><li> Wood<br><LI>Concrete<br><LI>Tires<br>

</ol><p>
Building with tires is by far the most economical.  If you wish you can even make planters from them!

Barriere serves as a central service centre for a trade area that
stretches from McLure (23  kilometres to the south), to Little
Fort (26 kilometres to the north).<HR>
<H2>Forestry</H2>

<P>
Approximately 75% of the Barriere area's labour force is either
directly, or indirectly, dependent upon the forestry industry.
 More than half of the businesses of Barriere and area are directly
dependent upon the forestry industry.  Many more are indirectly
dependent upon this very active sector for their economic well-being.
<P>
The predominant type of timber in the North Thompson Valley consists
of the softwoods: spruce, Douglas fir, pine, and cedar.  The area
includes three major mills:  Tolko Fadear Division (Louis Creek);
Gilbert Smith Forest Products (Barriere); and, Darfield Building
Products (Darfield).
<HR>
<H2>Agriculture</H2>

<P>
Agriculture is supported in the Barriere area.  Beef cattle ranching
and alfalfa hay production is evident up and down the valley.
 Ginseng is also gaining popularity as a viable crop in the Barriere
area.  Some corn silage is also produced.
<HR>
<H2>Tourism  </H2>

B.C..
<P>
The lakes and rivers of the Barriere area are considered to be
some of the best fishing lakes in the entire province.  Anglers
and other can revel in the beauty and abundance found here.  Many
resorts dot the area and welcome visitors and guests to their
facilities.
<P>
Barriere's Fall Fair, held on Labour Day week-end, is undoubtedly
its biggest event of the year.  The Fall Fair includes the exciting
entertainment offered by professional rodeo, and chuckwagon and
pony chariot races, along with the I.R.A. circuit professionals,
and Little Britches Rodeo.  This wonderful country fair offers
virtually something for all ages including:  reigning royalty,
 4-H and other competitions, a multitude of exhibits, light and
heavy horse events, concessions, dances, displays, pancake breakfasts,
beer garden, a midway, and parades through town on two days of
the three day event.
<P>

welcomed in Barriere.  There are numerous ball parks conveniently
clustered in one part of the community.  
<P>
In the winter, the Barriere area is a snowmobilers paradise, and
an emerging destination area for cross-country skiers.  The Barriere
Snowmobile Club has been active for many years, bringing events
such as their Snowarama and Sanctioned Drag Races.  Green Mountain,
among other areas, offers excellent snowmobiling opportunities,
and is accessed from the North Barriere Lake Road.  The Chamber
of Commerce , local accommodation facilities, and businesses offer
maps of local snowmobiling areas.
<P>
Another popular wintertime activity is cross-country skiing. 
Approximately 17 kilometres along the South Barriere Lake Road
offer enjoyable and challenging ungroomed trails operated by the
Barriere Heritage Society.  A sign marks the starting point. 
These are best appreciated in February and March.

Clearwater serves as the main service centre for the entire North
Thompson Valley, drawing trade from Valemount in the north to
Barriere in the south. In addition, Clearwater's all seasonal
recreation/tourism opportunities attract national and international
visitors year round.

Two major sawmills operate in the area; Slocan Forest Products'
mill (196 employees in 1993) and Weyerhauser Canada's mill (110
employees in 1993).

Clearwater boasts one of British Columbia's most envied travel
infocentres. The centre features travel information, a Business
Information Centre, a unique gift shop and displays of memorabilia,
geological specimens and history from the Clearwater area.
<P>
The growth of tourist visitor statistics at the Clearwater Travel
Infocentre is impressive. From 1986, until the end of 1994, both
individual and tour bus visitors have increased more than 5-fold.
In 1994 there were 112,310 individual visitors and 760 tour buses
to the infocentre.

<U><B>Agriculture</B></U> 
<P>
In spite of a scarcity of flat, arable land, and the existence
of a short frost free period there is some agricultural activity
concentrated in an area just south of Vavenby (20kms north of
Clearwater). Most of the farming activity is small vegetable production
on a local consumption basis. The area does host one of British
Columbia's largest sheep farms and Clearwater's farmers also pursue
cattle raising and berry production, particularly strawberries.
<P>
<U><B>Mining</B></U> 
<P>
The search for gold, both within the North Thompson Valley, and
into the Cariboo, has played a significant role in Clearwater's
colourful history. In 1916, the Queen Bess mine started producing
galena, silver, lead and zinc. By 1920, it was considered to be
a prime lead producer. The only other working mine to affect Clearwater
was the Windpass, situated above Dunn Lake. Large scale production
of gold from this mine peaked in the mid-1930's. Prospectors are
still searching the area for gold, uranium, and other ores. A
by-product of this activity is the periodic discovery of rich
fossil deposits in the area. Many miners area convinced that a
great deal of valuable ore remains to be found in Clearwater's
surrounding terrain.

A total of 79% of the Clearwater and Area population own their
own dwellings. Single detached houses account for 74% of the housing
inventory; semi-detached for 6%; and, mobile homes for the remaining
20%.
<P>
More than half of the Clearwater area's total housing stock has
been built in the last 25 years, reflecting the rapid growth of
the community over that time period.
<P>
The community is full of sweeping vistas - the product of deep
valleys and impressive peaks. The terrain dictates the settlement
pattern. As a result, many residents have large lots with significant
gaps between themselves and their neighbours. The whole community
strikes the visitor as one of ample spaces and an idyllic lifestyle.
<P>
Clearwater and area has serviced residential, commercial, and
industrial land. There is an availability of both residential
and commercial land and buildings in the area. Taxes and land
prices are far more reasonable than those found in urban areas.

<P>
<B>The Interlakes District is located within both the High Country & Cariboo Regions of British Columbia.   Being a District, it features
several communities and subdivisions supporting industry, schools,
health care, and government.    Privately owned summer cabins
dot the area , as well as year-round residences, and farming operations.
 Resorts and other retail enterprises are to be found  within
the District that offer fun, food, services, entertainment, and
information to the travelling public, business sector, and to
those considering relocating to the Interlakes District.   The
western approach  is  from Highway  97, the Gold Rush Trail, 
near 100 Mile House, BC , travelling east on Highway 24 for approximately
45 minutes.  To access the Interlakes District from the East,
 take Highway #5, the Yellowhead Route, to Little Fort, BC, and
travel west on Highway 24 for approximately the same amount of
 time.  Some of the destination resorts also offer access by air,
if solitude is what you are seeking.    There are a full range
of  fishing  opportunities at the resorts within the Interlakes
District, from full service contemporary lodges to more pristine
outpost accommodations.</B>
<P>
<B>Within the 'Lakes District your senses will be delighted
and rejuvenated by the unsurpassed beauty of wet lands, wild lands,
and wonder lands of natural splendor.  More than 125 lakes can
be found within a hour's drive of each other .  Mountains jump
up at the edges of the valley, many varieties of wildlife find
 the area plentiful, and some of the best freshwater fishing 
is to be found in the Interlakes District.  Photo opportunities
are everywhere.</B>
<P>
<B>Travellers of the soul will find  nostalgic reminders
of yesteryear,  present-day caring and goodwill, and tomorrow's
planning in terms of environment, community, and cultural endeavors.</B>

<H2>CABINS AND CAMPING</H2><BR>Peaceful Cove Resort offers a wonderful selection of log cabins
and campsites right on the water. The cozy cabins all have power,
running water, cooking facilities, fridges and wood stoves complete
with fire wood. Running between the cabins is a beautiful stream
which was constructed by the resort owners and the Grizzly Anglers
Club to provide a spawning bed for the rainbow trout. During the
spring months this creek provides a multitude of trout with an
area to deposit their eggs.
<A NAME="FACILITIES"><H2>FACILITIES</H2></A><BR>The resort offers a number of modern amenities which enhance your

<A NAME="ACTIVITIES"><H2>ACTIVITIES</H2></A><BR>There is ample opportunity for all season family fun. The crystal
clear, clean lake water is suitable for swimming and other water
sports. The haunting call of loons provides a beautiful background
music for campfire gatherings during the evening hours.
<P>In the winter months there are many miles of snowmobile trails.
<P>The warm, friendly atmosphere found at this resort keeps many
families coming back year after year.<BR>
<A NAME="ROADCONDITIONS"><H2>ROAD CONDITIONS</H2></A><BR>Highway 24, known as the &quot;Fishing Highway&quot; because of
its' proximity to literally hundreds of prime trout lakes, is
now fully paved. Peaceful Cove Resort is only 1/2 mile off Highway
24 on a well maintained, 2 lane gravel road which easily accommodates
large motor homes and travel trailers. The resort is within one
hours easy drive of hundreds of additional lakes. Your hosts, Harris and
Judy, will be more than happy to provide you with up-to-date fishing
information on Lac Des Roche and other nearby lakes.<BR>

<P>
<B>British Columbia is known throughout the angling world as one
of the world's finest Rainbow Trout fisheries. The Clearwater
North Thompson area contains some of B.C.'s most exciting fresh
water fishing grounds. The area also produces good quality and
quantities of lake trout, brook trout, dolly varden, kokanee,
and fresh water ling cod. With the help of local guides, resorts,
sporting goods outlets, and other anglers you could have the fishing
vacation of a lifetime. To help us maintain a quality fishing
resource please only keep what you can eat and be sure you know
the regulations before you fish.</B>

<B>During the winter months it is difficult to get up to date fishing
reports. As the season progresses we will provide you with up
to date reports on our favourite lakes.</B>
<P>
<HR SIZE=7> 
<B>Anyone who has wandered through the rows of a sporting goods store can appreciate the confusing array of flies which confronts the
average angler. Each region and individual lake have unique flies
which work best at certain times of the year. To help you plan
your fishing trip we have included a selection of 12 of the most
productive and popular flies for British Columbia's freshwater
lakes. It is better to start with a few good fly patterns rather
than so many you become confused and don't know what to use first.
Most resorts and small sporting goods outlets have good locally
tied patterns and are knowledgeable about what is working in the
area.</B><HR SIZE=7>

<A NAME="FISHINGTACKLE"><H2>BRITISH COLUMBIA'S MOST POPULAR DOZEN</H2></A>

<H3><B>Bloodworm</B></H3>
<B>
<P>
Best fished slow and on the bottom. Available in a variety of
colours. Red, maroon, dark green, and brown most popular colours.
<P><H3>Chironomid</H3>May be fished at any depth. Usually on the bottom. Use a very slow, sporadic retrieve. Available in a variety of colours.
<H3>Carey Special</H3>

<P>
Good trolled fly. Can be fished at any depth. Available in a many
colours.
<H3>Werner Shrimp</H3>

<P>
One of my favourite flies. Can be trolled slowly and works at
any depth but is best on or near bottom in weeds. Available in
a variety of sizes and colours.
<H3>Marabou Leech</H3>

<P>
This fly works particularly well after a chironomid hatch. Works
best when retrieve is almost undulating.
<P>
<H3>Doc Spratley</H3>A good generic fly. Depending on size and colour this fly can represent many different types of insect life.
<H3>Wooley Bugger</H3>

<P>
Very popular and often productive fly. Has been known to take
some very large rainbows. Works well trolled deep.
<H3>Half Back</H3>

<P>
Another generic fly which imitates a variety of insect life. Can
be fished at any depth but generally works best slow and deep.
<H3>Hare's Ear Nymph</H3>

<P>
A popular nymph imitation available in a variety of sizes and
colours. Most successful when fished slowly on the bottom.
<H3>Tom Thumb</H3>

<P>
Very useful dry fly imitation. Often fished on the surface as
a sedge imitation but can be used very effectively sub-surface.
<P>
<I>Please remember this is only a very simple point to start in
your selection of flies. Local guides and resort owners will be
able to provide you with a wealth of information when you actually
arrive at your destination.</I> <HR SIZE=7>

<A NAME="FISHINGTIPS"><H2>FISHING TIPS</H2></A>
Fish, like all other living creatures, have periods of rest and
of activity which vary under different circumstances. Observant
anglers will have noticed that weather patterns and barometric
pressure changes have a significant effect on feeding activities
of fish. Some anglers contend that tide tables and moon phases
also have a notable impact on the feeding patterns of fish.
<P>
Scientists are able to calculate, in advance, tide tables and
moon phases as they will occur throughout the year. This information
is used to create the solinar tables which, according to some
anglers, can be used to predict the best times to fish on any
given day of the year.
<P>
<P></B>
<HR>
<B>For many British Columbians, the crisp, clean autumn air is merely a harbinger of a long cold winter. However, for those fortunate outdoor enthusiasts this colourful season is perhaps the most exhilarating of all. Not only is it an indicator that we will soon be enjoying winter sports such as skiing, outdoor skating, snowshoeing and snow mobiling it is also a source of some of the best fishing ever.<P><BR></P>

Imagine yourself fishing on a beautiful, crystal clear lake surrounded by incredible wilderness forests clothed in brilliant fall colours. Add voraciously feeding fish to this picture and you have an idea of what Autumn fishing in central British Columbia can be like.<BR><P></P>

If you are fortunate enough to be able to travel to one of our lakes or streams here are some suggestions for successful fishing. Many of the guides and resort owners are reporting that leech, dragon, blood worm, water boatman, and shrimp flies are producing fish. For those of you who prefer hardware, black glitter flatfish, ford fender with hook and worm, apex, frog flatfish and blue silver side flatfish have all been effective. Be sure you check with the local resort owners and, to be politically correct, fisherpersons for current information about the specific area you are in. Make sure you check the regulations before you cast your line.<BR><P></P> 
</B><BR>

<B>Good luck and good fishing.</B>
<HR><B>


<B>Please help us retain our beautiful fishery. If you pack it in
you can pack it out. Make sure you are familiar with the fishing
regulations, some lakes are closed to ice fishing. </B>

<B>If privacy issues concern you and if unsolicited
phone calls or unsolicited mail annoys you, here's what you can
do:</B><BR>

<P>
<B>Contact the company directly.  Demand it take your
name off its lists and refrain from renting your name to any other
company.  If you are writing to them include a copy of the mailing
sticker.  And don't be afraid to call them if they have a toll
free number.  If calling, always get the name of the person you
talked to.  Keep a record of your letters and calls in case you
have to repeat the exercise.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>Get on the Canadian Direct Marketing Association
(CDMA) do-not-mail lists.  Provide various spellings and misspellings
of your name including a version with just your initials.  Include
your address and phone number.</B><BR>

</B><BR>
<B>Wait about four months for the deletion to go through
CDMA's membership.</B><BR>

<B>Note:  Not all companies involved in direct marketing
activities are CDMA members but action outlined above should delete
your name from the lists of more than 800 companies.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>If you order by mail, make contributions, subscribe
to magazines, in fact, every time your name and address is requested,
ask it will be put on a mailing list.  Also ask if the list will
be rented to other companies.  Remember, you have the right to
say, DO NOT PUT MY NAME ON A MAILING LIST and DO NOT RENT MY NAME
TO ANYONE.</B><BR>

<P>
<B>The best way to stay out of mailing lists is simply
NOT to respond to unsolicited offers.</B><BR><HR>

<br><b>Advantages of Becoming Involved</b></p></center>

<p>Because transitions are such a critical element for progress in most
areas of our world, using Glenn's Unified Transition Theory<sup>TM</sup>
framework to facilitate success is very beneficial. From the moment the
chart is first viewed, it gives an individual or client a visual checklist
of neccessary supports. Advantages of use have been found in the following
areas:</p>

<center><p><b>Education </b></p></center>

<p>Can be used by educators at the high-school level to ensure continuous
progress by students during their high-school career:</p>

<ul>
<li>Career and Personal Planning curriculum</li>

<li>Employment preparation programs</li>

<li>Framework for further education or training</li>
</ul>

<center><p><b>Personal Development</b></p></center>

<p>Develops lifetime knowledge of how to best make transitions, including
moving to jobs, between jobs and to retirement. Will be an asset to parenting
skills.</p>

<center><p><b>Business</b></p></center>

<p>Provides a holistic approach between employers and employees in dealing
with the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relocation</li>

<li>Downsizing</li>

<li>Long term disability</li>

<li>Retirement</li>
</ul>

<center><p><b>Professional</b></p></center>

<p>Speeds relationship development between counselor and client. Is currently
used by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Career Counselors</li>

<li>Employment programs</li>

<li>Workplace based training</li>

<li>HRCC funded employment services programs</li>

<li>Community Futures self-employment programs</li>

<li>&quot;First Job in Science and Technology&quot;</li>

<li>Youthworks</li>

<li>Welfare to Work</li>

<li>Youth Employment Services program</li>
</ul>

<center><p><b>Community Development</b></p></center>

<p>Using the Unified Transition Theory<sup>TM </sup>can provide a common
framework for all agencies and service providers in a community. This will
lead to more efficient use of human resources and energy by avoiding duplication
of services and streamlining the process. Individuals can be introduced
to the UTT and carry it with them between agencies. This serves to bring
agencies in a community together to provide the best possible assistance
to their citizens.</p>

<p><b>INFORMATION, INVOLVEMENT AND QUALIFICATION PROCESS</b></p>

<ul>
<li>contact the <b>site option owner </b>for your area</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>have your name placed on our mailing list to receive the &quot;<b>Theory
Talk</b>&quot; newsletter</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>attend workshops offered by a <b>Unified Transition<sup>TM</sup> Theorist</b>
in your area</li>

<li>register to attend a UTT<sup>TM </sup>training program to qualify as
a theorist, to understand the business structure and to enable purchase
of materials</li>

<li>become a site license owner </li>

<li>become a site option owner </li>

<li>audit a training session in your area (schedule included in &quot;<b>Theory
Talk</b>&quot; newsletter)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<br><b>Does it work?</b> </p>

<p><b>Yes!</b></p>

<p>There area over 65 people who have qualified themselves as <b>Unified
Transition<sup>TM</sup> Theorists, </b>working throughout B.C. in a variety
of government funded programs and private businesses.</p>

<p>* It is worth noting that this model can be worked through successfully
with non-literate individuals!</p>

<p><b><i>WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?</i></b></p>

<p> There has long been a need to create a new standard to make sense of
the process of making a transition. Transitions may include finding employment,
creating self employment, retirement, corporate or community transitions,
family, attitude or personality transitions.</p>

<p> The bewildering array of ideas concerning a transition is overwhelming
to most people. It is this sense of being overwhelmed that forces people
to focus on only a few avenues of transition. This limited focus results
in limited success. Many ways of experiencing a successful, well rounded
transition are ignored.</p>

<p>The Unified Transition Theory unites the bewildering array of ideas
concerning the process of making a transition into one easily understood
model. This united knowledge changes the feeling of being overwhelmed to
a sense of understanding and empowerment. With this new understanding,
people and organizations are able to use up to 33 different avenues to
transition. People increase their potential for transition by knowing about
and using these avenues to success.</p>

<p> Five statements and a chart create the basis of the theory:</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
<p><LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Those seeking or having the most transition supports have the greatest
potential of experiencing a successful transition.</b></li>

<p> There are 33 transition supports. Transition supports assist a person
in making a transition. They provide the experiences, the physical, mental
and emotional basis to transition.</p>

<p> </p>

<li><b>Those not seeking transition supports will not experience a successful,
complete transition.</b></li>

<p> </p>

<li><b>Those having &quot;paid for&quot; supports in all areas of their
lives rarely make a successful transition.</b></li>

<p> &quot;Paid for Supports&quot; occurs when someone (or a system) is
paying for transition support.</p>

<p> </p>

<li><b>Most transition supports deteriorate in direct proportion to the
amount of time spent attempting to make the transition.</b></li>

<p> </p>

<li><b>The greater the transition, the greater the need for diverse transition
supports.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center SIZE=3></p>

<center><p>The 33 transition supports are divided into 3 categories:</p></center>

<p> </p>

<ol>
<p><LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Paid for transition supports.</b></li>

<p> These cost money. They stop working when the payment stops.</p>

<p> <LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Unpaid or &quot;natural&quot; transition supports.</b></li>

<p> These are people who provide assistance. They do not require payments,
and their support can last a lifetime.</p>

<p> <LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Personal attributes.</b></li>

<p> These are traits such as personality, education, work history, self
esteem.</p>

<p><b><i>WHY DOES THIS WORK?</i></b></p>

<p> The Unified Transition Theory<sup>TM</sup> provides a believable, logical
framework for individuals and organizations to manage change. Ownership
is immediate, yet progress inspired by the model will last a lifetime.
As change is constant in our personal and professional lives a method to
improve our ability to make successful transitions is invaluable. Succcessful
transitions progress faster and smoother when the necessary supports for
transitions are in place.</p>

<p>However, in some situations, transition supports can be barriers to
transition. Recognizing when these supports are barriers and dealing with
them is a critical factor in making a successful transition.</p>

<p> The first step is recognizing the barriers. The second step is attempting
to convert the barrier to a transition support. This may not always be
possible. It may be better to do nothing than to cause harm. For example:
It is necessary to find out exactly what will happen to current income
and additional supports before proceeding with a transition program.</p>

<p> The Unified Transition Theory takes into consideration all of the
potential barriers to transition identified by a Statistics Canada study,
 and more. The Unified Transition Theory considers 33 possible barriers
to transition.</p>

<p> Over a 16 year period, I've made funding recommendations for over 1,200
transition programs. There were many factors in determining the success
of any transition project, but what was the most critical factor? <b>People!</b>
The most successful transitions involve <i>supporting </i>a person in their
development of 33 possible transition supports. <b>NO </b>other factor
is as critical.</p>

<p> A similar conclusion was made in a 1994 study by the University of
Manitoba, of 139 computer based transition projects. It reported:</p>

<center><p> <b><i>&quot;There is one final acid test of all transitions:
Love.&quot;</i></b> </p></center>

<p>The University of Manitoba set out to determine which computer hardware
and software would be best for a transition project and ended up finding
out that it was the people who counted...the &quot;humanware&quot;.</p>

<p> This is precisely why intuition is so important in the review process.
Intuition will help with transition.</p>

<p> Of all the supports a human can receive, it is those supports given
in love that are the best. Without love, people just go through the motions.</p>

<H1>Welcome!</H1>

<P>This smiling face belongs to Glenn Olien. He is smiling because he has
developed a new method of going through a major transition. The Unified
Transition Theory is based on this fact: Transition potential equals the
quality of 33 different transition supports.</P>

<P> Glenn Olien has spent sixteen years implementing solutions to employment
problems. In the course of developing his theory for employment purposes,
he realized it applies to all major transitions in life. He has worked
on projects that involved thousands of people and millions of dollars.
He believes, &quot;The greatest human support is other people -- people
connecting with people -- that's the ultimate support.&quot;</P>

<P> Talking to Glenn is a fast-paced and invigorating experience. There's
no time for idle thoughts as Glenn sweeps you up and carries you along
on a tidal wave of information about his Unified TransitionTheory.</P>

<P> What are people saying about Glenn Olien? He has a dedicated group
of believers out there:</P>

<P> 
<HR><I>&quot;Glenn turned Merritt around as far as finding solutions to
employment problems. We came from having no expectations of doing anything
about the problem to viable solutions.&quot;</I><BR>
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>Liz Toulet, Manager<BR>
Canada Employment Center<BR>
Merritt, British Columbia.</P></DIV>

<P><I>&quot;Glenn has done a lot of people a lot of good. He was instrumental
in introducing Supported Work to Western Canada. Thanks to his unique approach,
a lot of people are now employed who did not stand much of a chance. &quot;</I><BR>
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>Vic Cowley, Executive Director<BR>
Cowichan Valley Association for Community Living</P></DIV>

<P><I>&quot;The Unified Employment Theory is the next cornerstone of our
employment program. The theory gives concrete form to what we were doing
intuitively.&quot;</I><BR>
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>Marion Blake<BR>
J.M. Human Services Inc.<BR>
Kelowna, British Columbia</P></DIV>

<P><I>&quot;Glenn guided me all the way through the process of finding
solutions to employment problems for the physically and sensory challenged.
If I hadn't run into Glenn, I don't think the Kamloops 'People in Motion'
would exist today.&quot;</I> </P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>Ed Arntson, Founder<BR>
Kamloops People in Motion Society</P></DIV>

<P><I>&quot;I have followed Glenn's career through the West Kootenays and
I have seen him use employment programs that have also resulted in community
development.&quot;</I> </P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>Doug Findlater, Senior Program Officer<BR>
Multi-Cultural and Citizenship Kelowna, British Columbia</P></DIV>

<P>What does Glenn say about all this praise? With his usual good humor
he laughs, &quot;Hey, after sixteen years, there's bound to be five people
who will say good things about me!&quot;</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Well, there's a <I>lot </I>more than five people saying good things
about Glenn ! In fact, Glenn and his Unified Employment Theory have received
nothing but kudos in the professional community. Glenn is overwhelmed,
&quot;I knew my concept was good and I knew it would have a positive impact
on people, but I have been delighted with such a <I>unanimously </I>positive
response, really delighted.&quot;</P>

<p><b><i>WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?</i></b></p>

<p>There has long been a need to create a new standard to make sense of
the process of making a transition. Transitions may include finding employment,
creating self employment, retirement, corporate or community transitions,
family, attitude or personality transitions.</p>

<p>The bewildering array of ideas concerning a transition is overwhelming
to most people. It is this sense of being overwhelmed that forces people
to focus on only a few avenues of transition. This limited focus results
in limited success. Many ways of experiencing a successful, well rounded
transition are ignored.</p>

<p>The Unified Transition Theory unites the bewildering array of ideas
concerning the process of making a transition into one easily understood
model. This united knowledge changes the feeling of being overwhelmed to
a sense of understanding and empowerment. With this new understanding,
people and organizations are able to use up to 33 different avenues to
transition. People increase their potential for transition by knowing about
and using these avenues to success.</p>

<p>Five statements and a chart create the basis of the theory:</p>

<ul>
<p><LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Those seeking or having the most transition supports have the greatest
potential of experiencing a successful transition.</b></li>

<p>There are 33 transition supports. Transition supports assist a person
in making a transition. They provide the experiences, the physical, mental
and emotional basis to transition.</p>

<li><b>Those not seeking transition supports will not experience a successful,
complete transition.</b></li>

<li><b>Those having &quot;paid for&quot; supports in all areas of their
lives rarely make a successful transition.</b></li>

<p>&quot;Paid for Supports&quot; occurs when someone (or a system) is paying
for transition support.</p>

<li><b>Most transition supports deteriorate in direct proportion to the
amount of time spent attempting to make the transition.</b></li>

<li><b>The greater the transition, the greater the need for diverse transition
supports.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center SIZE=3></p>

<center><p>The 33 transition supports are divided into 3 categories:</p></center>

<ol>
<p><LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Paid for transition supports.</b></li>

<p>These cost money. They stop working when the payment stops.</p>

<p><LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Unpaid or &quot;natural&quot; transition supports.</b></li>

<p>These are people who provide assistance. They do not require payments,
and their support can last a lifetime.</p>

<p><LH></LH></p>

<li><b>Personal attributes.</b></li>

<p>These are traits such as personality, education, work history, self
esteem.</p>

<p><b><i>WHY DOES THIS WORK?</i></b></p>

<p> The Unified Transition Theory<sup>TM</sup> provides a believable, logical
framework for individuals and organizations to manage change. Ownership
is immediate, yet progress inspired by the model will last a lifetime.
As change is constant in our personal and professional lives a method to
improve our ability to make successful transitions is invaluable. Succcessful
transitions progress faster and smoother when the necessary supports for
transitions are in place.</p>

<p>However, in some situations, transition supports can be barriers to
transition. Recognizing when these supports are barriers and dealing with
them is a critical factor in making a successful transition.</p>

<p> The first step is recognizing the barriers. The second step is attempting
to convert the barrier to a transition support. This may not always be
possible. It may be better to do nothing than to cause harm. For example:
It is necessary to find out exactly what will happen to current income
and additional supports before proceeding with a transition program.</p>

<p> The Unified Transition Theory takes into consideration all of the
potential barriers to transition identified by a Statistics Canada study,
 and more. The Unified Transition Theory considers 33 possible barriers
to transition.</p>

<p> Over a 16 year period, I've made funding recommendations for over 1,200
transition programs. There were many factors in determining the success
of any transition project, but what was the most critical factor? <b>People!</b>
The most successful transitions involve <i>supporting </i>a person in their
development of 33 possible transition supports. <b>NO </b>other factor
is as critical.</p>

<p> A similar conclusion was made in a 1994 study by the University of
Manitoba, of 139 computer based transition projects. It reported:</p>

<center><p> <b><i>&quot;There is one final acid test of all transitions:
Love.&quot;</i></b> </p></center>

<p>The University of Manitoba set out to determine which computer hardware
and software would be best for a transition project and ended up finding
out that it was the people who counted...the &quot;humanware&quot;.</p>

<p> This is precisely why intuition is so important in the review process.
Intuition will help with transition.</p>

<p> Of all the supports a human can receive, it is those supports given
in love that are the best. Without love, people just go through the motions.</p>

<P>Located four km from the world renowned Wells Gray Provincial Park, the
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#008000">Lorien Guest Cottage</FONT></I></B> is a perfect
year round base for your wilderness holiday.  Although nicely secluded, the <I><B><FONT
COLOR="#008000">Lorien Guest Cottage</FONT></B></I> is close to facilities for
shopping and dining.  Guided activities such as trail riding, walking, canoeing,
mushing and rafting are also offered nearby.  In both July and August park
naturalists are available to give  presentations on natural history topics and
guide groups on interpretive hikes.</P>

us regarding the suitability of your pet.</P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+2">RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE
AREA</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>The Wells Gray Provincial Park is a huge wilderness area of some half
million hectares offering something of delight and interest to all nature lovers
and outdoors  people.  </P>
<P>Some two hundred bird species, fifty mammal species and hundreds of species
of plants and trees offer exceptional study and observation possibilities.</P>
<P>Mountains, canyons, lava flows, waterfalls and lakes, alpine meadows and
virtually untouched and unexplored hinterland offer a wonderful retreat from the
noise and bustle of daily life.</P>
<P>Recreational activities in the Clearwater and Wells Gray Park are as many
and varied as visitors care to make them.</P>
<P>To a large degree the seasons determine the types of activity over the year.
 Winter brings out the cross country, back country and high country skiers, the
snow shoers and dog sledders, and those who find joy in the profound stillness
of the forest in snow.  Summer offers hikers and bikers the trails, while the
lakes and rivers call to the canoeists, kayakers and rafters among us.  Birders
and botanists tend to pick their own seasons while photographers, writers and
painters find inspiration throughout the year.  Fall is particularly beautiful
in the mixed forest.  The area offers so much over such a broad loom, that there
is truly something to suit everyone's interests and activities.</P>

make money.  If you're a seller, you have to be in the right price range to get
the buyer to your door, but also to allow them to pay the price and make a wage
plus profit.</P>

The economy of hot in-place recycling is unmatched by any other rehabilitation process while still offering the most environmentally friendly method of resurfacing paved roads.<BR><P></P>

<B>TWO-STAGE TECHNOLOGY</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="pyrobar2.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=32><BR><P><P><BR></P></P>
Two-stage recycling means the sequential heating and removing of two separate layers of asphalt in one continuous operation.

Chief among the benefits of two-stage recycling at the 2 to 2-1/2 inch depths achievable are the speed and convenience of operation, the lack of damage to asphalt properties, the excellent ride quality of the finished surface, and the substantial cost savings.

The Pyropaver 300E is the culmination of years of practical experience by the creators of the two-stage process technology and represents the cutting edge of hot in-place asphalt recycling.

The Pyropaver 300E is the first hot in-place asphalt recycling system to operate virtually smoke free which means that even urban areas are now able to utilize hot in-place recycling without jeopardizing air quality.

<B>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="pyrobar2.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=32><BR><P><BR></P>
<IMG SRC="pyro6.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0>Material savings are a major benefit of pyropaving. Pyropaving reduces construction-caused emissions. Ninety percent of the fuel used by the Pyropaver 300E is propane which is a very clean-burning energy source.

Delayed traffic is another source of atmospheric emissions and a cause of increased fuel consumption. A pyropaver train is the least difficult disruption for motorists. It creates the shortest traffic delay of all resurfacing methods. 

A conservative comparison of rehabilitation options is shown in the following table and it is evident that Pyropaver two-stage hot in-place recycling has an undeniable impact on the future of these precious non-renewable resources.

<B>ECONOMIC BENEFITS</B>
<IMG SRC="pyrobar2.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=32><BR><P><P><BR></P></P>

There are three major reasons for the substantial savings created by pyropaving, all of which are possible because of the effectiveness and efficiency of the two-stage Pyropaver process:

- Little or no oil or aggregate must be purchased
- Process is usually used only for traveled lanes
- No barrier removals or curb alterations are needed

The timely use of pyropaving to remedy poor pavement conditions is a cost-effective option for the government jurisdiction.

Municipal roads and streets are excellent candidates for hot in-place recycling. The Pyropaver 300E causes minimal disruption for the business owner because the train moves quickly through the neighborhood and requires no subsequent construction to cause further delays.<BR><P></P>

<B>PYROPAVING APPLICATIONS</B>
<IMG SRC="pyrobar2.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=32><BR><P><P><BR></P></P>

Pyropaving can be done for many types of surface distress. The Pyropaver 300E will interrupt surface cracking, raveling and rutting. Although it can be used as a stand-alone maintenance alternative, the design engineer may also use the Pyropaver to recycle the bottom lift and place virgin hot mix for the final lift.
<BR><P></P>
<B>ENGINEERING CONSIDERATIONS</B>
<IMG SRC="pyrobar2.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=32><BR><P><P><BR></P></P>

The Pyropaver 300E has been designed to give pavement engineers maximum flexibility in asphalt mix design changes depending on deficiencies found in the lab test. Penetration and viscosity values of the asphalt cement can be modified easily by the addition of an appropriate amount of rejuvenating agent. If mix design values require improvement, this can be done by adding the appropriate add mixture aggregate to improve the gradation.

Club to provide a spawning bed for the rainbow trout. During the
spring months this creek provides a multitude of trout with an
area to deposit their eggs.

insurance.    Your policy would be modified to suit your needs for dental and
medical for your small business, but you will receive the benefits of the whole
group - ie. BC Chamber of Commerce members.  As a result, your premiums are very
affordable which makes sense for small business.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE>

<font size=2><font face=arial,helvetica color=#000000>
Dean Medical Center is the medical care component of Dean Health System.
 "Dean Clinic" as it was originally called, has its roots in southern Wisconsin,
 serving patients since 1904. Dean Medical Center currently has 315 providers
 at 22 locations in Madison and throughout Dane and Rock counties, providing
 primary and specialty care to more than 200,000 patients.

<font size=2 face=arial,helvetica><font color=#000000>
Dean Health Plan, the DHS managed care component, was created in 1983.
 Since then, it has grown into one of the largest and more diversified health
 maintenance organizations in the midwest. Dean Health Plan contracts with nearly 1000
 physician providers (including DHS physicians and other network providers),
 21 hospitals and 200 pharmacies in a 17-county area.

Dean Foundation is a non-profit research and education entity established
 in 1986. The Foundation currently encompasses Dean's Educational Sevices
 Department; supports community service and health education projects;

<b>Dean/St. Marys Regional Clinics--</b>Through a joint venture of Dean
Medical Center and St. Marys Hospital Medical Center, also of Madison,
a management structure has been established to oversee almost 50 primary care
 providers throughout a 10-county area. These "affiliated clinics" provide
 a strong referral base for subspecialty services provided by Dean and St. Marys.
 This joint venture also oversees the operation of two ambulatory surgery
 centers, one in Madison and one in Janesville.

<p>
<b>Retail Services--</b> DHS provides convenient in-clinic pharmacy and
optical services. Also available are extensive physical therapy and physical
rehabilitation services, including our Work Well Program. Through a
combination of job-task simulation, aerobic conditioning and educational
programs, this program focuses on work hardening for those injured on the job.

<p>

<b><A HREF=http://www.velocity.com>Velocity Healthcare Informatics, Inc.</A></b> is a computer software company
based in Minneapolis and a subsidiary of DHS. Measuring the results of
medical care from the patient's perspective is a breakthrough concept being
put to work across the United States. The continuing growth of managed care,
demand for lower costs and demonstrable quality, along with initiatives to
reshape the healthcare systems, spurs the drive toward patient-centered
outcomes. Founded in 1993, Velocity is the first U.S. company to provide
comprehensive solutions for patient-centered outcomes management.
Velocity has more than 80 clinics, hospitals and managed care organizations
using its products and services.

Lifesteps (Adult weight loss program)<BR>
</B>Manage your weight for the rest of your life!<BR>
Many weight loss plans can help you lose weight initially, but they don't focus on permanently changing your eating behavior. Many are nutritionally   unbalanced or impractical to follow long term. For these reasons, it can be very difficult to keep off the weight that you've tried so hard to lose. If you   really want to lose weight and keep it off -- to look better, feel better and enjoy a healthier lifestyle -- Lifesteps: Weight Management is for you.<BR>
<P>
Lifesteps is a comprehensive weight management program that stresses the importance of diet, physical activity and behavior modification techniques for weight loss. Lifesteps is taught at Dean Medical Center by Registered Dietitians along with Physical Therapists and Clinical Counselors. It's a program of realistic goals that you set and can achieve, and you'll have a support system of people who, like you, are determined to manage their weight for the rest of their lives. Additionally, all participants will be screened for psychological factors which might be interfering with successful weight loss. If identified, appropriate referrals will be facilitated.<BR>
<P>
Lifesteps includes 15 class sessions over a six-month period, plus a pre- and post-session personal assessment. Group classes are offered every spring and fall. <I>
For more information, call 608-252-8166.<BR>

Crash Helmet wins National Award</B></I><BR>
Crash Helmet proudly earned the first PACE (Public Affairs and Community Education) Gold Communicator Award of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. Nominated by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, Crash recently traveled to Indianapolis with Neurosurgeon Steven M. Toutant, M.D., to accept the honor. <BR>

<H2><B>Automated Clinical Trials (ACT)</B></H2>
<P>
Automated Clinical Trials (ACT) is a computer database management system that tracks and controls clinical trial data.  Designed with the flexibility to adjust to diverse and changing drug study protocols, this system ensures that all data are entered and consistent with protocol parameters.  Developed from the end-user perspective, ACT focuses on the needs of the principal investigators, study coordinators and study monitors.<BR>
<P>
<I>
<UL>
ACT enhances data integrity, decreases data entry time and improves trial monitoring and reduces time to market. 
</UL>
</I>
<P>
As a complete Remote Data Entry (RDE) system, ACT provides customized screens, case note access, data transmission, early reporting capabilities and data extraction tools.  ACT is designed to replace all other user alternatives in the clinical trial process.<P>

<P>

ACT takes the familiar format of the paper-based system and enhances its functionality with standardized error checking across fields, forms and visits.  Because the majority of data collection errors occur with adverse events, concomitant medications and concurrent illnesses, ACT resolves these errors through a combination of unique interface design and standardized error checking.<BR>
<P>
<I>
<UL>
ACT is a complete front-end data entry system that collects clinical trial data and delivers it to the sponsor's database in the format desired.<BR>
</UL>
</I>
<P>
Physicians, study coordinators, study monitors and patients all interact with ACT.  Investigator sites and pharmaceutical companies will be priority users who rely on feedback from the system to evaluate a patient's and a study's progress.  Physicians and study coordinators will perform data-entry.  Physicians, study coordinators and study monitors use ACT to identify missing or inconsistent data.  Patients can respond to computer versions of rating scales and other self-report questionnaires. <BR>
<P>
Because Dean Foundation also conducts clinical trials, we understand the issues, needs and concerns that are important to investigators.  Our clinical trials system group can provide individualized consulting on interface design and customization of ACT for any clinical trial.  This assistance can address both hardware and software implementation and training. <BR>
<P>
For more information on ACT,  please contact the software systems department at 1-800- 844-6015.

<H2><B>Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</B></H2>
<P>
<I>
What is IVR?</I><BR>
<P>
IVR, Interactive Voice Response, is the term used to describe a computer's ability to interpret touch tone or speech input and respond with prerecorded or digitized voice over a standard telephone line.<BR>
<P>
<I>
What is an Interview Driver?<BR>
</I>
<P>
An Interview Driver is a program that enables individuals without computer programming expertise to develop an IVR system which asks questions, branches, based on responses and provides customized feedback.  Dean Foundation has developed a sophisticated IVR Interview Driver that permits the rapid development of IVR administered interviews.  Combined with the clinical expertise of Dean Foundation physicians, it is possible to quickly create clinical interviews, monitoring modules and treatment systems that can be administered via telephone.<BR>
<P>
<I>
What are the advantages of IVR Interviews?<BR>
</I><P>
IVR Interviews provide greater access to target populations via ubiquitous touch tone telephones.  IVR systems centralize data storage but have the ability to transfer individual or summary information via fax, modem or pager.  From all clinical perspectives, the opportunities for remote monitoring, interviewing and treatment are substantial.<BR>

<H2><B>Telephone Assessment Program (TAP)</B></H2>
<P>
Dean Foundation created a Telephone Assessment Program (TAP) for CoCensys which is an on-line, computer-administered Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) for psychiatrists to use with their OCD patients.  It also includes the Patient Global Impressions (PGI) scale as well.  This program provides a fast, confidential report of the scores on a regular basis, along with the drug dosage, that is mailed to physicians.  Using a computer-telephone method eliminates time-consuming, in-office administration.  It optimizes time spent with patients during the office visit.  The reports graphically depict the impact of changes in drug tritation, providing clear and easy means of tracking effectiveness of CoCensys' Anafranil&reg; treatment regimen.  It also allows patients to take the test in a less stressful environment.  The CoCensys Telephone Assessment Program provides psychiatrists with the ability to offer their OCD patients a value-added service to augment their drug therapy. <BR>
<P>
For more information, psychiatrists should contact their CoCensys representative.<BR>

Helping Technology Help People<P>
<P>
	<I>
Purpose.  </I> To provide clinicians, researchers, managed care organizations and pharmaceutical companies with direct patient-computer interviews and gather and give essential information for screening, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of medical and psychiatric disorders.  Treatment programs empower the largest untapped resource in health care--the patient.  This approach emphasizes self-help, where that element is critical in producing good outcomes and providing timely feedback to clinicians on their patients' status as treatment progresses.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Rationale.  </I>Value in health care, as in most things can be represented as the ratio of quality over cost (V=Q/C).  The cost component of the equation is relatively easy to determine.  Quality has many dimensions and is more difficult to define.  While excellent assessment instruments for clinical symptomatology and quality of life are available,  their application through clinicians is limited due to the cost, poor reliability and accuracy, and time constraints.<BR>
<P>
Direct patient-computer interviewing began 30 years ago.  Computer interviews are accurate, reliable and highly acceptable to patients--sometimes even preferred to human interviews.  They can be administered by desktop computers or Interactive Response technology which makes this approach accessible to anyone with a touch tone telephone. Computer interviews help optimize medical care by having computers do what they do best: systematically gather accurate and reliable data.  Clinicians are freed to do what they do best: form relationships with patients and assessing all data for the patients' benefit.  Data collected by computer can provide feedback to the patient, reports to the clinician and a platform from which to make informed management decisions.<BR>
<P>
Development of interviews for screening, diagnosis and monitoring involves deciding the domain to be assessed, identifying candidate measures, modifying those selected for computer administration and evaluating them in relevant populations.  This process can be completed in three months.  Treatment programs use written and computer media and are authored by recognized experts on each disorder/disease.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Technology.  </I>All interviews are conducted by the sophisticated Parameter Driven Interview Driver&trade; (PDID&trade;) and are platform independent.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Principals.  </I>John H. Greist, M.D. has developed and evaluated computer interviews for 28 years.  James J.  Jefferson, M.D., Ken Kobak, Ph.D. and Keith Wenzel, B.S. have worked with Dr. Greist in this field for more than a decade.  They are supported by a staff of 20. <BR>
<P>

"FOR SUCCESSFUL CLINICAL RESEARCH, <BR>
	INVESTIGATE THE DEAN FOUNDATION."</B><BR>
<P>
<B>
Experience and Dedication to Research</B><P>
</CENTER><P>
<P>
Dean Foundation utilizes the resources of the Dean Medical Center, one of the nation's largest multi-specialty group practices, with 40 southern Wisconsin clinic locations.  Dean has more than 350 Dean physicians, approximately 150 in primary care, representing nearly 50 specialties.<BR>
<P>
Dean Medical Center's/St. Marys Hospital Medical Center's Regional Affiliated Clinic program encompasses more than a dozen of these southern Wisconsin locations.  A wide range of specialties and extensive patient base allows for a diverse range of study topics.  Since 1904, Dean has come to embody medical and scientific vision and commitment.  The excitement that comes with research has long held strong appeal for Dean's physicians and investigators.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Quality Clinical Trials</B><BR>
<P>
All clinical trial studies are conducted under the direction of Dean Foundation's experienced, research-oriented investigators.  A wide variety of studies covering many medical disciplines are conducted.  Fully accredited and professionally trained staff include full-time study coordinators and Registered Nurses.  Dean Foundation has many well-published research physicians who have worked with the country's leading pharmaceutical companies including Eli Lilly, Ciba-Geigy, Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and Abbott Laboratories.<BR>
<P>
The fine-tuned focus on clinical research, combined with experience, ensures that each research study conducted at Dean Foundation is completed in a timely, professional, confidential and cost-effective manner.  In addition, the quality of the data gathered meets the highest professional standards.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Dean Institutional Review Board (IRB)</B><BR>
<P>
The Dean IRB was established in 1991 under the guidance of the Food and Drug Administration for the protection of human subjects in research.  This board is available to review outpatient research being conducted within Dean Health Systems.  Meetings are held on an as-needed basis.  All clinical trials are given prompt, expert and thorough review by this on-site IRB.  See <B>Current Events: Research Studies Needing Participants</B> for a listing of open clinical drug trials in the recruitment stage. <BR>
<P>
Co-Chairs for this Board are Zorba Paster, M.D. and David Hahn, M.D.  The administrative manager is Cindy Way.  <BR>
<B>
<P>
Extensive Patient Base<BR>
<P>
</B>
The population pool available to Dean Foundation investigators is a base of more than 200,000 pediatric, adolescent, adult and geriatric patients.  Dean Medical Center's multi- site patient base offers a highly accurate population representation - it is not restricted to those persons typically found in a university town setting.  In addition, Dean Medical Center carries out more than 650,000 physician visits annually.<BR>
<B>
<P>
Modern, Easily Accessible Facilities<BR>
<P>
</B>
Dean Medical Center's 40 locations throughout south central Wisconsin provide convenient and ready access to quality health care.  In addition, two Urgent Care Centers offer state-of-the-art emergency treatment.<BR>
<P>
Dean Clinic, a modern 169,000 square foot facility, is Dean Medical Center's convenient main location.  Primary and specialty patient care services are located in the main clinic including radiology, physical therapy, oncology facilities and a computerized tomography and imaging department.  This clinic also houses a central pharmacy and state-certified treadmill and pulmonary function laboratories.  Several multi-specialty clinical research coordinators are also based at this site.<BR>
<P>
Dean Foundation is affiliated with St. Marys Hospital Medical Center in Madison, a 350- bed tertiary care hospital.  Inpatient studies are conducted at this site.<BR>
<P>
Dean Foundation's administration, psychiatric drug studies and Information Centers are housed in a separate facility on Madison's far west side.  This site also has an in-house lab and EKG services to better serve clients.<BR>
<P>
All of these facilities are located on city bus lines for easy access.<BR>
<P>
<B>A Site Conducive to Clinical Research</B><BR>
<P>
Due to the academic and investigative minds attracted by the University of Wisconsin, one of the nation's finest educational institutions, Madison is a center for biomedical and other research.  As the state capital, Madison typifies the best of the Midwest.  With its population of 200,000+, it is Wisconsin's second-largest city.<BR>
<P>
Madison is an easy-to-reach destination.  The Dane County Regional Airport is served by several major airlines.  By car, Madison is less than three hours from Chicago and an hour-and-a-half from Milwaukee.<BR>
<P>
Madison offers an ideal, congenial site conducive to clinical research.  This progressive city has many fine hotels, restaurants, theaters, museums, sports and beautiful parks.  Madison is noted for its four scenic lakes and their attendant water sports.<BR>
<P>
The work ethic and pride in a job well done are alive and well here in southern Wisconsin.  These qualities are invaluable to successful research when you consider the importance of each individual worker involved in any aspect of a project.  Now that you've investigated the Dean Foundation, please call us when you need to conduct your next clinical trial.<BR>

<H2><B>Information for Prospective Participants</B></H2>
<P>
<B>
Why should you participate in a clinical research trials?</B><BR>
<P>
By becoming involved as a clinical research participant, you will have the opportunity to benefit from unique, state-of-the-art methods of care.  And in the process, you will be helping to enhance the quality of life for future patients, too.<BR>
<P>
<B>
What is a clinical trial?</B><BR>
<P>
A clinical trial is a study conducted with patients, usually to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug or new medical device or treatment.  Each study is designed to answer scientific questions, and to find new and better ways to help patients.<BR>
<P>
The doctors who conduct clinical trials follow a carefully designed treatment plan called a "protocol."  A protocol specifies the medications, dosages, and length of treatment, and details such matters as frequency of visits, and which tests will be required to monitor progress.<BR>
<P>
Of course, all Dean Foundation studies are designed to safeguard the medical and psychological health of patients, in addition to providing answers to research questions.  Medications used in treatment are strictly monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency that approves all medications used in the United States.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Why are clinical trials important?</B><BR>
<P>
Clinical trials are important because advances in medicine and science are the result of new ideas and new approaches developed through research.  New drugs and treatments must prove to be safe and effective in a certain number of patients before they can be made widely available.  Many new treatments are designed on the basis of what has worked in the past, in an effort to improve the results.<BR>
<P>
The search for safe, effective medication begins with basic research in the laboratory and animal studies.  If the results are highly promising, they are then applied to patient studies.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Who benefits from a clinical trial?</B><BR>
<P>
All Dean Foundation clinical trials are comprised of volunteer patients.  People choose to participate for many different reasons.<BR>
<P>
As you might imagine, many people take part to improve their personal health picture.  They may hope for a cure to a disease, to live longer, or feel better.  Many others wish to contribute to a research effort that may help others in the future.<BR>
<P>
Patients in clinical trials are among the first to receive new research treatments or drugs before they are widely available.  Thus, they have the first opportunity to benefit from them.<BR>
<P>
All patients are carefully monitored during and after a trial.  They become part of an invaluable network of researchers and physicians who pool their ideas and knowledge from many disciplines.  The patients in our studies receive the benefit of their combined expertise.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Will I be paid to participate?</B><BR>
<P>
Some drug studies offer compensation to participants.  Oftentimes, studies provide access to free medical and laboratory evaluations or costly medications.  And if a study involves a number of clinic visits or involved procedures, patients are likely to receive financial compensation for their time and effort.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Are there risks or side effects?</B><BR>
<P>
With any new drug, there may be risks as well as possible benefits.  Because clinical trials involve research into new areas of treatment, the risks cannot always be known ahead of time.  The Dean Foundation makes every effort to determine what those risks might be.<BR>
<P>
The drugs and treatments used can sometimes cause side effects, depending on the type of drug and the patient's own condition.  Side effects vary from patient to patient, just as they do with standard treatments and standard prescribed medications.<BR>
<P>
<B>
What is informed consent?</B><BR>
<P>
Informed consent means that, as a patient, you are provided with complete information about what is to be involved in the trial.  This information includes such issues as the purpose of the trial, potential benefits and risks, number and type of visits or procedures required, those responsible for the study, and how to get more information.<BR>
<P>
Informed consent is required in all studies that are conducted within the Foundation.  The nature of the treatment is fully explained by the doctors and nurses in the trial.  You are given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully.  You are encouraged to ask questions so you can decide freely to take part in the trial or not.  If you agree, you can sign the form.  Of course, you may also decline participation.<BR>
<P>
<B>
What if I miss a visit or test?</B><BR>
<P>
Participants are assigned a schedule of visits and tests in the consent form.  The timing of these is critical to the research, since there are often time constraints specified in the research protocols.<BR>
<P>
Lab and x-ray tests are often the way that the progress of the research is measured and safety levels are monitored.  It is therefore important that these tests not be missed.<BR>
<P>
The results of laboratory and other tests required by a protocol become a part of the participant's medical records.<BR>
<P>
If a participant cannot make a visit, it is important that the study coordinator or other person specified be contacted in advance.  When calling in, it is necessary to identify yourself as a research participant.<BR>
<P>
<B>
What about confidentiality?</B><BR>
<P>
During the study, complete confidentiality of your records will be maintained.  You will be identified by a number or initials - never by your name.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Are there strict guidelines?</B><BR>
<P>
There are a few basic guidelines that help ensure successful research.  They include:<BR>
<P>
	-- Follow labeled directions on investigational drugs exactly.<BR>
	-- Notify personnel of any adverse reactions.<BR>
	-- Inform research team of all current medications.<BR>
	-- Return all unused investigational medications.<BR>
	-- Keep accurate records in the diary cards.<BR>
	-- Get instructions from the team if you miss a dose/treatment.<BR>
<P>
<B>
What happens if you decide to participate?</B><BR>
<P>
If you are interested in becoming part of a clinical trial, you will first be screened for eligibility.  Next, you will be asked to sign the consent form, which provides details about the research.  You will also be assigned a contact person.<BR>
<P>
<B>
What if you decide to leave a clinical trial?</B><BR>
<P>
Participation in research is voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.  A follow up visit is necessary upon termination to assess your health status.  All unused drugs must be returned.  You can then resume your regular care routine.<BR>
<P>
<B>
Terms encountered in clinical trials:<BR>
<P>
</B>	
<I>
Adverse Event (Side effect) </I>  A secondary and usually undesirable effect from a drug or treatment.  Nausea is a common example.<BR>
<P><I>
Blind or Double Blind Study</I> A study design in which patients do not know whether they are receiving the medication being tested, a control medication or a placebo.  A study in which neither patients nor research team knows is referred to as double blind.  Performed to eliminate the possibility of bias in reporting results.  Of course, in an emergency, a treatment can be easily and quickly identified.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Case Report Form</I>  Form developed by sponsor or investigator on which all data are transmitted to the sponsor and subsequently to the FDA.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Clinical Research Associate (CRA)</I>  Term used to designate the person who administratively supervises clinical investigators, always performing some of this supervision in the field.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Clinical Trial</I>  Systematic investigation of the effect of materials or methods, completed according to a formal study plan.  Done in a human population with a particular disease.  Treatment methods, prevention, detection, or diagnosis are possible subjects for study.<BR>
<P>
<I>
Control Group</I>  Refers to the group of patients that receive the "standard" treatment: the prevailing and considered effective treatment.

<P>
Introduction</B><P>

Dean Medical Center provides a variety of Patient Advocacy and Community Service programs designed to help our patients receive high quality health care when they need it.<P>

<P>
<A NAME="patient_advocate"></A>
<B>
Patient Advocate</B><P>

Our Patient Advocate is available to patients who are having difficulty getting their question or problem addressed.  Patients are encouraged to direct their questions to the departments or areas where their questions arise.  However, Dean's Patient Advocate is available to make sure patients are getting those answers when necessary.  The Patient Advocate regularly meets with physicians and medical directors regarding the more involved matters that sometimes arise. The Patient Advocate can be reached by phone at 608-252-7777. <P>

<P>

At Dean Medical Center, we recognized that patients often need answers to a variety of complicated questions.  In some cases we have found that patients who are uninsured or underinsured often simply put off receiving care, only to later appear at an emergency room or urgent care facility with a critical need.<P>

<P>

The key element of our Dean Advocacy and Community Service efforts to remove this barrier is health benefits counseling.  This involves helping patients find the financial assistance they need, either through existing programs or working with them through our own charity care program.<P>

<P>
<A NAME="dean_community"></A>
<B>
Dean Community Care Program and Community Care Fund</B><P>

This innovative advocacy and health benefits counseling program assists our uninsured patients in finding access to resources that can help them meet their medical debt.<P>

<P>

The goal of Dean Community Care is to assist patients in determining if they are eligible for a number of public assistance sources which include Healthy Start, Social Security Disability benefits, as well as a variety of other medial assistance resources.<P>

<P>

Interested patients are encouraged to complete a Dean Community Care application.  Applications can be obtained at any Dean Patient Service Desk or by calling <P>

(608) 283-7358.<P>

<P>

Once the application is filed:<P>

<P>

a trained health benefits counselor will review the application to determine if the applicant should be accessing a program.  If so, the counselor will assist the patient in understanding their rights and responsibilities within that program.<P>

<P>

if the patient is not eligible for a public assistance source, the application will be considered for temporary assistance through the Dean Community Care Fund.  Eligibility for assistance through the fund is based on income.  The Dean Community Care Fund is intended to serve as a temporary assistance source that can help with some of the Dean physician-related costs of a patient's care.<P>

Presumptive Eligibility is a state Medicaid program intended to assist pregnant patients in accessing benefits early in their pregnancy.  The intent is to encourage women to seek early and consistent prenatal care.<P>

<P>

Patients may sign up for Presumptive Eligibility benefits at any Dean Medical Center location:<P>

<P>

Sign-up takes place at the Patient Service Desk and generally takes about ten minutes.<P>

<A NAME="1.a"></A>
<B>Important information about Managed Care</B>
<P>
<P>Managed care is becoming a focal point in today's health 
care industry.  The goal of managed care is to help promote a 
healthy environment for all the members.  This is why managed 
care plans offer such  a wide scope of preventive health 
services, such as annual routine physicals, immunizations, health 
screenings and general health education for members.
<P>Many managed care plans provide care in a geographic 
area through health care providers that have agreed on 
standardized payments and medical services. These providers form a 
network that members can use.
<P>Primary care providers are often utilized to manage 
members' health care.  To ensure that members are receiving quality 
care, managed care plans review patient care to determine 
medical necessity and appropriateness of services.  Often case 
management or utilization review programs are used to 
redirect medical care that may not be as effective. In 
situations like this, an alternative approach is suggested to meet the 
goals of providing effective, efficient care for a reasonable cost.
<P>Managed care plans may be structured differently.  Our 
managed care plans are outlined below.
<P><B>HMO</B> (health maintenance organization) plans require 
members to use the provider network established for all of their 
health care. They must select a primary care provider (PCP) and 
may need to follow a referral process to receive care from 
someone other than the PCP. Referrals allow the HMO plan to 
monitor the member's care when receiving treatment from 
another provider.
<P><B>Point of Enrollment and Point of Service</B> plans allow 
members to use health care providers who are part of the provider 
network (plan providers) as well as health care providers who are not 
part of the provider network (non-plan providers). Members 
under these plans are not required to select PCPs and do not have 
any referral requirements on their plans.  There are prior 
approval requirements; however, that must be followed for 
certain services. The prior approval process is another step in 
managing members' care.
<A NAME="1.b"></A>
<P><B>Important information about Dean Health Plan</B>
<P>
<P>Dean Health Plan began business operations in 1983.  In 
our first full year of business, we began with 18,000 members.  
Our enrollment today consists of over 150,000 members and 
a service area of over 850 providers in 17 counties 
throughout South Central Wisconsin.  Our main clinic affiliation is with 
the Dean Medical Center, which is one of the 25 largest 
multi-specialty clinics in the nation.  
<P>Because quality health care for our members is important to 
us, we take great care to ensure that members have quality 
health care providers from which to choose.  This is done through 
our provider credentialing and recredentialing process.  Before 
a provider is approved to participate in our network, we 
will verify their education background, work experience, 
malpractice insurance and licensing information.  We also 
 ensure that they have hospital privileges at a plan 
hospital which would allow them to treat our members.
<P>Once providers have joined our network, we will 
recredential them at a minimum of every two years to ensure that they 
have maintained the proper credentials to practice.  We will also 
re-verify the same information from the initial 
credentialing process.  In addition, during a plan provider's 
recredentialing we will review any member concerns we received 
regarding that provider.  The process may seem complex but we believe 
it is necessary to maintain the highest quality providers in 
our network.
<P>We are continuously striving to improve our service to 
our members, so please be sure to let us know if you have 
any questions or concerns.

<A NAME="2.a"></A>
<B>Health Maintenance</B>
<P>
<P>The old saying, &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound 
of cure.&quot; is vital to living a healthy life.
<P>Maintaining good health means being informed about 
the health issues that may affect you, and understanding the 
health maintenance tests and exams you may need.  Screening 
tests and physician counseling are important tools for 
identifying common yet potentially serious injuries, illnesses, 
and diseases that can be prevented or cured with early 
intervention.
<P>Dean Health Plan has established a set of minimum 
health maintenance guidelines for primary care practices.  
Health maintenance can occur during any visit with your 
primary care physician.
<P>We all have different health care needs, so ask your 
primary care provider what is the most appropriate health 
maintenance care for you and your family.
<P>
<B>Patient Question and Answers</B>
<P>
<B><I>Why do health screening?</B></I><BR>
Research shows that a significant amount of injury, illness 
and death may be prevented by following a few medical 
guidelines.  These guidelines use patient counseling, 
immunization (shots), physical examination and laboratory testing in the screening process.
<P>
<B><I>Why have these guidelines been chosen?</B></I><BR>
The current guidelines are based on a report from the 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.  These guidelines 
were scientifically proven to be effective in preventing some 
injury, illness and death.
<P>
<B><I>Are these guidelines different from recommendations by other health groups?</B></I><BR>
Yes.  The current screening guidelines represent a 
minimum of preventive measures which have been proven to be 
effective.  Other health groups may recommend 
different guidelines which are not as strongly proven.  
However, additional screening measures or variations from the 
guidelines may be appropriate and should be discussed 
with your physician.
<P>
<B><I>What if my health changes?  Should I wait for my 
next scheduled screening before seeing my physician?</B></I><BR>
No!  These guidelines have been proven to decrease illness, 
but do not guarantee you will remain healthy.  Any 
significant change in your health should be reported to your 
physician immediately.  For example, if a woman detects a breast 
lump between mammogram screenings, she should not wait until 
her next mammogram to bring this to the attention of her physician.
<P>
<A NAME="2.b"></A>
<B>Adult Health Maintenance Guidelines</B>
<P>
<P>The following ten health maintenance procedures are recommended by Dean Health Plan because they have proven value in preventing illness or injury, or because effective treatment is available for early detection. <B><I>Consult your physician about other health maintenance procedures 
which he or she may recommend</B></I>.
<P><B>Blood Pressure</B><BR>
An inflatable cuff is used to measure the pressure of 
blood flowing through an artery in your arm.  
Excessively high blood pressure can cause strokes and heart failure.  All 
adults should have their blood pressure checked as a part of 
every regular exam so that high blood pressure can be detected 
and lowered.  At a minimum, all patients should have their 
blood pressure checked every 1-3 years.
<P>
<B>Pap Smear</B><BR>
A sample of cells is removed from the cervix (opening of 
the uterus) during a female pelvic examination.  The test is 
done to detect abnormal cells before they become cancerous.  
All adult women and sexually-active teens should have 
regular Pap tests. All women age 20-65 should have Pap smears 
done a minimum of every 1-3 years. Pap smears may be 
discontinued after age 65 if documented previous 
screening (minimum of three negative pap tests in last ten years) is normal.
<P>
<B>Smoking Cessation</B><BR>
Dean Health Plan physicians recommend all patients 
quit cigarette smoking and other tobacco use.  Quitting 
smoking can prevent lung cancer and other lung diseases.  
Everyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is advised to quit.
<P>
<B>Mammogram</B><BR>
An X-ray is taken of the female breasts.  The test is done 
to detect breast cancers.  It will detect most, but not all, 
breast cancers before they can be felt.  All women between the 
ages of 50 and 75 should have mammograms performed every 
1-2 years.
<P>
<B>Medical Breast Examination</B><BR>
A physician examines the female breast to check for lumps 
that could be breast cancer.  The test is a supplementary method 
of detecting breast cancers.  All women over the age of 40 
should have medical breast exams yearly by a physician.
<P>
<B>Non-Fasting Total Cholesterol</B><BR>
A sample of blood is drawn at any time (no need to have 
an empty stomach).  The test is to detect excessively high levels 
of blood cholesterol.  Lowering high cholesterol levels 
can decrease the risk of heart attacks.  All adults should 
have cholesterol tests, especially men, and both men and women 
with high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of heart 
disease or who are tobacco users. At a minimum, all patients age 
35-60 should have their cholesterol checked at least once, 
then periodically as appropriate.
<P>
<B>Seat Belt Use</B><BR>
Dean Health Plan physicians recommend all adults always 
use seat belts and other safety devices, such as infant seats 
and bicycle helmets.  Use of seat belts and safety devices can 
prevent death and serious injury from accidents.
<P>
<B>Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccination  </B><BR>
An injection (shot) is given to prevent &quot;lock-jaw,&quot; a serious 
and often fatal paralysis caused by bacteria commonly found in soil. 
 All adults should have the tetanus-diptheria booster 
vaccination every ten years, except those with a known allergy to 
tetanus immunization.
<P>
<B>Influenza Vaccination</B><BR>
An injection (shot) is given to lower the risk of serious or 
fatal influenza (flu), a viral lung infection.  Adults over 65 and 
others with certain diseases should have influenza vaccinations 
every fall.
<P>
<B>Pneumococcal Vaccination</B><BR>
An injection (shot) is given to lower the risk of some (but 
not all) types of pneumonia.  Adults over 65 should have a 
pneumococcal vaccination once. Others with certain 
diseases should have pneumococcal vaccinations as required.
<P>
<A NAME="2.c"></A>
<P><B>Pediatric Health Maintenance Guidelines</B>
<P>
<P>Preventive care is also important for your child's 
health. Research shows that many injuries, illnesses and deaths can 
be prevented by following a few medical guidelines. Dean 
Health Plan has established minimum health maintenance 
guidelines for all children. Consult your child's physician or health 
care provider about other procedures that he or she may recommend.
<P>
<P><B>Neonatal Screening</B><BR>
Neonatal screening is a laboratory test used to detect 
rare, inherited diseases in newborns. These include 
biotinidase, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, congenital 
hypothyrodism, cystic fibrosis, galactosemia, hemoglobinopathies and 
phenylketonuria (PKU). This test is done within the first 
48 hours of age (usually at the hospital) and is required 
by Wisconsin state law.
<P>
<B>Physical Exams</B><BR>
Physical examination of your child is an important way for 
a physician or health care provider to observe your 
child's growth and development. A minimum of five exams 
are required to receive immunizations (shots)  from birth to 
18 months.  Your child should have an annual exam between 
the ages of 2 and 6.  And from ages 7 to 18, your child 
should have an exam every other year. Your child's physician 
or health care provider may wish to increase the number of 
these visits to meet the individual needs of your child.
<P>
<B>Measurements</B><BR>
Your child's height and weight will be measured 
regularly during physical exams. Your child's head circumference 
will be measured until 2 years of age.
<P>
<B>Testing Anemia</B><BR>
A blood sample is taken sometime during the first year of 
age to check for anemia. Anemia in children is usually caused by 
a diet low in iron.
<P>
<B>Blood Pressure</B><BR>
An inflatable cuff is used to measure the pressure of 
blood flowing in your child's arm. Excessively high blood 
pressure can cause heart failure. Beginning at age 3, your child's 
blood pressure should be measured as a part of every 
regular physical exam.
<P>
<B>Eye/Vision Exam</B><BR>
The physician or health care provider will examine 
your child's eyes during the first 18 months to detect 
ocular misalignment (crossed eyes). Your child's vision is 
checked before starting school, (between ages 3-5 years). Other vision screening may be done if a problem is suspected.
<P>
<B>Nutrition and Exercise</B><BR>
What your child eats and how he or she exercises are 
very important for his or her  health. Your child's physician 
or health care provider will discuss diet, nutrition and 
exercise as a part of every regular physical exam.
<P>
<B>Injury Prevention</B><BR>
Dean Health Plan physicians and health care 
providers recommend that all children always use safety devices such 
as seat belts, infant seats, bicycle helmets, as well as other 
 injury prevention devices. The use of safety devices can 
help prevent death and serious injury.  Your child's physician 
or health care provider will counsel and answer 
questions regarding age-appropriate health and safety issues.
<P>
<B>Substance Use</B><BR>
Avoiding  tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs can 
prevent illness, injury and the need for treatment of substance 
abuse. Dean Health Plan physicians and health care providers 
are available to counsel your child about avoiding  
tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. 
<P>
<B>Sexual Counseling</B><BR>
Physicians and health care providers counsel parents 
and adolescents on sexual development and behavior to 
avoid sexually transmitted disease and unintended pregnancy.
<P>
<B>Immunizations (Shots)</B>
<P>Some infectious diseases are preventable through 
routine childhood immunizations. These include 
immunizations against Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (whooping 
cough), Polio, Hemophilus influenzae (H.flu) type B, 
Measles, Mumps, Rubella (German measles) and Hepatitis B. 
These immunizations are needed throughout childhood years.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTP) at 2,4 and 6 
       months and 12 to 18 months old; once between ages 4 
       and 6 years; Tetanus booster (Td) at age 13 and 18 
       years.
<LI>Polio (OPV) at 2,4, and 6 months; once between ages 4 
       and 6 years.
<LI>Hemophilus influenza (HiB) at 2,4, and 6 months old 
       and 12 and 15 months.
<LI>Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) at 12 to 15 
       months old and 4 to 6 years.
<LI>Hepatitis B at birth to 2 months old, 1 to 2 months later 
       and at 6 to 12 months; at age 11 years (if not 
       previously immunized) over a six month period.
</UL>
<P>Written material that explains why these shots are given and 
the benefits and risks of each vaccine are available in 
the physician's or health care provider's office.<BR>

<P><B>Prenatal Care Guidelines </B><BR>
<P><B>Prenatal Care </B>is care that a pregnant woman receives 
before giving birth to help keep herself and her baby healthy. 
Prenatal care during pregnancy includes regular visits to a health 
care provider, tests to identify possible problems, and counseling. 
 Pregnant women who regularly receive prenatal care 
services and follow the advice of their health care provider usually have 
 healthy babies and good health during pregnancy. 
<P>
Dean Health Plan has established minimum guidelines 
for prenatal care.   These guidelines contain the basic care 
that should be given to a woman during pregnancy.  You may 
want to consult your health care provider about additional 
procedures he or she may recommend for you.
<P>
<B><I>Prenatal Health Tests and Procedures</B></I>
<P>
<P>Ideally, the first prenatal visit to a health care provider 
should take place during the first three months 
of pregnancy.  The following services are recommended during pregnancy: 
<P>
<B>Blood Pressure</B><BR> 
High blood pressure can lead to serious problems during 
pregnancy, but it can be  treated.  Blood pressure should 
be checked at every visit.
<P>
<B>Pap Smear  </B><BR>
A pap smear checks for cancer of the cervix (the opening to 
the uterus).  A pap smear should be done at the first prenatal visit 
or when the woman is  due for her yearly pap test.
<P>
<B>Blood and other lab tests: </B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Hemoglobin and Hematocrit</B> (blood tests for low      
       blood iron) should be done often to make sure      
       that a common form of anemia, called Iron Deficiency 
       Anemia does not develop.
<LI> <B>Hepatitis B</B> is a viral infection that can be transmitted       
        from the mother to the baby during childbirth.  Pregnant      
        women should be tested for Hepatatis B using a blood test. 
        Women who have had Hepatitis B in the past should be      
        watched carefully during  pregnancy and special 
       precautions should be taken during childbirth.  
   
<LI><B>Syphilis </B>is a sexually transmitted disease which can      
               be passed by the infected mother to her baby.   If it is not 
               treated, Syphilis can have serious effects  on the      
               mother and baby.  Through a blood test, Syphilis can be      
               detected early and the pregnant woman can be treated      
               right away.  The baby should be watched carefully and      
               treated at birth.
<LI><B>  Rubella testing</B> is a blood test for German Measles.  If a 
               woman has had a Rubella shot in the past, she may not      
               need this blood test.  Always check with your health care 
               provider to see what is right for you. 
<LI><B>  Rh blood typing</B> is done to find out whether a pregnant      
               woman is Rh negative and her baby is Rh positive which 
               could put them at risk for health problems.  An antibody      
               screen blood test should also be done in this situation to      
               make sure there are not other problems that may affect the 
               baby. 
<LI><B>  Alpha-fetoprotein blood testing</B> should be done in between the 15th and 18th week of  pregnancy to make sure the baby's spinal cord and brain are developing properly. 
<LI><B>One hour glucose tolerance test</B>  (a test for sugar in the blood) should be done between the 26th and 28th week of pregnancy.
<LI><B>Urine tests</B> are given to pregnant women because they are 
               more likely to get urine infections.  Urine should be tested 
               regularly for bacteria. Urine is also tested for blood and      
               protein, which can signal health problems for the mother 
               and baby.  
<LI><B> HIV/AIDs testing and counseling </B>should be offered      
               and medical care should follow if the mother and baby      
               are at risk or test positive for HIV.
</UL>
<P>
<I><B>Routine Medications Used During Pregnancy</B></I>
<P>Multivitamins containing folic acid (0.8 to 1 mg) are 
recommended for development of a healthy baby. Ask 
your health care provider what is right for you.
<P><B><I>Tests and Procedures for Special Situations</B></I>
<P>
If a mother's age or background indicates that she may be at 
risk for difficulties with her pregnancy, here are some tests that 
her doctor may recommend.
<P><B>Chorionic Villus Sampling and Amniocentesis </B>
for women age 35 and older should be considered. Chorionic villus sampling 
is a test of the outer sac that surrounds the baby.  Amniocentesis 
is a test of the fluid that surrounds the baby.  These tests can 
help your health care provider determine whether  the baby 
is healthy.   Chorionic villus sampling should be done before 
the 13th week of pregnancy.  Amniocentesis should be 
done between  the 15th and 18th week of pregnancy.
<P><B>Blood Tests</B> for diseases that are common in certain ethnic 
or racial groups should be done.   Check with your health 
care provider if you have questions about these tests.
<P><B><I>Counseling During Pregnancy</B></I>
<P>Pregnancy is a good time for learning about how to improve 
the chances for a healthy baby.  Counseling is recommended in 
the following areas to aid in the healthy development of the 
baby and assure good health for the mother.
<P><B>Nutrition</B>  is very important during pregnancy.  Your      
health care provider should  talk with you about your eating habits and eating a healthy diet.

<P>
<B>Alcohol, Tobacco and other drugs</B> are harmful to the 
unborn baby.   Alcohol and drug counseling are available if needed. 
 Alcohol, tobacco and drugs can cause problems such as 
low birth weight of the baby or a condition called fetal 
alcohol syndrome.  The negative effect that passive smoke (smoke 
we inhale from those around us) has on both the mother and 
the baby is well documented and can be discussed with your 
health care provider.
<P><B>Childbirth Classes</B> are helpful and recommended.
<P><B>Breast Feeding</B> has been proven to be healthy for both 
mother and child.
<P><B>Sexually transmitted disease prevention</B> (safe sex 
behaviors) is an important topic for discussion.
<P><B>Child Care Classes</B> are helpful and recommended.
<P><B>Seat Belts</B> save lives.  Lap and shoulder belt use for the safety 
of the mother is strongly recommended and infant safety car 
seats should be used for the baby.
<P>The goal of these guidelines is to provide each pregnant 
member of Dean Health Plan with prenatal care that will ensure a 
healthy outcome for both the mother and baby.

<B>Your Primary Care Provider</B>
<P>Choosing a primary care physician (PCP) is an 
important decision for you and your family members.  Your PCP is

only exception to this would be in the event of an emergency

your health care and makes decisions such as referring you 
to specialists when necessary.  
<P>When enrolling in your health plan, you may be required 
to select a PCP. Because each family member has 
individual medical needs, you may choose a different PCP for 
each member of your family.  Whenever you need health 
care services, contact your primary care provider or clinic.
<P>If you are enrolling in a Point of Enrollment or Point of 
Service plan, you are not  required to select a PCP; however, 
we recommend that you choose a primary provider for you and 
your family members.
<P>A primary care provider should be a physician who practices 
a general scope of medicine.  A physician who specializes in 
one area of medicine would not be able to treat all of your 
health care needs.  The following physician practices can be selected 
as primary care providers.
<UL>
<P><B>Family Practice:</B> diagnose and treat 
medical conditions for people of all ages with an emphasis 
on family health problems.
<P><B>General Practice:</B> diagnose, treat and 
repair diseases, injuries and disorders for people of all ages.
<P><B>Pediatrics:</B> diagnose and treat diseases of 
children and adolescents and generally manage their health.
<P><B>Internal Medicine:</B> diagnose and treat diseases 
and disorders of the body of adult men and women.
<P><B>Obstetrics/Gynecology:</B> management of care 
during pregnancy, childbirth and disorders unique 
to females.
</UL>
<P>The Provider Directory can help you choose a PCP.  It lists 
all plan providers by city and specialty. PCPs are 
highlighted throughout the directory. Asterisks appearing next to the 
name of a provider means the provider is not accepting new patients 
at this time. Many times if you are already a patient of 
that provider before joining Dean Health Plan, you may still 
select them as your PCP. Our Customer Service Department can 
assist you regarding the status and professional qualifications of 
a particular provider.

<B>Changing Your PCP</B>
<P>Certain life events, such as moving, may create the need for 
you to change your PCP choice.  If you are covered under an 
HMO plan and would like to change your PCP, you may do so in 
one of the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>     If you are changing to another provider within the 
          same clinic, you may simply ask the clinic staff for 
          a new provider by calling or when scheduling your 
          next appointment.
<LI>     If you are changing clinics, you can change your PCP  
          by calling our  Customer Service Department. 
		Members of the State of Wisconsin or Wisconsin Public 
          Employer plan can request a PCP change by phone, but 
          <I>must </I>also complete an application from the payroll 
          office.
<LI> Or you may complete an enrollment application      
          indicating your new provider or clinic and mail it to 
          Dean Health  Plan.  The application may be obtained 
          from your employer or our office and must be received 
          by us before your first appointment with the new PCP.  
          The effective date of the change will be the date the 
	     application is received in our office, or a future date as 
          you request.
</UL>  
<P>If you need a current Provider Directory when changing 
your PCP, call our Customer Service Department.  When a 
PCP change is made, you will receive a new ID card.  It is 
important to carefully review the information on the ID card.
<P>
<A NAME="2.g"></A>
<B>What is an Advance Directive?</B>
<P>You have the right to make decisions about your health care. 
 This includes the right to accept or refuse medical or 
surgical treatment.  You also have the right to plan and direct the types 
of health care you may receive in the future if you become 
unable to express your wishes.  You can do this by making an 
advance directive.
<P>An advance directive tells, in writing, your choices about 
the treatments you want or do not want.  You can decide ahead 
of time how health care decisions will be made for you if 
you become incapacitated.  An advance directive expresses 
your personal wishes and is based upon your beliefs and values. 
 When you make an advance directive, you will consider 
issues such as living as long as possible, dying, being kept alive 
on machines, being independent and other issues relating to 
your overall quality of life.
<P>If you would like information concerning an advance 
directive, please contact your primary care provider. You may also 
contact our Customer Service Department. They can send you a 
packet that outlines advance directives.

<B>Dependents - Who Is Eligible For Coverage?</B>
<P>To cover any dependents under a family policy, you will 
need to know who qualifies as a dependent under your Dean 
Health Plan policy.
<P>
Qualified dependents include:
<UL>
<LI>     A legally married spouse of the subscriber.
<LI>     An unmarried natural child, adopted child, child placed      
          for adoption or step-child.  Your policy may also      
          include coverage for a legal ward.  Please check your      
          Member Certificate or Schedule of Benefits for further      
          clarification.  All dependent children are covered until      
          the age specified in your Schedule of Benefits.
<LI>     A natural child of an unmarried dependent child until      
          that dependent child is 18 years old.
</UL>
<P>Your policy further defines qualified dependents in 
the Member Certificate and Schedule of Benefits.
<P>
<A NAME="3.b"></A>
<B>Your ID Card:</B><BR>
<B>The Key to Your Care</B>
<P>As a member of Dean Health Plan you have received 
a membership ID card.  This card serves many important 
roles for your health care.  First, your card identifies you as a 
Dean Health Plan member.  It is important to present your ID 
card every time you visit your doctor or pharmacist.
<P>Your card not only identifies you, it also lists 
important information relating to your covered benefits. Information 
on your card includes:  your primary care physician/clinic, 
the members covered on your policy, your benefit renewal 
month and whether you have covered drug benefits or 
office copayments.
<P>New cards will be issued to you only when significant 
changes in your coverage occur. For example, you will receive a 
new card if you change your status from single to family, or if 
you change your primary care provider. When you receive 
your card, it is important to review the information carefully 
to ensure that everything is correct.
<P>Please keep in mind that your card is not a guarantee 
of coverage. Members are covered only for services listed in 
the Schedule of Benefits and Member Certificate. If you 
need additional cards for any reason, you may request them 
through our Customer Service Department.

<B>Qualifying Events</B>
<P><B>Adding Dependents to Your Policy</B><BR>
<I>This section only applies to members of an employer group 
plan. The Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan may have 
different criteria for qualifying events. Please contact your payroll office 
for more information if you are covered under the FEHB plan.</I>
<P>There may be times when a you need to add a dependent to 
your policy after your initial eligibility period has passed.  In 
certain circumstances, Dean Health Plan will allow potential members 
to enroll for coverage without submitting proof of good health*. 
 These circumstances are commonly called <I>qualifying 
events</I>.  If you experience one of the following qualifying events, you may not 
be required to submit proof of good health, providing that coverage 
is applied for within the time frame indicated.
<P><B><I>Marriage</I></B><BR>
One example of a qualifying event is a change in marital status.  
If you get married, you may add your new spouse and any 
newly acquired qualified dependents to your policy.  Their coverage 
will become effective on the date of marriage.  It's important to 
submit the completed application within 31 days of the date of marriage.
<P><B><I>Birth or Adoption</I></B><BR>
Another example of a qualifying event is birth or adoption of 
a child. An application should be submitted within 31 days of 
the date of birth or adoption to add your new dependent to your policy. 
 If you had only a single policy prior to the birth or adoption 
you can also add your spouse to your policy providing that your 
spouse had other insurance coverage through his or her employer up to 
the date of birth or adoption.  In this situation it is important to 
complete and return an application, including  evidence of 
your spouse's other insurance coverage within 31 days of the birth 
or adoption.
<P><B><I>Loss of other insurance coverage</I></B><BR>
A third example of a qualifying event is loss of other 
insurance coverage due to a layoff, termination of employment or a change 
to part-time employment status.  For instance, if you are 
covered under your employer's plan and your spouse is covered under his 
or her employer's plan and then loses coverage, your spouse can 
apply for coverage under your plan.  Additionally if you are eligible 
for Dean Health Plan coverage through your employer but are 
covered under your spouse's employer plan and your spouse loses 
coverage, you can apply for coverage with Dean Health Plan.  Please note 
that in both instances, only dependents that were covered under 
the other insurance plan can be covered under Dean Health Plan. 
 Coverage will become effective on the date following the loss 
of other coverage.  As with the previous examples, Dean Health 
Plan must receive a completed application, including evidence of loss 
of other coverage for you or your spouse, within 31 days of the event.
<P>Please check with your employer to find out which 
qualifying events are recognized and offered through your group plan.
<P>
<P><I>* Proof of good health requires a potential member to 
submit information about his or her health history for review before 
being accepted for coverage.</I>
<P>
<A NAME="3.d"></A>
<B>Full-Time Student Coverage</B>
<P>Each year, Dean Health Plan mails out a questionnaire 
to evaluate the eligibility of dependents who are 
full-time students.  This questionnaire helps us confirm whether 
they qualify as full-time students as outlined by the Schedule 
of Benefits.  These questionnaires are mailed to members 
who have dependents over the age of 19.  To determine the 
limiting age for your dependent, please refer to your Schedule 
of Benefits or call our Customer Service Department.
<P>In order for your dependent to qualify for insurance as a 
full-time student, he or she must meet all of the 
following criteria:
<OL>
<LI>be a qualified dependent (natural child, adopted 
          child, stepchild or legal ward)
<LI>be a registered full-time student in an accredited 
          post-high, academic, professional or trade      
          school (generally this requires 12 or more      
          credits per semester)
<LI>provide less than 50 percent of his or her own 
          financial support
<LI>not be married
</OL>
<P>If you receive a dependent eligibility questionnaire, 
please complete and return it immediately so that our records 
for your dependent are current.  If we do not receive the 
questionnaire from you, we will assume that your 
dependent no longer qualifies and the dependent's coverage will 
be cancelled.
<P>You may receive a form from your dependent's 
school requesting verification of insurance coverage.  This form 
may require the signature of a representative from your 
insurance company.  If you need us to fill out a portion of the 
form, please send it to:
<P>
<center>
Dean Health Plan<BR>
Attention: Customer Service Department<BR>
P.O. Box 56099<BR>
Madison, WI  53705
</center>
<P>Often, students take time off from college and therefore are 
no longer eligible for insurance.  If your dependent goes back 
to school and still meets the necessary requirements, 
coverage may be reinstated as of the day they return to school. 
However,  Dean Health Plan must receive the necessary 
proof of eligibility within 31 days of your dependent's return 
to school.
<P>
<B><I>Out-of-Area Coverage for Students</I></B>
<P><I>Please note, this section does not apply to members 
covered on a Point of Service,Point of Enrollment, State of 
Wisconsin or Wisconsin Public Employer plan.</I>
<P>If your dependent attends school out of our service area, 
your policy may have a special provision for out-of-area coverage. 
 This provision provides students with coverage for 
emergency and urgent care covered up to our maximum allowable fee. 
 Most policies cover non-emergency, non-urgent, and 
any follow-up care at 50 percent of our maximum allowable 
fee<B> if </B>the care is prior authorized by Dean Health Plan.  
Your primary care provider must submit a written referral to 
the Health Services Department for prior authorization.  
<P>If you would like an extra ID card for your dependent or 
have any questions about his or her coverage, please call 
our Customer Service Department.
<P>
<A NAME="3.e"></A>
<B>Canceling Your Coverage</B>
<P>At some point, you may need to cancel coverage under 
your Dean Health Plan policy for yourself or a dependent for one 
of many reasons, such as divorce, termination of 
employment, dependents reaching the limiting age of your contract, or 
for moving out of the service area.
<P><B><I>Group Plans</B></I><BR>
If your policy is through your employer, contact 
your employer's personnel or payroll office.  They will assist 
you with any necessary procedures. Be sure to check with 
your employer to determine if you or your dependents 
would qualify for state or federal continuation benefits.
<P>If a dependent's cancellation of coverage will change the 
type of policy you have (for example, switching from a 
family policy to a single policy), you will have to complete a 
new application to request this policy change.
<P><B><I>Non-Group Plans</B></I><BR>
If you are covered under the Individual or Conversion 
plans you will need to submit a request in writing to cancel 
coverage.  Farm plan members should contact 
Greater Insurance Services to cancel coverage.
<P>If a subscriber cancels coverage and qualified dependents 
wish to continue coverage, a new application must be completed.
<P><B><I>Premium Refunds</B></I><BR>
If the request is received by the end of the month, the 
coverage will be canceled at the end of that month and any 
prepaid premiums will be refunded back to the cancellation date. If 
the notification is received after the requested cancellation date, 
an explanation for the backdated cancellation is necessary 
for review and approval.  Some employer groups request 
that coverage end on the date of an event rather than at the end 
of that month. If you have employer group coverage, 
please check with your employer for the applicable cancellation date.
<P>
<P>If you have any questions regarding canceling your 
policy, please contact our Customer Service Department.

<P>
<A NAME="4.a"></A>
<B>Understanding the Referral Process</B>
<P>If you are a Dean Health Plan member of an HMO plan,  
<B><I>you</B></I> are responsible for obtaining a valid written referral.  
<I>If you are a member of a Point of Enrollment or Point of 
Service plan, this section does not apply to you.  Please refer to to 
the Precertification and Prior Authorization section of 
this handbook.</I>
<P><B>WHAT is a referral?</B></I><BR>
A referral is a Dean Health Plan form that is filled out by 
a primary care provider (PCP) and recommends 
outpatient treatment for a member by another provider of health care. 
 The completed form is submitted to the Health 
Services Department for approval.  A verbal request for treatment 
does not constitute a referral.
<P>A referral may be written for up to a six month maximum 
(10 months for pregnancy services).  However, your PCP or 
a Dean Health Plan Referral Specialist may limit the referral 
to a specific number of visits or a time period.  The 
referral expires when either the visit limit or time limit is reached.  
For example, you may receive a referral for three visits to 
a specialist over the next three months.  If only two visits 
were used and the three months have elapsed, the remaining visit 
is not authorized.  Or if three visits were used in two 
months time, the referral is not valid for the remaining month.  
Before seeking additional health care services, your PCP should 
be contacted for subsequent referrals.
<P>Please keep in mind, an approved referral is not a guarantee 
of payment and is subject to all benefit maximums, 
policy limitations, and eligibility requirements.  Please refer to 
your Member Certificate and Schedule of Benefits for 
benefit limitations.
<P><B><I>WHY is a referral necessary?</B></I><BR>
The referral process helps <B>you</B> by ensuring that you 
receive services from an appropriate plan provider or from an 
appropriate non-plan provider when the services you need 
are not available within the Dean Health Plan provider network.
<P>The referral process helps <B>us</B> to ensure 
that<B><I>you</B></I> receive appropriate, high quality care in a cost effective manner.
<P><B><I>WHEN do I need a referral?</B></I><BR>
A written referral is required for services performed by 
a provider who is not your PCP or is not located at your 
primary clinic. See the Dean Medical Center Association List in 
the Provider Directory for exceptions.  The Provider 
Directory offers a listing of Dean Health Plan providers.  Please 
contact our Customer Service Department if you need a 
current Provider Directory.  When selecting a specialist, you and 
your doctor must choose from those listed in this directory.
<P>In the event your PCP refers you to a non-plan provider 
(one who is not listed in the Provider Directory), prior 
authorization is required by a Dean Health Plan Referral Specialist 
<B><I>before</B></I> care is provided.  Authorization to non-plan providers 
will only be considered for services that cannot be provided 
within the Dean Health Plan provider network.
<P>The following are examples of services that require a 
written referral when received away from your PCP or clinic (this 
list is not all inclusive):
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Treatment
<LI>Audiology
<LI>Cardiac Rehabilitation
<LI>Dietary
<LI>Mental Health
<LI>Non-Routine Vision Care
<LI>Occupational Therapy
<LI>Physical Therapy
<LI>Podiatry**
<LI>Renal Dialysis
<LI>Services performed by a specialist
<LI>All services performed by a physician outside 
               your primary clinic
<LI>All services performed by a non-plan provider 
               (Prior Authorization is required)
</UL>
<P>**A referral is required for all podiatry office services, 
unless you have a Dean Medical Center location as your PCP 
and receive podiatry services at either the Dean Medical 
Center Fish Hatchery Road or Dean-Riverview Clinic location.
<P>
Written referrals are not required for the following types 
of service when provided by a Dean Health Plan provider:
<UL>
<LI>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) when provided 
               at approved facilities.
<LI>Diagnostic Tests &amp; Respiratory Therapy
<LI>Home Health 
<LI>Oral Surgery for covered procedures
<LI>Routine Vision Care
<LI>Follow-up Renal Dialysis
<LI>Chiropractic Care
</UL>
<P><B><I>HOW do I get a referral?</B></I><BR>
Once your PCP has determined a need for specialty care, and 
it is a service that requires a referral, the physician will 
complete and sign a referral request form and send it to Dean 
Health Plan.  A verbal request for treatment does not constitute 
a referral.  All referral requests to non-plan providers 
require prior approval, in writing, by the Health Services Department. 
 Referral requests to plan providers do not require prior  
approval by the Health Services Department.
<P>If you have any questions about the referral process or 
a specific referral, please contact the Customer Service Department.
<A NAME="4.b"></A>
<P><B>After Hours Care</B>
<P>
Starting January 1, 1997, Dean Health Plan members can 
get answers to health care questions from our new 24 hour 
nurse access line.  This line is available 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week!
<P>Registered Nurses, trained to assess your health care issues, 
can help you in determining the type of care that will be best 
for you or your family members.  They can help you 
decide whether symptomatic treatment is needed instead of a trip 
to the emergency room, or advise you where to go for 
further health care.
<P>The toll-free access line varies based on your Dean Health 
Plan policy. If you haven't received information on the 
toll-free number assigned for your policy, please call our 
Customer Service Department.
<P>
<A NAME="4.c"></A>
<B>Precertification and Prior Authorization</B>
<P>If you are a member of the Point of Enrollment or Point 
of Service plan, you are not required to obtain any 
referrals. However, there may be certain services for which your 
plan requires precertification or prior authorization.  It is important 
to know the difference between these two procedures.
<P><B><I>Precertification</B></I>
<P>If precertification is required by your policy, it would apply 
to all hospital and facility confinements.  Precertification is 
done prior to your admission, preferably at least 10 business days. 
 This process will allow us to review and approve your 
admission and determine the number of days to approve if you are 
being confined.  Precertification is usually required for all 
admissions to a hospital, residential treatment center, nursing home and 
any admissions to an outpatient surgical center for surgical 
procedures that are performed outside of the physician's office.
<P><B><I>Prior Authorization</B></I>
<P>If prior authorization is required by your policy, it would 
apply to various outpatient services that need our approval before 
you receive those services.  This process allows us to review 
the services that are being requested and determine if they are 
the most medically appropriate and cost effective services 
available for your condition.  Prior authorization is usually required 
for services such as certain prescription drugs (providing that 
your policy allows for prescription drug coverage),  Durable 
Medical Equipment that exceeds $200 a month for rental or 
purchase, and certain services from plan or non-plan providers for 
members on the Point of Enrollment or Point of Service plans.
<P>If you need a service that requires prior authorization and 
you have not heard from us regarding the approval, please 
contact our Customer Service Department 
<I>before</I> you receive these services.  If you receive services  that require prior authorization 
 without our approval, those services may not be covered.
<P><B><I>Emergency and Urgent Care</B></I>
<P>Services provided for urgent or emergency care do not 
require precertification or prior authorization.  However, we do 
ask that you contact our office by the next business day to 
inform us of the emergency.  
<P><I>Your Member Certificate and Schedule of Benefits will 
outline which services require precertification or prior authorization. 
 These documents will also indicate if your policy will apply 
a penalty for not receiving the required percertification or 
prior authorization.  It is important that you follow these 
guidelines appropriately to receive the most benefits from your policy.</I>
<P>
<A NAME="4.d"></A>
<B>Receiving Urgent or Emergency Care</B>
<P>
<B>HMO Plans</B>
<P>If you are an HMO member, a referral is always needed when you see a provider outside of your primary clinic or a provider that is 
not a plan provider. You will find a list of plan providers in the Provider Directory.  If you do not have a referral and receive services, you may be financially liable for the charges. If you need urgent or emergency care, a referral is not necessary but you will need to observe the following guidelines.
<P><B><I>In the Service Area</B></I>
<P><B><I>Urgent Care</B></I><BR> 
Urgent care is care you need sooner than a routine 
doctor's visit. Some examples of urgent care are broken bones, 
sprains, minor cuts and burns, drug reactions, and non-severe bleeding. 
<P>Urgent care should always be received by a plan 
provider when you are in the service area.
<P><B><I>Emergency Care</I></B><BR>
Emergency care is the sudden and unexpected onset of 
a medical condition that, if you did not seek immediate 
medical attention, could result in your death or serious injury to 
your body.  Some examples of emergency care are heart 
attacks, strokes, severe shortness of breath and significant blood loss.
<P>Most of the time, you will be able to receive emergency 
care from a plan provider. However, if you are unable to reach 
a plan provider, please go to the nearest medical facility 
for assistance. Please contact us as soon as possible if you must 
go to a non-plan provider.
<P><B><I>Follow-Up Care</B></I><BR>
Follow-up care is care you receive after the initial urgent 
or emergency condition has been stabilized.  Follow-up care 
in the service area should be received from plan providers.  
<P><B><I>Outside of the Service Area</B></I>
<P><B><I>Urgent Care</B></I> <BR>
Urgent care should be received at the nearest appropriate 
medical facility unless you can safely return to the service area. 
Please contact us by the next business day after seeing a 
non-plan provider. When we receive a claim for the services, it will 
be reviewed to determine if the diagnosis was urgent. If the 
diagnosis was urgent,  payment will be based on our maximum 
allowable fee. You will be responsible for any fees that exceed 
this amount. Please be aware that follow-up care for HMO 
members is not covered outside of the service area. 
<P><B><I>Emergency Care</B></I><BR>
If you are outside of the service area  and require 
emergency care, please go to the nearest medical facility. Please contact 
us by the next business day after receiving any emergency 
treatment or an emergency admission to a non-plan provider. If you 
are admitted to a non-plan facility for inpatient mental 
health services, we must be contacted within 72 hours of being 
admitted. Failure to contact us could result in your being 
financially liable for all services.
<P><B><I>Follow-Up Care</B></I><BR>
Follow-up care to an emergency or urgent care condition by 
a non-plan provider must be prior authorized. Please contact 
our Health Services Department before receiving any follow-up 
care out of the service area.
<P><B>Point of Enrollment/Point of Service Plans</B>
<P>If you are a member of  a Point of Enrollment or Point of Service Plan, and in need of urgent or emergency care, you can receive services from plan or non-plan providers. Urgent or emergency care is subject to the provider benefit level of your policy, 
depending on the provider you see. In addition, prior authorization for any follow-up care is required as indicated on your Schedule of Benefits.

</center>
<A NAME="5.a"></A>
<P><B>Your Member Benefits</B>
<P><B><I>Your Policy</I></B>
<P>As a Dean Health Plan member, you received a 
Member Certificate and Schedule of Benefits or a similar policy 
document approved or issued by your employer. These 
documents together specifically outline the benefits, services, 
exclusions and limitations under your Dean Health Plan policy.  The 
same Member Certificate is issued for many different plans, but 
the Schedule of Benefits reflects your plan's specific options.  It 
is possible that a benefit described in the Member Certificate 
may not apply to your particular plan.  This would then be shown 
in your Schedule of Benefits.  You should consult the Schedule 
of Benefits to determine whether and to what extent  a service 
is covered under your specific plan.
<P>Each year as your policy renews, you will receive 
information on any policy changes or clarifications.  Please be sure to 
read all information carefully so that you may fully utilize 
your coverage and be familiar with your benefits.  When you 
understand the extent of your health care coverage, you 
can make the most of your health care benefits.
<P><B><I>Filing Claims</B></I>
<P>Time is a valuable commodity for all of us; that is why 
Dean Health Plan minimizes the amount of paperwork required 
for our members.  In most cases, claims are submitted directly 
to Dean Health Plan by the providers or clinics.  On occasion, 
it may be necessary for you to submit a claim for 
reimbursement.  When submitting the claim be sure to follow 
these guidelines:
<UL>
<LI>     Send an itemized bill from the provider of service. If 
          services were received outside of the United States, 
          you will need to submit the original bill along with an 
          itemized bill that has been translated into English and 
          indicate the appropriate currency exchange rate at the 
          time the services were received.
<LI>     Send the bill within 60 days after the services are 
          received to Dean Health Plan, Attn: Claims 
     Department, P.O. Box 56099, Madison, WI 53705.
</UL>
<P><B><I>Explanation of Benefits</B></I>
<P>Occasionally, you may be responsible for paying a portion 
of a claim. The most common financial responsibilities of 
our members involve deductibles, copayment amounts, or 
charges from non-plan providers.  You will be notified of this 
financial responsibility with a form called an &quot;Explanation 
of Benefits&quot; (EOB).
<P>The EOB contains important information including the 
total amount charged, the amount paid by Dean Health Plan, 
and the amount that is the patient's responsibility.
<P><I>The dollar amount indicated as member responsibility on 
your EOB should always be paid to the provider of services and 
not to Dean Health Plan.</I>
<P>
<A NAME="5.b"></A>
<B>Understanding Copayments, Deductibles and Coinsurance</B>
<P>Some Dean Health Plan policies may contain a copayment, 
a deductible and/or coinsurance for covered services.  As 
a member you are responsible for these amounts, so it 
is important to understand the differences of each and how 
they affect your policy.
<P>A <B><I>copayment</B></I> is a specified dollar amount or a percentage 
of the cost of health care services that you must pay each 
time covered services are provided.  Some examples of 
services that may have a <I>copayment</I> are:  office visits, emergency 
room visits, prescription drugs and ambulance services.  As 
a member you should be prepared to pay your 
<I>copayment</I> at the time of services.  Please refer to your Schedule of Benefits 
for your plan's specific<I> copayment</I> information.
<P>A <B><I>deductible</B></I> is a specified dollar amount that a member 
or family must pay for covered services.  Your 
<I>deductible</I> is indicated on your Schedule of Benefits and is 
calculated according to your plan's benefit year.  When a member 
or family satisfies the deductible during the plan's benefit 
year, services will be covered at the percentage 
(<I>coinsurance</I>) indicated on your Schedule of Benefits. Unless 
otherwise indicated, the deductible must be met before the policy 
begins paying for services.
<P><B><I>Coinsurance</B></I> is a specified percentage of the cost of 
health care services that you must pay when covered services 
are provided.  The <I>coinsurance</I> amount paid by you is 
normally applied toward a specific dollar amount 
(<I>out of pocket maximum</I>) as indicated on your Schedule of Benefits.
<P>An <B><I>out of pocket maximum</B></I> is an accumulated dollar 
amount that you pay for covered services during the plan's 
benefit year.  The <I>out of pocket maximum</I> is normally the 
accumulated costs of covered services that you have paid for 
<I>deductibles</I> and <I>coinsurance</I> as indicated on your Schedule of Benefits. 
 Once you have reached your <I>out of pocket 
maximum,</I> covered services are available at 100% for the remainder of the 
benefit year.  <I>Copayments</I>, non-covered services and benefit 
<P>reduction amounts do not apply to the <I>out of pocket 
maximum</I>.
<P>If you, as a member, are responsible for any portion of 
the cost for covered health care benefits that you receive, 
Dean Health Plan will send you an Explanation of Benefits.
<A NAME="5.c"></A>
<P><B>Maximum Allowable Fees</B>
<P><I>If you are a member of the State of Wisconsin or 
Wisconsin Public employer group plans or GM employer group 
plan, please disregard this section.</I>
<P>When you receive services from any plan providers, 
the charges are covered based on the contract agreements 
Dean Health Plan has with all of our plan providers.  If there is 
a difference between the billed amount and what Dean 
Health Plan allows, you will not be held liable for that amount.  
You will only be liable for any copayments, deductibles or 
coinsurances of your policy or any non-covered services.
<P>When you receive services from non-plan providers, 
the situation is different.  Because we do not have any 
contract agreements with non-plan providers, the charges are 
covered based on our maximum allowable fee.  The maximum 
amount we allow varies by the type of services you receive and 
from whom you receive them. If there is any difference 
between what was billed and  our maximum allowable fee, you will 
be responsible for that amount.
<P>Maximum allowable fees apply to all services received 
from non-plan providers.  This includes emergency or urgent 
care services and services for which you may have received 
an approved referral or prior approval.  If you have an 
approved referral or prior approval to see a non-plan provider, you 
can find out if there is an amount you might owe before you 
even receive those services.  Call our Customer Service 
Department with the name of the non-plan provider, the procedure code 
of the service you will be receiving and the amount the 
provider will be charging.  Customer Service will then be able to 
tell you what amount, if any, you may owe.
<P>When we pay up to our maximum allowable fees, please 
keep in mind that any policy copayments, deductibles or 
coinsurance amounts will still apply to those services.
<P>
<A NAME="5.d"></A>
<P><B>Mental Health and Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (AODA)</B>
<P>As you or your primary care provider (PCP) determine that you need to seek mental health or AODA treatment, here is what you need to know before you receive treatment.
<P><B>Mental Health</B>
<P>When seeking outpatient treatment for a mental 
health condition, HMO members will need to obtain a referral if 
you are receiving this care outside of your primary care provider 
or clinic.  If you have not established a primary care provider 
and you need to obtain a referral for mental health services, 
please call the Dean Medical Center at (608) 252-8226 and ask 
to speak with a mental health care triage specialist. An 
informal telephone interview will be conducted and the triage 
specialist will determine what type of services you are in need of 
and which provider can best treat you.  A referral request will 
then be generated with Dean Health Plan.
<P>Point of Enrollment and Point of Service members do 
not require referrals; however, you still need to follow any 
prior authorization requirements outlined in your Schedule 
of Benefits.
<P><B>Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (AODA)</B>
<P>When seeking outpatient AODA treatment, HMO 
members will first need an assessment with a plan AODA 
provider. Please refer to your Dean Health Plan Provider Directory for 
a listing.  Following the assessment, the plan AODA 
provider will contact your primary care provider and Dean Health 
Plan with the recommended treatment and start date.  This 
treatment must be prior authorized by our Health Services Department.
<P>Once we have reviewed the treatment plan, we will send 
a copy of our authorization to you, your primary care 
provider and the plan AODA provider.
<P>Point of Enrollment and Point of Service members can 
receive an outpatient AODA assessment from any AODA 
provider; however, the AODA provider must prior authorize 
the recommended treatment and start date with our 
Health Services Department.
<P><B>Inpatient Care</B>
<P>If you are admitted to a hospital for any inpatient 
mental health or AODA treatment, the hospital admission must 
be certified with our Health Services Department.  We must 
be notified of any emergency mental health or AODA admission within 72 hours.
<P><B>Full-Time Students</B>
<P>If you are a full-time student covered under your parent's 
 HMO policy and you are attending school in Wisconsin 
but out of our service area, you have some additional 
mental health and AODA benefits.  You can receive an assessment 
by a non-plan provider that we designate.  If outpatient 
treatment is recommended, five outpatient visits will be approved.  
Any further visits must be prior authorized with our 
Health Services Department.  Please keep in mind that you must 
still maintain your full-time student status while receiving 
this treatment out of the service area.  If you are unable to 
maintain full-time status, you will need to return to our 
service area for any continued treatment.
<P><B>Benefit Limitations</B>
<P>All mental health and AODA benefits are limited by 
the number of visits or a dollar amount that we will cover.  
Each plan is different, so be sure to check your Member 
Certificate and Schedule of Benefits to determine what your plan 
will cover.  It is important that you  keep track of these 
services because once you reach your policy maximum you will 
be responsible for futher charges until the new contract year.
<P>If you have any questions about your mental health or 
AODA coverage please be sure to contact our Customer 
Service Department.
<A NAME="5.e"></A>
<P><B>Your Prescription Drug Benefit</B>
<P>Many of our policies cover &quot;legend&quot; prescription drugs. 
These are drugs which by law require a written prescription 
from your doctor. You can find your drug coverage outlined 
on your Schedule of Benefits.  Here is the information you 
need to understand about your prescription drug coverage.
<P><B>Prescriptions Limits</B><BR>
Generally,  Dean Health Plan's  policy for dispensing drugs 
is limited to a 30 day supply. If your plan is different it will 
be indicated on your Schedule of Benefits. Your Schedule 
of Benefits will also note if you have an annual 
prescription benefit maximum. Please check your Schedule of Benefits 
to verify what your specific policy allows.
<P><B>Filling your Prescription</B><BR>
Your prescription may be filled at any of our plan pharmacies. 
 Dean Health Plan requires that the generic equivalent 
be dispensed by the pharmacy whenever the FDA has 
determined a generic drug to be equivalent to the brand name.  
Generic does not mean quality has been compromised to provide a 
less expensive product. A generic medication contains the 
same ingredients and is absorbed by your body to the same extent 
as brand name medication. 
<P>If you are out of the service area and need to fill a 
prescription, you can simply go to one of the national 
plan pharmacies that are listed in the Provider Directory. 
These pharmacies will collect the appropriate copay and bill 
Dean Health Plan just as a local pharmacy would. This makes 
it easy for you, whether at home or away.
<P>If a national plan pharmacy is not available, your 
prescription will be covered only if your policy has a non-plan 
provider benefit or if the prescription is for an urgent or 
emergency care situation.  If you fill your prescription at a 
non-plan pharmacy, you will need to pay the full cost of the 
prescription and submit a claim to us for reimbursement up 
to the appropriate copayment.
<P><B>Prior Authorization of Prescriptions</B>
By requiring prior authorization for certain medications, 
we can help control escalating health care costs that affect 
your premiums. You may receive a list of the drugs that 
require prior authorization by calling our Customer Service 
Department.  As outlined in the Member Certificate, if 
your physician prescribes one of these drugs, either your 
physician, the pharmacy, or you can initiate a prior authorization request. 
<P>Occasionally, a request for prior authorization may be 
denied. Should this occur, the requesting physician is always 
offered alternative drugs to prescribe that are covered by Dean 
Health Plan.
<A NAME="5.f"></A>
<P><B>Insulin and Disposable Diabetic Supplies</B>
<P>Regardless of whether your policy has prescription 
drug coverage or not, you will always have coverage for insulin 
and disposable diabetic supplies as a Dean Health Plan member.
<P>This coverage is for the treatment of diabetes and includes 
not only insulin but disposable diabetic supplies such as 
lancets, syringes, cotton and alcohol swabs, finger stick devices, 
blood or urine glucose strips and control solutions for blood 
glucose monitors.
<P>Your Member Certificate and Schedule of Benefits 
specifically outline what copayments will apply to 
this coverage and any dispensing limitations.
<P>
<A NAME="5.g"></A>
<P><B>Obtaining Durable Medical Equipment and Supplies</B>
<P>Part of your benefit as a Dean Health Plan member 
also includes coverage for durable medical equipment (DME). 
 This would include coverage for medical supplies such as 
a wheelchair, crutches, splints, orthopedic braces and 
other medically necessary supplies or medical equipment.
<P><I>It is important to keep in mind that these items must 
be received from a plan DME provider, unless your 
policy specifically authorizes non-plan provider 
services.</I>  Please check your Provider Directory for a listing of plan 
DME providers.  You will also need to follow any prior 
authorization requirements that are outlined in your 
Member Certificate or Schedule of Benefits.
<P>When considering the coverage for your DME, we 
will determine whether rental or purchase of the equipment 
would be more cost effective based on the anticipated length of 
time you will be using the equipment.  Also, we will only 
consider the standard model of equipment.  Any equipment 
with features above and beyond what is medically necessary are 
not covered.
<P>If you have any questions about the type of DME 
covered under your policy, please contact our Customer 
Service Department.
<A NAME="5.h"></A>
<P><B>Understanding the Coordination of Benefits (COB) Process</B>
<P><B><I>What is COB?</I></B>
<P>It is very common for both spouses to be employed outside 
of the home and as a result, to be insured by more than 
one health insurance plan.  Similarly, one may be covered by 
both Medicare and a health insurance plan.  Children can also 
be covered by more than one policy through their parents.
<P>To address multiple health plan coverage situations, 
most health plans, including your Dean Health Plan policy, 
contain a Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision.  COB 
provisions are designed so that the total benefits available from two 
or more health plans reimburse up to 100% of your 
medical expenses, whenever possible.
<P><B><I>Which Coverage is Primary?</B></I><BR>
When you are covered by more than one health 
insurance plan, one of them is considered primary and the other 
secondary.  The primary plan pays its benefits first as if 
no other insurance coverage is involved.  After the primary 
plan pays, the secondary plan determines its payment. 
<P><I>Example: </I>You and your spouse both work full-time and 
have health insurance coverage.  You have Dean Health Plan 
and your spouse has other insurance.  Dean Health Plan is 
primary for you and your spouse's insurance is primary for him or her.  
<P>Wisconsin, along with many other states, has adopted 
rules which must be followed by all insurers who 
coordinate benefits.  Thus, all Wisconsin insurers who have 
COB provisions in their policies must operate on the same set 
of rules.   These rules are included in your Member Certificate. 
 They can be complex; so please call the Customer 
Service Department if you are not sure which insurance is primary.
<P><B>COB Rules</B><BR>
If you have Dean Health Plan and another health 
insurance plan, here are some common examples of how primary 
and secondary coverage is determined:  (This is not all inclusive. 
 If you have further questions, please contact the 
Customer Service Department).
<P><B><I>Birthday Rule</I></B><BR>
When each spouse has family health insurance coverage, 
they each will have primary coverage for themselves and 
secondary coverage for their spouse under their respective plans.  
The spouse whose birth date occurs earliest in the calendar 
year provides primary coverage for their dependent children.  
The other spouse's coverage would be secondary.
<P><B><I>Divorce</I></B><BR>
In divorce situations, the birthday rule usually applies unless 
a court order specifies otherwise.  Dean Health Plan requires 
a copy of the court order indicating who is to provide 
coverage for dependent children in divorce, custody and 
paternity determination cases.  
<P><B><I>Medicare </I></B><BR>
When you are covered by Medicare and another 
health insurance plan, many times Medicare is primary.  
One exception to this may be when your spouse or yourself are 
still actively employed and covered by a health insurance plan.  
In some cases that plan may be primary for the working and 
non-working spouse.  Medicare would then be your 
secondary insurance.  Each situation is different and Dean Health 
Plan will determine this based on federal guidelines.
<P><B>Both Dean Health Plan and your health care provider 
need to be informed of all health insurance coverage. </B>
<P><B><I>Submitting a COB Claim</B></I><BR>
Claims for you and your family members must be sent to 
your primary plan first <B>even if you believe the primary plan 
will not pay the claim.</B>  After your primary plan processes 
the claim, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). 
 The EOB contains what the primary plan did or did not pay.
<P>If Dean Health Plan is your secondary health care plan, 
you must send your health care provider a copy of the EOB 
from your primary plan before we can determine benefits. 
<B> Both your provider and Dean Health Plan need to be 
informed of all health insurance coverage or changes.</B>
<P><B><I>What Determines Payment?</B></I><BR>
If any portion of your health care visit is not paid by 
your primary insurance carrier, you will receive an Explanation 
of Benefits (EOB) or an Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB).
<P>It is important for you to submit the EOB or EOMB to 
your health care provider as soon as you receive it so that 
your claims can be processed promptly.  Because there are 
two insurance companies involved, it may extend the 
processing time of  your claim.
<P>
<UL>
<I>Example:  How COB is Paid</I><BR>
     * Office call = $50.00<BR>
     * Primary plan paid = $40.00<BR>
     * Dean Health Plan payment = $10.00
</UL>
<P>In this example, Dean Health Plan paid $10.00 because 
we coordinate with the amount paid by your primary plan.
<P>The specific payment may vary depending on the coverage 
in your health insurance plan.
<P><B><I>Important Note</B></I>
<P><I>We will periodically request updates from you regarding 
other health insurance coverage.  If you receive a 
questionnaire, please complete it and return it to us.  Doing so will help 
us process your claims promptly and correctly.  Please inform 
us in writing if there are ever changes in other 
insurance coverage on any family members in the future.</I>
<P>
<A NAME="5.i"></A>
<B>Subrogation:  What does it mean?</B>
<P>At some time during your life, you may be involved in 
an accident.  For example, you could fall on an icy sidewalk or 
be involved in an automobile collision.  Occasionally there 
is another party involved in the accident who should be responsible for the resulting expenses.
<P>A standard but not commonly recognized provision in 
most insurance policies is subrogation.  For example, if you 
were involved in an automobile accident that was not your 
fault, you would want the responsible party's insurance company 
to pay for your car's repair.  If you were injured in the 
accident and needed medical care, your expenses would be paid 
by your Dean Health Plan policy.  In turn, Dean Health 
Plan would try to recover the money spent on your injuries.  
This attempt to recover money from the responsible party is 
known as subrogation.
<P>If you or a family member are injured in an accident, it 
is important that you notify Dean Health Plan.  If you 
are dealing with another party's insurance company and/or 
an attorney, please let us know their names, addresses 
and telephone numbers.
<P>Paying for claims that should be another's responsibility 
may affect premium rates. Dean Health Plan has an obligation 
to all of its members to pursue subrogation because we want 
to do our part to keep the costs of your health care down.
<P>
<A NAME="5.j"></A>
<P><B>Complaints and Grievances</B>
<P>We recognize that at times, questions and concerns 
about benefits, claims, or services you have received  may arise. 
 Whenever you have a question or concern, please call 
our Customer Service Department.  A representative will 
make every effort to resolve your concern promptly and completely.
<P>If you continue to feel a decision has adversely affected 
your coverage, benefits or relationship with Dean Health Plan, 
you may file a written grievance.  The formal grievance process 
is outlined in your Member Certificate.
<P>Sharing your concerns will help us to identify our 
strengths and weaknesses.  Your input matters, and we encourage 
you to call with any concerns you may have regarding your 
health care.  Each month we survey several members who 
have contacted our Customer Service Department with 
concerns they have about Dean Health Plan.  We then record 
and review these surveys and develop processes to 
improve services and create the kind of environment that will allow 
us to better meet your health care needs.<HR>

<h2>Buckle Bear</h2>

Buckle Bear wants you and your little ones to ride his way.  Riding in a car the Buckle Bear way is the safe way.<P>

<P>

Through discussion, a video presentation, a rhyme and a song, Buckle Bear teaches children about car safety.  By encouraging the use of seat belts, Buckle Bear helps ensure each ride is a safe one. After the program, Buckle Bear will give each child a Buckle Bear sticker, pictures to color, and a letter to parents.<P>

<h2>Car Seat Program</h2>
<B>
Every Ride a Safe Ride<P>

</B>Traffic accidents are the leading killer of small children, claiming more lives than any other type of accident or disease. For every child killed, about 100 are injured. In order to assist you in safeguarding your child's life by proper restraint in motor vehicles, Dean Medical Center has instituted a car seat program--Every Ride a Safe Ride. <P>

<P>

<I>
What<P>

</I>This program includes: viewing a 15-minute film, "Don't Risk Your Child's Life;" demonstration of and instruction in use of the Century-1000, crash-tested, government-approved car seat and on-site rental of the car seat. <P>

<P>

<I>
Who<P>

</I>Any child (from birth-40 pounds) in Dane County is now eligible to participate in Every Ride a Safe Ride. <P>

<P>

<I>

<B>
Car Seat Tips</b>
<ul type=disk>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
There is no one brand that everyone agrees is "safest" or "best." The best care seat for your baby is one that fits your child's size and weight, fits in your car, and that you'll use correctly on every ride.<P>

<LI>
The price of the seat doesn't make a difference in safety of the seat. Higher prices usually mean added features that may or may not make the seat easier to use. <P>

<LI>
Try out the seats you like. Read the instructions, put your child in the seat, adjust the harnesses and buckles, read your vehicle owner's manual, and try the seat in your car. Also, make sure you are able to fasten the vehicle seat belt snugly, without extra slack through the belt path on the car seat before you buy it. Note that demonstration or illustration of seats in stores may not show them being used correctly. <P>

<LI>
Car seats are constantly being tested to make sure they pass the safety standards. Occasionally, this leads to a recall to fix a problem with the seat. When you purchase a new seat, make sure you send in the registration card attached to the seat to the manufacturer so they can let you know of any problems or recalls. If you have a used seat, call the Auto Safety Hotline, 800-424-9393 to get a registration card. 
<P>
</ul>

<I>
<b>For more information on car seats and their proper use, please call Dean's Passenger Safety Educator, Sherri Faust, 252-8376.</b>

<h2>Crash Helmet</h2>
<B>
Why a good helmet is essential to good health<P>

</B>A cycling helmet acts as a second skull. The foam absorbs the shock of any impact, minimizing or preventing head injuries. But knowing how to properly size and position your helmet can increase its level of protection. <P>

<P>

Since 1990, Dean Foundation and Crash Helmet have been working to reduce the risk of head injuries caused by biking accidents, by encouraging families to wear bicycle helmets. Traveling to area schools, daycare centers, and community events, Crash Helmet shares this vital message with children throughout southern Wisconsin. <P>

<P>

To find out more about the Crash Helmet program, please call the appropriate number listed below:<P>

<P>

Remember what Crash Helmet says, &quot;Don't be a street stain - wear your helmet.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
Four steps to achieving a good helmet fit:<P>

</B>
<P>

<I>
Step One:  Choosing a helmet</I><P>

<P>
<ul type=disk>
<lh></lh>

<LI>Shape and size affect the fit.<br>
When choosing a helmet, pay particular attention to its size and shape. Since some manufacturers provide helmet size according to head measurements, you may want to take head measurements with you. Different brands generally offer a range of shapes and sizes, and one may fit your head better. Try to find a helmet that fits fairly well before any adjustments. Try on different brands and choose the one that's most comfortable for you.<P>

<LI>
Strapping systems vary. <BR>

Check the strapping system and anchor points. Strapping systems vary, and where they adjust often differs between manufacturers. Helmets with more adjustment points provide more adjustability. Check to see if the manufacturer has provided clear directions for adjusting the straps. If not, ask the retailer for more information.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Fitting pads secure the helmet. <BR>

Most helmets come with fitting pads of different sizes. Make sure there is a good selection provided with the helmet so you can add them to achieve a good fit. <P>

<P>

<LI>
Styles incorporate safety and appeal.<BR>
There are three types of helmets:
<ul type=circle>
<lh></lh>
<li>Hardshell helmets are made of a hard, plastic shell which covers a separate foam liner inside.
<li>Thinshell helmets have a thin coat overlying the foam liner.
<li>Foam only helmets are made up of a foam liner and are worn with a lycra cover.
</ul>

<P>

<LI>
If these helmets have Snell, ANSI, ASTM or CPSC safety ratings, then all provide good protection.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Helmets come in many styles and colors. <BR>

If the size and shape are good, and it passes safety standards, choose the one you like best. This is especially important if you're buying a child's helmet, because it may help encourage the child to wear it regularly if it has a &quot;cool&quot; look.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Comparing price to value.<BR>

Helmet prices vary greatly. A more expensive helmet does not necessarily equal a better helmet. Correct size and shape, and passage of safety standards are the most important features. <I>
Dean Medical Center helps reduce the cost, offering seasonal coupons worth $5 off helmet purchases (courtesy of participating retailers).</I>  <P>

<P>
</ul>
<I>
Step Two:  Three steps to fit a helmet<P>

<ul type=disk>
<lh></lh>

</I><P>

<LI>
Position the helmet properly.<BR>

Leave hair loose or tied at the back of the neck. A pony tail or similar style or ornament will make it difficult to fit or wear your helmet correctly. Leaving straps undone, place the helmet so it sits evenly on your head, the same distance from each ear. Place the front edge of the helmet no more than one to two finger-widths above your eyebrows. Forehead coverage is essential.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Use foam pads to fit the helmet snugly.<BR>

If necessary, put the foam pads inside the helmet so it feels comfortable and fits snugly. There are usually several thicknesses _ choose one that is snug without feeling too tight. The pads are either reusable velcro pads, which can be removed and repositioned easily, or stick-on pads, which cannot be repositioned or used again after they are removed.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Adjust straps so the helmet stays in place.<BR>

The helmet may look like it is in a good position but may move out of place easily. Adjust the straps so the helmet stays in good position.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Buckles/loops/slides:      <BR>

Adjust junction of front and back straps just under ears at hinge of  jaw.<P>

<P>

<LI>
Chin strap:        <BR>

Tighten chin strap as snugly as you can without too much discomfort. Some helmets have &quot;locking&quot; strap adjustment, where you can set the adjustment and it won't slip or move.<P>

Step Three: Five steps to test a helmet<P>

</I>Have someone else test your helmet fit by doing this five-step test:<P>

<P>
<ol seqnum=1 type=1, 2, 3, ...>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
Hold your head still during the test. Your helmet should not move up and back to uncover your forehead.<P>

<LI>
With one hand, gently lift the back of the helmet up and forward. The helmet should not move up and forward to cover your eyes. Put a hand on each side of the helmet and rock from side to side. Your helmet should not slip side to side. <P>

<LI>
Shake your head &quot;no&quot; as hard as possible.  The helmet should not move on your head.<P>

<LI>
Open your mouth (lower jaw) as wide as possible, without moving your head. Someone facing you should be able to see the top of your helmet pulled down slightly. Your lower jaw should pull the helmet down. <P>

<LI>
Check to see where the front edge of the helmet covers your forehead. The front edge of the helmet should not be more than one to two finger-widths above your eyebrows.

</ol>

<P>

<I>
Step Four: A good fit takes time<P>
<ul type=disk>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
</I>Allow at least half an hour for adjustments.<BR>

 <P>

<LI>
Test your helmet fit each time you put it on.<BR>

<P>

<LI>
Inspect your helmet once a week for visible damage. If your helmet has been hit in an accident, it may have damage that is not visible. In this situation, it is a good idea to          replace it, since helmets are designed to take only one impact. Many manufacturers offer a buy-back program for damaged helmets.<P>

FDA-APPROVED LASER EXPAND OPTIONS FOR CORRECTING NEARSIGHEDNESS</B><P>

<P>

Millions of people wear glasses or contact lenses to see clearly. These lenses treat the symptoms of their focusing disorders, like nearsightedness.  Refractive surgical procedures that correct focusing disorders enable patients to see clearly without lenses.  To perform these procedures, ophthalmologists have used diamond blades.  Now, the arrival of a laser at Davis Duehr Dean gives patients with nearsightedness another choice to help them see clearly.<P>

<P>

In November, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the excimer laser manufactured by Summit Technology, Inc., to perform photorefractive keratectomy, or PRK (a refractive surgery to correct nearsightedness).<P>

<P>

According to Ophthalmologist John Vukich, M.D., nearsightedness (myopia) occurs when the eye is too long, or the cornea's curvature is too steep, causing distant objects to be blurred.  &quot;It would be the equivalent to a 35mm camera, with a lens that's slightly out of focus,&quot; he explains.  &quot;If you change the shape of the cornea, so it's the same shape it would be with a contact lens over it, you improve its focusing power.&quot;<P>

<P>

Until now, the primary refractive surgical procedure used to correct nearsightedness was radial keratotomy (RK).  RK is performed using diamond blades to make microscopic incisions around the cornea's outer edges, in a spoke-like pattern.  This flattens the cornea, so objects focus clearly.<P>

<P>

PRK applies the same principle, Dr. Vukich explains.  However, instead of a blade, the laser beam flattens the cornea.  &quot;PRK is slightly different, in that the excimer laser actually removes a tiny sliver of the cornea, so it takes on the shape it would be with a contact lens over it.<P>

<P>

According to Ophthalmologist Michael Shapiro, M.D., the primary advantage of PRK is that it corrects moderate cases of nearsightedness more predictably than RK.  &quot;Because the laser beam literally ablates excess corneal tissue, PRK provides a more nature means of flattening the cornea.&quot;<P>

<P>

Many candidates for PRK range from 20/60 vision or worse.  &quot;They range from being unable to see the big &quot;E&quot; on the eye chart, to barely being able to see two fingers held up in front of them,&quot; Dr. Vukich says.<P>

<P>

Other factors also determine which procedure is best for each patient. <P>

&quot;Certain procedures work better for certain age groups, because <P>

corneas heal differently at different ages,&quot; Dr. Shapiro says.  &quot;Gender and daily activities can also affect the decision.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
How is PRK performed?<P>

</B>According to Dr. Shapiro, patients are given a mild sedative before surgery, and anesthetic eyedrops to numb their eye.  During the surgery, a speculum is used to gently hold the eye open.  To prepare the laser and perform the PRK takes only about 10 minutes.<P>

<P>

According to Dr. Shapiro, the excimer laser removes tissue by delivering rapid pulses of ultraviolet light.  Each pulse evaporates a microscopic amount of tissue, reducing the steepness of the cornea.  To direct the beam, the physician looks into the patient's eye through a high-powered magnified lens, guiding the laser to remove the excess tissue.<P>

<P>

After surgery, patients go to a recovery room, where they are given instructions and a kit to care for their eye.  To protect the eye's outer layer (epithelium) while it heals, patients wear a powerless contact lens, called a &quot;bandage contact lens.&quot;  They'll wear the bandage lens for about a week.  Most patients can have surgery on their second eye within about six to 12 weeks.<P>

<P>

<B>
Most can drive without lenses after PRK<P>

</B>According to Shapiro, Davis Duehr Dean physicians have waited anxiously for FDA approval of the laser.  &quot;We've studied this and anticipated it for years,&quot; he says.<P>

<P>

PRK has been studied for six years before approval in the United States.  Worldwide, more than 250,000 patients have had PRK, with 95 percent improving to 20/40 vision or better-the vision required to legally drive without correction.<P>

<P>

<B>
Choosing the right refractive surgery<P>

</B>For patients who aren't candidates for PRK, Dr. Shapiro emphasizes that this is just one of Davis Duehr Dean's refractive surgery options.  &quot;We are going to recommend the procedure we think is best for them,&quot; he says.  &quot;We've completed over 7500 refractive surgical procedures, and over 98 percent of those people improved to 20/40 vision or better.  We can correct virtually every refractive error a person can have.&quot;<P>

<P>

Patients considering refractive surgery are asked to attend one of Davis Duehr Dean's regularly offered instructional seminars.<P>

<P>

A free video is available to patients who cannot attend.  Viable candidates for surgery are given a complete eye exam.  Patients should be at least 21 years old, with vision that hasn't changed in the past year.  There is no upper age limit for having refractive surgery.  Although refractive procedures eliminate the need for glasses for clear distance vision, most people still need reading glasses in middle-age.<P>

<P>

The Davis Duehr Dean physicians performing refractive surgery are all board-certified ophthalmologists.  They include:  C. Joseph Anderson, M.D., Richard Baske, M.D., Donald Beresky, M.D., Charlotte Burns, M.D., Judith FitzGerald, M.D., Jerome Kadell, M.D., Michael Shapiro, M.D., John Vukich, M.D., and Leighton Whitsitt, M.D., PhD.<P>

<B>
Well worth the wait<P>

</B>Ophthalmologists aren't the only ones who've waited for the FDA's approval of the Summit excimer laser.  Debbie Lundeberg has waited nearly a year.  Since third grade, she's looked at life through thick glasses or contact lenses.  Now, thanks to a few painless minutes under a laser beam, she's one eye closer to being free from her lenses.<P>

<P>

Debbie had first considered correcting her vision with radial keratotomy.  After thoroughly examining her eyes, Ophthalmologist Michael Shapiro, M.D., told her she would be a better candidate for photorefractive keratectomy.  &quot;He told me the laser surgery would be better for me, since my vision was so bad,&quot; she says.  &quot;I couldn't wait to have it done.&quot;<P>

<P>

Without lenses, Debbie was legally blind.  &quot;As a kid, it was hard, because I couldn't wear contacts,&quot; she says.  &quot;My glasses were quite thick, and not real attractive.  But, to get thinner lenses to make them look better, it costs about $300.&quot;  Although she'd worn contact lenses successfully since she was about 14 years old, Debbie wanted to be free from the hassles and expense of corrective lenses.<P>

<P>

Debbie says the surgery was quick and painless.  &quot;When I first got there, they gave me something to relax, and put eyedrops in my eye to numb it,&quot; she says.  &quot;I didn't feel a thing.  I think the whole thing took about ten minutes.&quot;<P>

<P>

Before leaving, she was given a bandage contact lens to protect her eye.  &quot;It just fit over my eye like a contact lens,&quot; Debbie says.  That evening, she already saw the difference.  &quot;I'd close one eye and realize I could see the television screen across the room.  It was amazing.&quot; At the end of the first week, Debbie's vision had doubled its focusing ability.  &quot;I can see signs while I'm driving,&quot; she says.  &quot;Dr. Shapiro said I should be ready to have my left eye done in about six weeks.&quot;<P>

<P>

Debbie says the surgery has given her more control.  &quot;It's so nice not to worry about falling asleep with my contacts in, or have to rush to put them in before I can see in the morning,&quot; she says.  &quot;It's just great to be in control of my own vision.&quot;<P>

EXERCISE TO LOSE FAT<P>

</CENTER><P>

</B>Losing weight requires losing fat. Fat can't be melted off by saunas or steam baths. Fat can't be rubbed off with rolling machines or massages. And fat can't be dissolved by eating grapefruit, vitamins or any other food supplement. Only the team approach--aerobic exercise and a low-fat, balanced diet -- can lead to a successful body fat loss. <P>

<P>

Aerobic exercise is any activity that uses large muscle groups and requires your heart and lungs to work hard. Such activities -- brisk walking, jogging, bicycling, swimming, cross country skiing and aerobic dance -- make your heart quickly pump the oxygen from the lungs to the muscles. Muscles with oxygen (the meaning of aerobic) are muscles capable of burning fat. Oxygen must be present for fat-burning action. Start and stop activity such as weight training or tennis, promotes muscle tone, but not aerobic fitness. A good exercise program includes both muscle toning and aerobic exercise. <P>

<P>

The fat-burning benefits of aerobic exercise have three requirements -- intensity, duration and frequency. <P>

<ul>
<LI>Intensity: Breathing hard, but not out of breath. Just able to talk while exercising. 

<LI>Duration: At least 20 minutes

<LI>Frequency: At least three times a week on nonconsecutive days. 
</ul>
<P>

Don't get discouraged that you may not be able to meet the minimum requirements in the first few weeks. It takes time and progressively more exercise to get into shape. The more you do it, the easier it gets. <P>

<P>

Non-aerobic activities such as leg lifts and sit-ups help firm flabby muscles, but can't slim down specific parts of the body laden with fat. For the most part, fat storage sites are genetically and sexually determined. Men essentially have one fat depot, the abdominal area. Women store fat primarily in the hips and thighs. Abdominal fat storage is tailor made for easy-access energy. This is why men typically lose fat more easily than women. On the other hand, hip and thigh fat depots serve as an energy reservoir to be tapped. Unfortunately, as most women know, the hips are the first place the hot fudge sundae goes and the last place from which it will be "melted." <P>

<P>

If you haven't exercised in a long time, have any medical or back problems, or are over age 35, you may need a physician evaluation before beginning an exercise program. To reap the many benefits of exercise and a healthy diet, start now and make these permanent habits.<P>

PRECAUTIONS HELP KEEP WINTER EXERCISE SAFE AND FUN</B><P>

</CENTER><P>

The cold winter weather may keep us from planning an abundance of outdoor activities, but many fitness-conscious recreational athletes continue their outdoor exercise regimen into the blustery conditions that come with the Wisconsin months of January and February.  Although those dedicated individuals deserve a pat on the back for their continued activity, they need to take extra precautions when heading out into frigid temperatures.<P>

<P>

According to Dean Sports Medicine Specialist Mark Timmerman, M.D., one of the most important things for winter recreational athletes to remember is to dress appropriately.  Dr. Timmerman recommends wearing a wicking layer next to your skin (polypropylene or Thermax is recommended) that won't absorb moisture.  It's also very important to wear a cap or hood since a significant amount of heat is lost through the head.<P>

<P>

Because of the way the body reacts to cold weather, covering the extremities is another important aspect of winter dressing.  One reaction, vasoconstriction (a narrowing of the blood vessels), helps the body regulate heat balance under the stress of cold.  During vasoconstriction, the body closes off the small blood vessels running to the extremities to prevent heat loss through the skin.  This natural body reaction places hands, feet and the face at an increased risk of frostbite.<P>

<P>

Dr. Timmerman warns people that although alcohol may make outdoor enthusiasts feel warmer as they head down their favorite ski hill or skate on the smoothest rink in the area, mixing alcohol with any winter outdoor activity can be quite dangerous.  &quot;Alcohol makes you feel warmer because it opens up some of the peripheral blood vessels.  In reality, you're taking away body heat when you open up the blood vessels near your skin.  Consequently, you're not able to feel when the frostbite hits because the alcohol is fooling your body into feeling warm,&quot; he says.<P>

<P>

In addition to the threat of frostbite, Dr. Timmerman says the chilly weather also seems to place an additional stress on the cardiovascular system.  &quot;People with a history of heart disease need to be concerned about putting a sudden strain on their system.  Definitely warm up more carefully in the cold weather and take frequent breaks from your activity.&quot;<P>

<P>

According to Dr. Timmerman, the simple act of breathing in cold air can cause problems for people with respiratory problems like exercise-induced asthma or cold air-induced asthma.  &quot;For some people, cold air is the irritant that causes their airways to narrow,&quot; he says.  To reduce the reaction to cold air, Dr. Timmerman recommends warming cold air by using a scarf or facemask over the mouth or using an inhaler prior to exercise if it's been prescribed.<P>

<P>

As many recreational athletes are aware, dehydration is common during the warmer summer months.    But Dr. Timmerman says people often forget they have to think about hydration just as much in the winter.  &quot;You still sweat a lot and need to replenish that loss of fluid, especially for long-distance activities like cross-country skiing.&quot;<P>

<P>

Although watching the Packers in the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field isn't an athletic activity, some of the same precautions taken by recreational athletes need to be taken by frenzied fans.  Wear layered clothing, cover your extremities and drink warm fluids, says Dr. Timmerman.  And if you're unfortunate enough to suffer from frostbite, soak the body part in warm water.  If the skin around the area starts to blister or swell, see a physician.  However, if there's a risk of refreezing, don't thaw the extremity.  &quot;The second time you experience frostbite is much worse.  Keep it frozen until you can stay inside for an extended period of time.&quot;<P>

<P>

Sledding is another common winter activity that isn't necessarily athletic but can cause serious injury, &quot;It's viewed as a fun activity, but it's actually a very dangerous one,&quot; says Dr. Timmerman.  &quot;Injury rates are very high due to running into trees, falling off sleds and colliding with other sledders.&quot;  Before allowing children to sled, parents should make sure the area is well lit and that there aren't any dangerous objects downhill.  Dr. Timmerman also recommends children wear helmets to protect them from head injuries.<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Additional Tips to Beat the Winter Weather<P></B></I>
<ul>
<LI>To warm-up, start with a light aerobic activity for 5-10 minutes, stretch for 5-10 minutes using a static stretch on the muscle groups you're using, mimic your activity with a sports-specific movement.<P>

<LI>Even in the winter, your skin needs to be protected from the sun with sunscreen.<P>

<LI>If you're starting an exercise program for the first time, start slowly and get advice from someone who is knowledgeable about the sport.<P>

<LI>When running on ice and snow, wear shoes with good traction.  Shoe stores now sell winter running shoes.<P>

<LI>Be extra cautious skating on area lakes and never skate alone.<P>

<LI>If there's a history of cardiovascular problems, see your physician before starting a vigorous exercise program.<P>
</ul>

YOUR TRAINING ZONE<P>

</CENTER></B><P>

Maintaining your heart rate is the easiest way to determine if you're exercising at an effective and safe level. Each person has a training zone (target heart rate) at which there is enough activity to produce cardiovascular fitness, but not too much to exceed a safe level. <P>

<P>

The training zone for each individual is between 60-80 percent of one's maximum heart rate. Exercising below 60 percent of your maximum heart rate will have little effect in improving your fitness level. Exercising above the 80 percent level will produce only a little extra cardiovascular improvement from a great deal of extra effort and intensity. <P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Maximum Heart Rate</B></I><P>

Estimate of the fastest possible rate at which your heart can beat. Reaching your maximum heart rate can be dangerous because you may be working at a harder rate than your heart can handle. <P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Training Zone (target heart rate)</B></I><P>

60-80 percent of your maximum heart rate is the range each person should strive for in order to improve the heart's and the cardiovascular system's ability to circulate blood. <P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Finding Your Training Zone</B></I><P>

Your appropriate training heart rate zone can easily be determined by using the formulas shown: <P>

(220 - Your Age) X 60%  =  Target Heart Rate<BR>

(220 - Your Age) X 70%  =  Target Heart Rate<BR>

(220 - Your Age) X 80%  =  Target Heart Rate<BR>

<P>

To determine a more accurate measurement of your training zone, use the <I>
Karvonen Formula: </i><P>

<B>1.</B> Take your pulse in the morning before getting out of bed. <BR>

<B>2.</B> Your maximum heart rate can be obtained by subtracting your age from 220. <BR>

<B>3.</B> Subtract your resting heart rate from 220. <BR>

<B>4.</B> Multiply by .70 (70%).<BR>

<B>5.</B> Add your resting heart rate. (this will give you the heart rate at your 70% level.)<BR>

<B>6.</B> To find your upper training level, repeat step four using 80%.<BR>

<B>
<P>

Why Choose Walking?<P>

<ul>
<LI></B>Walking, as any exercise that places weight on your bones, is one proven way to prevent the age-related decline in skeletal mass and builds bone mineral content.<P>

<LI>Walking is an excellent source of cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and calorie burning. For the most part, walking is free. <P>

<LI>Studies have shown the adults who walk for exercise 2 1/2 -4 hours a week tend to have less than half the prevalence of elevated serum cholesterol as those who don't walk regularly.<P>

<LI>For effective bone stimulation, walking or stair climbing, 30-60 minutes a day, three to four times a week, is sufficient. When starting a walking program, try 10-15 minutes at a comfortable pace. After one to two weeks, progress to 30 minutes. After six weeks, progress to 45 minutes.<P>

<LI>To calculate your THR (target heart rate)<br>
Men: 220 minus 1/2 your age = PMHR (Perceived maximum heart rate)<BR>
Women: 220 minus your age =  PMHR<BR>
To calculate your target rate, 60 % times your PMHR, up to 90% times your PMHR<P>

<LI>For cardiovascular benefits, start at 60 percent of your Target Heart Rate (THR). When progressing to 30 minutes, work at 70 percent THR. Check your pulse every five to seven minutes. AFter a 10-minute cool down, your pulse should be below 100 beats per minute. <P>

<LI>Walking shoes should have a hard sole, with a flat or waffle design. The top cussion should be three times as thick as the bottom cushion. A flared heel provides good comfort and support. <P>

</ul>

<h2>Mental Health</h2>
<B>Alzheimer's Disease</B><P>

<I>Definition.  </I>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking and behavior.  Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia.  Dementia is a loss of intellectual function (thinking, remembering and reasoning) so severe that it interferes with an individual's daily functioning and eventually results in death.  Alzheimer's disease is the fourth leading cause of death in adults, after heart disease, cancer and stroke.  Men and women are affected almost equally.  The disease was first described by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906. Since then, researchers have developed a deeper understanding of the changes in the brain (plaques and tangles) and behavioral changes that characterize the disease.  Identified risk factors are age and family history.  Most people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are older than 65; however, the disease can occur in people in their 40's and 50's. <P>

<I>Symptoms.</I>  Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease can include gradual loss of memory, decline in the ability to perform routine tasks, disorientation, difficulty in learning, loss of language skills, impairment of judgement and planning and personality changes.  The rate of progression varies from person to person.  The time from the onset of symptoms until death ranges from 3 to 20 years; the average is 8 years.  Eventually persons with the disease become totally incapable of caring for themselves.<P>

<I>Diagnosis</I>.  Early and careful evaluation is important because many conditions, including some that are treatable or reversible, can cause dementia.  Potentially reversible conditions include depression, adverse drug reactions, metabolic changes and nutritional deficiencies. <P>

There is no single clinical test to identify Alzheimer's disease.  A comprehensive evaluation to establish diagnosis will include a complete health history, physical examination, neurological and mental status assessments and other tests including analysis of blood, urine, electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest x-rays.  Documenting symptoms and behavior over time, in a diary fashion, will help physicians understand the person's illness.  The physician may order additional tests as needed including: computerized tomography (CT scan), electroencephalography (EEG), formal psychiatric assessment and/or neuropsychological testing.  While this evaluation may provide a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's disease, confirmation requires examination of brain tissue, which is usually done by an autopsy.<P>

<b>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</b><P>

<I>Diagnosis.  </I>This disorder has many names, however, the correct medical term is "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder" or "ADHD."  A physician or psychologist makes a diagnosis of ADHD based on direct observation of a child's behavior and on reports about the child's behavior from parents and teachers.  The diagnosis is considered when a child exhibits an extraordinary level of <B>inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity</B> that is in excess of what would be expected of most children the same age.  The age of the child must be taken into consideration since younger children are normally more inattentive, impulsive and active than older children.  Most children are at times impulsive, inattentive and very active.  The occasional occurrence of these behaviors does not warrant a diagnosis of ADHD.  There are no specific blood tests that can be used to diagnose ADHD.  It should be noted that none of the specific behaviors used to make a diagnosis of ADHD are by themselves an indication of abnormality.  However, when these behaviors occur with enough frequency, consistency and severity that they significantly interfere with the individual's functioning at home or at school, ADHD should be considered. <P>

<I>Prevalence.  </I>Estimates of the number of children affected by this disorder vary.  In the United States, as many as two to three percent of children are affected.  The disorder occurs much more commonly in boys than in girls.   There is some evidence that ADHD tends to run in families.  However, many cases are seen in which the affected individual has no relatives with the disorder.  <P>

<I>Treatment.  </I>There is no known cure for ADHD.  Many children will improve spontaneously around the time of adolescence, but a substantial percentage of children with ADHD continue to have attention problems into adolescence and adulthood.  Although there is no known cure, there are several treatments which may be helpful.  Some children with ADHD (particularly those with mild symptoms) respond well to classroom and social settings that are carefully structured and organized.  Specific interventions may help complicating problems including low self-esteem, academic problems or family discord.  One class of medications, the psychostimulants (methylphenidate or Ritalin is the most commonly used) has emerged as the most effective treatment for this disorder.  Other classes of medications such as antidepressants or antipsychotics are occasionally used to treat ADHD. <P>

<a name="mandepress"></a>

<B>Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression)</B><P>

<I>Definition.  </I>Certain mental and emotional conditions characterized by wide and often disabling mood swings are referred to by the medical terms <I>manic-depressive, bipolar affective, bipolar mood or simply bipolar disorder. </I> Most people with manic-depressive disorder experience recurrent episodes of both "mania" and "depression."  In a few cases, an episode may occur only once or a few times and never reappear.  People experiencing only recurrent episodes of mania are also considered to have manic-depressive disorder.  Those experiencing only recurrent episodes of depression, however, appear to have an illness called major depression or unipolar affective disorder, which is distinct from manic-depressive disorder.<P>

<I>Mania.  </I>Mania is a condition during which one's mood changes from its normal state to an extremely overactive state, often marked by feelings of elation, expansiveness and euphoria--a state described as being "on top of the world."  During a manic episode a person may sleep very little, talk very rapidly and continually, take little time to eat, show marked irritability and impatience and have racing thoughts.  Often the manic state progresses to the point where judgment is impaired and contact with reality is lost.  It may be difficult to understand what a person is saying.  Sometimes poorly thought-out decisions are acted on impulsively, with devastating financial or legal consequences for self, family and others.  Hospitalization may be necessary.  Hypomania (low mania) has the same characteristics but is of lower intensity.<P>

<I>Depression.  </I>Depression is a condition during which one's mood changes from its normal state to that of being very low, blue, sad or unhappy.  A person may experience changes in sleep pattern, altered appetite, loss of sexual interest, lack of energy, increased worrying, decreased interest in things, loss of ability to experience pleasure and difficulty with concentration and memory.  Accomplishing normal daily activities, such as going to work, becomes difficult or impossible.  Depressed people often consider and sometimes commit suicide.  Hospitalization may be necessary. <P>

<I>Prevalence.  </I>It is estimated that at least five out of every 1000 people (0.5 percent) will have some form of manic-depressive illness during their lifetime.  But since depression can also occur in conditions other than manic-depressive disorder, it is estimated that as many as 150 our of every 1000 people (15 percent) will experience at least one serious depression in their lives. 	<P>

<I>Inherited?  </I>There is strong evidence from twin, family and adoption studies that genetic or hereditary factors play a role in manic-depressive disorder.  For example, close relatives of someone with the disorder are more likely to develop the disorder than the average person.  Heredity factors, however, are not apparent in the families of all persons with manic-depressive disorder and even when present, types of genetic transmissions are not well understood.  As a result, it is not possible to predict accurately the risk for a given individual who has a relative with manic-depressive disorder. <P>

<I>Treatment.</I>  Lithium does not <B>cure</B> manic-depressive disorder but it is the most effective way to <B>control</B> it.  There is presently no cure for manic-depressive disorder and its cause remains a mystery.  For persons suffering from the disabling mood swings of  manic- depressive disorder, lithium may be of help in two ways: <B>stopping</B> an acute episode;  <B>preventing</B> further episodes.	The fact that lithium acts to control rather than cure manic- depressive illness is important.  It means that if people stop taking their lithium, manic or depressive episodes are likely to recur.  For more information, see the section on <a href="#lithium">lithium</a>.<P>

<a name="depress"></a>

<B>Depression</B><P>

<I>Definition.  </I>Depression is a medical illness known as a mood disorder that affects at least 5% of the populations at any point in time.  Depression, the illness, is different from temporary "blues" or sadness that are part of everyday life.  Not only does depression cause more sustained and severe low mood, but it also interferes with functioning in terms of activities and relationships.  Physical symptoms are common.  Although depression clearly runs in families, it knows no boundaries with regard to age, sex, race or culture, and many individuals with no prior family history of depression fall ill. <P>

<I>Kinds.  </I>If depression is severe enough and lasts at least two weeks, it is called major depression.  If left untreated, an average episode of major depression lasts six or more months.  While most individuals recover fully, some remain chronically depressed.  In addition, major depression is likely to become a recurrent disorder since the majority of patients have more than one episode.  About 15% of those suffering from major depression will sooner or later take their lives.<P>

Less severe forms of depression such as dysthymia and minor depression may also cause personal suffering and interfere with social relationships and occupational functioning.  Depression breeds despair and casts a dreadful pall over all life's activities and pleasures. <P>

A different mood disorder, bipolar or manic-depressive disorder, involves not only recurrent depressive episodes, but also manic episode characterized by elevated (sometimes irritable) mood, increased energy and decreased need for sleep.  See the section on <a href="#mandepress">bipolar</a>disorder for more information.  <P>

<I>Treatment.  </I>Fortunately, antidepressant medications have made safe and effective treatment for depression readily available.  A wide selection of antidepressants insures that the most depressed individuals can benefit from a drug that is well tolerated and easy to take.  Not only can antidepressants end an episode of depression and return a person to normal, but they can also prevent the appearance of subsequent episodes.  New antidepressant medications continue to be developed, and the future looks bright with regard to successfully overcoming the ravages of depression.<P>

<a name="flying"></a>

<B>Fear of Flying</B><P>

<P>

Not all fear of flying is phobic.  Planes do crash and passengers do die.  Totally "fearless" flyers are denying these realities.  Realistic fear is understandable, appropriate and manageable.  However, many people experience an irrational fear or anxiety about flying even after learning and accepting reassuring information about the risks of flying. Many of them suffer <B>flying phobia</B>.  Flying phobia can be diagnosed when people avoid flying because of their anxiety before or their distress during, flying.  For some, the fear of flying is part of a larger phobia known as <a href="#panic">agoraphobia</a>.  For those not suffering from agoraphobia, flying phobia often focus on a specific aspect of flying.  They usually experience anticipatory anxiety and one or more symptoms of <a href="#panic">panic</a>.  In fact, it is usually the fear of the developing panic symptoms rather than the actual occurrence of the symptoms that causes a person to avoid the thing he fears.  Other people avoid flying because of <a href="#social">social phobia</a>, a fear that something that they will do will lead to embarrassment or humiliation.<P>

<I>Prevalence.   </I>Flying phobia is very real problem for 25 million people in the United States who are so frightened they will not fly at all.  For an additional 50 million who experience substantial anxiety whenever they do fly, it makes travel for pleasure or work unnecessarily uncomfortable.  Many flying phobics find it difficult to travel far from home because they are restricted to the use of surface transportation.  Some people with flying phobia cross oceans by boat or miss children's graduations and weddings or parents' funerals because surface travel is such a slow and onerous process. 	<P>

<I>Treatment</I>.  Behavior therapies have revolutionized the treatment of phobias in general and have also been shown to be more lastingly effective than other treatments for flying phobia.  While most other methods produce improvements in no more than 20 percent of the cases of flying phobias, success rates (using actual flight as a criterion of success) between 66 and 90 percent are reported for several different behavior therapy treatments. 		 Continued confrontation of the feared object (exposure treatment) will cause phobic symptoms to dissipate.  Exposure treatment is very straightforward and requires an average of  8 to 12 sessions to control a wide variety of phobias.  Some phobic individuals can even treat themselves. <P>

<a name="lithium"></a>

<B>Lithium</B><P>

Lithium is a simple chemical element found in nature.  Because very small amounts occur naturally in food and water, lithium is found in the human body.  These trace amounts, however, have no known function.  Certain rocks have a high lithium content and these are the source of much of the lithium used in medicine and industry.<P>

Although lithium's chemical properties have been known for more than 100 years, its use in modern medicine began in 1949.  When used as a medication, lithium is taken by mouth in the form of tablets or capsules or sometimes as a syrup.  Both standard and "slow-release" versions are available.  All require a doctor's prescription.<P>

Lithium is effective in controlling certain mental and emotional conditions characterized by wide and often disabling mood swings.  Such conditions are referred to by the medical terms <I>manic-depressive, bipolar affective, bipolar mood or simply bipolar disorder. </I> See the section on <a href="#mandepress">bipolar disorder</a> to learn more about this subject. <P>

<a name="obscomp"></a>

<B>Obsessive Compulsive Disorders</B><P>

<P>

<I>Definition</I>.  Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) commonly involves both obsessions and compulsions.  Occasionally, an afflicted person will have only obsessions or compulsions. <P>

Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive ideas, images, impulses or worries that run through a person's mind repeatedly.  Often obsessions are senseless, unpleasant, distasteful or even repugnant and typically involve themes of harm.  For some, infrequent obsessions cause great anguish while for others, incessant obsessions may be viewed as mildly annoying "background noise."  <P>

Compulsions are strong urges to do something to reduce anxiety or other discomfort from obsessions.  Usually certain behaviors (either physical actions or mental thoughts) called rituals are repeated in response to an obsession.  However, relief from rituals is often incomplete and always short-lived, so they must be repeated frequently and soon become a problem in their own right because they are excessive.   <P>

Obsessions increase discomfort, anxiety or rituals, while mental rituals decrease discomfort, anxiety or rituals.  Just as obsessions vary in their frequency and intensity, compulsions may occur only rarely but can consume many hours each day. Obsessive compulsive disorder can be a mild problem unnoticed by anyone except the individual involved.  It can create varying amounts of difficulty for the sufferer and family members as it waxes and wanes or it can be of such severity that it consumes the sufferer's attention and energies and involves family members in elaborate rituals in order to "keep the peace." <P>

<I>Prevalence.</I>  Obsessive compulsive disorder often begins in childhood.  Fully one-third of cases have appeared by the age of 15 with a majority of additional cases emerging before age 30.  Average age of onset is 17 in males and 21 in females.  The recent National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Study of 18,000 Americans interviewed in their homes found that 1.3 percent reported enough obsessive compulsive symptoms to meet criteria for the diagnosis in the last month and that 2.5 percent had suffered the disorder at some point in their lives.  Some families have four successive generations with clear cases of obsessive compulsive disorder.  However, many individuals suffering obsessive compulsive disorder have no family members with any symptoms of the disorder.<P>

<I>Treatment.</I>  The past 20 years have seen the emergence and evaluation of two effective forms of treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder: <B>drug treatment</B> using medications with marked effects on serotonin neurotransmission has been shown to be effective in decreasing both obsessions and compulsions; <B>behavioral therapy</B> provides obsessive compulsive patients with a successful method for decreasing anxiety from obsessions and for reducing or eliminating compulsive rituals.  A combination of medications which enhance serotonin neurotransmission and behavioral therapy is presently the most effective treatment for almost all patients.<P>

<P>

<a name="panic"></a>

<B>Panic Disorder (and Agoraphobia)</b><P>

<I>Definition.  </I>Distinct periods of intense fear or discomfort, when people may freeze and feel compelled to escape, but when there is no recognizable or logical cause, are called <B>panic attacks.  </B>Frequent recurrences of panic attacks may lead to the diagnosis of <B>Panic Disorder.</B>  People experiencing an unexpected or spontaneous panic attack "know" that something is wrong, possibly even potentially fatal.  Many expect to have a heart attack or stroke or to faint, smother or lose their balance.  Others become convinced that something is terribly wrong with one of their organ systems.  Panic attack sufferers therefore typically rush to an emergency room or call their doctors for diagnosis and treatment of these alarming physical symptoms, which may include: shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, trembling, sweating, numbness, flushes, chills, chest pain, choking or nausea.  Often there are the following non-physical symptoms as well:  feeling of unreality, fear of dying, fear of going crazy.  Unless panic attacks lessen on their own or with treatment, many sufferers begin to anticipate recurrence of panic attacks in specific situations.  Worry about subsequent panic attacks, called anticipatory anxiety mounts, as the panic sufferer contemplates returning to these situations.  If anticipatory anxiety becomes severe, many people respond by avoiding the situations associated with it.  <P>

The triad of Panic Disorder leading to anticipatory anxiety and avoidance is a common, but not universal pathway to Agoraphobia.  Agoraphobia is the fear of being in places or situations from which quick and graceful escape might be difficult; or in which help might not be available in the event of a sudden incapacitation.  As a result of this fear, the person restricts travel, needs a companion when away from home or endures intense anxiety in agoraphobic situations.  Some agoraphobics do not experience full panic attacks, but may suffer limited symptom attacks or just vague feelings of worry and discomfort caused by typical agoraphobic situations.  Although Panic Disorder often precedes Agoraphobia, it may exist alone without the development of much, if any, phobic avoidance.  Thirty to seventy percent of patients develop Agoraphobia without preceding panic attacks but may suffer attacks later. <P>

<I>Prevalence.  </I>Upwards of 30 percent of the population will experience a <B>panic attack</B> during a given year and an even larger percentage at some point in their lifetimes.  But the lifetime prevalence of <B>Panic Disorder</B> is about two percent, and only one-half of one percent of the population experience Panic Disorder in any given month.  The lifetime prevalence of Agoraphobia is about 5 percent, while the prevalence in a given month is about two percent.  Thus, many more people have Agoraphobia than Panic Disorder.  Women have roughly twice the prevalence of both Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia as men. <P>

<I>Treatment.  </I>The combination of medications and behavioral therapy is presently the most effective treatment for many patients with Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia. <P>

<P>

<a name="schizo"></a>

<B>Schizophrenia</B><P>

<I>Definition.  </I>The acute phase of schizophrenia involves some disorganization of a person's functioning in several areas.  People with the disorder often lose their grip on reality and feel confused, isolated or terrified.  There may be difficulty in communication and disturbances of logical thought.  Often delusions (firmly held false beliefs) and hallucinations (abnormal perceptions of the senses of hearing, sight, smell, taste or touch) are present.  Delusions and hallucinations often have persecutory, religious or grandiose themes, may deal with bodily concerns and thought control and are frequently easily recognized (so-called "positive" symptoms).  Hallucinations involving voices are common.  Other symptoms may include inappropriate or lessened emotion, loss of sense of identity, reduced motivations and social withdrawal (so-called "negative" symptoms of schizophrenia).  There may be a lack of concern about self-care with deterioration in grooming and hygiene.  Hospitalization is often necessary to begin treatment.  After resolution of the acute phase, a chronic or residual phase often persists.  This is characterized by deficits in social functioning, motivation and coping abilities.  Relapse into another acute episode can occur, particularly if medication is stopped and/or at times of stress.  In addition, suicide is the cause of death in 10 to 20 percent of schizophrenic individuals.  Schizophrenia is a serious medical condition.  Before making the diagnosis, a search for other causes of  psychosis--such as drug and alcohol use, organic, metabolic and circulatory diseases or other psychiatric disorders such as depression, manic- depressive disorder or mental retardation--must be made.  Some of the symptoms commonly found in the acute phase of schizophrenia may be present during manic episodes of manic-depressive disorder.  Initially, it may be difficult to distinguish between schizophrenia and mania. <P>

<I>Prevalence.  </I>It has been estimated that one out of every 100 people (1 percent) will develop schizophrenia in their lifetime.  In men, symptoms most often begin between 15 and 24 years of age; while in women, the peak age onset is between 25 and 34 years.  The onset of schizophrenia after the age of 45 is uncommon but can occur.  Studies of twins, families and adoption at birth show that close relatives have a greater chance of developing this disorder.  Approximately 40% of children whose parents both have schizophrenia will develop it themselves.  While genetic or hereditary factors may predispose a person to schizophrenia, such factors are not apparent in the families of all persons who develop schizophrenia.<P>

<I>Treatment.  </I>Although antipsychotic medications cannot <B>cure </B>schizophrenia, they are essential to the effective <B>control</B> of the disorder.  Comprehensive treatment also includes supportive individual and family psychotherapy, hospitalization when necessary and vocational, recreational and other therapies.  Unfortunately, there is not yet a cure for schizophrenia and the exact causes of this disorder are still unknown.  For a person suffering from the disabling emotional and mental symptoms of schizophrenia, antipsychotic medication many help in two ways: <B>stopping</B> an acute episode; <B>preventing</B> further episodes. <P>

<P>

<a name="social"></a>

<B>Social Phobia</B><P>


<I>Definition.  </I>Phobias are fears which are recognized as unreasonable by the people who have them.  Almost any object or situation can be the source of a phobia.  Phobias usually lead to the avoidance of the stimulus that evokes the fear or to enduring it with great distress.  Avoidance causes dysfunction and the dual criteria of distress and dysfunction define phobias that may be clinically significant and warrant treatment.  Many phobias are specific to a single object, situation or stimulus and are appropriately called specific or single phobias.  Specific phobias may require treatment if they interfere with an individual's functioning.  Some phobias are broad rather than narrow, such as agoraphobia which involves the fear of being caught or trapped or stuck in situations from which it would difficult to escape quickly and gracefully should the person feel uncomfortable.  Agoraphobia can and usually does involve more than one specific situation and the common fear across situations is of being unable to move quickly and gracefully to a place of comfort.<P>


Similarly, social phobia involves many situations since humans are social animals and exist in societies.  The unifying theme in social phobia is the fear of performing poorly in social situations leading to an embarrassment or humiliation.  The lives of individuals with social phobia are further complicated by <I>
anticipatory anxiety</I>, the fear of approaching social encounters. <P>


<I>Symptoms.   </I>In addition to anxiety about embarrassment or humiliation when being watched, individuals often experience physical symptoms associated with social phobia.  As they enter socially sensitive situations, they may notice palpitations, sweating and trembling.  Some experience flushing or blushing.  <P>

<I>Kinds.  </I>Social phobia takes many forms.  Most common is fear of public speaking or other public performances such as reading in church, acting in a play or performing with a musical instrument.  Another common form of social phobia involves eating with others.  Others fear writing in public.  Public bathrooms are another social setting for some.  In all forms of social phobia, a public or social setting is necessary.  Social phobics can often perform these tasks without anxiety when alone.  It is anxiety when performing in the presence of others that largely defines social phobia.<p>

<i>Prevalence.  </i>Social phobia is quite common.  One recent epidemiologic study found 7.9% of a sample of the United States population met the criteria for clinically signigicant social phobia and another study put the figure at 10.5%.<p>

<i>Treatment.  </i>The past 20 years have seen the emergence of two effective forms of treatment for social phobia: <b>drug treatment</b> with several classes of medications, has been shown to have markedly beneficial effects for many patients; <b>behavioral therapy</b> also provides many social phobic patients with a successful method for decreasing anxity and avoidance in the situations the fear.  A combination of medications and behavioral therapy is presently the most effective treatment for many patients with social phobia.<p>

<h2>Chicken Pox Vaccine</h2>

Everyone can probably remember getting the chickenpox. And if you don't remember, your mother has most likely told the story enough times that you now know it by heart. For me, the story goes like this...I was three, my brother was six. He got the chickenpox after playing with one of the neighbor kids. I got them from my brother. For my mother, it was extremely poor timing. Two days after spotting the red dots on my brother's body, she was planning on heading with my father to a convention. Instead of spending a week in Las Vegas, she spent a week with two kids complaining about itchy skin.  <P>

<P>

But with the development of a vaccine to prevent varicella zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox, fewer parents of today will have chickenpox stories to tell. Although chickenpox very seldom causes severe problems in children, it is one of the most contagious infectious diseases in the country.  Nearly four million Americans get chickenpox each year with approximately 90 percent of cases occurring in children 1 to 14 years old. Not only does this cost millions of dollars in lost workdays for parents who stay home to care for their sick children, but like my mom, causes complications in already busy households. <P>

<P>

According to Pediatrician Edward McCabe, M.D.,  the vaccine has been available in Japan since 1973, but became available in the U.S. on May 1, 1995. And actually, he says, the vaccine was ready four years ago, but the Food and Drug Administration had to do additional research before releasing the drug. Now Varivax, the varicella virus vaccine, is recommended for anyone over a year old that has never had chickenpox. For patients under a year, the vaccine is being worked into immunization schedules. <P>

<P>

However, Dr. McCabe says the prime target to receive the vaccine are teenagers and adults who have never had chickenpox. "We're trying to target teens and adults because the possibility of complications from chickenpox increases with age," he says. In fact, adult cases of chickenpox account for 13 percent of hospitalizations because of complications like pneumonia and respiratory tract conditions. "An otherwise healthy five year old with chickenpox will do just fine. A 30 year old who gets chickenpox can become very, very sick and could require hospitalization."<P>

<P>

But the group who could benefit the most from Varivax are children and adults who are chronically ill and not able to properly fight off infection. "For immuncompromised patients, this is a very big deal," says Dr. McCabe. "The availability of this vaccine will considerably reduce the chance they have of coming in contact with another person with chickenpox." <P>

<P>

In addition to preventing the fever, irritability and itching that comes with chickenpox, Dr. McCabe says the biggest impact of the new vaccine will be cutting down on lost work time for parents. "Chickenpox takes a long time to run its course and children can be contagious for five to seven days," he says. "That means mom or dad has to stay home from work since the child can't go to daycare or school." And usually, if one child in the household comes down with the chickenpox, the other kids will become infected, too. In fact, there's a 90 percent chance that a susceptible child will catch the disease from someone else in their household. That can mean multiple weeks of lost work for parents. <P>

<P>

Although chickenpox has never been considered a serious illness, Dr. McCabe says the introduction of the vaccine will certainly reduce the number of deaths related to the disease and cut down on the estimated 364,000 physician office visits each year by patients with chickenpox. And, who knows, if Varivax would have been introduced 26 years ago, my mom could still be talking about meeting John Davidson, her all-time favorite Las Vegas act.<P>

<P>

<I>
All patients older than one year who haven't had chickenpox are encouraged to be vaccinated against the disease. For more information, or to schedule an appointment for a vaccination, call your physician.<P>

MANAGING YOUR CHILD'S ASTHMA<P>

<P>

</CENTER><I>
Current treatments conquer even severe cases</B></I><P>

It seems like only yesterday when growing up with asthma meant dreading gym class, knowing that even five minutes on the floor would leave you gasping for air, while classmates cruised around effortlessly, never stopping to rest. For some, it meant never really knowing the freedom of running or swimming long distances without wheezing and coughing. Often, growing up with asthma meant being told, &quot;You're just out of shape. Maybe you shouldn't work so hard.&quot;<P>

<P>

Fortunately, times have changed. Now, for most kids, treating asthma can be as easy as inhaling a tasteless mist through a couple of inhalers, just a few times each day. When taken properly, today's prescription treatments send even the &quot;wheeziest&quot; kids off and running -- some, all the way to the Olympics. <P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Swollen airways reduce breathing<P>

</B></I>Greek for &quot;panting,&quot; asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs, which causes the asthmatic to literally pant for air. According to Pediatric Allergy and Pulmonary Disease Specialist Don Bukstein, M.D., asthma attacks strike when airways become inflamed. &quot;If you had a camera looking into the child's lungs, you would see that the lungs are actually inflamed,&quot; he explains. Responding to the swelling, the airways leading to the lungs (bronchial tubes) also become swollen, causing their surrounding muscles to spasm. &quot;For some, an asthma attack will cause coughing or wheezing. Other kids may only experience a tight or heavy feeling in their chest.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Heredity and the environment cause asthma</B></I> <P>

Although asthma generally begins in childhood, it can also start later in life. Usually inherited, this common disease is often passed on through generations. &quot;If a child's mother or father has asthma, that child has a 30 percent chance of getting it,&quot; Dr. Bukstein explains. &quot;If both parents have it, that chance doubles.&quot;<P>

 <P>

Environmental factors, such as extreme air pollution or disease-infested pests, such as cockroaches and dust mites, can also cause asthma. &quot;Each year, thousands of children living in highly populated urban areas get it,&quot; Dr. Bukstein says. &quot;This is because there are a lot of cockroaches and dust mites in their environment.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Many things trigger asthma<P></B></I>

Although each child differs, Dr. Bukstein says that several common factors often trigger asthma attacks: <br>
<ul>
<li>Allergies -- Often, kids diagnosed with asthma will be tested for allergies too<br>

<li>Exercise -- For &quot;exercise-induced&quot; asthmatics, this may be their only trigger<br>

<li>Weather -- Dry, hot, cold or damp air --  for some, any extreme may reduce breathing<br>

<li>Stress and/or anxiety -- Relaxing is key to calming and preventing attacks<br>

<li>Cigarette smoke, fumes and other air pollution -- Never smoke near an asthmatic<br>
</ul>

Successful management requires proper tools, regular use &quot;Treating asthma is generally quite simple,&quot; Dr. Bukstein says. &quot;Getting children to follow their doctor's and parent's advice, however, can be a challenge.&quot; To encourage children to take medication, he suggests parents try different strategies. &quot;Offer the child incentives, make a chart to record daily progress -- make a game out of it,&quot; he says. &quot;Whatever it takes -- as long as it encourages the child to take all the medication as directed.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Peak flow meters measure breathing<P>

</B></I>&quot;The first step to treating asthma is knowing when it is necessary, before it becomes an emergency,&quot; Dr. Bukstein says. Just as thermometers measure a child's temperature, the peak flow meter measures breathing. Easy to use, light weight and compact, the meter consists of a small tube, slightly bigger than a child's glue stick. The child simply takes a deep breath, blowing it out into the tube, which propels the meter's gauge upward, marking the force of the breath.                    <P>

<P>

Knowing the child's ideal or &quot;peak&quot; breathing level enables parents to respond with treatment immediately, when the reading drops below normal -- the same way they would treat a fever before it becomes serious.<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Medications treat and relieve asthma<P>

</B></I>Generally, physicians will prescribe two types of medication -- anti-inflammatory treatments to prevent inflammation, and bronchodilators to temporarily relieve the symptoms of an attack. Because each plays a vital and separate role in managing the disease, Dr. Bukstein stresses the importance of using both to yield maximum results. <P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Anti-inflammatory medications prevent inflammation<P>

</B></I>According to Dr. Bukstein, these medications are perhaps the most essential element in managing asthma. &quot;Over time, anti-inflammatory treatments reduce the inflammation which restricts breathing,&quot; he says. &quot;But they only work if they are used regularly, twice a day, or as often as the physician recommends.&quot; <P>

<P>

To reduce swelling, Corticosteroid (&quot;steroid&quot;) treatments are generally prescribed. Although most are taken through an inhaler, some oral (pill) remedies are also used to treat severe chronic (long-term) or episodic (short-term -- often triggered by a cold or infection) cases of asthma. (Not to be confused with those used illegally by some athletes for body building, the steroid treatments used to manage asthma don't affect the liver or cause sterility.) Steroid inhalers which are currently available include:<P>

Fluticasone, triamcinolone, flunisolide, and beclomethasone<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Bronchodilators relieve symptoms <P>

</B></I>To temporarily treat the wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties brought on by an asthma attack, Dr. Bukstein says most physicians will prescribe inhalers called &quot;bronchodilators.&quot; Like the over-the-counter asthma remedies, these inhalers do nothing to reduce inflamed air passages. Their role is simply to provide temporary relief from attacks, loosening mucus secretions and relaxing tightened airways. Commonly prescribed bronchodilators include:<P>

Albuterol, pirbuterol, metaproterenol, terbutaline or bitolterol<P>

<P>

Dr. Bukstein cautions parents not to rely solely on bronchodilators to manage their child's asthma. &quot;We know that very few patients take their anti-inflammatory inhalers as they should,&quot; he says. &quot;Since they don't provide immediate relief, many people think they aren't worth taking. In fact, when patients use them as directed -- generally twice each day -- we've seen some kids with mild asthma who no longer need their bronchodilators for relief. This is because the swelling reduces so much that their symptoms go away.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Do children outgrow asthma?<P>

</B></I>&quot;Unfortunately, children generally do not outgrow asthma,&quot; Dr. Bukstein says. But the upshot is that it doesn't have to -- and shouldn't -- limit their ability to enjoy an active lifestyle. Learning to manage their illness while they're young may even help teach asthmatic children healthful habits which could pay off later in life.  <P>

<P>

&quot;When parents and physicians work together as a team, helping the child manage the disease, there should be no reason the child can't enjoy a healthy, active life,&quot; he says. &quot;Just look at the number of Olympic athletes who have asthma.&quot;

<CENTER>DECIPHERING THE FOOD LABELING LINGO</B></CENTER><P>

So, you've put on a few extra pounds.  You decide something has to be done.  Before your next trip to the grocery store, you commit to buying foods with less fat and fewer calories.  As you peruse the store's aisles comparing the many brands of your favorite products, you become increasingly frustrated.  Due to the different food labeling techniques, it's nearly impossible to compare brands.  You give up and buy the same items that end up in your cart every week.<P>

Thanks to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), this frustrating experience can be put in the past.  As of July 6, all food inspected by the two Federal agencies will be following new food labeling regulations that offer practical nutrition information in a clear and useful format.  The only exceptions to the food labeling regulations are foods produced by a small business, foods prepared for immediate consumption, foods in small packages and foods shipped in bulk.<P>

According to Nutritionist Mary Hughes, R.D., M.S., the new labeling regulations enable consumers to make healthier food choices.  &quot;The labels used since the 1970s were designed to prevent dietary inadequacies.  The new label is designed to prevent dietary excess,&quot; says Hughes.  &quot;By offering more complete and useful information, the new label will enable Americans to make healthful food choices.&quot;<P>

For the purpose of comparing foods, the most helpful change in the &quot;Nutrition Facts&quot; panel is the addition of serving sizes that are consistent across product lines.  These standardized sizes are also based on amounts people actually eat.  &quot;By taking advantage of these changes, consumers can truly make healthier choices.  Of course, don't try to compare all food products in one trip to the grocery store,&quot; says Hughes.  &quot;To save time, choose a few products that you'll concentrate on each trip.  In a few months, the contents of your cart will look completely different.&quot;<P>

The percent daily values in the center portion of the label makes it easy to match foods with your personal nutrition goals.  It's also more convenient when comparing nutritional quality of different brands.  In the sample label, the food has three grams of dietary fiber.  The average consumer doesn't know if that's a good or bad amount.  By looking at the percent daily value of fiber, you'll see the product will provide 12 percent of the recommended amount of fiber for the day.  So if your physician has prescribed a high-fiber diet, you'll find this product a good source compared to others.<P>

Another labeling benefit, especially for anyone trying to reduce fat or cholesterol intake, is the addition of the daily values footnotes listed on the bottom of the &quot;Nutrition Facts&quot; panel.  The values are based on 2000- and 2500-calorie diets, and are set according to current nutrition recommendations.  For example, the recommended intake of fat is 30 percent of calories or less.  Therefore, the sample label indicates someone with a 2000-calorie diet should eat no more than 65 grams of fat per day.<P>

Along with the changes on the food label, manufacturers now also need to follow legal definitions for terms like &quot;calorie free,&quot; &quot;lite&quot; and &quot;fat free.&quot;  For example, a food claiming to be &quot;fat free,&quot; must now contain less than one-half gram of fat per serving.  &quot;In the past, manufacturers tried to lure consumers by making claims on the front of their packages.  Now consumers can be confident that the claims actually mean something,&quot; says Hughes.<P>

Although all consumers should gain from the revised food label, the changes won't be cheap.  According to Hughes, more than 270,000 labels will be produced costing the food industry - and ultimately consumers - $2 billion or more.  But, as Hughes points out, consumers will reap the benefits in decreased rates of coronary heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, obesity and high blood pressure.  &quot;It's estimated that over the next 20 years, the labeling changes will reduce health care costs by anywhere from $3.6 to $21 billion,&quot; she says.  &quot;These numbers show the label really can be used as a tool to improve your health.&quot;<P>

HOW TO HELP YOUR FAMILY ENJOY A HEALTHY, <P>

HAPPY HOLIDAY SEASON</B><P>

</CENTER><P>

Christmas, Hanukkah, New Years; special memories, traditions, happy times.  Yes, the holidays are special, but the flip side of these occasions can include overeating, stress and not enough exercise.<P>

<P>

These celebrations and their trappings can undermine your family's efforts toward healthy eating and exercise habits.  The holidays should not be a time of deprivation, but they can serve as an opportunity to learn and practice moderation.<P>

<P>

If you've decided to manage the holidays better this year, and they can be managed but you'll need a plan.  The following suggestions will help you to practice healthy eating and exercise habits during the holidays and enjoy yourself while doing it.<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Managing Food<P>

</B></I><P>
<ul>
<LI>If special meals and parties are held at your house, you have control over the outcome.<p>


<LI>Have good tasting free and light foods available in abundance, for example - veggies and low fat dip, bread cubes and reduced-fat spinach dip, fresh fruit kebabs.<p>

<LI>Reduce fat in recipes by using less of the high-fat ingredients called for such as butter, nuts, sour cream, cream cheese or oils.<p>

<LI>Make low-fat substitutions such as using plain yogurt instead of sour cream, evaporated skim milk instead of evaporated whole milk or cream, ice milk or frozen yogurt instead of ice cream.<p>

<LI>Use reduced-fat products like reduced - or zero-fat margarine, sour cream or cream cheese.<p>

<LI>You may not want to meddle with traditional family favorites like Aunt Ruth's cheese cake.  Instead, try serving smaller portions.  Encourage everyone to eat slowly and savor every bite.  Try not to serve it after a large meal.  Offer it later or when it can be enjoyed to its fullest.  Remember, heavy and junk foods can be part of a healthy diet if limited appropriately.  The only way to learn moderation is to practice it.<p>

<LI>Seek out new, good tasting low-fat recipes to establish as traditions. <p>

<LI>A good resource for healthy recipes is the cookbook Eat, Drink and Be Healthy; A Guide to Healthful Eating and Weight Control by Janet Chiavetts.  Piedmont Publishers, $24.95.<p>

<LI>If you are attending events outside your home, volunteer to bring something light.  That way you can be sure at least one healthy item will be available.<p>

<LI>If your tradition includes making cookies or other treats, give them away as quickly as possible or freeze them.  Leave only a few at home to enjoy.<p>

<LI>Allow treats, but set limits.  If strategies don't go as planned, don't despair, talk about it with your child.  Consider it a learning experience to profit from.<p>

</ul>
Help your child focus on the non-food aspects of the holiday.  Emphasize the meaning behind the celebrations and traditions.  Encourage participation in events that don't involve food, but encourage involvement in the spirit of the season such as caroling at a hospital, visiting nursing home residents or collecting food and gifts for the needy.<p>

<p>

Because the holidays can create a hectic pace, meals become hit or miss.  To ensure healthier meals, plan ahead.  A good trick is to start early and prepare foods in large quantities to be frozen.  On busy days these can be reheated when a quick meal is needed.  A valuable resource for make-ahead meals is Once a Month Cooking by Mimi Wilson and Mary Beth Lagerbor, Focus and Family Publishing, $11.95.<P>

<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Exercise<P>

</B></I>Don't forget to continue to encourage exercise.  Discuss with your child ways to schedule exercise during this busy season.  If you don't make a point of prioritizing exercise, it can get lost in the holiday shuffle.<P>

<P>

Make time to relax as a family.  Cross country skiing or taking a long walk on a snowy night can relieve stress and keep you fit!<P>

<P>

Use the holidays as a start to planning your winter exercise routines. <P>

It can be more difficult to work out regularly in a colder climate.  <P>

Don't let this stop you.  Work together with your child to find wintertime activities that are fun to do.<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Healthy Gift Giving<P></B></I>
<ul>
<LI>Exercise tapes - Mousercise and the Barbie exercise tape are good for younger children.  Richard Simmons' Sweatin to the Oldies 1,2 and 3 are good for teens.<P>

<LI>Give your family a health club membership.  Make plans on when and how often you'll go together.<P>

<LI>Sport lessons make good gifts and broaden exercise options.  Tennis lessons, golf lessons, soccer camp, gymnastics or dance lessons are a few ideas.<P>

<LI>A present of workout clothes such as nifty new sweats, bright tights for aerobics class or fashionable workout shoes go a long way to encourage exercise.<P>

<LI>Since many overweight kids eat when bored, encourage new interests by giving the gift of craft classes, music lessons, language classes, etc.<P>

<LI>Promote positive self image - by giving gift certificates for haircuts, makeovers, manicures or a visit to an image consultant.<P>
</ul>
<P>

Encourage healthy eating by getting the kids involved in food preparation.  give them the gift of a kid's cooking class.  St. Marys Health Works offers them periodically.  You can call Health Works at 608-271-6400 for information.  Kids cookbooks are also available, these are some good ones:  Kitchen Fun for Kids:  Healthy Recipes and Nutrition Facts for 7 to 12 Year Old Cooks by Michael Jacobson and Laura Hill, $14.95; The Kid's Cookbook by Patricia Barrett-Dragon and rosemary Dalton, $8.95; the Lunch Book and Bag:  Including a Shopping List, Growth Chart and Over 25 Easy to Make Recipes by Kinny Kreiswirth and Jolene Bodily, $12.95; Betty Crocker's Boys and Girls Microwave Cookbook edited by Jean E. Kozar, $12.95; Kids Cooking:  A Very Slightly Messy Manual by the Editors of Klutz Press, $12.95.<P>

<P>

Use the New Year Holiday as a time to make family resolutions for a healthier new year!<P>

<P>

Have a happy, healthy holiday season.<P>

HEALTHY HOLIDAY GIFTS OF GOOD TASTE</B><P>

</CENTER><P>

<I>
By Tami Gregg, M.S., R.D., C.D.E.<P>

Registered Dietitian / Dean Foundation<P>

</I><P>

Homemade gifts can be some of the favorite presents to both give and receive during the holidays.  Through these gifts, we can give a little bit of ourselves to those we care about.  However, food gifts are not always low in fat, sugar or calories.  This article is meant to give you some ideas for healthy holiday gifts from the kitchen which can be interspersed with some of the more traditional favorites.<P>

<P>

If you would like to get the children involved, try making &quot;pomander balls.&quot;  Their spicy fragrance makes them a delightful gift.  Start with a thin skinned orange, lemon or lime.  Pierce the skin with a skewer or a large needle and insert a whole clove until only its head is showing.  Continue to do this until the fruit is completely covered in cloves.  Set the fruit aside and out of direct sunlight.  In about three days, the fruit will have dried and shrunk.  Since spices are preservatives, the pomanders will rarely spoil.  You can tie a ribbon around it and hang it in the closet or make a bowl full of them and make the entire room smell wonderful.  (Source:  Good-News Letter, American Institute for Cancer Research, Vol. III, Issue 1, Nov. 1992.)<P>

<P>

Holiday food gifts don't have to be fancy.  Old bottles, jars and other containers can be used to package your holiday gifts.  Homemade herb seasoning mix, seasoned vinegars or cooking wines packaged and decorated with a bow make nice gifts.  Decorated baskets or even everyday items, such as a colorful colander or a large measuring cup or bowl, make wonderful containers for homemade muffins, spices or the pre-measured ingredients for a healthy holiday meal ready to go.  A child's toy or lunch box can be used to package food gifts for the little ones.<P>

<P>

Recipes for these &quot;healthier&quot; gifts of food may be found in a variety of cookbooks.  A recommended nutritional reading list can be obtained from the Dean Medical Center Educational Services Department.  Another reference list (annotated bibliography) is available as part of the November 1993 issue of the Tufts University Diet and Nutrition Letter for four dollars (single issue) or twenty dollars (twelve issues).  Call 1-800-274-7581 for more information.  In fact, a cookbook or a subscription to the Tufts Newsletter makes a great gift.<P>

<P>

For those who enjoy making crafts, some excellent resources are Christmas Gifts of Good Taste and Gifts that Taste Good by Leisure Arts' Memories in the Making series.  These can be ordered by telephone at 1-800-288-8990 or purchased from your local bookstore.  The list price is $18.95.  These books can also be checked out at the local library.  The craft ideas which accompany each recipe are fairly simple and very beautiful.  The recipes are not especially low in fat, sugar or calories, but can be easily modified by substituting with versions from other cookbooks.  Recipes can also be modified by using the following tips:<P>

Other gift ideas include kitchen items like a steamer, a fat-trapping gravy pitcher or a double meatloaf pan.  An interesting assortment of healthy gadgets is available from the Vegetarian Lifestyle Catalog.  Call 1-800-835-2867 for ordering information.<P>

<P>

When giving or receiving food gifts, it is important to be mindful of food safety.  If you have any questions regarding food safety, you can call the Department of Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555.  Another resource is the National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics Nutrition Hotline at 1-800-366-1655.<P>

</I>Gift baskets:  A variety of herb teas, a tea leaf ball and a special tea cup;  gourmet mustard and salsa, herb vinegar, crackers and unique canape knives; gourmet coffees, scented mug rugs and a special coffee mug.<P>

A companion guide is available which provides a nutritional analysis for major nutrients.  It's called What's In It?  The Busy Cook's Diet and Nutrition Guide by Nutrinfo at $4.95.

<P>

<I>

<P>

<I>
Naomi Wedel</I><P>

A subscription to Cooking Light magazine, $15 per year, call 1-800-999-1750; gifts to promote exercise such as weights, exercise mat, bike, treadmill, exercise videos, tapes, etc.; the books Fit or Fat by Covert Bailey or Eat More, Weigh Less by Dean Ornish; an assortment of snack foods such as &quot;by Request&quot; popcorn by Orville Redenbacher, rice cakes, pretzels, crackers and lowfat cheeses; an air popcorn popper.<P>

<P>

And finally, here are a few tips for taking care of yourself during the holidays.  First, don't label foods as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot;  There is no perfect diet and no perfect food.  The important point is to keep food choices, as well as lifestyle, in balance.  If you've been trying to lose weight, just try to maintain over the holidays.  Continue to make exercise and healthy food choices a priority, but don't assume that you will pass up every opportunity to enjoy your favorite treats. Instead, set priorities on holiday goodies and allow yourself small portions of your favorite treats.  And, when possible, replace some of those high-fat holiday dishes with a low-fat version.  Try to eat in a healthy way on average over the holiday season.<P>

<P>

Have a happy and healthy holiday!<P>

<h2>Atherosclerosis/Narrowing of the arteries</h2>
<B>
Bypassing surgery: Expanding treatments for blocked arteries</B><P>

Each year, over 780,000 Americans die from atherosclerosis -- arteries that narrow, due to deposits which form along their lining. Often referred to as a hardening of the arteries, or build- up of cholesterol plaques, the disease can affect arteries anywhere in the body. When it strikes, it restricts blood flow through the vessel, reducing oxygen that's carried through the blood to vital organs. In the past, treating clogged arteries meant performing risky bypass surgery that required opening the patient's chest cavity to redirect blood flow around the blockage. Now, increasing alternatives to open heart surgery mean reduced hospital stay, recovery time and cost for many patients.<P>

<P>

<I>
Atherosclerosis: A disease of aging<P>

</I>While people in their middle- to old-age are most susceptible, other <P>

factors also help determine a patient's risk for developing atherosclerosis. According to Cardiologist Daniel T. Danahy, M.D., men have a greater risk than women, (particularly premenopausal women) for developing the disease. Other contributing factors include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, inactivity and family history. &quot;Family history is an important risk, particularly when there are multiple family members who've had it,&quot; Dr. Danahy explains.<P>

<P>

Developing gradually over years, or sometimes very abruptly, the disease follows a complex course. &quot;What actually happens, is that cholesterol and other blood fats deposit on the walls of the artery,&quot; Dr. Danahy says. &quot;There's an inflammatory response and scarring (fibrosis) that takes place. Over time, the plaques build up.&quot; <P>

The arteries most commonly blocked are those running to the brain (carotid), the heart (coronary) and the leg (femoral or iliac). As its passage narrows, the strained vessel can only carry limited amounts of blood through its channel, restricting the oxygen which travels through the blood. If the tunnel is not widened, clogged carotid arteries can trigger a stroke; blocked coronary arteries can result in a heart attack; and clogged arteries in the leg will often cause the patient significant pain and reduced circulation or numbness.<P>

<P>

According to Dr. Danahy, patients are at the highest risk when the blockage builds abruptly, completely closing off access through the artery. &quot;For example, there may be plaque on the inner lining of the coronary artery that's not big enough to cause much trouble,&quot; he explains. &quot;Then, suddenly a clot forms on top of that plaque, restricting blood flow through the artery. That's what causes most heart attacks.&quot; <P>

<P>

<I>
Balloons widen paths<P>

</I>For years, the only surgical intervention for blocked arteries was bypass surgery. The complex procedure involves redirecting blood flow around the obstructed artery, by making a new connection downstream to restore circulation. According to Dr. Danahy, the downfall to bypass operations, is that they require the patient's chest to be opened and the heart stopped, while the new path is constructed. The procedure requires lengthy hospital stays, and sometimes months of recovery after the patient returns home. About 20 years ago, cardiologists began using a new technique, called balloon angioplasty, which enables them to treat clogged arteries without major surgery.<P>

 <P>

Inserting a long, narrow, hollow tube (catheter) into an artery through a small incision made into the patient's arm or leg, the physician guides the catheter to the blocked artery. Inside the catheter, there is a thinner catheter, which carries a miniature, deflated balloon on its tip. Using X-ray imaging on a television screen, the cardiologist directs the balloon-tipped instrument to the obstructed site, inflating the balloon to flatten the plaque against the artery walls, widening its passageway. <P>

<P>

Taking just one to three hours, angioplasties are performed in a catheterization laboratory, using a local anesthetic, with most patients experiencing only minor discomfort. &quot;One of the advantages is that we can work from the artery in the leg, just using a puncture into the blood vessel to guide the catheter,&quot; Dr. Danahy says. Although angioplasty has freed many patients from relying on bypass surgery, one particular group had not been well suited for it. &quot;Some people have really advanced plaque, with calcium deposits which form in the plaque. This makes their artery very hard, stiff, and resistant to angioplasty,&quot; Dr. Danahy explains. &quot;Our concern with patients like this, is that we'll tear the artery when the balloon is inflated.&quot; Because of the risks, most of these patients have had little choice but to undergo bypass operations. Now, a tool that actually removes plaque, allows many of them to be treated without major surgery.<P>

<P>

<I>
Rotoablator grinds plaque<P>

</I>Approved for clinical use several years ago by the Food &amp; Drug Administration, the rotoablator has been used by Dean Medical Center cardiologists for about one year. According to Dr. Danahy, rotoablation is performed very much like balloon angioplasty. The rotoablator looks similar to the balloon-tipped catheter, but on its end, rather than a balloon, the rotoablator has a diamond tip, which spins at 200,000 times per minute, grinding the plaque into minuscule pieces. &quot;The rotoablator is almost like a sander,&quot; he explains. &quot;It actually removes the plaque from the artery walls by shaving it into tiny particles. Although they don't actually leave the body, these particles are flushed downstream through the blood circulation.&quot; <P>

<P>

<I>
Other options expand success<P>

</I>Although rotoablation will most likely be confined to treating patients with severely hardened arteries, other advances continue to expand the options for helping people with atherosclerosis. &quot;There are several options we can use, often in conjunction with angioplasty.&quot; Dr. Danahy says. &quot;We've had a lot of success with stents and atherectomies, for example.&quot; <P>

<P>

Much like rotoablation, an atherectomy is performed using a small cutting instrument, that's guided through a catheter, grinding away plaque from the artery walls. Some are accompanied by a small vacuum, which removes the plaque once its cut from the vessel.<P>

About the size of a spring inside a ballpoint pen, stents are used to widen clogged arteries. They are inserted into the blocked region using a balloon-tipped catheter. When the balloon is inflated, it expands the stent, leaving it in place to support the artery wall. According to Dr. Danahy, stents add to the benefits of balloon angioplasty. &quot;You get the largest opening with the stent,&quot; he says. &quot;Even if there is some new tissue that forms as the artery heals, it may not narrow the artery enough to cause substantial blockage.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Considering the alternative<P>

</I>According to Dr. Danahy, one continuing challenge cardiologists face in treating atherosclerosis, is that plaque deposits may return. Even patients who've had atherectomies or rotoablation, sometimes require future treatments to widen arteries clogged with new blockage. &quot;We see the plaques return (restenosis) in about one in four patients,&quot; he says. &quot;It probably isn't the same plaque, but may be an exaggerated healing response to the treatment.&quot;<P>

<P>

For some patients, this may mean combining treatments when restenosis occurs. &quot;If we have someone whose artery won't stay open, we may go in repeatedly.&quot; Dr. Danahy says. &quot;Usually we'll try a new approach.&quot; <P>

<P>

As more approaches become available, cardiologists are increasingly empowered to successfully treat atherosclerosis without major surgery. &quot;Even with a low risk patient, bypass surgery means the patient will spend about five to seven days in the hospital, requiring an incision to his chest and probably his leg also. After returning home, he'll probably face several weeks of  recovery,&quot; Dr. Danahy says. &quot;The procedures we perform in the cardiac catheterization lab allow most patients to return to full activity the next day.&quot;<P>

<h2>Adult Immunizations</h2>
<B>
Shots: They're not just for kids anymore<P>

</B>Many of us have one. It's a tiny scar, about the size of a pencil eraser, usually on our upper arm. I don't remember getting mine, but my mother does. Though she regretted seeing me hurt, she knew my momentary pain paled in comparison to what I might otherwise suffer. Once the tears dried (hers, that is), my tiny scar served as a comforting reminder that I was immune from the deadly smallpox disease. If you're like many adults, you probably share your own stories about childhood vaccines. But, if you thought shots were just for kids, you may be surprised to learn that there are several you will probably need throughout your adulthood. Without these shots, you could risk contracting serious, preventable diseases.<P>

<P>

<I>
How vaccines prevent disease</I><P>

According to Internist and Infectious Disease Specialist Katherine Kulak, M.D., vaccines prevent infection by introducing the disease-causing agent into the person's body. &quot;Theoretically, the patient's immune system should build a protective barrier against the actual disease,&quot; she explains. Vaccines can be given in either &quot;live&quot; or simulated doses. &quot;Sometimes you may hear about a patient experiencing very low-grade symptoms after they've had a vaccine,&quot; she says. &quot;This is because they've been given a live dosage of the actual agent that causes that disease.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Ask your doctor first<P>

</I>Before asking to be immunized, Dr. Kulak recommends that adults check with their physician. She stresses that certain people should not receive live doses of vaccines, and their doctors may even recommend they avoid or postpone getting shots. These patients include:<P>
<ul type=disc>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
Pregnant women, or women considering pregnancy Immunocompromised patients

<LI>
Patients receiving chemotherapy treatments

<LI>
People taking immunosuppresant drugs or high doses of Prednisone HIV-positive patients
</ul>
<P>

People who grew up outside the United States should also discuss their history with their physician, Dr. Kulak recommends. &quot;The vaccination requirements vary between countries,&quot; she says. &quot;For example, Ireland does not give a tetanus series, which we recommend in the United States. So, it's important that their records be confirmed.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Incomplete vaccination records?<P>

</I>One challenge adults often face is having incomplete records of their vaccination history. Fortunately, this does not necessarily mean they'll need to endure childhood shots all over again. Instead, Dr. Kulak says a &quot;titer&quot; can be used to test patients' immunity to certain diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), hepatitis A, hepatitis B and varicella (a form of chicken pox). &quot;The titer involves taking a blood sample from the patient,&quot; she says. &quot;If the agent is present in their blood, it means they're immune to that disease.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Shots adults should have: who, what and when </i><P>

<ul type=disc>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
Tetanus, diphtheria (TD):<BR>

If receiving for the first time, patients should get a series of three shots: the second and third will follow two and six months (respectively) after the first. Patients should get boosters every 10 years.<P>

<LI>
Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR):<BR>

Adults born after 1957, who've never been immunized, should get one shot. College students and health care workers are advised to have a second dose.<P>

<LI>
Influenza (Flu):<BR>

One shot should be given annually (in November) to:<BR>

<ul type=circle>
<lh></lh>

<li> Patients 65 and older

<li> Residents of nursing homes, or chronic care facilities Patients with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disorders, including:
<ul type=circle>
<lh></lh>

<li> Asthma

<li> Congestive heart failure

<li> Conditions requiring regular follow-up care or hospitalization during the prior year, due to a metabolic disease, such as diabetes, renal insufficiency or immunosuppression
</ul>
</ul>
<LI>
Pneumococcal pneumonia:<BR>

Patients who are advised to have flu shots may also be given this vaccine at the same time.<P>

<LI>
Hepatitis B:<BR>

Shots are given in a series of three: the second and third are given one and six months (respectively) following the first. People who are often advised to have the vaccine include:<BR>
<ul type=circle>
<lh></lh>

<li> Women considering pregnancy

<li> Health care workers 

<li> IV drug users 

<li> Patients with multiple sex partners 
</ul>
</ul>
<P>

<I>
Newly approved vaccines for adults<P>

</I>According to Infectious Disease News (a trade publication for Infectious Disease Specialists), physicians recently added newly approved vaccines to the list recommended for adults. These shots, and the patients who may be advised to get them, include:<P>
<ul type=disc>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
<B>
Varicella</B> (health care workers; immunocompromised individuals; adults working in schools, day care facilities, or other settings which may increase exposure to the disease; patients in semi-closed environments, such as college dormitories or the military; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; international travelers.)<P>

<LI>
<B>
Hepatitis A</B> (international travelers, including military personnel, traveling to countries where the virus is endemic; patients with multiple sex partners; IV drug users; patients with chronic liver disease; anyone in an occupational setting that poses infection risks, such as laboratories where live virus is handled.)<P>

<LI>
<B>
Purified typhoid Vi polysaccharide</B> (people traveling to developing countries, anyone in contact with carriers of salmonella typhi, laboratory personnel who handle salmonella typhi.)<P>
</ul>
<P>

<I>
Traveling outside the country?</I><P>

According to Dr. Kulak, patients planning to travel outside the United States should find out what shots they may need before going. They can generally get this information by calling the Travel and Immunization Clinic (608-252-8109), located in Dean Medical Center's Infectious Disease department. But she urges travelers to plan ahead. &quot;If you are aware of a trip -- especially a long one -- it may be a good idea to check well in advance,&quot; she says. &quot;Some vaccinations can take up to six months to vaccinate.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Some shots may be forgotten<B>
<P>

</B></I>Although most adults generally remember their flu shots, Family Practitioner Kathleen A. Kruk, M.D., Fort Atkinson Medical Center (a Dean/St. Marys Regional Affiliated Clinic), says they may forget certain other vaccines. &quot;Many adults forget they need tetanus boosters every 10 years,&quot; she says. &quot;Some may also be unaware that they might need the two-shot chicken pox series, if they've never had the disease, and are over 18 years old.&quot; Some adults could even be missing their complete measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) series. &quot;Adults in their 20s and 30s may need an additional MMR,&quot; she points out. &quot;Even though most received these shots as young kids, many in this age group had left school before physicians began administering the second series. Anyone who's unsure should check with their doctor.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Remember: Diseases don't discriminate</I><P>

Although vaccinated patients are protected from getting many diseases, there are still people who go through life or on trips without being immunized. As long as these unprotected bodies are available for infection, otherwise preventable diseases can continue to thrive. And even when old diseases are eradicated, new ones -- like the Ebola virus and AIDS -- take their place. So, even if you remember having the mumps as a child, or you don the scar to prove you've had your smallpox vaccination -- remember, that as long as diseases occupy our planet, you'll probably never be too old for more shots.<P>

GOOD NEWS FOR MIGRAINE SUFFERERS<P>

</CENTER><P>

</B>Everyone has suffered from an occasional headache.  But some migraine sufferers will say you don't know what a real headache is until you've battled your way through a migraine...and it is a battle.  Migraine sufferers tell stories about headaches involving an intensely throbbing pain that is accompanied by nausea and made worse by sounds (phonophobia) and lights (photophobia).  Up until a few months ago, many migraine sufferers had to do just that...suffer.  Now, with the introduction of a new medication, the more than 10 million Americans who suffer from migraines can find relief.<P>

<P>

A migraine is a painful inflammatory reaction in the blood vessels triggered by the central nervous system.  It may be one particular trigger or a combination.  One migraine trigger theory states that certain physical and emotional triggers produce migraines by causing blood vessels to dilate.  Another theory, however, suggests just the opposite - the emotional trigger (anger, frustration) releases adrenaline, which causes blood vessels to narrow.  Once the stress is gone, vessels open again and a migraine results.<P>

<P>

According to Dean Neurologist Charles Miley, M.D., the new drug Imitrex has been successful in relieving migraines in 70-80 percent of sufferers.  &quot;Before Imitrex, we used straight pain killers.  The trouble with analgesics is you build up a tolerance and some people can even develop an analgesic-induced headache as a result of taking a lot of headache medication,&quot; says Dr. Miley.<P>

<P>

Although there are some things you can do to prevent a migraine from occurring, people who suffer from them seem to be targeted from birth. <P>

Dr. Miley says there's an inborn disturbance in the centers of the <P>

brain that make people susceptible to migraines.  &quot;Migraines appear to be genetic, but not necessarily related to a specific gene.  Multiple genes are probably involved, making it poly-genetic.&quot;<P>

<P>

Although migraines have an inborn tendency, Dr. Miley says they are usually precipitated by a physical or psychological stress, a change in sleeping or eating patterns, a sudden reduction in stress or a change in season.  &quot;It's very common for people to suffer from a migraine on the first day or two of vacation due to the letdown after working very hard to plan the time off.&quot;<P>

<P>

The migraine headache has been classified into two different categories.  The &quot;classic migraine&quot; involves a physical warning sign (aura) before the migraine arrives.  Auras are most often visual where the patient sees flashing lights or zigzag lines or experiences a gap in the visual field.  Migraines lacking strong, clear warning symptoms are labeled &quot;common migraines.&quot;<P>

<P>

The success of Imitrex comes from the way it mimics the action of a neurotransmitter called serotonin located in the receptors of the brain.  The effect serotonin has on the receptors eliminates the migraine.  &quot;The difference between this drug and others that we've tried is that it's not a pain medication,&quot; says Dr. Miley.  &quot;Imitrex works specifically to counteract the mechanism of a migraine in the brain.&quot;<P>

<P>

In addition to its effectiveness, Imitrex is attractive to patients because it's easier to use.  Patients are able to inject the drug in their leg or arm using the specially-designed injection tube.  And for those people who don't like to see needles, don't worry.  The tube doesn't allow the migraine sufferer to see the needle during the injection.<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Behavioral therapy as headache treatment<P>

</B></I>In addition to Imitrex, some patients have had great success using Behavior Therapy either alone or in combination with pharmaceutical treatment.  Behavior therapy in migraine patients is based on identifying factors that contribute to the headache and coming up with a plan to control them, typically through some form of relaxation exercise.<P>

<P>

With the assistance of a biofeedback machine that allows patients to see how their muscles react to stressors or relaxation exercises, John Martin, Ph.D. has witnessed some migraine success stories.  &quot;Using the biofeedback machine we can give patients information they wouldn't normally be able to use to help them relax,&quot; says Dr. Martin.  &quot;It makes it much easier for patients to have something to look at that indicates their relaxation effort rather than having to figure out on their own if they feel more relaxed.&quot;<P>

<P>

The first step, according to Dr. Martin, is to work with patients on a 20-minute muscle relaxation training exercise.  The exercise is done while on the machine so patients can see the results of the exercises. <P>

<P>

Next, strategies are devised that patients can fit into their daily routines.  &quot;I like to design a plan that automatically works into their day,&quot; says Dr. Martin.  &quot;There's a good chance that if everyone could take 20 minutes off to relax there wouldn't be as many headaches.  Since most of us don't have that luxury, we try to create strategies that are built into their routines, making it difficult for headaches to reoccur.  In a sense it's treatment, but it's also a form of prevention.&quot;<P>

<P>

One successful treatment plan was designed for a patient who had a desk job involving a lot of computer work and phone answering.  &quot;We had her repeat the same `cue' word every time she hung up the phone.  After a day or two, the patient automatically thought of the word when hanging up the phone, helping her relax.&quot;  The philosophy behind the cue word is based on the same stressful cues in which people react negatively.  When the phone rings many times in one day, the ring becomes a negative cue.  Using a positive cue word when hanging up the phone can help reduce or prevent stress that can lead to migraines.<P>

<P>

According to Dr. Martin, giving migraine sufferers a sense of control over their bodies is one of the best aspects of behavioral therapy.  &quot;These are people who have in the past been hit with a debilitating illness without much notice.  Using some of the behavioral therapy techniques gives them a chance to keep the migraine from occurring.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
Imitrex proves successful with this patient<P>

</B></I>Amy Clemens has been suffering from migraines since she was in her early twenties.  Until the emergence of Imitrex, the other pharmaceutical alternatives were either ineffective or caused side effects that almost equaled the migraines.  Now, with the use of Imitrex and a maintenance medication, the frequency of Amy's migraines has gone from two a week to approximately two a month.<P>

<P>

Because of Amy's debilitating migraines, before discovering Imitrex she would have to miss work whenever a severe headache developed.  &quot;Even when using some of the other medications, I wasn't in good enough shape to work.  With Imitrex I get relief in about ten minutes,&quot; she says.<P>

<P>

Although Amy tries to avoid cheese and chocolate, the things that trigger her migraines, she still has to use Imitrex a few times a month.  And each use has made her more comfortable with the medication.  &quot;Since I've become more relaxed with Imitrex, the result seems to be better.&quot;<P>

<P>

Having Imitrex as an alternative, Amy says, may even keep the migraines from occurring as often.  &quot;I'm more relaxed and less stressed now that I know there's something that will relieve my migraines.  I can finally count on something that really works for me.&quot;<P>
