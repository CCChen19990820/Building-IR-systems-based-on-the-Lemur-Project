<H3>ENDNOTES FOR PART 3:  THE ARKANSAS PHASE</H3><BR>





<P>1 Although the documents are signed by Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, but are not signed by President Clinton, the information reported by the Clintons on their 1978 federal income tax return corresponds exactly with the cost and date information on the purchase agreement and installment note, indicating that the transaction was consummated on January 25, 1977. (See Williams & Connolly Prod. DKSN022069; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01547.) <BR>

<P>2 There is no independent documentary evidence that the $400 down payment was made, but a deposit ticket from 1st Jacksonville Bank of Jacksonville, Arkansas indicates that Rolling Manor Inc. deposited a $155.51 payment by then-Attorney General Clinton into its bank account on April 22, 1977. (Williams & Connolly Document DKSN022068; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01546).<BR>

<P>3 The deposit ticket, which was stamped by the bank, indicates that the outstanding balance on the note was $10,917.82, consistent with what the balance of the note would be after the first monthly payment of $155.51 is applied to interest and principal. Williams & Connolly Prod. DKSN022068; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01546.<BR>

<P>4 Based on information reported in their 1977 federal income tax return, the Clintons' adjusted gross income in 1977 was just $41,731.  After accounting for adjusted itemized deductions ($9,688) and other adjustments, e.g., federal taxes withheld, ($8,835), the Clintons' disposable income in 1977 was $23,208, before any expenditures for such items as principal payments on their mortgage, food, and clothing.  Thus, a $9,500 payment would have equaled more than 40 percent of their total disposable income in 1977. <BR>

<P>5   Mr. Ritter's recollection of these meeting is vague, and if these meeting were held to execute loan renewals, the dates of these meetings do not comport with the available documentary evidence.  If both of these meetings were convened to execute loan renewal documents it is possible that they occurred one or two years later than Mr. Ritter recollects (for instance the interest rate first increased in 1980, but did not increase significantly until 1981).  Mr. Ritter left Citizen's Bank at the end of 1983.<BR>

<P>6 The remaining $6,052 balance of Mrs. Clinton's loan was paid off in two payments-- one in the amount of $285 from the man who had purchased the property from Mrs. Clinton, and the other, $5,797, from an unknown payor.<BR>

<P>7 On November 1, 1989, Mr. Wade filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  On August 27, 1990, Mr. Wade's bankruptcy was converted to an involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 7.   Wade's involuntary bankruptcy remained open as late as 1995. ( 4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 124).<BR>

<P>8 Elsewhere in his notes, Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>

<P>A.<P>Colo analysis was of economic loss<BR>

<P><P>(1)  did not take into account interest deductions<BR>

<P><P>(2)  calculation included some items for which there were no canceled cks.<BR>

Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000517.  "Colo analysis" was an apparent reference to the Lyons report.<BR>

<P>10<P> Internal Revenue Code Section  453 allows, under certain conditions, taxpayers to pay gains on the sale of property on the installment method. <BR>

<P>11<P> The gross profit percentage on this transaction was 42.9%.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00672 (Installment Gain on Sale Schedule - attachment to Clinton 1978 income tax return). Since the remaining gain was $5,405, the basis would be $7,194.<BR>

<P>12<P> Treas. Regs. Section 1.6001-1(a) states that taxpayers shall keep records which "are sufficient to establish the amount of gross income, deductions, credits..." on the taxpayer's return.<BR>

<P>13<P> Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00523 (check 697, dated December 28, 1978, issued to Great Southern Land Company, Inc. in the amount of $10,130.58 states "Reimbursement for six months interest"; check 396, dated December 29, 1979, issued to Citizens Bank & Trust in the amount of $4,752.88 states "Interest Payment"; check 395, dated December 29, 1979, issued to James B. McDougal in the amount of $237.50 states "Reimbursement of Interest pd.").  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 00528 (check 1623, dated December 30, 1986, issued to Security Bank in the amount of $1,635.51 states "Int on note 957585.").<BR>

<P>14<P> There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1981 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-69.<BR>

<P>15<P> There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1982 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-88.<BR>

<P>16<P> Betsey Wright, who ran Governor Clinton's 1984 campaign, testified that $30,500 was raised at the event.  (Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 278.)  Ms. Wright, the custodian of records for that campaign, she based that figure on checks from 17 persons or entities that she said had been collected in connection with the fundraiser.  (O'Melveny & Myers Production CCBW-0017-24.)  Mr. McDougal has stated in various interviews that the fundraiser raised about $35,000.  (E.g. New York Times, 12/15/93 p. B8.)  Notes taken by Susan Thomases in 1992 of a conversation she had with Sherry Curry reflect that "MacD FR raised $39,150."  (Willkie Farr & Gallagher Production ST 45.)<BR>

<P>17<P> Senator Fulbright himself could not be interviewed because he had a stroke several years ago and died in February 1995.<BR>

<P>18<P> Mr. Chertoff.  Did Mr. Latham come to you and offer you work for the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan?<BR>



<P>Mr. Massey.  I don't believe so. <BR>



<P>Mr. Chertoff.  Did Mr. Latham come to you and ask you to help him -- come to you directly, that is to say, before you'd been assigned to the matter, and ask you to help him with an effort by the savings and loan to issue preferred  stock? <BR>



<P>Mr. Massey.  Sir, I don't remember that.  It could have happened, but I don't remember that.<BR>

<P>19   In an interview with RTC investigators, Mr. Latham stated that "McDougal had friends over there and he suggested we use them.  When asked who the friends were Latham said that they were Hillary Rodham Clinton and others."  <BR>

<P>20  Well as I have said consistently since 1992. . . my recollection is that Mr. Massey wanted to do the work he had discussed with Mr. Latham, that some partners, I believe in the securities section, had advised Mr. Massey that they were not enthusiastic about undertaking the representation on behalf of Jim McDougal and Madison because of some problems in having work paid for in the past, and that there were discussions among partners.<BR>



<P>I believe it was Vince Foster who came to me, who said that Mr. Massey wanted to do this work, but the partners didn't want him to do it . . .  And I was asked, as someone who knew McDougal, if I could intervene and perhaps set up an opportunity for Mr. Massey to do this work.<P><BR>



<P>So I talked with Mr. Massey about the work.  Mr. Massey told me, as his testimony relates, that he had a talk with Mr. Latham, but it wasn't up to Mr. Latham, and he wasn't getting any support from others within the firm, and I told him I would talk to Mr. McDougal, which I did.  (1996 Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro Interview of Hillary Rodham Clinton, pp. 27-31, Resolution Trust Corporation Document S-INTV000628-632.)  <BR>



<P>21<P> The Rose Law Firm letter had misspelled Mr. Handley's name; they wrote "Hanley".<BR>

<P>22 In addition, starting on May 14, 1985 and until the end of 1985, the Rose Law Firm attempted to secure approval for a broker-dealer subsidiary for Madison. (Massey, 6/15/95 RTC Statement p. 3).  The proposal was submitted to the Arkansas Savings and Loan Board Association.<BR>

<P>23 The Pillsbury law firm reached the conclusion that "a court might hold that the acquisition, as structured, was fraudulent," and noted that "the use of Seth Ward as a straw has some of the earmarks of a fraudulent or intentional attempt to violate the law."  2/6/96 Pillsbury Report pp. 142, 146.<BR>

<P>24 At trial, Mr. Ward took the position that the notes worth $370,943 was evidence of his entitlement to unpaid commissions, but he denied that the $400,000 loan was related to any commissions.  That loan, he maintained, was separate and fully discharged when he quitclaimed the property securing the mortgage -- Holman Acres -- back to Madison.  12/28/95 Pillsbury Report pp. 31-32.  When the jury returned a verdict for Mr. Ward, it <BR>

<P>25 As with the September 24, 1985 letter, there is a second version of the May 1 option.(RTC Document SW1-070 - SW1-074).  The only substantive difference between the two is that the property at issue in the second option is not Holman Acres, but a 6.67 acre parcel of land containing the Levi Strauss Building.(RTC Document SW1-070 - SW1-074).<BR>

<P>26 Mr. Hubbell stated that "I remember that Mr. Ward would come to my office and on occasion, ask my secretary to type letters that he had handwritten or had been drafted somewhere else."  Hubbell, 2/7/96 Hrg. p. 11.<BR>

<P>27<P> All three were subsequently arrested and convicted for felonies involving drug use and distribution.<BR>

<P>28<P> Mr. Lasater testified that he was first introduced to President Clinton by the President's mother Virginia Kelly at Oaklawn Racing Park in Hot Springs Arkansas in the 1970's.  Lasater, 5/1/96 Hrg. p. 10.<BR>

<P>29<P> Mr. Nash is currently the Director of the White House Personnel Office.<BR>

<P>30<P> Mr. Hardwicke was appointed by Governor Clinton to the AHDA board, and served from 1980 - 1986 or 1987.  Hardwicke, 2/15/96 Dep. p.6.  Mr. Hardwicke testified that he has been a "pretty close" personal friend of Bill Clinton since 1974.  Hardwicke, 2/15/96 Dep. p. 11.<BR>

<P>31<P> The Multi-Family Sub-Committee made this recommendation after considering both oral and written proposals from eight financial firms.  ADFA Document 10/19/95 (Not Numbered).<BR>

<P>32<P> Mitchell Williams billed Lasater & Co. $32,150.93 for legal services performed related to "legislative advice" and the "leasing proposal."  TJ Raney Production 72.<BR>

<P>33<P> The Mitchell Williams attorney who signed the May 16 opinion letter, was Anne Ritchey, one of the lawyers who had performed work for the Lasater group.<BR>

<P>34<P> Mr. Gaines was the governor's office liaison with state public safety agencies.<BR>

<P>35 In May, 1986, Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Hale to substitute another application for the file.  According to Mr. Hale, Mr. McDougal was "real frightened and he was--he said he had to see my file, he had to get the file.  I asked him what the problem was.  He said he was going to have to change the purpose out.  He had prepared another loan application showing the loan for a different purpose and he had to exchange that out, and he had things that were going bad at Madison.  (McDougal trial, p. 3308).  The other application states that "real estate brokerage and land development was Master Marketing's business.  (McDougal trial, p. 3347).  <BR>

     Mr. Lyons reviewed the available Whitewater "documents and information...that had been assembled by campaign staff after the issue had been raised by Mr. Jeff Gerth of the New York Times."294294.     Lyons, 6/5/96 Dep. p. 11.  Based on his preliminary analysis of the documents, Mr. Lyons determined that the campaign "needed accounting help to assist in a financial reconstruction."  He "made a recommendation to campaign staff and to Governor and Mrs. Clinton . . . to engage Patten, McCarthy & Associates,"295295.     Lyons, 6/5/96 Dep. p. 10. a Denver financial consulting firm.<BR>

     In early March 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Leslie Patten, a certified public accountant and president of Patten, McCarthy & Associates,296296.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. p. 9. and engaged his firm, on behalf of the Clintons, to conduct "a financial reconstruction of Whitewater Development Corporation from the then available books and records."297297.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 47.  Mr. Lyons and Mr. Patten were "friends" and "had a professional relationship for a number of years."298298.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 47.  Mr. Patten's firm provided "consultation on banking, financial, accounting and tax matters arising from business litigation and expert witness testimony on such issues."299299.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01155.  On March 10, 1992 the Patten firm began working on its analysis of Whitewater.300300.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 69-71.  Mr. Patten and Norris Weese, another certified public accountant and the firm's vice president, were the only professionals who performed work on the document that became the final report.301301.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 12-13.  Mr. Weese went to Arkansas to gather documents and began the financial analyses, and Mr. Patten reviewed the financial analyses and drafted the document that became the final report.302302.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 12-13. <BR>

     Work on the so-called Lyons report proceeded rapidly, with the involvement of Mrs. Clinton.  On March 18, 1992, just eight days after the Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese began work on the project, a draft of the final report was completed,303303.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 69-71. and was faxed the next day to Mr. Lyons, Mrs. Clinton, Loretta Lynch and James Hamilton, a lawyer working with Mr. Lyons on the Clinton campaign.304304.

The fax to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch was 55 pages long and contained over 30 pages of work papers prepared by the Patten firm.  On March 20, a revised draft was faxed to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hamilton, and John Klusaritz, another Clinton campaign lawyer.305305.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01177-90.  Later that day, Mr. Patten faxed to Mrs Clinton a revised report, dated March 20, 1992 and addressed to Governor Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, that contained six type-written pages.  The report was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese.306306.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01101-107.  According to Mr. Patten, "the substance of the report was pretty much final at that point," but "I think we were premature in signing it because we had not obtained everybody's comments."307307.

During this period, Mr. Patten testified that he "was in fairly regular communication with Mr. Lyons," who "was anxious to get this project completed and was seeking periodic updates as to where we were in the process."308308.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 19-20.<BR>

     Then, on March 20 or March 21, 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Mr. Patten and told him that he wanted two versions of the report prepared, a summary version that only addressed specific questions raised by the press and a full report addressed to him.  According to Mr. Patten's testimony:<BR>

     It's at this approximate point [in] time when Mr. Lyons advised me that he wanted a summary report prepared. . . .  The essence of it was that Mr. Lyons indicated that he [would] like to have a summary report in addition to the full report which would be addressed to him. . . .  My understanding was that the purpose of the summary report was to address two or three specific questions that had been raised by the press.309309.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 75-77.  <BR>

     Mr. Lyons testified that the Patten firm "prepared a single report and a summary of it"310310.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 103. and that "[o]ne is simply shorter and in my opinion was more responsive to the issues that were then being put forward by the press."311311.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 112.  On March 21, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed a shorter version of the report to Mrs Clinton.312312.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01086-92.  As with the version of the report faxed to Mrs. Clinton the day before, this version of the report, dated March 21, 1992, was addressed to the Clintons and was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese, but it was almost three pages shorter than the previous day's version.313313.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01086-92.  On March 22, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed even shorter versions of the report, dated March 23, 1992 and signed by Mr. Weese and Mr. Patten, to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch.314314.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01058-69.  <BR>

     On March 23, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed Mrs. Clinton the final summary version of the Patten firm's report, which contained three type-written pages and two pages of charts.315315.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01115-119. A one page cover letter from Mr. Patten to the Clintons states: "Pursuant to the request of James Lyons, Esq., enclosed please find Patten McCarthy & Associates, Inc's report pursuant to our recent engagement."<BR>

     In a March 23, 1992 letter to the Clintons, Mr. Lyons notified the Clintons that his review of Whitewater had been completed.  He noted the findings of the summary report, including that the Clintons' had "invested approximately $70,000 in the corporation."316316.     Lyons Documents JML 077-78.  The Clinton campaign only released the final summary version of the Patten firm's report to the press,317317.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 112. and Mr. Patten testified that Mr. Lyons "is the only individual that received both versions of the report."318318.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. p. 68.<BR>

     On April 10, 1992, Mr. Lyons sent the Clintons the final complete version319319.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01105-14. of the Patten firm's report, which contained seven type-written pages and three pages of charts.320320.     Lyons Documents JML 140.  In his cover letter, Mr. Lyons states:<BR>

     Enclosed please find the complete report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates concerning Whitewater Development.  A summary of this report was previously sent to you and released to the press along with a cover letter from me on March 23, 1992.  I have deferred sending this complete report until now to avoid any confusion or possible inadvertent production.  The only copies of this report which exist (other than the enclosed original) are in my file and the confidential files of Les Patten.321321.     Lyons Documents JML 140.<BR></P>



<P>     He then explained that the summary report omitted several items:<BR></P>



<P>     Please note the enclosed report discusses such things as the $9,000 interest deduction taken by you in 1980, lot 13 and borrowings associated with it, and the sale of 24 lots in 1985 to Ozark Air for assumption of the mortgage and an airplane.  None of these items is set out in the summary report which was released to the press.  Similarly, the summary report released to the press did not contain Schedule 1, which details loans and advances by the McDougals and the Clintons from 1980- 1991.322322.     Lyons Documents JML 140.<BR></P>



<P>     Mr. Lyons concluded his letter by noting: "Accordingly, it is my recommendation to you that you maintain the complete report in strictest confidence and do not waive either the attorney/client or accountant/client privilege which attaches to the enclosed report."(emphasis added)323323.     Lyons Documents JML 140.<BR>

     Mr. Lindsey testified that the complete report was not released to the press as of late 1993.324324.     Lindsey, 6/12/95 Dep. pp. 79-80. According to his testimony, "it turned out later [after late 1993] at least one reporter, through other sources, probably Independent Counsel, who knows, reported on the longer version of the Lyons report, but at that time I don't think anyone had reported on it."325325.     Lindsey, 6/12/95 Dep. pp. 79-80.<BR>

     In March 1994, almost two years to the date after the Patten firm issued its report, it was discovered that the report had overstated the Clintons investment in Whitewater by $22,244.65.326326.     Lyons Documents JML 2584-85.  The $68,900 investment in Whitewater by the Clintons reported by the Patten firm included a check paid by Mr. Clinton to Madison Bank and Trust in 1982 on a loan used to purchase a house for his mother in Hot Springs, Arkansas.327327.     Lyons Documents JML 2584-85.  Thus, the Patten firm overstated the Clinton's Whitewater investment by more than 30 percent.<BR>

     Less than two weeks after this error was first acknowledged, Mr. Patten, in a November 4, 1993 memorandum to Mr. Lyons, explained the problems that his firm had encountered in its analysis.  Mr. Patten noted that his firm's work "did not and could not constitute an audit, review, compilation or the application of agreed upon procedures as those terms are understood within the accounting profession."  He further wrote that "source documentation was not available in many instances and we had to utilize the next best available documentation," and that "[t]he financial statements that we reconstructed took into consideration monies paid by the Clintons, the McDougals and others that had not been reflected in the accountant's workpapers or tax returns."328328.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP00014.<BR>

     C.     The Clintons Finally Get Out of Whitewater <BR>

     Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death was his handwritten note: "Get out of White Water."329329.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000481.    To that end, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hubbell and others in the Clinton organization met with Mr. Lyons on November 24, 1992, two weeks after Mr. Clinton was elected President.330330.     Hearings before the Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters, administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on the Inquiry into whether Improper Conduct Occurred Regarding the Way in which White House Officials Handled Documents in the Office of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., 104th Cong., 1st Sess., July 18, 1995 - August 10, 1995 [hereinafter "S. Hrg."], 8/8/95 p. 28; Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000482.    <BR>

     Mr. Blair called Mr. McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, and told him that "the Clintons and the McDougals needed to be totally separated over the Whitewater thing."331331.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 62.    According to Mr. Blair, he suggested that Mr. McDougal pay a nominal amount to buy the Clintons' interest in Whitewater:332332.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 67.    "I think we settled on a thousand dollars as an appropriate nominal amount."333333.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 67.    There was one problem: "McDougal doesn't have a thousand dollars."334334.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 69.    Mr. Blair then told Mr. Heuer, "[W]ell, what the heck, I will loan him the thousand dollars.  I'll just Fed Ex you a check to your trust account.  And I believe that's what I did."335335.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 70.    The loan was made without interest,336336.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 72.   and Mr. McDougal has never repaid Mr. Blair.337337.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 72.    <BR>

     On December 22, 1993, Mr. McDougal and the Clintons executed the transaction to get the Clintons out of Whitewater.338338.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 84.    Mr. Foster obtained the Clintons' signature for the documents executing the sale.339339.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 63.    It is unclear whether Mr. Foster, Mr. McDougal, or the Clintons knew that Mr. Blair gave Mr. McDougal the $1000 to buy the Whitewater shares from the Clintons.340340.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 73.  <BR>

     Mr. Blair then assigned Mr. Foster the task of contacting the accountants and preparing the Clintons' tax returns.341341.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 79.  The issue facing Mr. Foster in the months preceding his death was how to treat the $1000 sale on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  The basic dilemma stemmed from the Clintons' claim, bolstered by the publicly released Lyons report, that they had incurred significant losses on their investment in Whitewater.  The problem with declaring the loss on the Clintons's tax return was the lack of a proper basis with which to calculate the cost of the venture to the Clintons.  Despite their claim that they were 50% partners in the venture, the Clintons had contributed less than 25% of the funds used to cover Whitewater's losses.<BR>

     Also among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death were his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden.342342.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 237.  The notes, in Mr. Foster's hand, identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."343343.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000518.  His notes in the file outlined the basic tax issues the Clintons faced in connection with Whitewater:<BR>

     "1)     What was nature of deductions<BR>

          A.  How deduct interest/principal payments for corp.?<BR></P>



<P>     2)     Can you use contribution which predated incorporation?<BR></P>



<P>     3)     Contribution/advancements of $68,900 to the McD<BR></P>



<P>     4)     Inability to utilize $8000 capital loss"344344.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000514.<BR>

     Mr. Foster's objective was to avoid calling attention to Whitewater during the annual audit of the President and Mrs. Clinton's tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service audit.345345.     Jeff Gerth and Stephen Engleberg, "Documents Show Clintons Enjoyed Far Vaster Protection from Whitewater Losses," New York Times, July 15 1995, at A18.  One approach was simply to report a wash, that is, to show no loss and no gain from the venture, thereby obviating the need for any tax treatment.  The problem with such treatment, however, was that it would have bolstered the allegation that the Clintons were insulated from Whitewater losses and thus the company was a vehicle for Mr. McDougal to channel funds to the Clintons.<BR>

     In notes titled "Discussion Points," Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>

     1)     An argument that they were protected against loss:<BR>

          A)  wash is consistent with this theory346346.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000515.<BR></P>



<P>But Mr. Foster did not a have a proper cost basis with which to calculate the Clintons' true losses or gains.  His discussion points continued:<BR>

     2)     Improper to reduce basis by improper tax benefit<BR></P>



<P>     3)     Computation of economic loss was based, in part, on assumptions<BR>

          Whereas computation of tax gain or loss must be defensible in audit.347347.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000515.<BR>

     Therein lay the problem.  To claim a loss based on economic assumptions, as the Lyons report did, was one thing.1      1 Elsewhere in his notes, Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>

     A.     Colo analysis was of economic loss<BR>

          (1)  did not take into account interest deductions<BR>

          (2)  calculation included some items for which there were no canceled cks.<BR>

Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000517.  "Colo analysis" was an apparent reference to the Lyons report.  But to claim a loss on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns without proper support and documentation increased the likelihood of calling attention to Whitewater during the IRS audit--of opening the can of worms that Mr. Foster and the Clintons' accountant wished to keep sealed.348348.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000518.<BR>

     Mr. Foster's notes summarized the options as follows:<BR>

     "10     Options<BR>

          $1000 basis     so no tax effect<BR>

          but is arbitrary & still risks audit<BR>

                        vs<BR>

          0 basis w/ $1000 gain<BR>

          avoids any audit of issue"349349.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000519.<BR>

     In a letter to Mr. Foster days before the tax returns were due, Ms. Redden, the accountant the Clintons hired to handle Whitewater tax issues, wrote:  "Because of the numerous problems with Whitewater records and the commingling of funds with other companies and individuals, I believe many explanations may have to be made if we claim a loss."350350.     Sidley & Austin Document 0000185. This letter, addressed to Mr. Foster, was not among the documents in Mr. Foster's office that the White House produced to the Special Committee.  It was obtained by the Special Committee through another source.351351.     Sidley & Austin Document 0000185.  Ms. Redden testified that after the Clintons were in the White House she had a number of discussions with Mr. Foster concerning tax issues related to Whitewater.352352.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 228.  The main focus of these numerous communications was the tax basis for the Clintons' contributions to Whitewater and how to treat the $1000 payment.353353.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp. 230-231.<BR>

     The Clintons' final tax returns for 1992 reported a capital gain of $1000 from the sale of stock to Mr. McDougal.354354.     Jeff Gerth and Stephen Engleberg, "Documents Show Clintons Enjoyed Far Vaster Protection from Whitewater Losses," New York Times, July 15, 1995, at A18.  According to Ms. Redden, "I think we need to claim no gain or a loss."355355.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 234.  Mr. Foster did not follow her advice, however, because he was also consulting with another accountant, and "[a]t the end we compromised what we were going to put in the return in connection with Whitewater."356356.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 234.<BR>

IV.     The Clintons' Questionable Tax Treatment of Whitewater: A History of Unreportable Income and Improper Deductions<BR></P>



<P>     During the years that the Clintons owned an interest in Whitewater, the Clintons adopted an aggressive approach to the tax treatment of their investment.  This approach sometimes resulted in errors on their federal income tax returns.  From 1978 to the early 1990s, the Clintons invested a total of $42,192 in Whitewater.357357.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, pp. 130-31.  During this same period, the Clintons deducted $42,656 of their Whitewater related expenses on their federal income tax returns -- almost $500 more than their total investment in the corporation.<BR>

     The Special Committee's analysis of the Clintons' treatment of individual Whitewater-related items on their federal income tax returns reveals that the Clintons took a number of questionable tax positions relating to Whitewater.  From 1992 to the present, the Clintons have admitted taking improper deductions of $7,928 and omitting income of $8,171 on their federal income tax returns during the period of their Whitewater investment.  Therefore, the Clintons have admitted understating their income by $16,099 during this period.  Based on its analysis of the available evidence, the Special Committee concluded that the Clintons could have understated their income on Whitewater related items by an additional $33,771, for a total increase in taxable income of $49,870.<BR>

     The Clintons have explained that errors on their tax returns relating to Whitewater were due to mistakes made by their accountants.  The Clintons did not fully disclose, however, all of their financial information to their accountants,358358.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 3-4; Norton, 5/6/96 Dep. pp. 83-84.  did not discuss the details of important financial transactions with them,359359.     Norton, 5/6/96 Dep. pp. 92-93, 100-101. and sometimes simply ignored their accountant's advice.360360.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 8-9. <BR>

     Gaines Norton, the Clintons' personal accountant from 1978 to 1984, stated that the Clintons provided him with the information used to prepare their tax returns.361361.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 3-4.  According to Mr. Norton, a former IRS revenue agent and a certified public accountant, the Clintons did not provide him with underlying documents, but instead provided him with summaries,362362.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 3-4. such as handwritten lists on notepads.363363.     Norton, 5/6/96 Dep. pp. 20 and 83-84.   In one case, Mr. Norton raised specific tax concerns about the structure of Whitewater and Mr. Clinton told him "to back off and leave the issue alone."364364.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 8-9.  The errors and questions discussed in this section, therefore, cannot be dismissed as merely mistakes by the Clintons' personal accountants.       <BR>

     A.     1978: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,405 from 15-Acre Installment Sale<BR></P>



<P>     The Clintons may have unreported income of $5,405 from their 1978 installment sale of 15 acres of land originally purchased from Rolling Manor Inc., a company owned and controlled by Mr. McDougal.  On January 25, 1977, then-Attorney General Clinton purchased 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor Inc. for $11,400.365365.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01547.  The Clintons' 1978 federal income tax return reports that they sold 20 acres of land in 1978 in two separate transactions, a cash sale of five acres and an installment sale of 15 acres.  On May 17, 1978, the Clintons sold five acres on a cash basis for $5,000, resulting in a gain of $2,150, which was properly reported on Schedule D (Capital Gains or Losses) of their 1978 return.366366.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP0663.  On July 23, 1978, the Clintons sold 15 acres of unimproved land on the installment method for $14,985, resulting in a gain of $6,435.367367.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00672.  Since the Clintons elected to report this $6,435 gain on the installment method, only $886 of the gain was taxable in 1978 and was reported by the Clintons on their return.368368.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP00663, LP00672.  The $5,549 balance of the gain ($6,435 - $886) from this 15-acre land sale was to be reported in future years as the Clintons received the payments from the buyer.  <BR>

     $5,405 of the $5,549 deferred gain reported on the Clintons' 1978 return does not appear, however, in their subsequent federal income tax returns.  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on their 1979 tax return.369369.     RTC Document DKRT800001-20.  The Clintons did report $144 in capital gains from an installment sale on Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses) of their 1980 tax return.370370.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00682.  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on any of their tax returns after 1980.1      1      Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00690-95 (Clinton 1981 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00696-719 (Clinton 1982 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00720-739 (Clinton 1983 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00740-762 (Clinton 1984 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00763-786 (Clinton 1985 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00787-815 (Clinton 1986 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00816-860 (Clinton 1987 income tax return). Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00861-894 (Clinton 1988 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00895-942 (Clinton 1989 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00005495-5503 (Clinton 1990 amended income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00005520-5583 (Clinton 1990 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00005827-5904 (Clinton 1991 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00006319-6346 (Clinton 1992 income tax return).  How the Clintons collected a total of $2,066 in 1978 on the sale of this 15 acre tract of land, collected no funds in 1979, collected a total of $335 in 1980, of which $144 was reported as a gain on their 1980 tax return, and then collected no other funds from the buyer remains unexplained.<BR>

     If the Clintons collected the funds due from the buyer of the 15-acre parcel, they were required to report a portion of each payment as a gain on their tax returns, just as they reported a $144 gain on their 1980 return.1      1      Internal Revenue Code Section  453 allows, under certain conditions, taxpayers to pay gains on the sale of property on the installment method.   As described above, the Clintons reported no other gains on any of their subsequent returns.  Of course, if the Clintons did not receive payments from the buyer, they would not have been required to report gains on their income tax returns.  If the buyer of the property defaulted, however, the Clintons could have foreclosed on the property and then resold the property to another buyer, but there is no evidence on any of their subsequent tax returns that such action was taken by the Clintons.  In addition, if the buyer defaulted, the Clintons could have taken a $7,194 deduction for their remaining basis in the 15 acres, but there is no evidence of such a deduction on any of the Clintons subsequent tax returns.1      1      The gross profit percentage on this transaction was 42.9%.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00672 (Installment Gain on Sale Schedule - attachment to Clinton 1978 income tax return). Since the remaining gain was $5,405, the basis would be $7,194.  Moreover, if the property was foreclosed upon and not sold, then the Clintons would still own it, but this property is not shown on the Clintons 1991 Federal Election Disclosure form.371371.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00000518-531.<BR>

     B.     1979: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,400 <BR>

     The $2,400 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1979 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On December 7, 1979, Whitewater deposited in its account a check from the Clintons in the amount of $2,900.372372.     RTC Document DKRT900994.  On the books of Whitewater, this check was recorded as $500 for capital and $2,400 as "Loan - Bill Clinton".373373.     RTC Document DKRT800044-68.  According to its books, Whitewater's first interest payment in the amount of $4,352.63 was made to Citizen's Bank of Flippin on May 5.374374.     RTC Document DKRT800053.  On their 1979 federal income tax return, the Clintons claimed an interest deduction of $11,749 for payments to "Bank and Loan Companies."375375.     RTC Document DKRT800009.  This amount included the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater.376376.     RTC Document DKRT800001-20. <BR>

     Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"377377.     Internal Revenue Code Section  163(a). but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.1      1      Treas. Regs. Section 1.6001-1(a) states that taxpayers shall keep records which "are sufficient to establish the amount of gross income, deductions, credits..." on the taxpayer's return.  In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater was for interest on indebtedness.  Indeed, the only available evidence, the $2,900 deposit slip and the entries on Whitewater's books, indicates that the $2,400 payment was a loan to the corporation, which the corporation had an obligation to repay, and not an interest payment.  Moreover, Whitewater did not make its first interest payment to a bank until May 5, 1980, almost five months after the Clintons' payment of $2,400 was deposited, and there is no evidence that Whitewater's first interest payment of $4,352.63 included the Clintons $2,400.378378.     RTC Document DKRT8000533.<BR>

     An IRS audit of the Clintons' 1979 income tax return resulted in no changes.  However, there is no evidence that the revenue agent reviewed all of the relevant documents regarding this interest deduction.379379.     RTC Document DKRT11000804-808.  Absent proof that Whitewater's books and records were made available to the revenue agent by the Clintons, the result of the 1979 audit is inconclusive on this issue.  Indeed, it is possible that the revenue agent would have reviewed only a canceled check or bank records, determined that less than the full payment was deducted, and accepted this as sufficient evidence to verify the deduction.<BR>

     C.     1980: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $9,000<BR>

     The $9,000 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1980 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On August, 23, 1980, Mrs. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $9,000.380380.     RTC Document DKRT800533.  The Clintons' deducted this $9,000 payment on their 1980 federal income tax return as interest paid to "James McDougal."381381.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00673-89.  A third-party endorsement by Citizens Bank of Flippin, dated September 5, 1980, is on the reverse side of the Clintons' check.382382.     RTC Production DKRT800533. <BR>

     Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"383383.     RTC Document DKRT800533.  but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.  In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $9,000 payment was used to pay interest on indebtedness.  Nor is there evidence on the face of this check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.  The payee on the check was left blank, and there is no designation or notation on the check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.384384.     RTC Document DKRT800533.       In addition, the absence of a notation on the check that it was for interest is particularly probative, since Mrs. Clinton made such a notation on the other checks that she wrote to pay interest on the Whitewater debt.  Mrs. Clinton wrote at least four other personal checks to pay interest on Whitewater related debt -- three before and one after the $9,000 check, and, on each of these checks, Mrs. Clinton wrote a notation that the checks were for interest.1      1      Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00523 (check 697, dated December 28, 1978, issued to Great Southern Land Company, Inc. in the amount of $10,130.58 states "Reimbursement for six months interest"; check 396, dated December 29, 1979, issued to Citizens Bank & Trust in the amount of $4,752.88 states "Interest Payment"; check 395, dated December 29, 1979, issued to James B. McDougal in the amount of $237.50 states "Reimbursement of Interest pd.").  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 00528 (check 1623, dated December 30, 1986, issued to Security Bank in the amount of $1,635.51 states "Int on note 957585.").  Moreover, the Clintons' checkbook entry designates this check as a "land payment," not an interest payment.385385.     Letter from David Kendall to the Honorable James A. Leach, May 24, 1996, forwarding a report entitled "Review of Clinton Tax Adjustments Proposed by the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services," p.8 (hereinafter the "Kendall Report").  "Land payment" could refer either to a principal or interest payment.  Since Mrs. Clinton generally noted when a payment was for interest, however, her notation that this check was for a "land payment" would tend to confirm that this payment was for principal, not interest.   <BR>

     Analyses of the available bank records also indicate that the $9,000 check was used to pay principal, not interest.  A report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates, a Denver accounting firm hired by the 1992 Clinton Presidential Campaign, states:<BR>

     In our telephone conversation with her [Mrs. Clinton] and you [James Lyons] on March 18, 1992, she reaffirmed that she believed that it was an interest payment. Based on our reconstruction of the probable amortization of the mortgage loan at Citizens Bank & Trust, we believe the $9,000 went to reduce principal.386386.     Lyons Document JLM 088.<BR>

The report of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro is even more conclusive on this point.  It states:<BR>

     On August 23, 1980, the Clintons paid $9,000 to an unknown payee.  Through a reconstruction of the Citizens Bank mortgage, it has been determined that this payment was applied as principal to the outstanding balance of the Citizens Bank loan.387387.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, p. 31.<BR>

Thus, the available evidence indicates that the bank applied the $9,000 to reduce principal, not interest.<BR>

     According to the report prepared by the President and Mrs. Clinton's counsel, David Kendall, since the Clintons "owed interest to Citizens Bank of Flippin, WDC [Whitewater] or the McDougals, if they intended that their $9,000 check represents the interest, then Mr. and Mrs. Clinton accurately deducted the $9,000 payment as interest."388388.     Kendall Report, pp. 10-11.  However, there is no evidence of any unconditional and legally enforceable indebtedness between the Clintons and Whitewater or Mr. McDougal at the time of this payment.  While an indebtedness did exist between the Clintons and Citizens Bank, Mrs. Clinton's intent that a payment on the note was for interest is not sufficient to support an interest deduction under federal income tax law.<BR>

     Courts generally will give effect to an arrangement between a creditor and a debtor allocating payments on an indebtedness to principal and/or interest where that arrangement is bona fide and done at arm's length.389389.     Bayou Verret Land Co. v. Commissioner, 52 T.C. 971, 985-986 (1969), affd. on this issue 450 F.2d 850 (5th Cir. 1971).  However, a taxpayer cannot deduct prepaid interest, regardless of her intent.  <BR>

  There is no evidence of that such an arrangement existed between Mrs. Clinton and Citizen's Bank.  Nor is there evidence that Mrs. Clinton communicated to the bank or any other party that the payment was for interest.  Absent such an arrangement, payments by a debtor are first allocated to accrued but unpaid interest and then to principal.390390.     Bayou Verret Land Co. v. Commissioner, 52 T.C. 971, 985-986 (1969), affd. on this issue 450 F.2d 850 (5th Cir. 1971).  <BR></P>



<P>     The available evidence indicates that no accrued but unpaid interest was due on the Citizens Bank loan when the Clintons' $9,000 check was endorsed by Citizens Bank on September 5, 1980.  One month earlier, on August 5, 1980, the Citizens Bank note was extended and modified and, at the same time, the Clintons paid Citizens Bank the quarterly interest owing and due of $4,350, which they properly deducted on their 1978 return.391391.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, p. 31.  No principal payment had been made on the loan as of the date of its renewal.392392.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, p. 31.   Just 18 days later, Mrs. Clinton wrote the $9,000 check for "land payment."  The next quarterly interest payment on the note would not have been due until November 5, 1980, two months after Citizens Bank endorsed the Clintons' $9,000 check.<BR>

     D.     1980: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $10,000 from Whitewater payment of the $20,000 Union Bank Note<BR>

     Whitewater's 1980 payment of a 1978 $20,000 unsecured, personal note of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $10,000 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1980 federal income tax return.  On June 19, 1978, Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton obtained a $20,000 unsecured, personal loan (Loan # 0004197) from Union National Bank of Little Rock.393393.     RTC Document DKRT900145.  The proceeds of this loan were used to make the down payment on the 230 acres of land in Marion County, Arkansas that became Whitewater.394394.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report pp. 15-16.  On December 17, 1979, the Union National Bank note was renewed for 6 months, with a new maturity date of June 16, 1980.395395.     RTC Document DKRT900155.  As of the date of that renewal, the principal of the note remained $20,000.396396.     RTC Document DKRT900155.  On June 10, 1980, Mr. McDougal borrowed $20,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley in Cherry Valley, Arkansas,397397.     RTC Document BCV0004. and deposited those funds in Whitewater's account at the Union National Bank.398398.     RTC Document DKRT900968.  On June 23, 1980, Whitewater disbursed $21,346.29 to Union National Bank, using a corporate check with the notation "For Note # 0004197 Plus interest thru 6/23/80," to pay off the accrued interest and principal owed personally by Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton to Union National Bank.399399.     RTC Document DKRT901077.<BR>

     Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . income from discharge of indebtedness."400400.     Internal Revenue Code Section 61(a)(12).  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.401401.     Lash v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1956-87 ("amounts expended by Bristol for petitioner's benefit would constitute income to him. . . .").    Section 108(e)(4)(A) of the Code states that income is realized if debt is discharged or acquired by a related entity.402402.     Internal Revenue Code Section 108(e)(4)(A).<BR>

     The central issue is whether Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton were jointly and severally liable on the Union National Bank note.403403.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00106.  Whitewater's incorporation did not change this, since the Union National Bank note was not transferred to Whitewater.404404.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman LP00106.  Therefore, Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank eliminated Mr. Clinton's obligation to that bank.<BR>

     However, if Mr. Clinton was an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, from which Whitewater received the funds to pay Union National Bank, then Whitewater's debt would not have discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the debt simply would have shifted from Union National Bank to the Bank of Cherry Valley.405405.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01957-69. 1      1      There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1981 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-69.  On the other hand, if Mr. Clinton was not an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, then Whitewater's payment would have discharged debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the Union National Bank debt, on which Mr. Clinton was jointly and severally liable, would have been replaced by the Bank of Cherry Valley debt, on which Mr. Clinton was not liable.  In the latter case, Mr. Clinton would owe the IRS additional taxes on the $10,000 of discharged debt, his share of the Union Bank debt.<BR>

     Was Mr. Clinton an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note?  Mr. Clinton has stated that "any shift of this $20,000 loan from Union Bank did not affect its character as an acquisition loan, for which my wife and I considered ourselves equally responsible with the McDougals for repayment."406406.     W.Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 pp. 12-13.  However, testimony by the Bank of Cherry Valley's former President, Maurice Smith, indicates that the loan was made to Mr. McDougal individually, and most of the bank documents support his testimony.  Indeed, Mr. Smith testified that the bank "just loaned it to Jim McDougal" and that Mr. Clinton did not make payments on the loan.407407.     Smith, 4/23/96 Dep. p. 25.<BR>

     Most of the available loan documents indicate that Mr. McDougal was the sole obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note.408408.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN 021879 (Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 4/13/81); RTC Document (Not Numbered) Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/9/82, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 6/9/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/3/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal.        Mr. McDougal's name, and not Mr. Clinton's, is typed on each of the documents, and Mr. McDougal signed each of the documents.409409.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN 021879 (Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 4/13/81); RTC Production (Not Numbered) Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/9/82, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 6/9/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/3/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal.  Only one loan document appears to have Mr. Clinton's signature on it, and Mr. Clinton's name is not typed on that document.410410.     RTC Document DKRT100500.  Moreover, that document is dated more than two years after the note was originated.411411.     RTC Document DKRT100500.<BR>

     E.     1982: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,691 for Whitewater Payment of Citizens Bank of Jonesboro Note<BR>

     A 1982 payment by Whitewater of the principal and interest on a $5,000 note between the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $5,691.20 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1982 federal income tax return.  A May 21, 1981 personal financial statement of the Clintons lists a $5,000 note payable to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro as a liability under the heading "general debt."412412.     RTC Document CBF0280.  On February 17, 1981, Mr. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $243.82 to Citizens Bank, which had a notation "Interest on Note #585-270."413413.     Hogan & Hartson Document BL011114.  On February 22, 1982, Whitewater disbursed a check in the amount of $5,691.20 to Citizens Bank.414414.     RTC Document DKRT500067.  The notation on the check states "Note 585-270,"415415.     RTC Document DKRT500067. and the Whitewater checkbook entry designates this check as payment of "Note #585-270 - Bill Clinton."416416.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP02928.<BR>

     Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . [i]ncome from discharge of indebtedness."417417.     Internal Revenue Code Section  61(a)(12)  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.418418.     Lash v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1956-87 ("amounts expended by Bristol for petitioner's benefit would constitute income to him. . . .").    Whitewater paid Mr. Clinton's note at Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, but Mr. Clinton has stated that "[i]t is possible that it was a WDC-related loan."419419.     W. Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 pp. 23-24.  If Mr. Clinton invested the proceeds of this loan in Whitewater and Whitewater then repaid the loan, Mr. Clinton would have received no personal benefit from Whitewater's payment of the note, and, therefore, would not have been required to recognize income from discharge of indebtedness.<BR>

     The evidence is inconclusive on whether this Citizens Bank of Jonesboro loan was related to Whitewater.  A March 1, 1982 letter from Jim McDougal to Bill Clinton states:<BR>

     I have paid from the Whitewater Development Corporation the note you owed Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.  You are correct in your belief that the sum of money borrowed was part of your investment in Whitewater. 420420.     RTC Document DKRT400989.   <BR>

         </P> 

<P>Yet, there is no evidence on Whitewater's books that it received $5,000 from either the Clintons or Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.421421.     RTC Document DKRT800044-68; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01957-88.   1      1      There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1982 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-88.  Indeed, when Whitewater disbursed $5,691 to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, it recorded the full amount as "interest" paid, which indicates that the corporation had never recorded a liability that could be reduced upon payment of the note.422422.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01981-2.<BR>

     Although the evidence is inconclusive on whether these funds were invested in Whitewater, under federal income tax law the Clintons would bear the burden of proof that this payment did not result in any benefit to them personally.  It is unclear whether the March 1, 1982 McDougal letter would be considered sufficient proof that the Clintons invested the funds received from the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro in Whitewater.  If found insufficient, the Clintons would have unreported income of $5,691.20, excluding any interest and penalties.<BR>

     F.     1984: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $144 for Real Estate Taxes<BR>

     On their 1984 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $144 for real estate tax payments for which they were reimbursed by Whitewater.  On October 10, 1984, the Clintons paid $144 to Marion County for the payment of real estate taxes on Whitewater lot 13.  On November 4, 1984, Whitewater reimbursed the Clintons for this amount.423423.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP02018.  Since the Clintons were reimbursement for the taxes paid, this deduction was improper.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged this error and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.424424.     Kendall Report, p. 11.     <BR>

     G.     1984 and 1985: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deductions of $2,811 and $2,322<BR></P>



<P>	On their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns, the Clintons improperly deducted $5,133 for interest payments made paid by Whitewater, not the Clintons.425425.	Gerth and Labaton, "Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment," The New York Times, August 6, 1995, p. 20.  In 1984 and 1985, Whitewater made interest payments to the Security Bank of Paragould in the amounts of $2,811 and $2,322, respectively, that the corporation deducted on its corporate tax returns.426426.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00109.  The Clintons also claimed these same interest deductions on their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns.427427.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00109.  Since Whitewater made the interest payments to the bank, it, and not the Clintons, was entitled to those deductions.  On December 28, 1993, almost two years after the errors were first reported, the Clintons repaid the taxes owed due to these errors.428428.	Gerth and Labaton, "Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment," The New York Times, August 6, 1995, p. 20.  The Clintons did not explain the delay.429429.	Gerth and Labaton, "Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment," The New York Times, August 6, 1995, p. 20.  <BR>

	H.	1987: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,561<BR>

	On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $1,636 for interest which they also deducted on their 1986 federal income tax return.  On December 30, 1986, Mrs. Clinton wrote a check in the amount of $1,635.51 to Security Bank of Paragould.430430.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00528.  On their 1986 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $1,636 for interest paid to "Security Bank."431431.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00790.  In 1987, Security Bank of Paragould sent the Clintons a statement of interest paid on their loan during 1987, which listed interest paid of $2,561.33.432432.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL011121. On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $2,561 in interest paid to "Security Bank.433433.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00858.<BR>

	The $2,561 of interest deducted on the Clintons' 1987 tax return improperly included the $1,635.51 payment made by the Clintons in 1986 and deducted on their 1986 tax return.  The $925 balance of this amount ($2,561 - $1,636) was also improperly deducted by the Clintons on their 1987 tax return.  This interest was paid by Hillman Logan, the owner of Whitewater lot 13.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged these errors and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.434434.	Kendall Report, p. 11.	<BR>

	Documents show that the Mrs Clinton may have discussed this error with her personal accountant, Yoly Redden, and Loretta Lynch on March 23, 1992 -- almost four years before the Clintons acknowledged the error. Notes taken by Ms. Redden of a March 23, 1992 telephone conversation between herself, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch state:<BR>

	Clinton Campaign - Issue discussed with HC & Loretta Lynch<BR>

	1987	$2,651 deducted per return to Security Bank of Paragould. [found canceled check from Clintons dated 12/30/86 check # 1623 for 1635.51.]<BR>

	1986	1,636 paid [an arrow in Ms. Redden's notes points from this entry to the 1987 entry]435435.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00001008.<BR>

Ms. Redden testified that in this conversation she had discussed with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch whether or not certain deductions had been "double-counted" on the Clintons' 1986 and 1987 federal income tax returns and that this issue had been discussed even prior to this conversation.436436.	Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp. 184-187.<BR>

	I.	1988: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $1,275 for Real Estate Taxes<BR></P>



<P>	The $1,275 real estate tax deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1988 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On October 28, 1988, Mrs. Clinton reimbursed Ozark Realty $1,275.15 for real estate taxes due on several Whitewater lots.437437.	RTC Document DKRT101031-35 and DKRT101043-44.  On their 1988 federal income tax return the Clintons deducted $1,275 as real estate taxes.438438.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00866.  Generally, only the owner of real property is entitled to deduct real property taxes on the property, since those taxes are the liability of the owner under federal income tax law.439439.	See DeVere v. Commissioner, 35 T.C.M. 28 (1976); Anderson v. Commissioner, 33 T.C.M. 234 (1974), aff'd. per curiam, 527 F.2d 198 (9th Cir., 1975).  Since the Clintons did not own the property on which the taxes were assessed, they were not entitled to a deduction for the payment of those real estate taxes.  A taxpayer who owns a beneficial interest in property and who pays taxes thereon to protect that interest may deduct the taxes, even though legal title is in another.440440.	Cornelia C.F. Horsford v. Commissioner, 2 T.C. 826 (1943); Estate of Movius, 22 T.C. 391 (1954); Steinert v. Commissioner, 33 T.C. 447 (1959).   Beneficial interest is narrowly defined, however, and does not appear to the Clintons interest, if any, in the lots on which these real estate property taxes were assessed.  Therefore, the Clintons' $1,275 payment to Ozark Realty for real estate taxes may not be an allowable deduction.<BR>

	J.	1988: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $1,673 from the Sale of Lot 13<BR></P>



<P>	On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged that they under-reported the capital gain from the sale of a Whitewater lot owned by Mrs. Clinton by $1,673 on their 1988 federal income tax return.441441.	Kendall Report, pp. 12-13.  On that return, the Clintons reported a $1,640 long-term capital gain from the sale of lot 13.442442.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00861-94.  In computing the capital gain from this sale, the Clintons included in their basis calculation payments made by the previous owner of the lot.443443.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00861 - LP00894; Kendall Report, pp. 12-13.  As a result, the cost of the property was artificially inflated by $1,673, reducing the gain reported by the Clintons by this same amount on their 1988 tax return.

<P>Part II. GOVERNOR CLINTON'S QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAMES MCDOUGAL<BR></P>



<P>	While Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons share on the Whitewater loans, Governor Clinton, using the power of his political office, acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's other business ventures and accepted Mr. McDougal's recommendations regarding state action.  These favors took the form of granting Mr. McDougal influence in appointments to state positions445445.	RTC Document MG0000759; Williams & Connolly Document DKSN025966; Lyon, 12/14/95 Dep. p. 55., steering lucrative state leases to Madison Guaranty446446.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. pp. 18-19., and making decisions for Mr. McDougal concerning state regulators.447447.	RTC Document DKRT800606A.  This pattern of favoritism was important to Mr. McDougal, whose thrift was experiencing serious financial trouble. <BR>

	The motive for this favoritism is clear.  From the standpoint of Governor Clinton, if Madison Guaranty failed or Mr. McDougal experienced financial troubles, the Clintons could be liable for the full Whitewater debt.  Thus, Governor Clinton had a reason to act to ensure the viability of Mr. McDougal's savings & loan, even if such action was adverse to the interests of the state.<BR>

I.	James McDougal's Madison Guaranty: A Corrupt Savings & Loan<BR>

	In January 1982, James and Susan McDougal, along with several others, purchased 90% of the stock of the Woodruff County Savings & Loan Association for $246,500, which they renamed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty").448448.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.  To finance the purchase of Madison Guaranty, the McDougals borrowed $70,000 from Worthen Bank. Mr. McDougal inaccurately indicated on the change of control applications that he had obtained the money through "funds received from closely held corporations." 449449.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.   In June 1983, the McDougals borrowed another $142,186 from Worthen Bank to acquire stock belonging to other investors in Madison Guaranty in order to acquire exclusive control over the S&L.450450.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.  <BR>

	Mr. McDougal's true interest was always real estate investments, and his control of Madison Guaranty allowed him to pursue such investments.  On the other hand, Madison Bank & Trust, Mr. McDougal's other federal institution, was prohibited from such investments.451451.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.    In early 1982, Mr. McDougal incorporated Madison Financial Corporation as a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty for the sole purpose of real estate investment.452452.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 45.  <BR>

     From the beginning, Mr. McDougal viewed Madison Guaranty as a personal "candy store."453453.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.    Soon after its purchase Mr. McDougal began to borrow personally from Madison Guaranty to pay down other loans including financing Whitewater.454454.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report pp. 44-45.    <BR>

 	In 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") examined Madison Guaranty and concluded that "[t]he viability of the institution is jeopardized through the institution's current investment and lending practices in real estate development projects."  The FHLBB attempted to force Madison, through a cease and desist order and a supervisory agreement, to stop lending money to the McDougals or any McDougal-controlled entity, and require Madison Guaranty to raise additional capital.<BR>

	Shortly thereafter, Mr. McDougal hired Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm to represent Madison Guaranty and then-Governor Clinton appointed Beverly Bassett Schaffer to the position of Arkansas Securities Commissioner, based possibly on Mr. McDougal's recommendation.  Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer discussed -- and Ms. Schaffer approved -- a novel proposal for Madison Guaranty to raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock.  Ms. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm also represented Madison Guaranty in connection with land transactions and real estate investments, notably Castle Grande.<BR>

  	Beginning in March 1986, the FHLBB again examined Madison Guaranty.455455.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 9.    James Clark, the examiner-in-charge, testified that the examiner discovered "a group of insiders was obtaining cash in what amounted to a pyramid scheme" led by the principal insider, James McDougal.456456.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 9.  <BR>

	Mr. Clark testified that in his 20 years as a bank examiner, Madison Guaranty was on of the top five worst financial institutions that he examined in terms of self dealing by insiders.457457.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 15.    The 1986 examination report concluded that "management blatantly disregarded numerous regulations," "ignored" parts of the Supervisory Agreement.458458.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.  Moreover the report stated that Mr. McDougal's effective control of Madison Guaranty "enabled [him] to use corporate resources to develop large land developments [and] to divert substantial amounts of funds from the projects to himself and others."459459.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.  The examiners cited Campobello, Maple Creek, and Castle Grande as problematic projects.460460.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.    Although Madison Guaranty's financial statements indicated that the institution was in the black, the FHLBB report noted that improper accounting appeared to be the source of the profit, not successful investing. The report stated that, "[i]f profits [of the real estate projects] were booked properly, the Institution would be, in fact, insolvent."461461.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.  <BR>

	A.	Madison's Fraudulent Land Deals	<BR>

	Examiner Clark testified that Mr. McDougal "had total control of Madison Guaranty funds" and that Mr. McDougal could "dispense those funds at any time he wished, and he did so through the land development projects."462462.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 17.    The 1986 federal examination uncovered several instances where Madison Guaranty insiders engaged in "sham transactions" or acted as a "straw man," an arrangement whereby the "purchaser of the property would obtain legal title to a property without having any actual financial interest in the property simply as a means to hide true ownership of the property."463463.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 18.     The sham transactions were used as a means to place phony profit on the books in attempt to falsely inflate net worth.464464.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 19.  <BR>

      </P> 

<P>	For example, the 1986 examination found that the Castle Grande project was "purchased and sold in a series of fictitious transactions" to straw buyers.465465.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 21.    At the recently concluded McDougal-Tucker trial, Don Denton, chief lending officer of Madison, testified that Seth Ward was a "nominee" buyer in the purchase of part of the land.466466.	Denton, 3/18/96 McDougal Trial Testimony p. 1025.    These transactions were structured in this way to enable Madison Guaranty to violate the Arkansas state regulation prohibiting Madison Guaranty from investing more than 6% of its assets into Madison Financial Corporation.467467.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 146.  <BR>

	Bank examiners also found that Madison Guaranty insiders obtained financing for real estate projects that were fully funded by Madison Guaranty.468468.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 155.    In addition, insiders received real estate commissions that they did not earn.469469.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. pp. 155-56.     <BR>

	B.	Madison's Phony Books and Records  <BR>

	The 1984 examination of Madison Guaranty had concluded that the books and records were "inadequate."470470.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 92.    The books and records at Madison Guaranty were "poor, missing, and in some cases, intentionally misleading."471471.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 10.    The loan files did not sufficiently document the disbursements of the loan proceeds.472472.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 32.    	Mr. Denton testified that prior to the arrival of the examiners in March 1986, the staff of Madison Guaranty went through the loan files to find out what was missing, back dated documents, and had phony appraisals prepared.473473.	Denton, 3/18/96 McDougal Trial Testimony p. 1125.    Robert Palmer, a Madison appraiser, confirmed that he prepared several inflated appraisals for Madison Guaranty and backdated several appraisals.474474.	Palmer, 3/26/96 McDougal Trial Testimony pp. 2152, 2178, 2193.    Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that the appraisals were "wholly inadequate" and "the reports seemed to us to be essentially shams, some documents to put into the loan file."475475.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 142.  <BR>

	The 1986 FHLBB examination of Madison Guaranty lasted from March through September of 1986, as opposed to the three to four weeks that it would normally take for an S&L that size, because "Madison Guaranty's problems were so severe and its records were so poor."476476.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 14.    Moreover, Madison Guaranty's management actively obstructed the examination by retaining needed loan files or withholding information.477477.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 15.    <BR>

  	C.	Federal Regulators Oust Mr. McDougal from Madison <BR>

	On June 19, 1986, Walter Faulk, the FHLBB's Supervisory Agent responsible for Madison Guaranty, issued the preliminary report of the examination.478478.	O'Melveny & Meyers Document CCBW885-887.    This report was so devastating that the Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer believed it "effectively put Madison out of business."479479.	O'Melveny & Meyers, Document CCBW884    	<BR>

	Curiously, on July 2, 1986, Ms. Schaffer forwarded a letter which Mr. Faulk had sent to Madison Guaranty, to Samuel Bratton, then Counsel to Governor Clinton, with a personal note attached.  The note stated, "Madison Guaranty is in pretty serious trouble.  Because of Bill's relationship with McDougal we probably ought to talk about it."480480.	O'Melveny & Meyers Document CCBW884.    Mr. Bratton, who had already spoken with Governor Clinton several times about Madison Guaranty's financial difficulties, was well aware of the Governor's personal ties to Mr. McDougal.481481.	Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. pp. 6,9.     After Mr. Bratton received the note, he spoke with Ms. Schaffer about the possible closure of Madison Guaranty by the FHLBB,482482.	Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. p. 7.   and the upcoming FHLBB meeting in Dallas on July 24 where Madison's financial problems would be discussed.483483.483.	O'Melveny & Meyers Document CCBW885.    After Mr. Bratton received Ms. Schaffer's memorandum he contacted Governor Clinton, telling him of the FHLBB's plans.484484.	Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. p. 7.    Mr. Bratton also went to see Betsey Wright, the Governor's Chief of Staff, and they "together carried this to the Governor rather than my sending it in his normal mail."485485.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 229.    <BR>

	Although the exact date of Governor Clinton's receipt of the copy of the FHLBB's letter is unknown, he certainly received it before July 14, 1986.486486.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 230.    It is clear that Governor Clinton knew that Mr. McDougal -- his business partner, friend, and client of his wife's law firm -- was in serious financial trouble before it was ever made public.<BR>

	Results of an examination by the FHLBB are to be kept confidential, and "[t]he law requires that release of an exam report be restricted."487487.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 115.    Bank regulators should not share the results of exams with anyone outside of the regulatory agency.   James Clark, the FHLBB examiner, could not think of one reason why it would be appropriate for a state bank regulator to tip off the governor's office with regard to an ongoing bank examination.488488.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. pp. 116-17.    Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that, given Governor Clinton's business relationship with Mr. McDougal, the "tip off" from Ms. Schaffer certainly "had the appearance of a conflict."489489.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 120.   <BR>

	On July 11, 1986 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board met to discuss Madison.  Ms. Schaffer, her associate Charles Handley, nine persons from the FHLBB, and the Madison Board of Directors were all present.490490.	RTC Document 001395.     Mr. and Mrs. McDougal were not present.491491.	RTC Document 001395.    Mr. Clark expressed some concerns about Ms. Schaffer's presence at the FHLBB meeting because she had performed legal work for Madison Guaranty when she was in private practice, and he viewed that as a conflict with her oversight capacity as the Arkansas Securities Commissioner.492492.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 36.  <BR>

	During the meeting, Dawn Pulcer of the FHLBB mentioned that she thought Ms. Schaffer's conduct during the meeting was peculiar.  Ms. Pulcer's contemporaneous notes of the meeting reflect that during the course of discussion at the FHLBB meeting Ms. Schaffer appeared to be frowning, and asked only one question: "[w]ho is representing the McDougals?"493493.	RTC Document 1403, 7432.    Ms. Pulcer stated that she "[t]hought it was a little odd.  I, too, would have expected her to say something in support of the actions that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board supervisory authorities were taking."494494.	Pulcer, 1/30/96 Hrg. pp. 122-123.  <BR>

	At this meeting, FHLBB determined that Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham should be removed from Madison.  On July 14, 1986, just three days after this meeting, Ms. Wright wrote a telling message to Governor Clinton that reads:<BR>

		White Water stock<BR>

		(McDougal's company)<BR></P>



<P>		Do you still have? (pursuant<BR>

		to Jim's current problems<BR>

					</P>	

<P>		If so, I'm worried about<BR>

		it.495495.	Williams & Connolly Document DKSN013309. <BR></P>





<P>Governor Clinton responded by writing "No-Do not have any more---B."496496.	Williams & Connolly Document DKSN013309.    Ms. Wright claimed it was then well known that Mr. McDougal had been removed from the bank.  But the local newspaper did not report the event until July 25, 1996, eleven days later.497497.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 232.    <BR>

	Curiously, on the very same day that Ms. Wright inquired about Governor Clinton's relationship with Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton wrote a letter to Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham terminating the Rose Law Firm's retainer agreement with Madison Guaranty.498498.	Williams & Connolly Documents DKSN001168-9.    Along with the letter, Mrs. Clinton sent a check from the Rose Law Firm refunding Madison Guaranty's outstanding retainer balance.499499.	Williams & Connolly Documents DKSN001168-9.      <BR>

	Mrs. Clinton has given at least two different accounts regarding why she terminated the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.500500.	Associated Press, 4/22/94, "Text of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's News Conference in the State Dining Room of the White House."; H. Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC 2/4/94 pp.36-37; H. Clinton, 2/14/96 FDIC Interview pp. 91-96.    In a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the Rose Law Firm's relationship with Madison Guaranty was terminated because Madison Guaranty could not meet the requirements imposed by Ms. Schaffer for the issuance of preferred stock.501501.	Associated Press, 4/22/94, "Text of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's News Conference in the State Dining Room of the White House." p. 15.    However, in response to interrogatories on February 4, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the representation of Madison Guaranty was terminated due to "the increasing work the Rose Law Firm was doing for FSLIC ... the firm had decided in early July, 1986, generally to avoid taking on any new or expanded representations of S&L's."502502.	H. Clinton Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 pp.36-37.   In Mrs. Clinton's February 14, 1996 interview with the FDIC, Mrs. Clinton stated that the letter to Madison Guaranty was written in direct response to a memorandum written by Herb Rule, then the managing partner of the Rose Law Firm, to all attorneys.503503.	H. Clinton, 2/14/96 FDIC Interview p. 92.    <BR>

II.	Governor Clinton Provides Benefits to James McDougal and Madison S&L<BR></P>



<P>	During the time when Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty and carrying the Clintons on the Whitewater investment, Governor Clinton acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's various proposals before the state.  Indeed, substantial evidence supports Mr. McDougal's claims that he had "clout" with the Governor.504504.	Lyon, 12/14/95 Dep. pp. 28-29.     <BR>

	A.	Governor Clinton Steers Valuable State Leases to Madison<BR></P>



<P>	Governor Clinton exercised the power of his office to steer two lucrative lease contracts to Madison Guaranty.505505.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. pp. 18-19.    Helen Herr, the former Leasing Administrator for Arkansas State Building Services ("ASBS"), testified that she first learned in January or February 1984 that Madison Guaranty was interested in leasing space to Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") during a meeting in the office of Paul Mallard.506506.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. pp. 15-16.    Mr. Mallard, the Director of ASBS called Ms. Herr into his office to meet Susan McDougal. Mr. Mallard told Ms. Herr that the McDougals were developing a building on South Main Street in Little Rock, in Quapaw Quarter, and that they had additional office space that they wanted to rent.507507.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. pp. 16-17.    This office space was difficult to lease because it was located in an unsafe part of Little Rock and the real estate market in Little Rock was soft. Many commercial landlords were eager to fill their office space with long term tenants.508508.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 10.<BR>

	In fall 1983, AHDA developed a need for additional office space.  ASBS was considering office space on Brookwood Drive that the Director of AHDA, Wooten Epes, felt would be suitable.509509.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 12.   After meeting with Mrs. McDougal, Mr. Mallard instructed Ms. Herr to examine the Madison office space.510510.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 13.    <BR>

	When Mr. Epes, AHSA's Director, complained to Ms. Herr about the Madison space, she recommended that he state his complaints in writing.  On March 5, 1984, Mr. Epes wrote a letter to Ms. Herr rejecting the proposal that AHDA lease the office space from Madison.511511.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 16.    Mr. Epes was concerned that the Madison space was not sufficiently large and was not located in a safe part of Little Rock.512512.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 15.    When Ms. Herr brought Mr. Epes' letter to Mr. Mallard's attention, Mr. Mallard told her that the leasing contract was going to Madison Guaranty because the McDougals were "friends" of the Governor.513513.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. p. 34-35.    Ms. Herr specifically testified: "When I presented the objections from Mr. Epes about the Madison space, [Mallard] said that the governor's office wants us to lease that space ... and that the McDougals were friends" of Governor and Mrs. Clinton.514514.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. p. 34-35.    Mr. Mallard also told her that "they weren't going to consider other proposals" because the "governor's office wants us to lease this space and that's the way it's going to be."515515.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 19.    Mr. Epes took his concerns to the Governor.516516.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 24.    Mr. Epes testified that Governor Clinton refused to overrule Mr. Mallard's decision, and that was the Governor's final word.517517.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 24.  <BR>

	On April 1, 1984, the AHDA entered into a lease with Madison Guaranty.518518.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    The lease was for a 60-month term at $4,800 per month.519519.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    The contract realized nearly $300,000 in payments to Madison.520520.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)   <BR>

	In 1985 AHDA became the Arkansas Development Finance Authority ("ADFA").521521.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    ADFA subsequently sought to lease additional office space for their new employees.522522.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    As a result of this change, ADFA entered into another contract with Madison.523523.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    In August 1987, however, ADFA canceled its lease with Madison because it needed still more space, which was the concern that Mr. Epes had from the beginning.524524.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not Numbered.)  <BR>

	Moreover, the State of Arkansas, through ASBS, leased space in an additional building from Mr. McDougal, in Quapaw Quarter, to house the Arkansas Revenue Department.525525.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    Other than the three leases entered into with McDougal-owned entities, Ms. Herr could not recall any other leases the state entered for office space in the lease in Quapaw Quarter.526526.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)  <BR>

	Don Denton, a Madison loan officer, believed that the state leases were a political payback by Governor Clinton to the McDougals.  Mr. Denton testified that the connection "[s]tood out like a beacon at night."527527.	Denton, 5/7/96 Dep. p. 81.  	<BR>

	B.	McDougal Holds a Questionable 1985 Fundraiser for Clinton<BR>

</P> 

<P>	On April 4, 1985, James McDougal hosted a fundraiser for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty to raise money to pay off the Governor's outstanding personal debt from his 1984 gubernatorial campaign.528528.	Williams & Connolly Document DKSN001259; 4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 102.    In the closing days of that race, Governor Clinton had obtained an unsecured personal loan in the amount of $50,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley. 529529.	Smith, 4/23/96 Dep. p. 33, 35.    <BR>

	The exact amount of money raised at the event is not known.  The campaign finance report listing the contributions received at the fundraiser is missing from the Pulaski County Clerk's office and has never been located.  By all accounts, however, the fundraiser netted more than $30,000 to pay off Governor Clinton's personal debt.1      1 	Betsey Wright, who ran Governor Clinton's 1984 campaign, testified that $30,500 was raised at the event.  (Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 278.)  Ms. Wright, the custodian of records for that campaign, she based that figure on checks from 17 persons or entities that she said had been collected in connection with the fundraiser.  (O'Melveny & Myers Production CCBW-0017-24.)  Mr. McDougal has stated in various interviews that the fundraiser raised about $35,000.  (E.g. New York Times, 12/15/93 p. B8.)  Notes taken by Susan Thomases in 1992 of a conversation she had with Sherry Curry reflect that "MacD FR raised $39,150."  (Willkie Farr & Gallagher Production ST 45.)<BR>

	Four $3,000 checks were collected at the fundraiser.530530.	RTC Document B-1, C-1, D-3, D-5.    The names on the checks were James B. and Susan McDougal, J.W. Fulbright, Ken Peacock, and Dean Landrum.531531.	RTC Document B-1, C-1, D-3, D-5.    J.W. Fulbright is the late former Senator.  Ken Peacock is the son of former Madison director and borrower Charles Peacock.532532.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 169.    Dene Landrum, who is now deceased, was Mr Peacock's business associate.533533.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 169-170.     His first name was misspelled on the check as "Dean."534534.	RTC Document D-5.  <BR>

	All four checks were dated April 4, 1985.535535.	RTC Document B-1, C-1, D-3, D-5.    The James McDougal check was written on the McDougal's personal checking account at Madison Guaranty and was signed by Susan McDougal.536536.	O'Melveny & Myers Document CCBW-0017.    The Fulbright, Peacock, and Landrum checks were Madison Guaranty cashier's checks bearing numbers 2496, 2497, and 2498, respectively.537537.	RTC Document B-1, D-3, D-5.    <BR>

	There is strong evidence suggesting that the $3,000 check in Senator Fulbright's name was purchased by Mr. McDougal out of funds from his Flowerwood Farms account.  Senator Fulbright did not attend the fundraiser, although he was expected to.538538.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 280; W. Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 p. 40.   In 1994, Kent Goss, an RTC investigator, questioned Senator Fulbright's lawyer, a former aide to the Senator, about the $3,000 check.539539.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.   1      1 	Senator Fulbright himself could not be interviewed because he had a stroke several years ago and died in February 1995.  Mr. Goss wrote that although it was "evident" that Senator Fulbright was "a meticulous record-keeper," there was no record of any charitable donation in the amount of $3,000 between 1984 and 1991.540540.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.    Nor did Senator Fulbright's bank statements reflect a $3,000 debit during the relevant time.541541.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.    Senator Fulbright's lawyer added that he believed that the Senator had "no knowledge" of a $3,000 contribution to Governor Clinton.542542.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.   <BR>

	The Pillsbury Madison & Sutro Report on Madison Guaranty and Whitewater commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation attempted to trace the source of funds of the Fulbright check.543543.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report pp.108-110.     According to this report, on April 4, 1985, the same day that the Fulbright check was issued, a $3,000 check payable to Madison Guaranty was written on Flowerwood Farms' account at Madison Guaranty.544544.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report pp.108-110.     The Flowerwood Farms check was apparently deposited in the Madison cashier's check account, as it was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of that account.545545.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p.109.    A $3,000 deposit was posted in the account 7001312 on April 4, 1985.546546.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p.109.  <BR>

	Despite this evidence, the Pillsbury Report erroneously concluded that the link between the Flowerwood Farms check and the Fulbright check "has not been conclusively confirmed" because Madison Guaranty issued two other cashier's checks for $3,000 on April 4, 1985, i.e., those in the names of Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum.547547.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 109.     However, Charles Peacock, an attendee and donor at the fundraiser, has admitted to purchasing those two checks.548548.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 169-170.    The Pillsbury report recognized: "[I]f the Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum cashier's checks were funded by Charles Peacock III, the Flowerwood Farms check could have funded the remaining $3,000 cashier's check, the one from Fulbright."549549.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 109.  <BR>

	Mr. Peacock's testimony establishes, and the documentary evidence confirms, that he caused the checks to be issued.  Mr. Peacock admitted that he purchased the $3,000 checks in the names of his son and Dene Landrum.550550.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. pp. 22-23.    Mr. Peacock said he bought the check in his son's name because he thought it might help his son secure a job with Governor Clinton.551551.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. pp. 22-23.    He testified that he bought the check in Mr. Landrum's name because Mr. Landrum wanted to help the child of a friend receive a scholarship awarded by Governor Clinton.552552.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. p. 23.   <BR>

	The documentary evidence is consistent with Mr. Peacock's admission that he procured the checks.  On April 4, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a $6,000 counter check payable to Madison Guaranty, apparently on his account #15253.553553.	RTC Document D-2.    The check was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of the Madison cashier's checking account.  That same day, Mr. Peacock purchased a cashier's check for $4.554554.	RTC Document D-5.    Madison Guaranty charged a $2 fee for cashier's checks.555555.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 106.    When asked whether he bought this cashier's check to pay the $4 fee on the two $3,000 checks, Mr. Peacock said, "I'm sure that's what happened."556556.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. pp. 27-28.    It seems clear that since Mr. Peacock purchased two of the $3,000 cashiers checks, the third $3,000 check was purchased with proceeds from Flowerwood Farms.<BR>

	There is evidence that Mr. Peacock purchased the Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum checks with proceeds diverted from loans made by Madison Guaranty.  <BR>

	On the day of the fundraiser, April 4, 1985, Dixie Continental Leasing, a company owned by Mr. Peacock, purchased 29.77 acres of land on Woodson Lateral Road for $335,000.557557.	Peacock, 12/10/86 Borod & Huggins Interview p. 5.    Most of the sale was financed by Madison Guaranty with a $297,000 mortgage.558558.	RTC Document A-3, A-8; Peacock, 12/20/86 Borod & Huggins Interview p. 107; RTC Production A-6.  <BR>

  Mr. Peacock borrowed an additional $50,000 from Madison Guaranty in his own name to fund the down payment on the property.559559.	RTC Document E-1.      The loan was executed on April 5, 1985, but was funded on April 4, 1985, with a $50,000 Madison Guaranty check payable to Mr. Peacock.560560.	RTC Document E-1, D-1.    The loan was secured by commercial air conditioning equipment appraised at $273,000 but ultimately sold as scrap by Madison Guaranty for $1,500.561561.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 173.  <BR>

	On April 5, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a check for $38,940 to Quapaw Title Co. to pay the down payment on the Woodson Lateral Road property.562562.	RTC Document E-8.    The check was deposited in Madison Guaranty.563563.	RTC Document E-9.    There is no documentary evidence indicating what happened to the remaining $11,060.  Mr. Peacock does not remember how the remaining $11,060, a sum sufficient to fund the checks to Governor Clinton, was spent.564564.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. p. 43.    Moreover, he does not recall what funds he used to pay for the cashier's checks:  "I don't remember how I paid for them, whether I paid for them with a check or whether I paid for them out of funds or what I did."565565.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. p. 26.  <BR>

	The Pillsbury Report concludes that the source of funds for Mr. Ken Peacock's and Mr. Landrum's checks "cannot be established from the available documentation,"566566.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 107.     because Mr. Peacock's April 1985 Madison Guaranty bank statement is missing.567567.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 107.

<H1>The weekly journal of ideas and analysis</H1>





<P>

<I>The Economist</I> is a weekly news and opinion newspaper offering

reporting, commentary and analysis on world politics, global business,

finance and economics, science and technology and the arts.

<P>

Founded in 1843 to support the cause of free trade, the newspaper

has remained true to its mission ever since. Today, <I>The Economist</I>

is firmly established as one of the world's most influential and

authoritative publications.

<P>

The editorial staff of <I>The Economist</I> enjoy a unique independence from outside financial control: the constitution of The Economist Newspaper Ltd does not permit any individual or organisation to gain a majority shareholding. <I>The Economist</I> also differs from all other major news and opinion publications in the anonymity of its contributors. These factors guarantee <I>The Economist</I> a truly independent single voice.

<P>

With a circulation in excess of 600,000, <I>The Economist</I>

is read by opinion-formers in more than 180 countries around the

world.

<h1 align=center>Is Kohl in control?</h1>


<br>HELMUT KOHL has long made it clear what he hopes his place in history will be. Of course he wants to be remembered as the chancellor who united Germany--but even more than that, he wants to be recognised as the statesman who did most at the end of the 20th century to bring Europe closer together. If economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>) happens, and proves a success, that ambition will be fulfilled: the largest share of the credit will indeed be due to him. But there is another side to the euro. If <font size=-1>EMU</font> doesn't happen, or goes forward but proves a failure, that will just as surely be Chancellor Kohl's doing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The possibility that <font size=-1>EMU</font> might be postponed, or even abandoned, seemed more thinkable this week than for some time. For the moment, it remains only that, a possibility. Financial markets still predict that the single European currency will arrive on schedule. But the difficulties ahead are greater than the markets appear to think. What is clearer than before is the scale of the challenge confronting Mr Kohl himself, not so much in Europe as at home in Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany's latest unemployment figures, released last week, were startling. They showed a rise of 510,000 in the space of a single month, bringing the total to 4.7m, more than 12% of the workforce. True, these "unadjusted" figures need to be heavily qualified. Normal seasonal adjustment brings the monthly rise down to 160,000; Germany has had an unusually cold winter; other special factors, including a change in tax allowances, may also have helped to inflate the total. Nonetheless, the figure was worse than the gloomiest prediction and dreadful by any standard. The German economy is even weaker than had been supposed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has great implications for <font size=-1>EMU</font>. A crucial question throughout, posed now with added urgency, is this: how much longer can <font size=-1>EMU</font> float silently above the fray of German politics? The opposition blames unemployment on the government's austerity measures--but few as yet draw the obvious connection between those policies and the government's determination to meet the target for public borrowing in the Maastricht treaty. If unemployment climbs towards 5m, more politicians will surely begin to calculate that there are votes in attacking <font size=-1>EMU</font> in its own right. Recent polls show that the <font size=-1>SPD</font> has drawn level with Mr Kohl's <font size=-1>CDU</font>, and that the <font size=-1>SPD</font>'s most popular politician is Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, an <font size=-1>EMU</font>-doubter. If Mr Schr&ouml;der becomes the party's candidate for chancellor in the election of autumn 1998, he could conceivably make that vote a referendum on the single currency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, Germany's economic problems interact with the Maastricht plan in another way, only adding to Mr Kohl's difficulties. The treaty's target for public borrowing this year is 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Recently, but before the new unemployment figures were known, Germany's government increased its forecast for the deficit to 2.9% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>--a hair's breadth below the permitted ceiling. Again before the new unemployment figures, forecasters at the <font size=-1>OECD</font> said they expected Germany's deficit to be 3.4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> this year. On the government's own calculations, it seems, the target will now be difficult to reach; on everybody else's, more than just difficult.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This matters not because the deficit target reflects some pressing economic need. Judged in narrow economic terms, in fact, the deficit-ceiling is not merely unnecessary but positively dangerous. And it was already clear that if <font size=-1>EMU</font> were to go ahead, at least one of the Maastricht criteria (the one for public debt) would have to be all but ignored. Germany's fiscal embarrassment matters for another reason: it will affect the politics of <font size=-1>EMU</font>. Mr Kohl had presumably been counting on Germany's meeting the borrowing target. He could then have insisted that it be applied somewhat rigorously to others. That would have made it easier to keep Italy out, at least to begin with, making <font size=-1>EMU</font> more palatable to German opinion. Now it begins to look as though Mr Kohl may have to choose between waiving the deficit criterion, in which case Germans may ask whether <font size=-1>EMU</font> is such a good idea after all, or insisting upon a strict interpretation of the target, in which case the start of <font size=-1>EMU</font> would have to be put back.
<br></p><p><b><b>What Maastricht hath decreed</b>
</b><br>This last possibility is one that Europe's officials cannot yet bring themselves to contemplate (see <a href="eu6364.html">page</a>). They insist that the treaty has spoken, and that is that. In fact, the treaty seems to say that if Germany's borrowing exceeds 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> next year, <font size=-1>EMU</font> should go ahead without Germany. (No provision allows Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, all well-placed to qualify, to hang on until Germany and France are ready.) But this too, of course, is unthinkable. So Europe's <font size=-1>EMU</font> planners remain frozen in their accustomed state of intellectual paralysis: bound to do something they may well be unable to do, forbidden therefore to start asking what might be done instead. A postponement would be risky in several ways, but it would at least give Europe's policymakers an opportunity to review and improve their present flawed design.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dilemma that may soon face Chancellor Kohl is of his own devising. Whenever he has confronted a great issue, he has done the same: establish a point of no return, march past it, never mind about popularity and let the details take care of themselves. This was how he dealt with Germany's relationship with the West when he first came to power. Then he applied the method to German unification. Now he is trying to do the same with <font size=-1>EMU</font>. The drawbacks of pressing on regardless have become all too clear in eastern Germany: the "detail" of converting Ostmarks at the wrong rate has cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. With a certain justice, the economic implications of that mistake have now come to haunt the chancellor as he surges on with his third and greatest task, and may in the end be instrumental in defeating him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once more, says Mr Kohl, concentrate on the vision, and see to the details later. As their economy reels, Germany's voters may yet decide that <font size=-1>EMU</font> is one vision too many.

<h2>Crumbling
</h2>Three people died in <b>Albanian</b> <b>disturbances </b>sparked by the collapse of pyramid schemes, which have ruined many thousands. 
<p>Bulgaria's president, Petar Stoyanov, set parliamentary elections for April 19th and appointed a <b>caretaker cabinet</b>, led by Sofia's mayor, Stefan Sofianski, to govern until then.
<p>Serbia's parliament passed a law <b>restoring opposition victories</b> in 14 municipal elections held last November. But opposition leaders said protests would continue until the government introduced more democracy.
<p>One Muslim died and 22 were hurt in fighting between Muslims and Croats in <b>Mostar</b>, a Bosnian town split between the two groups. 
<p>President Boris Yeltsin's national security adviser, Ivan Rybkin, said Russia should be ready to use <b>nuclear weapons</b> against even a non-nuclear attack.
<p><b>Boris Berezovsky</b>, a businessman who is deputy head of Russia's security council, sued <i>Forbes</i>, an American magazine, for suggesting he had links with Russia's mafia.
<p>Mr Yeltsin's former bodyguard, <b>Alexander Korzhakov</b>, won a parliamentary by-election at Tula, south of Moscow. He said he had "a great deal of compromising material" on public figures.
<p>A new president, Aslan Maskhadov, took office in <b>Chechnya</b>, amid growing confusion in Russia about how to deal with the republic's claim to independence.
<p><font size=-1>ETA</font>, a <b>Basque </b>separatist movement, was blamed for killing a judge in Madrid, an air-force employee in Granada and a businessman in the Basque country.
<p>The loyalists' ceasefire in <b>Northern Ireland </b>was further strained after a British soldier was shot dead, apparently by the <font size=-1>IRA</font>.
<p>Catherine M&eacute;gret, candidate for France's xenophobic <b>National Front</b>, won the mayoral election in Vitrolles, a town in the south.
<p><h2>Zaire still mired
</h2><b>Rebels</b> <b>in eastern Zaire </b>advanced westwards towards the key city of Kisangani. President Mobutu returned home from treatment for cancer, and the opposition brought the capital, Kinshasa, to a halt with a general strike.
<p><b>Ethiopia</b>, once a by-word for hunger, has increased its food security reserve ninefold in the past four years. In a famine, the country could feed 4m for six months.
<p>Following redeployment in Hebron, Israel released 31 <b>Palestinian women prisoners</b>, as agreed, then long delayed, in an earlier deal. Some 3,000 male prisoners are still held. 
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Iran's 15th Khordad Foundation, a semi-official body, raised its bounty on <b>Salman Rushdie's</b> <b>head </b>from $2m to $2.5m. 
<p><h2>A form of justice
</h2>O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25m in <b>punitive damages </b>to the relatives of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, on top of the $8.5m in compensatory damages already assessed. Mr Simpson, hinting at an appeal, said the case was "far from over". 
<p>In New York, a jury convicted two black men of violating the civil rights of a <b>Hasidic Jew </b>who was stabbed to death in race riots in 1991. One of the men had been previously tried for the murder and acquitted.
<p>In a show of bipartisan unity at the Capitol, President Clinton and congressional leaders agreed to try to <b>balance the budget </b>by 2002.
<p>In <b>Ecuador</b>, last week's widely supported strike against price rises led to a coup: Congress--dominated by opposition parties--voted out (unconstitutionally) the country's eccentric but elected president, Abdala Bucaram. Then, with muted army backing, it allowed his vice-president two days in the hot seat before voting in (unconstitutionally) its own chairman, Fabian Alarcon. He has 12 full months to call a fresh presidential election.
<p>Might <b>Colombia </b>follow suit? Public-sector unions there launched an indefinite strike over pay. Left-wing guerrillas cheered, called for violence and threatened it themselves. Unions called for public demonstrations on Thursday. But few saw President Ernesto Samper going the Ecuadorean way.
<p><h2>Asian tension
</h2><b>Rioting </b>broke out in Xinjiang, China's north-western province, after 30
<p>Uighurs, an Islamic people, were reported to have been executed.
<p>Hundreds of <b>Indonesians </b>in western Kalimantan were reported to have been killed in clashes between Muslims and Dayaks, a mainly Christian ethnic group.
<p>Talks in Singapore between officials of the European Union and the Association of South-East Asian Nations produced differing views over <b>human rights </b>in Myanmar and East Timor. The two groups postponed a final communiqu&eacute;.
<p>In Beijing, Hwang Jang Yop, a senior aide to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, <b>defected to South Korea</b>, arousing speculation that the North's regime is cracking.
<p>A South Korean cabinet minister, <b>Kim Woo Suk</b>, resigned after claims that he took bribes to secure loans for Hanbo, a failed steel company. The police later arrested Mr Kim and two other close political allies of President Kim Young Sam.

<h2>A fast buck
</h2>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The ascent of the <b>dollar</b> paused after finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven rich countries, meeting in Berlin, declared that its two-year recovery and recent sharper climb had gone far enough. But the impact of their words, backed by no action, was short-lived: by February 12th the dollar had reached a 34-month high against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark. Sterling also rose against the German currency, reaching a four-year high. 
<p>The <b>Dow Jones</b> industrial average hit a record high. In Tokyo even the Nikkei perked up. Meanwhile Japanese investors have been flocking abroad. In 1996 they bought a vast quantity of foreign bonds, and some shares, spending in the process a net &#165;9.33 trillion ($75 billion), the most in five years and 20% more than in 1995.
<p>Can the American economy do no wrong? In the United States <b>business productivity</b>jumped in the fourth quarter by 2.2% at an annual rate after a flat third quarter, the biggest improvement in four years (though for the year it was a sluggish 0.8%). Business failures were stable for a third year. The rise in unit labour costs slowed to 1.4%, and despite more jobs the unemployment rate ticked up in January from 5.3% to 5.4%, nearing the 5.5% minimum considered necessary to keep inflation at bay.
<p><h2>Changing course
</h2><b>Big tobacco </b>is looking more favourably on the notion of a cash settlement with its legal tormentors. The chief executive of <font size=-1>B.A.T</font> said in a television interview that the British tobacco company might consider a settlement in return for "a peaceful life". But it is not peace yet. In North Carolina this week American tobacco firms challenged the right of the Food and Drug Administration to clamp strict new limits on the sale of cigarettes to young people.
<p><b>Pearson</b>, a British media group and part-owner of <i>The Economist</i>,<i> </i>said improper accounting at an American publishing subsidiary may knock &#163;100m ($163m) off 1996 profits. 
<p>Anglo-Dutch <b>Unilever</b> announced record earnings. But it has also put its profitable specialty chemicals businesses up for sale, a divestment that could yield &#163;5 billion ($8 billion), to concentrate on its core consumer products and food operations. Unilever's pre-tax profits rose 15% to &#163;2.66 billion last year. 
<p>In America <b>ITT</b> appeared to be mobilising to fight off last month's $6.5 billion takeover bid by Hilton Hotels. <font size=-1>ITT</font> rejected Hilton's offer and said it might sell some inessential assets to raise the value of the company and sharpen its focus on gaming and lodging. One item in the <font size=-1>ITT</font> portfolio that may be for sale is New York's Madison Square Garden entertainment complex.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>Westinghouse Electric</b> came close to completing its long-term plan to shed its industrial past and turn itself into a leading entertainment and media group in America, with the purchase of two country-music cable channels for $1.55 billion. The purchase gives Westinghouse's <font size=-1>CBS</font> television network a belated move into cable and also close links to Gaylord, which owns the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.
<p>Only in France, perhaps, could a privatisation get so muddled. Lagard&egrave;re, the winner in last year's contest to take over <b>Thomson-CSF</b>, a state-owned defence-electronics firm, has complained to the Council of State about the way its bid was handled. Its victory was snatched away after a public outcry at its plans to sell Thomson's multimedia arm to a South Korean firm.
<p><b>Western Resources</b> won its hostile $2 billion bid for rival Kansas City Power & Light to create a power utility with 2m customers and $3 billion in revenues. But Western's hostile $3.5 billion offer for <font size=-1>ADT</font> is going less well. The home-security company filed a lawsuit attacking its bank, Chase Manhattan, for supporting the bid.
<p><b>Jan Timmer</b>, who brought Philips back from the brink of bankruptcy, quit the supervisory board to which he was appointed only a few months ago after Cor Boonstra took over the job of president. Philips reported a loss of 591m guilders ($312m) in 1996, after three years of profits. 
<p>The European Commission has begun an investigation into sales practices used by <b>Michelin</b> after allegations that the French tyre group is using its dominant position in France and other European countries to tie dealers to its products.<WWHead><p><b>Jammed Airways</b></p>
<p><b>British Airways</b> marked its ten years as a private company with a record third-quarter pre-tax profits of &#163;113m ($185m), up 8.7% over the 1995 period. It also celebrated with &#163;10 Concorde tickets. 
<p>Nine airlines, headed by United Airlines and Lufthansa, are forming a global alliance to counter the proposed pact between <b>British Airways</b> and <b>American Airlines</b>.

<h1>The costs of learning</h1>

BILL CLINTON'S state-of-the-union promise of an extra $50 billion for education would be worthwhile if, as he urged, Americans end up with "the best education in the world". But, according to a recent essay in a book on the subject by Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester*, there is little evidence that spending more money makes for better students (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hanushek considers two ways of measuring the connections between educational spending and student performance. First, he simply looks at broad trends in both areas. Real spending per student has almost doubled since 1970; total spending is now equal to about 4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. But scores on two important standardised tests--the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a college entrance exam, and the broader-based National Assessment of Educational Progress--have either stagnated or declined over the same period, although blacks and Latinos have improved noticeably in maths and reading.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next Mr Hanushek surveys research studies on cross-sections of students, teachers and educational achievement. On the ratio of students to teachers, for example, only 15% of the studies report a statistically significant positive result--that fewer students per teacher led to higher achievement. Almost as many report a negative result and the rest are inconclusive. On spending per pupil, the result is equally muddled: 27% report a positive result, 7% a negative one, while the rest are agnostic. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, money is necessary for education. Schools need textbooks and teachers. But the reason that adding money does not automatically add value is that costly new textbooks could be worse than old ones; that computers in every classroom (another Clinton ideal) may not instil basic skills; and that playing with untried educational philosophies may prove expensive in terms of both price and standards. If the volume of cash were the primary determinant of achievement, then the school system in Newark, New Jersey, which spends the most per pupil of any district in the country ($9,501), would be turning out accomplished scholars; instead, it is so awful that the state government has taken it over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some schools do get results when they get more money; and many parochial and private schools get better results on smaller budgets than their public counterparts. But the lesson is to spend money well, not prodigally.

LEXINGTON
<h1>Dan Coats, senator for charity</h1>

IN A time of soundbites and vanity, of cynical venality, it makes a change to meet Dan Coats. Rather than talk in slogans, this senator speaks like the insurance lawyer he once was. Rather than grab the spotlight, he has contrived to hide in the shadows of two other Indiana Republicans, Dan Quayle and Richard Lugar: quite an achievement, really, when you consider how small those shadows are. Far from being venal, Mr Coats recently announced that, rather than beg for money for his re-election campaign, he would give up his Senate seat in 1998. And, far from being cynical, Mr Coats devotes his energy to a Utopian idea: that charities and volunteer enthusiasm can break the back of poverty. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of a sudden, this has made him a hot figure. Back in 1995, when Mr Coats suggested using tax credits to reimburse people who give to anti-poverty charities, almost nobody took notice. In early 1996, only one serious candidate (Lamar Alexander) echoed Mr Coats's views. Towards the end of the campaign, Bob Dole did embrace a modest charity break. But right up until election day, as one Coats staffer says, "We were pretty lonely."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No longer. In January Mr Coats announced a grand "Renewal Alliance", featuring 21 congressmen who aim to shift the fight against poverty away from government and towards churches and voluntary organisations. Outside Congress, three prominent Republicans (Mr Alexander, Mr Quayle and William Bennett) have launched their separate schemes to privatise compassion too. Not to be outdone, Bill Clinton is planning a summit on volunteerism for the spring. It will feature three ex-presidents (George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter) and one near-president (Colin Powell, who will be in charge), as well as one currently in office. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, this charity-fest seems odd. Politicians run governments; but charities are proud of their status as non-governmental organisations. Politicians have the power to demand taxes and make laws; the whole point of volunteerism is that it is voluntary. Politicians need to get elected, and for this they need cash; so most of their policies are designed to help the middle class and moneyed lobbies, not charities. And yet, despite these awkward facts, Mr Coats's unaccustomed prominence could have been predicted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After Ronald Reagan's crusade against the state, George Bush tried to round out the Republican message by promoting volunteerism. Now, after Newt Gingrich's anti-government drive, Republicans want to sound cuddly and positive, not negative and mean; helping charities take over the job left by government's retreat is the perfect way to do this. The Coats idea allows Republicans to be for small government and big-heartedness at the same time. Rather than send taxes to Washington's bureaucracy, send your money to a friendly charity, they cry; close the sluggish Department of Housing and Urban Development, but let the home-building volunteers of Habitat for Humanity multiply. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This makes for winning rhetoric. And, up to a point, it makes for winning policy. In recent years, social scientists have stressed that government should think about the moral consequences of what it does, not just the material ones. The needy do not merely require shelter and food; if they are to fend for themselves, they must be encouraged to acquire a taste for work and discipline. The trouble is that, though this may be true, government cannot foist its morals on the poor without compromising liberty. This is where charities come in. Unlike government, they are powerless to compel involvement; because of this, they can insist on moral standards from those they help without infringing freedom. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a marvellous thing. By championing charities, Americans may resolve the dilemma at the heart of modern liberalism: how to reconcile liberty with authority, social tolerance with social discipline. According to the conventional wisdom, this dilemma threatens to divide the Republican Party into warring camps. Yet moralism and freedom come together in Mr Coats's emphasis on charities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So much for theory. The question is whether charities are really better at tackling poverty than government. They have the freedom to impose morality, which is good. But they lack economies of scale. Many charities spend a quarter of their budgets on fund-raising and other administrative costs. The Department of Health and Human Services, by contrast, claims that such costs account for less than 5% of its anti-poverty spending. Mr Coats retorts that charities can draw on the unpaid zeal of volunteers. If a charity's "budget" included not merely financial contributions but free labour and gifts in kind, the chunk taken by fund-raising might suddenly look puny. "Just visit the Gospel Mission, five blocks from here," the senator declares. "See for yourself if charities are inefficient!"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And so, on a cold Washington night, Lexington walked into a run-down hall, filled with former crack addicts in various stages of rehabilitation. The boss is a doctor who has turned to charitable work out of Christian zeal; the doctor's wife has put her heart into redecorating the drab rooms; upstairs volunteers teach computer skills; a toothless man, dragged off the street in a drunken coma just a year ago, repays the institution that dried him out by cooking everybody supper. On a budget of just $1m a year, the mission treats and houses 120 addicts at a time, and offers free classes to 500 others. Touring this mission, it is impossible not to hope that tax credits would help its work. After 30 years of government-led efforts to eradicate poverty, it is time to try something different.

<h1>China's rebellious west</h1>

<p><b>China and Indonesia, the two most populous countries in East Asia, are both struggling to contain outbreaks of ethnic conflict. We report first on the problems in China's Xinjiang province </b></p>
<br>THOSE who speculate that China might one day split up like the old Soviet Union are often reminded that China is much more ethnically homogenous than the old Soviet empire. Well over 90% of China's population are Han Chinese--"sons of the Yellow Emperor". But although the population is overwhelmingly Han, big chunks of its territory are largely inhabited by peoples that chafe at the rule of the Hans. So news trickling out of unrest in Xinjiang province raises the perennial question of the strength of China's grip on its harsh and sparsely populated far west. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Historically, control of the far west has ebbed and flowed according to the vigour of the regime in Beijing. A century ago, a weak China was just one of many other influences--Turkic, Muslim, Russian, Indian, British--in the oasis towns of Xinjiang and high plateaus of Tibet. In 1913 China was powerless to prevent Tibet establishing an autonomy that lasted until 1951, when the Chinese army marched in. Mongolia declared independence from China in 1924, under Soviet tutelage. In 1944, in Xinjiang, a short-lived Eastern Turkestan Republic was proclaimed. Later, tens of thousands of Kazakhs fled Xinjiang for the Soviet Union after a revolt was crushed in 1962, but there has rarely been a year since without reports of minor unrest of some kind.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest reports from Xinjiang suggest violence on an increasing scale. Several thousand Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group who outnumber Han Chinese by two to one in the province, are said to have been involved in a riot. The fracas took place in Yining, a town close to the border with Kazakhstan (see <a href="as1.gif">map</a>), and ten people--both Uighurs and Han Chinese--are said to have been killed. Local officials have said that the rioters were "pro-independence Muslims". There are around 20m Muslims in China and 8m of them are Uighurs, who have been particularly resistant to assimilation. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nationalists exiled in Kazakhstan say that this month's riots were sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs--a story the Chinese have denied. A curfew has been imposed in Yining, and the airport has been closed. Meanwhile, 1,000 protesters are reckoned to have been arrested. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Restiveness in Xinjiang has clearly been on the rise over the past year or two, and so has official shrillness about it. Last year a Muslim cleric high in the Xinjiang Communist hierarchy was assassinated; the presumed killers were later killed in a gun battle with government forces. The authorities have said they have "dealt with"--presumably, executed--"terrorists" who have killed lowly government officials on half-a-dozen occasions. In all, the official press reports, several thousand "terrorists, murderers and other criminals" have been netted. The main separatist group based in Kazakhstan puts the figure at 57,000 arrests last year, and also claims that over 100 Koranic schools were closed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese government has certainly launched a fierce rhetorical campaign against what it sees as the "grim threat" of Muslim separatism. Predictably, the propaganda machine says the unrest is being masterminded by "imperialists who aim to split and westernise our nation." Actually, if there is an outside source of guns and influence in Xinjiang, it is likely to be Afghanistan's Taliban militia--not noted for their fondness for the West. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese authorities have now tightened control over campuses, cracked down on religious teaching and reinforced security at the borders. Teachers have been exhorted to show "patriotic feelings and uphold atheism". Government officials are to be on the look-out for the many books being read in Xinjiang that are of "low taste, or even works of a gloomy nature." But as is so often the case in China, many of the problems in Xinjiang seem to lie within the Communist Party itself. The local paper has even spoken of party officials being involved in "explosions and assassinations of a political colouring." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese government emphasises that it deems only a small number of Uighurs unpatriotic. Indeed China has an avowed policy of positive discrimination towards its 50-odd minorities and appears quick to tackle insensitivities displayed towards Uighurs. It banned a popular book last year called "Weird Sex Customs", which gives a rather imaginative description of Islamic sexual life. In an unprecedented case, the government investigated and publicised the sexual harassment of a female Uighur soldier by a Han general.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China's traditional method of assimilating its outlying territories has been to encourage Han Chinese to emigrate from the densely populated heartland, swamping the minorities. In Inner Mongolia Hans now outnumber Mongolians sixfold. And although Beijing hands out graphs to foreign journalists purporting to show how few Han live in Tibet, they have in fact been pouring into Tibet's larger towns during the past few years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Xinjiang locals resent Han immigrants, who are said to get the best jobs on the construction sites and in the oil fields that are being developed. They resent the fact that few Chinese bother to learn Uighur. They resent the suppression of anything other than state-blessed worship. They are outraged at the forced sterilisation of women. And they consider that China's nuclear-weapons test site at Lop Nor threatens their health. (China recently announced an end to tests.) This string of grievances plays a part in what the authorities perceive as a "separatist" movement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But China's neighbouring Muslim states are also not keen to see fundamentalism fanned in western China, for fear of the regional instability that it might foster. Last year Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and Tajikistan signed border agreements with China. Beijing has also pressured Central Asian governments to withold support from exiled groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can Beijing maintain control? The numbers of troops in Tibet give the place the air of an easily occupied country. And Xinjiang's garrison also is kept strong, for three reasons: the troops serve as a tool for domestic control, as a border force, and as a guard for what some claim are two-fifths of China's potential oil reserves. Inner Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang all have powerful public-security forces as well as the army, so China does not lack for brute force. The authorities may have to resign themselves to a diet of surly resentment, hit-and-run violence and sabotage, but they could probably put down a popular uprising with ease. It might need a crisis in Beijing to provoke one in Xinjiang; it was only during a period of turmoil and civil war in China, from 1944 to 1949, that the Uighurs last gained independence.

<h1>Ecuador's post-modern coup</h1>

<font size=1>QUITO
</font><p>THE people of Latin America will put up with austerity, but not when it is meted out by populists who also seem arrogantly and ostentatiously corrupt. That combination caused the downfall of Brazil's Fernando Collor in 1992, and of Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez a year later. Now it has undone a third elected president, Ecuador's Abdala Bucaram.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only six months into office, and within weeks of launching a harsh economic stabilisation plan, he was suddenly bundled out. With the country paralysed by a general strike, massively backed by business as well as labour, on February 6th Congress voted, by 44 votes to 34, to sack Mr Bucaram for "mental incapacity". It used to be generals who ousted Latin American presidents. This time, the army, after a brief show of support round the presidential palace, decided not to use force to sustain Mr Bucaram, and he was doomed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strongest claimant to his job was Rosalia Arteaga, his vice-president, who at the army's urging had briefly taken over. But after hectic backroom negotiations, Congress repeated (by 57 votes out of 82) an earlier decision to appoint its own speaker, Fabian Alarcon. A smooth Quito lawyer and professional politician of the elastic centre, he is required to hold a presidential election within 12 months, though he will stay in office till August 1998. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In all this, the army showed more respect for the constitution than did Congress, listening harder to public opinion and the ambitions of its members. It could have impeached Mr Bucaram, but that would have taken time and a two-thirds majority, which his enemies initially lacked. A speedy simple-majority vote to sack him for "mental incapacity" was easier. Mr Bucaram may have rejoiced to be known as <i>El Loco</i>, the madman; but he was sane enough in pointing out that "Congress is not a psychiatrist". And in brushing aside Ms Arteaga, Congress at best--and she, another lawyer, denied even that--was exploiting a drafting error in the constitution, which specifies that the vice-president takes over if a president is temporarily unable to act, but does not say who should if that inability is permanent. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Legally dubious as it was, Mr Bucaram's overthrow was overwhelmingly popular. A thuggish and vulgar populist from the port of Guayaquil, who delighted in insulting his opponents, his election last year (with 54% of the votes in a run-off) was a slap in the face for Ecuador's political establishment. But in six months he managed to unite almost all the country against him. Partly that was because he opted for drastic economic surgery, including hefty rises in the subsidised prices of cooking gas, electricity and petrol as part of a plan that was meant to culminate in an Argentine-style fixed exchange rate--an idea which few economists thought right for Ecuador. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hit Ecuador's poor majority hard. Worse still, Mr Bucaram also presided over rampant and highly visible cronyism and corruption. The American ambassador last month complained publicly that demands for backhanders for customs clearance and contracts would deter foreign investment; a statement which, even if unintendedly, seems to have galvanised the political elite into action against Mr Bucaram.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet his removal does not solve Ecuador's problems. Indeed, it may have made some of them worse. On paper Mr Alarcon has the support of parties across the spectrum. But their commitment may prove shallow--especially if he tries to take the tough decisions needed to stabilise the economy. Apart from ordering the army to take over the customs administration, his first measure was to revoke Mr Bucaram's subsidy cuts--while in the same breath calling on Ecuadoreans to prepare for "sacrifices", a call that got a dusty answer from the unions. Francisco Swett, an economic consultant, reckons that if nothing is done to reduce a fiscal deficit heading for 5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, inflation will double this year to 50% and growth could be negative.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Alarcon's supporters claim that the negotiating skills that landed him his new job will enable him to achieve the policy consensus that Mr Bucaram never bothered to seek. That could allow Ecuador to continue to muddle through. But rather than back-room deals, the country needs thoroughgoing reform. A deeply conservative place, it has avoided the guerrilla wars, political violence and large-scale drug trafficking that plague its larger neighbours, Colombia and Peru. But it remains an economic backwater. And its political system is chaotic, with 14 parties holding seats in the 82-member Congress, deep regional cleavages (notably between Guayaquil and inland, mountainous Quito), and frequent clashes between legislature and executive. Almost heedless of the constitution as they replaced Mr Bucaram, Mr Alarcon and his backers have to earn legitimacy through delivering better government. If they fail, Ecuadoreans may yet come to see Mr Bucaram as a martyr.

<h1>Sweating for that euro</h1>

<font size=1>BRUSSELS
</font><p><p><b>Behind a front of grim optimism, some of the single currency's keenest
<br>proponents are starting to doubt that it will take shape on time</b></p>
<br>IT IS so hard to keep saying nothing. The chief engineers of Europe's single currency still intone the mantra that, under the Maastricht treaty, it will start life on January 1st 1999, and that all European Union countries meeting the treaty's "convergence criteria" (except for Britain and Denmark, which can "opt out" if they wish) will adopt it. The business of deciding who qualifies will take place in early 1998, on the basis of economic figures for 1997. The grim word from the European Commission is that it will apply "the treaty, the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the silence is becoming untenable in the face of a steady drip of contrary speculation--and figures that can no longer be wished away. Plans to exclude Italy and the other Mediterranean countries from the first wave of the euro are discovered, discussed and disowned. New--often conflicting--economic figures are released almost every week. A seemingly endless string of gambits are proposed by France, Belgium, Italy and the rest to massage their debt figures and squeeze their 1997 budget deficits below the Maastricht ceiling of 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>; so far, the Union's compliant statisticians have been loth to cry foul, though there remains some doubt about whether Italy's partially repayable euro tax, designed to raise 0.6% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1997, will pass muster. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest bombshell was, however, not detonated by any of the usual suspects but by the most important, and seemingly most dependable, country of all, Germany. A huge jump in German unemployment in January to 4.7m, 12% of the workforce, has pushed the total well above the assumptions in German economic forecasts for the year. Those forecasts had already been revised upwards to show a budget deficit of 2.9%, barely below the Maastricht ceiling. After the January jump in unemployment, hardly any independent forecasters expect this year's budget deficit to be under 3%; most predict 3.5% or more. In addition, Germany looks highly unlikely to meet the debt criterion: even the most elastic interpretation, which would waive the 60%-of-<font size=-1>GDP</font> minimum requirement so long as the figures are moving the right way, cannot do the trick. Germany's public debt has been steadily rising for the past five years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The falling <font size=-1>D</font>-mark may still rescue the German economy; some commission insiders say they expect it to boost <font size=-1>GDP</font> by 0.4%. But given high unemployment and a faltering recovery, it will be exceptionally hard for the government to cut spending or raise taxes any further--indeed, it plans to reduce taxes. Worse, German ministers have repeatedly insisted that the 3% Maastricht ceiling must be rigidly adhered to, even though the wording of the treaty is sufficiently vague to allow let-outs if an excess is deemed temporary and exceptional. It might be possible to "fine-tune" the numbers to below 3%. But the risk is that Germany, which largely devised the Maastricht criteria, could be hoist with its own petard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A single currency without Germany is, of course, unthinkable. So if the German deficit figures for 1997 prove intractable, the wiggle room in the treaty may have to be used. But there are two big snags. One is that the German constitutional court insisted, when it approved the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, that the convergence criteria should be strictly applied--so any fiddles would be likely to prompt swift court challenges. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Far more difficult, however, is the second snag: the ambitions of Spain, Portugal and Italy to join in the first wave. Germany's declared position on this is studiously neutral. But German bankers and even ministers privately make little secret of their determination that Italy, at least, and probably Spain and Portugal too, should be kept out. Indeed, the criteria were partly designed to this very end. Letting in these countries, many German officials feel, could fatally weaken the euro and make it far harder to sell the abandonment of the beloved <font size=-1>D</font>-mark to the German public.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, the Germans had hoped that some figleaf--an undertaking, for instance, to offer entry in 2001 or 2002--could be found to persuade the Mediterraneans to accept exclusion in 1999. That hope was already looking forlorn, not least because the Italian and Spanish governments have reacted so fiercely whenever it has been mooted. What would sink it altogether would be the failure of Germany itself to meet the Maastricht criteria. It might technically still be correct to argue that Germany is far closer to a genuinely sustainable convergence than Italy or Spain--but such arguments cut little ice down south.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves only two options. One is to let a bigger bunch into the euro club, perhaps all the Mediterranean countries, bar Greece. But fears that this would mean a weak euro, that it may prove unacceptable both to the German public and to financial markets, and that it will be challenged in court all make this option unappealing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the second option: admit defeat in 1997 and delay the single currency, preferably for only a year or two. Eurocrats still feel obliged to assert that delay remains unthinkable--there is, indeed, no provision for it in the treaty. The German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, no less, has argued that any delay might well blow up the entire euro project. Yet one official close to the negotiations observes that an extra year or two would do no more than recognise that, since the Maastricht treaty was signed, Europe has been through a wrenching recession. The European monetary system in its day was delayed at the last minute, though only for three months. There are plenty of <font size=-1>EU</font> precedents for "stopping the clock", whatever treaty rules may say.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaying the euro would, even so, be decidedly problematic. Once this has happened, after all, why should it not happen again--meaning, in effect, that the project could be postponed indefinitely? How would the financial markets be managed in the meantime? There must be a risk that delay would push up the value of the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, further hampering the German recovery. Delay might harm governments in the 1998 elections due in both France and Germany. It might even put off the start of negotiations to enlarge the European Union eastwards, though these are bound anyway to last several years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worst of all, a delay might do little to solve the problems that caused it in the first place. Governments would immediately be tempted to slow down their efforts to meet the Maastricht criteria, meaning that they could face the same troubles all over again in 2000 or 2001. It would be no easier, and could be harder, to keep out the Mediterraneans. Yet there is a more optimistic view, too. Delay could make genuine convergence more feasible across Europe, especially if governments carried out needed reforms of both product and labour markets (see <a href="eu6365.html">page</a>). In the longer run, the euro might then have a bigger chance of working.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every way of getting to the euro presents obstacles. But some of them are now looking insuperable. Not so long ago, delay seemed most unlikely. As 1997 wears on, it is beginning to look distinctly possible.

<h1>The unemployment conundrum</h1>

<font size=1>BRUSSELS
</font><p>TO CRITICS, one cause of rising European unemployment is easy to identify: the approach of the single currency. The Maastricht criteria, say the carpers, is forcing governments to tighten fiscal policy at the wrong time in the economic cycle; and the prospect of a more competitive single market when the euro arrives is making companies cut costs--and payrolls. Hence some of the hostility to the euro across Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The logic is shaky, though. Continental Europe was suffering from high unemployment long before the single currency hove into view (see <a href="eu1.gif">chart</a>). John Major, the British prime minister, recently pointed out in a speech in Brussels that over the past 20 years America had created 36m new jobs, of which 31m were in the private sector; in the same period the European Union had created only 5m jobs, of which just 1m were private.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This long-term trend suggests that the bulk of Europe's unemployment is structural, not cyclical. That is, it reflects over-regulated product and labour markets, rather than inadequate demand or tight fiscal policies. The fiscal tightening for Maastricht has had at most a marginal effect. Moreover, reductions in public spending and borrowing were long overdue--and have produced offsetting benefits in falling interest rates that should have helped to boost economies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not obvious, either, that the single currency will shrink the number of jobs when it comes. Indeed, if it helps to force structural changes on companies and obliges governments to unpick regulations, it could eventually help create jobs. In some ways, continental Europe may be going through what Britain experienced in the early 1980s, when restructuring and deregulation of labour and product markets pushed up joblessness--for a while. But Britain now has the lowest jobless rate of any big European country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The real risk with the euro is not that it will produce an upsurge in unemployment. It is that, if countries have not freed their labour markets and are also denied fiscal flexibility, some could suffer badly in the event of an "asymmetric shock"--one that hits one country more than others. Here, paradoxically, is the best economic argument for delaying the single currency. Not so as to enable countries to meet the Maastricht criteria, but to give them more time to deregulate their sclerotic economies. Whether politicians are brave enough to take that on is another matter.

<p><b>Germany
<h1>Kohldom creaks</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>BERLIN
</font><p>"TWILIGHT of the chancellor" . . .
<br>"The beginning of the end". German newspaper headlines show the door is wide open to criticism of Helmut Kohl. With joblessness rising way past alarm-bell levels and government plans to sort out Germany's squeezed finances splitting the chancellor's conservative coalition, Kohldom is creaking. Mr Kohl himself, still a popularly reassuring figure, insists he has not decided whether to stand for office again next year, but the pressure to make his position clear is growing within his own camp. Adverse rumours have surfaced about Mr Kohl's health, quickly denounced by a seemingly robust chancellor as shabby invention. Yet the spotlights are playing, as never before, on possible successors. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was more than sauciness in the reply of Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic leader, to a recent Kohl thrust in parliament that to call for the chancellor's departure is hollow routine for an opposition chief. "That is true, Mr Chancellor," said Mr Lafontaine. "But your problem is, there are more and more people on your own side who also want you to go." Indeed, the big change in Germany is the doubt expressed in government ranks over Mr Kohl's capacity to tackle surging unemployment, now at 4.7m (above 12%), the highest level since the 1930s. Mr Kohl's reaction to the problem seems to be a shaking of the head, an admonition to those who have jobs to forgo any increase in real income, and a plea for Germany's now shaky consensus between employers, unions and political leaders to be revived.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, Mr Kohl seems at a loss. His aura further dims in the disobliging shadow of Ludwig Erhard, Germany's "economic miracle" worker from the 1950s who has been reaping rich praise on what would have been his 100th birthday. With St Ludwig hovering above, Mr Kohl's plight looks all the sadder. The sweeping tax cuts contained in an ambitious tax-reform plan for 1999 have splintered his ruling coalition, as have controversial plans to ensure that Germany can keep paying for retirement pensions. These are conflicts the Kohl of old might have smothered at birth. And now a euro-trap may be closing around him, not least because the expense of soaring unemployment endangers German efforts to meet budget-deficit conditions for joining Europe's planned single currency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ordinary Germans have been slow to spot possible links between their social problems and the euro, despite continuing popular reluctance to give up the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark. But Mr Kohl, the euro's standard-bearer, clearly fears the voters might start making the connection. His concern showed in a fatherly performance on French television last Sunday, when he soothed French nerves over Germany's role in Europe. Anyone who tried campaigning against the euro in Germany's general election due late next year, he told his French audience, was doomed to "dramatic defeat".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? Because Germans prized the peace and stability provided by full European integration above all else, <font size=-1>D</font>-mark included. In tarring Social Democrats with the anti-euro brush (only Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, their possible candidate for chancellor, is in fact openly positioning himself for an assault on the new currency), Mr Kohl made clear he would cast them as enemies of Europe's stability, the Germans' dearest goal. But jobless figures could still have the last say. The federal labour office does not exclude a further rise. At best, an average for the year of 4.2m (still 11%) is expected. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is true that criticism of Mr Kohl coming from his Christian Democratic Union (<font size=-1>CDU</font>) falls well short of revolt. People remember that long ago in 1989 Mr Kohl was battered and almost counted out, then barged back as the hero of German unification and has until lately reigned unchallenged. So, like Mr Schr&ouml;der, conservative chieftains too are just positioning themselves. The most obvious is Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, party boss in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Then come Volker R&uuml;he, the defence minister, and Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's prime minister.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What people want is not less Kohl, but more Kohl," contends Friedbert Pfl&uuml;ger, a young <font size=-1>CDU</font> stalwart. The summons is for a Kohl with answers--a decisive Kohl addressing economic issues. Readiness to cross the chancellor in his fraught 15th year in office comes more from young <font size=-1>CDU</font> barons in the German <i>L&auml;nder</i> (states) than from his cohorts in the Bundestag, who mostly still regard him as their best bet for staying in power next year, and certainly a surer bet than those preening themselves to succeed him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whispering about his health, made louder by speculation in <i>Der Spiegel</i>, a news magazine, that treatment he has undergone for a prostate ailment points to cancer, may indeed be the underhand political nonsense he says it is. Physically, Mr Kohl shows no signs of slowing. To help him recover his poise, and to stop short the end-of-reign gossip, his keenest coalition supporters want him to commit himself by this spring at the latest to standing for another term. Yet, one way or another, jobs and the euro will prove the ultimate test of his authority.

<p><b>Scottish Tories
<h1>About face</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>EDINBURGH
</font><p>WHEN Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, and Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, contradicted each other on February 10th over what the Tories would do if a Labour government set up a Scottish parliament, they were merely giving a foretaste of the troubles to come for the Tories north of the border if they lose the general election. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dorrell told the <i>Scotsman</i> newspaper that the Tories would get rid of Labour's devolved parliament. Unfortunately for Mr Dorrell, Mr Forsyth had already decided that a better argument was to warn Scots voters that, once an Edinburgh parliament had been set up, they would be stuck with it. The Scottish Tories found this approach effective in 1992, when they claimed that votes for the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>) could be more than mere protest votes--they could actually lead to independence. The Tories reckon that this tactic prevented the <font size=-1>SNP</font> from winning three Conservative seats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth plans to repeat the trick, this time to stop Labour from winning his own constituency in Stirling. John Major agrees with Mr Forsyth's tactic, and smacked down Mr Dorrell on February 11th, insisting repeatedly that only Mr Forsyth and himself had responsibility for constitutional "policy". Describing Labour's plans as "extremely damaging", Mr Major added: "It is not an omelette that could be readily unscrambled."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This inelegant metaphor conceals a sensible long-term strategy. Most Scottish Tories assume that Labour will win both the election and the referendum on the Scottish parliament which Tony Blair, the Labour leader, plans to hold before putting a devolution bill through Westminster. If their anti-devolution posture is twice rejected by voters, the Scottish Tories will then have the awkward task of formulating a manifesto to run for election to the very parliament they have opposed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I cannot imagine us standing on a platform of seeking to abolish it," observes one senior Tory. Pledging to make devolution work by keeping taxes down looks more likely to be a vote-winner, especially if the Scottish Labour Party is bent on putting taxes up. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tory <font size=-1>U</font>-turns on devolution are nothing new. Under Edward Heath, the party became pro-devolution in 1968. Margaret Thatcher reversed that stance in 1976. Since then, the tiny band of pro-devolution Scottish Tories have kept their mouths shut. But now they see their chance of grabbing back some of the limelight. One such is Arthur Bell, a Lanarkshire businessman who is also an unpaid adviser to Mr Forsyth. Mr Bell says he would be keen to become the Scottish Tory party chairman if there were a vacancy after the election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, this job is in the gift of the Tory party leader. Mr Major's successor might think, like Mr Dorrell, that there are more votes to be won in England than lost in Scotland by promising to unscramble the devolution omelette. Such a strategy might appeal to English voters who felt that Labour's failure to deal with the West Lothian question (see Bagehot) gave the Scots too much say in England's business. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a development would strengthen the hand of those Scottish Tories who think that their best future in a devolved system lies in declaring independence from the British Tory party in much the same way as Bavaria's Christian Social Union is independent of Germany's Christian Democrats. The two parties operate in alliance only in federal elections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But neither this strategy, nor a naked appeal to English nationalism, is likely to attract Scottish Tory heavyweights such as Malcolm Rifkind, the foreign secretary, who campaigned for devolution in the 1979 devolution referendum. If Labour gets its way over devolution, the Tories will need some smart thinking and fast footwork if they are not to end up as split over devolution as they are over Europe.

<p><b>Labour and the environment
<h1>Green or red?</h1>

</b></p>IN THE race for electoral advantage, Tory and Labour politicians have long tried to prove they are tougher than each other on bad things like crime and inflation. Less noticed, they are now engaged in another race: to prove they are nicer than each other on the environment. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, the Tories appeared to be winning this contest. John Gummer, the environment secretary, was last year awarded a prize for the "<font size=-1>MP</font> who has done most for the world's environment". He has opposed the building of new out-of-town shopping centres, for example, and called for tough international action to stop global warming. Last month Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, an environmental lobby group, accused Labour of lagging behind the Tories on green issues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Labour appears to be closing the gap. Next week Tony Blair, Labour's leader, will hold a private meeting with the leaders of Britain's biggest environmental groups to reassure them of his green intentions. Michael Meacher, the party's spokesman on environmental protection, recently promised to deliver the "first truly green government Britain has ever seen".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are these just warm words? For most voters the environment is less important than other issues such as health, crime and the economy. But both parties recognise that for certain groups, such as the young, or families living in polluted city streets, greenery could prove a crucial vote winner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The art of wooing green voters, therefore, is to appear greenest on issues which involve little confrontation with other economic or political interests. Thus John Gummer has been able to take a lead on global warming, because the collapse of the country's coal industry has already given Britain an enviable record, by international standards, of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. He has been more cautious about proposing any measures to curb the use of cars. That might annoy millions of British drivers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's environmental policy is following a similar pattern. On global warming the party is proposing a 20% cut in carbon-dioxide emissions by 2010, a tough target by international standards but one which will not require drastic measures in the immediate future. Mr Meacher has proposed a new international convention to regulate the use of chemicals which appear to be causing a world-wide collapse in men's sperm counts. He also wants to set up an "environment taskforce" to encourage young people to conserve the countryside and perform other green activities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to the annoyance of environmentalists, Labour is proposing an immediate cut in the rate of <font size=-1>VAT</font> on fuel from 8% to 5%. Although fuel taxes discourage consumption of energy, and hence reduce pollution, the party has long complained that high rates of <font size=-1>VAT</font> on fuel hit poor families disproportionately. Once in government, the party will also come under pressure not to impose environmental rules on industries which it has long sought to defend. The coal industry, for example, has recently been complaining about proposed controls on sulphur emissions, arguing that they would cost around 8,000 of the 18,000 coal-mining jobs left in the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one area of environmental policy, however, the Labour Party may be able to out-green the Tories. An increasingly popular argument used by environmental groups these days is that green regulations are not just good for the environment, but good for jobs. Tough regulations, they argue, create markets for firms which sell environmentally friendly technologies, or which clean up the mess caused by polluting industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories have been sniffy about this argument, suspicious of any attempt to load more regulations on business. Labour politicians, however, seem to have welcomed it with open arms. Last month Mr Blair spoke of the need to "stimulate the development of new green industries." Labour last year criticised the government for delaying controls on volatile organic compounds, a type of air pollutant. It argued that this would "jeopardise" the ability of the country's environmental-technology industry to win a big share of foreign markets in pollution-control equipment. Mr Meacher points out that the worldwide market for such green technologies, currently worth around $250 billion a year, is expected to grow to $300 billion by 2000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour may have promised not to raise public spending if it is elected, but it has made no promise not to toughen regulations on business. In some countries critics of environmental campaigners have given them the nickname "watermelons"--because, while green on the outside, they are red on the inside (ie, they favour government intervention in the economy). Are Labour politicians watermelons too?

<p><b>Religion and economics
<h1>Reverend moneybags</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>LIVERPOOL
</font><p>GOD, according to many British churchmen, does not think too much of Mammon. The main fault of the way we run capitalism, they reckon, is that it leaves too many people out of work and in poverty. So says a report on employment drawn up by clergymen from the main British and Irish Christian churches due to be published in April.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A foretaste of the kind of political rage the report is bound to kindle came last month. David Sheppard, the Anglican bishop of Liverpool, who chairs the committee of clergymen overseeing the compilation of the report, criticised Tory and Labour politicians for supposedly putting the concerns of comfortably-off people ahead of the problems of the poor. Both parties promptly smacked him down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actually, neither party ought to be annoyed--the clergy are as entitled as anyone else to chuck their tuppence-worth into public debate. But politicians might have more respect for their views if the churches used their resources and influence to create jobs and wealth to deal with the poverty that they are rightly worried about. In the following rather impressive example, one clergyman has. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Derrick Walters arrived as Dean of Liverpool's Anglican cathedral in 1983, he found the church surrounded by dereliction and rarely visited by local people. It is close to Toxteth, where nearly half the people were unemployed. In 1981, some rioted, burning buildings and injuring 700 policemen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Walters took a businesslike approach. "I believe in competition and the private enterprise system," he says. He started with the cathedral, hiring cleaners to spruce it up. He set up a gift shop and a restaurant, which made it into the Egon Ronay good-food guide. These moves so boosted attendance, and revenues, at the cathedral that Mr Walters was able to double the number of people working there to 70.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next he turned his attention outside. He drew up a plan for houses and built them with &#163;4.8m from Barclays Bank and &#163;2.4m from the Housing Corporation, a government agency. Flats for 400 students, an art school for John Moores University, offices, and more houses followed, bringing the total spent on the area to about &#163;20m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This impressive enterprise brought him into contact with government ministers such as Michael Portillo, Michael Heseltine, and Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister. Mr Walters used these connections ruthlessly to push forward the regeneration of 45 acres of near-derelict housing in Toxteth, which he named "Project Rosemary". The site now boasts a 260-bed women's hospital and 250 new houses, a quarter of them privately owned. About &#163;65m of public and private money has been spent, creating 2,000 jobs. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Walters does not see himself as a property developer, but as someone who opens doors for others. In 1990, for example, fears arose that J.F. Renshaw, a local marzipan and cake-icing manufacturer, might close and transfer production to another factory in the south-east of England. Mr Walters helped the company to get government subsidies for a &#163;14m investment to shift all its work to Liverpool instead, securing 200 jobs in Toxteth. "It was down to the enthusiasm and persuasive powers of Dean Walters," says Fred Connolly, Renshaw's operations director.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Walters hopes these abilities will be enough to convince the Millennium Commission to stump up &#163;25m, and private firms to cough up another &#163;30m, for a grandiose pavilion on Liverpool's waterfront to house shows and businesses in the media industry, creating an estimated 1,200 jobs. The commission is expected to announce its decision next week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oddly, the churches' April employment report barely mentions Mr Walters's schemes, despite the fact that some of its contributors have visited his projects. Andrew Britton, a former director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the report's main author, says that, although there are a lot of enterprising people in the church, the churches preferred to concentrate on their role in training schemes and running job clubs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This seems like a missed opportunity. Mr Walters's example is a good one, and carries more credibility than sweeping complaints about unemployment or calls for giant schemes to ameliorate poverty. True, Mr Walters seems to have been as adept at milking the public purse as at generating new private investment. But the same could be said of many businessmen, and Mr Walters does seem to have put what money he has raised, from whatever source, to very good use.

<p><b>Archaeology
<h1>Beep beep beep</h1>

</b></p>EACH year, about 400,000 items of archaeological interest are dug up, from shards of pottery to great hoards of gold and silver. The most spectacular find of recent months is a stash of 486 coins dating from the English civil war, found at Tregwynt, Pembrokeshire, in September.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is talk of mutiny among the 30,000 people who use metal detectors, and who find most of this buried loot. February 14th was the deadline for objections to proposed new rules to replace the ancient law of "treasure trove". Some metal-detecting enthusiasts are indeed objecting, convinced that the new rules are the first stage in a plot to ban their hobby, as has happened in countries such as Ireland and Sweden.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The law of treasure trove, which some historians think was brought to Britain by invading Anglo-Saxons in the fifth century <font size=-1>AD</font>, gave the crown the right to seize items of precious metal if they appeared to have been deliberately hidden. Over the centuries, a tradition has developed of rewarding finders who handed in such treasures. If items are ruled not to be treasure trove, or if no museum wants them, they are given back to the finders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, only about 20 finds a year are claimed by museums. The new rules, drawn up under the Treasure Act passed by Parliament last year, aim to double this number by defining a wider range of archaeological finds as "treasure", and by removing the need to show that they had been hidden. The new law makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to three months in prison or a fine of &#163;5,000, to fail to report a finding of treasure within 14 days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Treasure-hunters are divided over the proposed new rules. Dennis Jordan, president of the National Council for Metal Detecting, says that by making some small concessions, the government has now won the reluctant agreement of most of his members. His organisation is suggesting only relatively minor changes to the new rules. But some groups have broken away from the council, accusing it of being too conciliatory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the rebels is Nigel Mills of <i>Treasure Hunting</i> magazine. Like others, he objects strongly to the criminalisation of those who fail to report their finds, and says 14 days is not long enough to seek advice on whether finds are covered by the new law. If it is so important to keep such treasures for the nation, Mr Mills asks, why are museums not being obliged to display them, instead of leaving them in storage, as often happens?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Roger Bland, an official at the British Museum who was involved in drawing up the new rules, insists there is no plot to ban metal detecting. The objectors are exaggerating the likelihood of anyone being jailed or fined heavily, he claims. Such punishments would apply only in the most serious cases. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the courts interpret the new rules sensibly, and if museums try harder to co-operate with the metal-detecting fraternity, then those who uncover Britain's historical treasures will be encouraged to continue reporting their finds. If not, some may be tempted to keep their mouths shut and pocket their discoveries.

<h1>Tobacco outclassed</h1>

<p><b>This may be the American tobacco industry's worst year. What was once seen as an elegant pastime is now on the point of being treated as drug-taking</b></p>
<br>BEING "carded" is part of growing up in the United States. Without a driving licence or similar identification document (<font size=-1>ID</font>) to show that they are over 21, the young can buy nothing stronger than root beer. In a few days' time, if government plans go ahead, it will not be just drinkers who have to carry <font size=-1>ID</font>. Any smokers who look younger than 27 will be required to prove that they are over 18 before they can buy cigarettes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ID</font> rule (and the introduction of 18 as a national minimum age rather than a state-by-state requirement) is due to go into effect on February 28th. It is the first of a series of regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration, and intended to reduce smoking among young people. Two years ago the <font size=-1>FDA</font> asserted that nicotine, the main addictive component of tobacco smoke, is a drug and that the agency therefore had jurisdiction over it. Further regulations will come into force in August (see below).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These are just the first of the shocks that will hit the tobacco business this year. Because they will directly affect customers, the <font size=-1>ID</font> requirements will be widely noticed, but the more punishing blows from the industry's point of view may come later, when a series of lawsuits--some for medical expenses incurred by states, others for the suffering of individuals and groups of people--come to trial. In addition, there is a strong possibility of criminal indictments for conspiracy against executives from some of the big companies. And a stream of leaks from within tobacco companies has been revealing past deceptions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big tobacco firms are fighting back in the way that served them well for 40 victorious years, pouring their wealth into potent, relentless legal teams. But they are also starting to talk of striking deals--anathema for those 40 years, and a sure sign that, this time, victory is less certain.
<br></p><p><b><b>First strike</b>
</b><br>Just possibly, the industry may yet thwart the regulators. On February 10th a judge in Greensboro, North Carolina, heard arguments from lawyers representing the largest American tobacco companies and several advertising groups seeking to have the rules summarily dismissed. They dispute the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s authority to regulate tobacco, arguing first that Congress would need to give it specific authorisation, which it has not done, and second that cigarettes are not medical devices and therefore do not come under its general remit. On a different tack, they argue that to ban and restrict advertising would be to limit free speech, in defiance of the first amendment to the constitution. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The judge has now retreated to ponder these arguments and the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s reply, promising a ruling in five weeks or so. Whatever his decision, the losing side will immediately appeal, sending the case up to the court of appeals in Richmond, Virginia. This court has previously shown itself willing to accept advertising bans vaguer than those proposed by the <font size=-1>FDA</font>. And, since health and safety regulations are conventionally left in place until proved faulty, the Richmond court would probably reverse any suspension imposed by the Greensboro judge while it made up its mind. Again, whatever it decides, appeal is inevitable and the case is likely to end up before the Supreme Court in 1998. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tobacco lobby takes courage from a 1996 Supreme Court decision rejecting a Rhode Island ban on alcohol advertisements that touted price. But the other set of arguments, about the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s authority over cigarettes, matters more. If the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s claim were to be upheld, the agency would be in a position to impose stricter rules later on, if it missed its goal of halving the number of teenagers taking up smoking each year. The tobacco industry believes that the <font size=-1>FDA</font> wants a total ban on smoking. David Kessler, the head of the <font size=-1>FDA</font>, who has led its assault on tobacco, insists that he and the agency recognise a ban would be impossible. Given that 40m Americans already smoke, that is just as well. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s case has been much strengthened by a series of revelations by whistleblowers within cigarette companies. Their tales suggest that the manufacturers have sometimes manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes. The cigarette companies have always argued that nicotine is simply an incidental part of a natural product. However, such manipulation implies that the purpose of a cigarette is indeed to deliver a set "dose" of nicotine. 
<br>Evidence of manipulation continues to emerge. On February 10th <font size=-1>NBC</font> reported a story about Philip Morris. Some of the company's employees claimed in the network television broadcast that, in the late 1980s, the company had taken nicotine extracted from tobacco used to make a low-nicotine brand and added it to tobacco in a different batch of cigarettes. These extra-strength cigarettes were sent out to smokers as free samples. The company had previously told federal investigators that it had thrown away all the extracted nicotine. This denial may come back to haunt it as part of a Justice Department investigation of possible conspiracy. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides the <font size=-1>FDA</font> rules, tobacco's opponents have several more bombshells to lob. Norwood Wilner, the lawyer who won the first legal victory in a negligence case against a tobacco firm on behalf of a smoker, in Florida last year, has lined up a sequence of similar cases. The first, on behalf of the family of Jean Connor, a smoker who died in 1995, is scheduled for April, and will add conspiracy charges to the mixture, alleging that R.J. Reynolds suppressed and distorted information in order to encourage people like Mrs Connor to smoke. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bigger lawsuits lie ahead. The first state Medicaid suit is due to go to trial on June 2nd. The attorney-general for Mississippi is suing tobacco companies to recover the cost of paying for looking after poor people made ill by smoking. Florida, Texas and Washington are all likely to follow this year, and more are mustering for 1998. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All these suits will try to meet the tobacco companies' argument that smokers should take responsibility for the consequences of their addiction. Another sequence of state-level suits will seek damages for the harm done by the addictive qualities of nicotine, rather than by diseases such as lung cancer and emphysema. Lawyers in these suits, who represent enormous "classes" of people harmed by nicotine addiction, are drawing on much of the same evidence of nicotine manipulation that has strengthened the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s hand. Originally, a single suit, known as <i>Castano</i> after a person who had died of lung cancer, grouped all the potential litigants into a single vast nationwide class. That class action was ruled invalid in May 1996. Hydra-like, <i>Castano</i> is resurgent as numerous state-level class actions. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The threat of criminal investigation by the Justice Department is the hardest to gauge at the moment, but is potentially lethal. As well as the recent Philip Morris example highlighted by <font size=-1>NBC</font>, investigators are examining whether tobacco company bosses committed perjury when they swore before Congress during hearings in 1994 that nicotine was not addictive. These investigations could produce indictments which would send individual tobacco-company bosses to prison. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cumulative effect of all these threats is to make the tobacco industry talk about striking a deal with its tormentors. Martin Broughton, chief executive of <font size=-1>B</font>.<font size=-1>A</font>.<font size=-1>T</font> Industries, a British firm which owns Brown & Williamson, the third-largest tobacco company in America, said earlier this month that such a deal--large payments in exchange for immunity from further lawsuits--looked attractive. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year one of the lawyers leading the Mississippi suit floated the idea of an act of Congress that would wring $160 billion over 20 years from the tobacco industry, as well as adherence to the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s proposals on curbing youth smoking, in exchange for freedom from further lawsuits and from <font size=-1>FDA</font> regulation. Philip Morris denied any interest in such congressional settlements, but the industry no longer presents a united front. Earlier in 1996 Liggett, the smallest of the large American cigarette firms, broke ranks to strike a similar deal on its own. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the anti-tobacco lobby gains the whip hand, it too may start to split. Tobacco's enemies will discover that maintaining an alliance becomes harder when you are no longer on the defensive. The industry will doubtless exploit any divisions. Deciding how far to hold out when striking deals will be a fresh problem--albeit a more rewarding one than it has faced before. 
<p>


<h2>Tobacco rules</h2>
<p>AS FROM August 28th, the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s new rules will: 
<ul
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;restrict cigarette vending machines to places where under-age people never go, such as private clubs;
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;ban free samples, packs with fewer than 20 cigarettes and sales of single cigarettes;
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;insist that coupons for cigarettes are exchanged in person in a shop, not through the mail;
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;ban cigarette billboards from with-in 1,000 feet (300 metres) of schools;
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;insist that cigarette advertisements have no pictures or colour (leaving them only the aptly named "tombstone" format of black words on white paper), except in magazines which have few young readers or in places where youngsters never go;
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;ban gifts in exchange for tokens from cigarette packs;
<br><font size=-1>&#149;</font>&#160;ban all sorts of branded free gifts such as baseball hats and <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts.
</ul
<p>A year later, the <font size=-1>FDA</font> will ban cigarette manufacturers from sponsoring sports in the name of their brands.

<p><b>The City of London
<h1>Stitched up</h1>

</b></p>FOR much of this century, Britain's Labour Party has been at war with the City of London. Nationalising industry and taxing the rich have been policies with limited appeal to a square mile chock full of millionaire shareholders. Recently, Labour has done much to change this, cosying up to all sorts of City worthies. Yet in one respect, at least, Labour seems to be in danger of committing what for it would be a novel sin: being captured by City interests.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The issue is financial regulation. Labour has already announced plans for reforming Britain's two-tiered regulatory structure. It wants to scrap the three self-regulatory organisations (<font size=-1>SRO</font>s)--so-called because their governing boards are partly drawn from the businesses they regulate--which are charged with patrolling the City's investment-banking, fund-management and personal-investment industries. Labour would do so by folding them into the Securities and Investments Board, London's chief financial-markets watchdog. This, Labour hopes, will cut the costs of regulation and simplify the system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Labour, this seems like canny politics. By attacking self-regulation it can present its policies as tough ones, aimed at cleaning up a sector whose reputation has been besmirched by dodgy sales practices and a string of high-profile fraud trials. But the City need not be unduly alarmed. For, as Labour admits, its reform plans are not as radical as they seem. One of the three <font size=-1>SRO</font>s, the Personal Investment Authority, is hardly a self-regulator: the majority of its board members are not practitioners. And many bankers, who once were wedded to self-regulation, would now gladly trade it for a better system. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor are Labour's proposals quite so far-reaching as previously threatened. Not long ago Alistair Darling, then Labour's City spokesman, was talking heatedly about creating a commission to regulate the banking industry, stripping control from the Bank of England. Mr Darling wondered in 1995 whether Britain ought to have separate banking and securities industry regulators when there is increasing overlap between the two industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That sentiment finds echoes among some regulators because a clutch of mergers have left the City's watchdogs--which are still divided along old industry lines-- struggling to cope with huge new financial conglomerates. Michael Taylor, a former bank supervisor at the Bank of England, has proposed one way of tackling this problem. He advocates setting up one regulator to deal with consumer matters, particularly affecting small investors, and a second to worry about the stability--but not about the business practices--of banks and investment houses in their dealings with one another. Mr Taylor's ideas have some fans. Both Colette Bowe, boss of the Personal Investment Authority, and Richard Farrant, her counterpart at the Securities and Futures Authority, argue that this set-up would give consumers better protection while making regulation more efficient. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why has Labour backed away from these proposals? The answer, perhaps, is that the critics of the scheme have more influence than its backers. The Bank of England, which came under attack for its handling of the 1995 collapse of Barings, a merchant bank, is unlikely to welcome a radical review of financial regulation. That might have the humiliating result of depriving it of banking oversight altogether.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alternatively--and worse still from the bank's point of view--the Old Lady might gain additional and unwelcome responsibilities for policing accident-prone securities firms as well as banks. "Many people would say that the Bank already considers regulation to be a poisoned chalice," says Mr Taylor. In December, Howard Davies, the Bank's deputy governor, argued against radical changes to Britain's regulatory structure on grounds of cost and disruption. The Bank may have found a useful ally in the Securities and Investments Board. That agency would be stripped of some of its powers under Mr Taylor's proposals. It prefers Labour's ideas, which would give it greater influence. All of which leaves Labour with some peculiar bedfellows.

<h1>Slave to the rhythm</h1>

<p><b>Living organisms could not function without clocks inside them. But those clocks are not always comfortable with the strains of modern life</b></p>
<br>WILLIAM PALEY, an 18th-century British philosopher, believed that all living things were created by a divine watchmaker. Darwin showed that he was wrong. But he was not as wrong as all that, for most creatures, from bugs to ballerinas, are full of clocks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many cycles in the human body recur every 24 hours: hormones ebb and flow, organs seethe and rest, and--most noticeably-- sleep follows wakefulness. As long-distance air travellers know to their discomfort, these cycles are well ingrained. They are called circadian rhythms (from the Latin <i>circa dies--</i>about a day), and their role is to match a body's functions to what is appropriate for the hour. If they get out of synchronisation with each other, they can affect a person's mood--particularly by inducing depression. To stop this happening, they are regulated by a master clock.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The site of this clock is well known. It is a collection of cells in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (<font size=-1>SCN</font>), two pinheads of tissue buried in the base of the brain. But biologists are only now discovering how the neural clockwork operates, and what happens when it goes wrong.
<br></p><p><b><b>The eyes have it</b>
</b><br>One thing has been clear for some time: the external signal that resets the clock (gradually with the seasons, or more rapidly with air travel) is light. If a creature is put into continuous darkness (or, in the case of a person, shut away without any clocks or windows, and allowed to switch the light on and off as desired), then its master clock "free runs"--in the case of people, at about 24.5 hours a cycle--and its circadian rhythms drift away from the 24-hour norm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What was obscure until recently was how this adjustment is brought about. It was known that the light which causes it enters through the eye (and not, for example, through the skin), because damage to a nerve that runs between the retina and the <font size=-1>SCN</font> prevents the resetting from taking place, and because profoundly blind people usually suffer severe circadian disturbances and recurrent insomnia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Charles Czeisler, who runs the Circadian, Neuroendocrine and Sleep Disorders Medicine Section at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, has found that a significant fraction of such sightless people retain their <font size=-1>SCN</font> response to light. This suggests that the clock uses different light detectors from those employed in vision--a finding supported by Russell Foster, at Imperial College in London.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Foster works on genetically engineered mice. One of his experimental mouse families lacks receptor cells for normal sight in the retina. The pigments these receptors (known as rods and cones) contain are there to detect light and turn it into electrical impulses for the brain to process into a picture of the outside world. Even without these receptors, however, such mice still use external light to control their circadian rhythms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is the structure in the eye that enables this to happen? Dr Foster may have found it in the Atlantic salmon. He was studying salmon visual pigments because of the ease with which fish eyes can be obtained in bulk. When he analysed them, he discovered a new one that was very different from those present in ordinary retinal cells. He has dubbed this pigment "vertebrate ancient opsin", and he suspects-- since it seems to have no role in vision--that it may be the missing link in the connection between the eye and the <font size=-1>SCN</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That connection is easily stimulated: it does not take much light to manipulate the body's timekeeping. Dr Czeisler has found that even a few hours in an artificially lit room (which is far dimmer than sunlight) are enough to alter the hands of the circadian clock. Indeed, the body seems to respond to light most when it is weak--after dusk and just before dawn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is not so surprising, for these transition points between day and night are the most critical periods for the <font size=-1>SCN</font>. They are the times when the nuclei have to send out signals to bring about appropriate changes in physiology. Exposure to weak light in the evening, just as the <font size=-1>SCN</font> are settling down to the night shift, tends to cause them to recall the rhythms of the day. Indeed, Dr Czeisler believes this may explain why many people find it difficult to fall asleep until the wee, small hours of the morning. And when they do eventually descend into the arms of Morpheus, he notes, they tend to do so in bedrooms sheltered behind thick walls, and with small windows. They are thus shielded from the stimulus of the dawn's early light, and find it just as hard to wake up again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On top of this daily tinkering with the clock by the luxuries of civilisation, there is evidence for longer-term effects. According to Thomas Wehr, a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, men (though not, for some reason, women) who live in cities have lost their capacity to adjust their circadian rhythms to the seasons. Long winter nights should mean longer biological nights--with extended production of the night-hormone melatonin, which regulates sleep (see <a href="st4159.html">page</a>). But this is not the case in men. Their biological nights remain more or less constant throughout the year, and Dr Wehr suspects this is because male clocks are dulled by life under the lights. In a more seasonal species than humans, this would have serious implications for things like reproduction. What it is doing to metropolitan men is unclear.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interesting though these observations of behaviour are, none of them help to explain how the clock itself actually works. For that, it is necessary to take it to pieces and examine the mechanism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taking living people's biological clocks to pieces is not, of course, allowed. Instead, Steven Reppert, of the Department of Developmental Chronobiology at another Bostonian hospital, Massachusetts General, works on rats. He has recently shown that some of the thousands of cells in rat <font size=-1>SCN</font> can act as independent clocks, keeping their own time--though how they co-ordinate their timekeeping in order to send out a coherent signal is still a mystery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tracing the biochemistry of this cellular timekeeping in rodents is just beginning. Joseph Takahashi, who works at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, believes he has found one of the genes responsible for part of it. By using mutation-inducing chemicals, he has created a strain of mice whose rhythms are seriously awry. Dr Takahashi refers to the gene he has succeeded in damaging--and which seems to control the timing of mouse behaviour--as "<i>clock</i>". He is now trying to isolate it, in order to discover what the protein produced from it looks like, and how it works.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is not only mammals that have biological clocks. Circadian rhythms are just about as universal as biological phenomena get: they are found in bacteria, plants and fungi, as well as most invertebrates. Since they are so widespread, they probably have a common origin. And since evolution rarely throws anything useful away simply to replace it with something that works the same but is different, experiments on other species should lead to insights into human body clocks.
<br>Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, and Michael Young at Rockefeller University in New York, have worked out many of the details of the clock in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila</i>. They have, in particular, identified two proteins which seem to put the tick-tock into <i>Drosophila'</i>s clock. These proteins are known as "Period" and "Timeless".
<br></p><p><b><b>How flies time</b>
</b><br>During the hours of daylight, the concentrations of Period and Timeless build up inside certain brain cells that are the insect equivalent of the <font size=-1>SCN</font>. Then, under cover of darkness, individual molecules of Period and Timeless link up and waltz off to the nuclei of the cells they are in. Here they act in a peculiar way. They shut down the genes that carry their own blueprints, hence stopping their own production. As a result, the number of protein couples in each cell thins out as the night progresses, and by the time morning arrives so few Period and Timeless molecules remain in each cell that the genes come back on and the cycle starts again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A flash of light in the night, however, can reset a fly's clock instantly. It does so by destroying the molecules of Timeless (though no one yet knows how). As a result, Period is left alone in the nucleus. Since it cannot operate without its partner, the genes for both proteins are turned on early and the clock is reset forward.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Period and Timeless partnership is thus a simple, self-winding mechanism. And a similar system has been found in a creature even less attractive than <i>Drosophila</i>--the bread mould <i>Neurospora</i>. Its clock has been teased apart over the past few years by Jay Dunlap and Jennifer Loros at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire, beginning with their isolation of the timekeeping gene <i>frq</i> in 1989. The model Dr Dunlap and Dr Loros have developed goes one step further than the <i>Drosophila</i> findings. It shows how the workings of the clock may, by stimulating the formation of particular enzymes, control the timing of other activities such as the production of energy or the formation of the delicate filaments that carry the mould's spores.
<br></p><p><b><b>Dark moods, light spirits</b>
</b><br>If the evolutionary argument is correct, the proteins involved in the clocks of <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Neurospora</i> probably have counterparts in mammals. That would enable experimenters to ask the right questions straight away rather than flailing around, as it were, in the dark.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This could be important. Discovering what makes the circadian clock tick would be a big step towards understanding how it drives other cycles in the body, such as the sleep-wake cycle. The clock and the sleep-wake cycle are distinct mechanisms. But, like interlocking cogs, they move together throughout the day. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Occasionally, though, they come uncoupled, as happens in jet-lag, shiftwork and old age. The consequences of this can be more than loss of sleep and a hard day's night. Those with seasonal affective disorder (<font size=-1>SAD</font>)--about 5% of people in the West--suffer from depression and chronic sleepiness between October and April, apparently because short winter days with late dawns push their circadian clocks ahead of their sleep-wake cycles. And when Dr Czeiler and Simon Folkard, of the University of Wales in Swansea, deliberately decoupled the circadian clocks and sleep-wake cycles of 24 healthy young adults, they found that their subjects reported daily bouts of the blues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why adjusting the 24-hour pacemaker should alter mood remains to be found out. Robert Moore, a doyen of the subject (he helped discover the role of the <font size=-1>SCN</font>) is now at the department of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. He is looking for structural changes in the post-mortem <font size=-1>SCN</font> of patients with <font size=-1>SAD</font><t--mode> </t--mode>and similar disorders. He has also begun to study the function of normal <font size=-1>SCN</font> using high-resolution brain-scanning techniques such as positron-emission tomography and magnetic-resonance imaging.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether these techniques will work is still unclear. Looking at structures a millimetre across inside a living brain will test them to the limit. But if they do, they should shed a little more light on the subject. And a little more light may be all that is needed to master the master clock.

<h1>Shift worker</h1>

FOR a hormone normally associated with darkness, melatonin has been enjoying a lot of limelight lately. But despite the hype that has cast it as a new panacea--able to cure everything from <font size=-1>AIDS</font> to Alzheimer's--there is no scientific evidence that it can do anything except rock the body's internal clock. This, however, makes it a powerful treatment for those maladies arising from airline travel or shiftwork.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Melatonin is made in the pineal gland, in the middle of the brain. Descartes considered this gland to be the seat of the soul, and though the pineal has rejoined the ranks of mortal organs since the 17th century, its importance in daily biological rhythms is increasingly appreciated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In almost all species studied, the hormone's presence is an indication that it is night. It is produced during the hours of darkness under instructions from the body's master clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei or <font size=-1>SCN</font>, and then switched off by the morning light. But, in one of the numerous feedback loops that control bodily activities, the level of melatonin itself helps to regulate the <font size=-1>SCN</font>. This means that manipulating melatonin levels artificially can reset the body clock.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Josephine Arendt, in the chronobiology laboratory of the University of Surrey, in Britain, has been working out the treatment best suited to overcoming the needs of the weary traveller. She has found that five-milligram doses of melatonin taken at critical times are enough to shift the clock by 90 minutes a day. In a study of 500 volunteers, four days of extra melatonin (combined with the natural adjustment that would have taken place anyway) was usually able to synchronise people's sleep with their environment. But the timing of the doses must be exact. Those who pop pills indiscriminately, often for melatonin's hypnotic effects, risk setting their clocks awry and destroying their sleep altogether.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The proven benefits of melatonin extend beyond jet-lag. The alertness and moods of night workers are often impaired if their circadian rhythms fail to swing between shifts. Dr Arendt has found that melatonin taken early in the morning after the first few sessions of a week-long night shift will help workers sleep better on their days off and work more effectively at night.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The highest-flying use for melatonin, though, looks as if it will be in space. The circadian clocks of astronauts suffer a double whammy of jet-lag and shiftwork. Since a space shuttle's orbit takes 90 minutes, crew members pass through 16 sunsets and sunrises each day. This completely disorients the <font size=-1>SCN</font> even of America's space heroes: astronauts on board a shuttle sleep almost two hours less than when they are back at base, and they resort to sleeping pills nine times more often than those who remain grounded. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles Czeisler (see <a href="st4161.html">main story</a>) has just begun to investigate the effects of melatonin on shuttle-crews. Experiments aboard next year's Neurolab mission on the shuttle <i>Columbia</i> will be the ultimate test, and a chance for melatonin to live up to some lofty expectations.

<p><b>Reinventing Kodachrome
<h1>Amateur night</h1>

</b></p>OLD fogies often bemoan technological advance. For some audiobuffs the johnny-come-lately transistor will never replace the purity of the valve, nor the compact disc the long-playing record. And in photography it is generally agreed that nothing recent has been as good a colour film as Kodachrome--which turns 62 this year. The thinner gel, tighter grain structure and purity of the emulsion used in Kodachrome makes for sharper detail and richer colour than either the rival "<font size=-1>E-6</font>" slide films, such as Ektachrome and Fujichrome, or any colour-print film.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in a world that prizes immediacy (another thing that fogies despise) Kodachrome has a problem: it is a nightmare to develop. Bringing out those perfect images requires 18 different photochemical processes. As a result, the machines used to develop Kodachrome are huge, expensive and rare. Most people have to send the stuff away by post and will probably not see the results for a week or more. Not surprisingly, many prefer to use a lesser film that the local chemist can develop and return in an hour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, though, the Kodachrome process has been revamped into something that corner-shop developers can afford. And, since many old fogies also believe that a gifted amateur is worth a dozen slogging professionals, they will probably be pleased to learn that the job was done not by Kodak's own engineers but by a dilettante chemist (albeit one who is also a professional photographer).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In making his invention, Richard Mackson is merely following tradition. Kodachrome itself was devised by two gifted amateurs--Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky. Their day jobs were as classical musicians, and they timed the steps in the development process by whistling the final movement of Brahms's C Minor Symphony. But the method they came up with--though a big advance on the multiple lenses and filters that had previously been required to take colour photographs--was still fiendishly complicated. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even a modern Kodachrome processor is a behemoth. It is 33 metres (100 feet) long, costs $1m, occupies 1,000 square metres of floor space and needs to be served by a staff of ten, including an analytical chemist to formulate fresh solutions. Moreover, it uses thousands of litres of chemicals a day, and must run the film through high-pressure sprays at speeds in excess of 100 metres a minute in order to produce a sufficiently strong chemical reaction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Mackson had his idea in 1988, after returning to America from photographing the Seoul Olympics. Kodak had set up a temporary Kodachrome-processing centre in South Korea to allow him and his colleagues to turn their film round quickly. Back home, he was unwilling to go back to the original level of service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the two Leos half a century before him, Mr Mackson worked on his ideas alone before he approached Kodak. The main problem he had to overcome was the build up of waste products from the development process on the surface of the emulsion. These have to be swept away quickly enough to allow fresh chemicals to do their work. After a number of false starts he realised that he could do this by enclosing the film in a small container instead of an enormous vat. That would let him reduce the speed at which the film had to pass through the reaction vessel, and he could therefore shrink the whole apparatus.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The heart of Mr Mackson's innovation is a series of metre-long plastic tubes-within-tubes. The chemical developers are pumped into the space between the tubes and out through holes in the inner tube into the central chamber. Here, the turbulence created by the spray forces an intimate contact between the film and the developer. As a consequence, the film need move at a mere two metres a minute.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is a machine that, in all relevant departments, beats the old one by a factor of ten. It costs a tenth of the price, requires only one technician to operate it (the chemicals are pre-mixed by Kodak, and their concentration is monitored by computer) and can fit into a 60-square-metre room. A film can be processed in under 40 minutes. The result, Kodak hopes, will soon be in a high-street developer near you. Fogies should cheer.

<html><head><title>A survey of technology in finance</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><h3>A survey of technology in finance</h><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></td></tr></table><H1>Warp speed</H1><P><I> Technology is rapidly changing the way financial services are designed and delivered, argues Andrew Freeman. That is because businesses have at last learnt how to use it</I><p ><br>CONSIDER this vision of finance. Artificially intelligent agents plan their clients' investment and transaction needs, constantly finding the best prices on 24-hour electronic financial markets and managing their assets to meet defined risk-reward targets. Businesses send and settle their bills instantly (or, as the jargon has it, in real time), and raise any working or other capital they need by advertising to investors on global computer bulletin boards. And, operating under the auspices of a global sales-tax authority, digital money systems make electronic commerce indistinguishable from physical trade.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How realistic is that vision&#063; On the face of it, not very. Some of the technologies, notably artificial intelligence, are only nascent today. Other details, such as a global tax authority, seem pretty unlikely. And, according to some observers, digital money is riddled with hopeless security flaws.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet a deeper look at today's financial-services industry makes the vision seem suddenly more plausible. Automated financial planning is appearing rapidly in retail finance. Electronic marketplaces are developing for insurance and mutual funds, as well as for low-cost share trading. Some small firms already raise money by appealing direct to investors, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries (though not yet lawyers and accountants). Companies everywhere are racing to offer consumers electronic access to their products, usually by setting up a Web site on the Internet. "Virtual" banks are touting cyber-payment systems. Investment banks are using mind-boggling mathematics to run complex portfolios of financial instruments, borrowing liberally from quantum physics. Financial firms are pouring money into information technology, and are expected to go on doing so (see <a href="tf1.gif">chart</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So even radical forecasts should, it seems, be taken seriously. If they are not, today's insurers, banks and brokers could turn out to be dinosaurs, with new technologies playing the role of the destructive meteor, and only a few surviving in unpredictable new forms. More technologically adept creatures may take over, remaking the industry along entirely different lines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps. Yet rapid technological change is confusing--and radical forecasts are easily hyped. Past waves of innovation produced forecasts that proved wildly inaccurate. Remember electronic home banking, which was accorded revolutionary status in the early 1980s, but failed to take off&#063; Embarrassed bankers do, and their experience is a good reason for financial firms' careful attitude towards such novel phenomena as the Internet.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, many banks have learnt that revolutions are not made by new machines alone. Changing the way people behave is often more important. As Martin Taylor, chief executive of Britain's Barclays Bank, says: "The industry taught people to associate banking with visiting marble halls that were almost like cathedrals. Now we're telling them it's all right to pray at home. But we have to understand that money, our product, has a lot of sociological encrustations which we can't remove simply by changing the way we view our business."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As this survey explores technology and its impact on finance and financial services (mainly in America, which is the furthest ahead in this field), it will therefore pay close attention to two groups of people. One is the managers of financial firms. After several decades of wrestling with technology, the best have recently begun to harness and use it more intelligently. Their recognition that firms can do things in new ways lies behind this survey's central proposition: that, thanks to technology, financial services are on the cusp of dramatic change.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second group is composed of people who buy and use financial services. Their increasing familiarity with technology is a powerful force for change. But they can be recalcitrant, resisting innovations in favour of tried and tested procedures. Metal coins, paper money and cheques are still ubiquitous (see <a href="tf2.gif">chart</a>) compared with electronics. Consumer preferences are often at odds with the innovative impulses of service providers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence this survey's crucial caveat. In so far as technology is changing finance, it is not because of a particular invention or insight. Rather, it is doing so when the new techniques are broadly in sympathy with how people and firms wish to conduct their financial affairs. For almost the first time, leading financial-services firms are trying to understand their customers' desires and to shape their businesses to meet them--at a suitable profit.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may mean moving into areas far removed from the traditional terrain of finance. Or it may mean breaking from traditional process-driven ways of doing things and re-examining what a financial firm actually does. This is the financial-services equivalent of "business-process re-engineering", the management fad of the early 1990s. It has the potential to change an entire commercial model. And that, after decades of false dawns, is what technology may at last be delivering.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf2.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<html><head><title>A survey of technology in finance</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><h3>A survey of technology in finance</h><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></td></tr></table><H1>The machine age</H1><P><I>Past technologies merely automated the processes of finance</I><p ><br>"THE system is used in factories of all sorts, in steel mills, by insurance companies&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;by textile mills, automobile companies, numerous railroads, municipalities and state governments. It is used for compiling labour costs, efficiency records, distribution of sales, internal requisitions for supplies and materials, production statistics, day and piece work&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;for analysing risks in life, fire and casualty insurance&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;for distributing sales and cost figures as to salesmen, department, customer, location, commodity, method of sale."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The odd archaism aside, this quote&#042; reads uncannily like a description of a 1960s mainframe computer system. In fact it dates from half a century earlier. An enthusiastic American journalist is describing the impact of the electro-mechanical punch-card machines that preceded digital computers. By 1911 Herman Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company had around 100 customers. That year Hollerith sold the firm for $2.3m and watched it merge with two other companies to become the Computer Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924 it became International Business Machines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Punch cards certainly had a huge influence on businesses of all sorts, including financial ones. Indeed, they did not become obsolete until the 1960s, when digital computers took over. The long-time prevalence of cards had a profound effect on how financial firms used technology. In part thanks to their technical limitations, computing machines were seen almost entirely as a means of automating manual processes. There was little concept of data storage (memory was primitive and expensive until the digital era), and only limited ability to compile data in forms that could be analysed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early computing systems were usually designed to be more efficient "analogues" of existing physical business systems that relied on hand-written ledgers and paper chains. Punch cards also led to an approach which took it for granted that processing would be done in batch cycles: literally the batches of cards that could be fed into machines running a single program. So the computing infrastructure of financial services mirrored its physical infrastructure. Cheque-processing systems, credit-accounting systems, even banks' general ledgers, were reproduced first in card and then in digital form. This analogue tendency persisted in the 1960s and 1970s when big firms installed mainframes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The race was now for efficiencies in processing. A new generation of managers, exemplified by John Reed of America's Citibank, extolled the virtues of process engineering and tried to import technologies from manufacturing into finance. Paper was anathema. Machines replaced clerks. But the nature of the underlying jobs was unchanged. As one senior banker explains, the first mistake that everybody made was to suppose that their existing model was the right one and that computers could be used in some way to make it more efficient.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In retrospect this is somewhat ironic. Managers knew that information was the essence of finance. Yet they built huge, expensive systems that simply dealt with processes and transactions, with no effect on how their firms captured and monitored information. Although this meant greater speed and fewer errors, it profoundly limited the impact of technology on the managers' business.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is largely because they were concentrating on aspects of finance which could confer few if any competitive advantages. Activities such as cheque processing are now rather like utilities. Reflecting that, they are fertile ground for "outsourcing" to low-cost specialist firms. Another consequence was that competitors that were slow to adopt technology were not fundamentally disadvantaged. If they stuck with manual processes, their competitive handicap was marginal rather than profound.<br><b><p>The competitive advantage of banks<br></b>Where, then, does competitive advantage in financial services lie&#063; Not in the transaction itself, perhaps; but certainly in the information typically embedded within it. What is a customer doing; how might this be different from his normal behaviour; does it expose either customer or financier to any risks which could or should be hedged&#063; These are questions that hint at where value resides. And, as we shall see, they are precisely the kinds of questions that financial managers are now, thanks to information technology, better able to answer.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Information of this type has, to be sure, always existed in finance. Firms created repositories for it intuitively and trusted that they could be used to make decisions. The repositories were not big central databases; they were people. Think of a broker's intimate knowledge of customers' investment goals and trading preferences. Or of insurance agents' grasp of the lifetime coverage needs of families. Perhaps most obvious of all, remember the local bank branch manager, whose social standing reflected his implicit lending power as well as his explicit knowledge of local connections.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By scattering these human repositories as widely as they could, banks and other financial firms built what were in effect information networks. In some cases, however, regulation forbade far-flung networks--American banks were until recently banned from branching across state lines. That made the banks more vulnerable to cyclical swings in profitability. In any case, there was seldom much of an attempt at useful aggregation of information. True, insurers built detailed models of mortality rates or theft claims. But they had little sense of whether their relationship with particular customers were profitable, or of whether the customers had bought an appropriate array of policies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lack of specific knowledge about customers combined with high distribution costs to shape financial services in another way. Financial products tended to be uniform, regardless of who bought them. Only the super-rich could afford, say, insurance that was tailored to their needs. Most people bought standard products, often paying for elements they did not need or, perhaps worse, forgoing elements they might have found useful.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extracting specific customer information from firms' process-driven systems was technically difficult and financially prohibitive--at least until recently. A big technological breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when faster and cheaper computer chips made possible the development of "middleware", or sophisticated systems that sit between mainframes and desk-top terminals and facilitate both data extraction and analysis.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The development of big relational databases also conferred an advantage on firms dealing with huge amounts of data. Falling communication costs removed another barrier to the creation of sophisticated computer networks, permitting the linking of previously disparate systems. These systems are now central to financial firms' ability to derive useful knowledge from their otherwise dumb data. Indeed, it has become <i>de rigueur </i>in some financial circles to have a "data warehouse": a somewhat misleading term for large systems for data storage and analysis.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter Carroll, a consultant with Oliver, Wyman & Company, observes that in the past banks often purged data that had been temporarily entered into their processing systems. These days they seek to "mine" it for useful nuggets. Instead of rejecting a credit-card applicant because he has no credit history, a bank might now note that he has $250,000 on deposit and issue a card after all. Rather than lose the account of a prominent local entrepreneur, a bank might choose to waive charges on his son's bouncing cheques.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some ways, this is merely an effort to replace human repositories of knowledge by machines. At another level, however, it is a huge shift in how financial firms go about their business. They are seeking to turn data into information; and then to use that information to make more profitable business decisions. These decisions could be big strategic steps, such as disposing of a business line or agreeing to a merger; or they might be tactical decisions, to re-price a product or close a branch, say.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yet, as Mr Carroll argues, the really profound impact of the shift from dumb data to usable information comes in the unglamorous area of daily operational decisions. There are three main types of operational decision (see <a href="tf3.gif">table</a>). In the past these were dictated by firm rules--people who lack a credit history make bad credit-card customers, say. But now such decisions can be informed by a richer array of knowledge. A bank can differentiate its decisions: instead of applying one iron rule to all similar customers, it can say "yes" to one customer, "no" to another, and "yes but only if" to a third.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not easy to appreciate the  For each individual decision, the financial effect may be small or even trivial. But extended to an entire customer base, the impact of such techniques could be enormous. Even without gaining a single new customer, a bank could transform its revenues by becoming better at evaluating its existing relationships. And if it could also ensure that new customers would be more likely to be profitable, the bank could cement its advantage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such techniques are not pipedreams. Several banks and insurers have experienced such improvements in limited areas of their business and are now trying broader applications. Other financial firms are also making the transition from dumb data to useful information. All of this, note, with no mention of the Internet or other high-tech frontiers. The bigger impact often comes from people using existing technology to run their businesses better--so long as their customers are prepared to go along.<br><p><Footnote>&#042;From "Computer: a History of the Information Machine".

But this quiet town was chosen for a trial launched on August 26th by one of the region's leading banks. First Union, America's sixth-largest bank with $140 billion in assets, was once a typical process-driven user of technology, according to Ed Crutchfield, the bank's boss. "But about five years ago," he says, "we switched from an inward-looking perspective to asking how all this technology was affecting our customers, and what we could do to make them like it." Now the bank is trying to change its customers' behaviour. If it succeeds, it will extend the trial to all its 2,000 branches.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Customers entering the branch in Arden, a blue collar suburb of Asheville, are greeted by a new look. The space has been redesigned, walls knocked out to create open areas and desks repositioned to seem less intimidating. Telephones link to First Union's service centre outside Charlotte, the bank's base. The branch's automated teller machines (<font size=-1>ATM</font>s) have been enhanced to offer such services as instant cheque-cashing, mini-statements of recent transactions, split deposits (the ability to send, say, $100 to one account and $50 to another while making a single deposit) and coin facilities. Customers get another dose of novelty when they are approached by a "customer relationship manager" (<font size=-1>CRM</font>), who asks what they want to do. If the transaction can be done electronically or remotely, the <font size=-1>CRM</font> politely shows the customer a faster alternative to standing in a queue for a human teller.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results are impressive. One man is waiting to deposit a cheque for $200, $50 of which he wants to transfer into his money-market account. Although he has an <font size=-1>ATM</font> card, he queues up to see a teller. Step forward the <font size=-1>CRM</font>, who telephones the First Union service centre and remotely adds the money-market account to the customer's <font size=-1>ATM</font> card. He can then do what he wants with a single visit to an <font size=-1>ATM</font>, avoiding the human teller. At one test branch, <font size=-1>ATM</font> deposits have quickly doubled their previous rates. Queues have dwindled. As Don Harrison, First Union's area manager in Asheville, jokes, he will need more <font size=-1>ATM</font>s if customers are not to be frustrated by a new kind of wait. Old ladies who had never before used an <font size=-1>ATM</font> card are suddenly enthusiastic about their technical prowess.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It may sound trivial; but that is because First Union is seeking merely to improve its use of technology that it already has. Most banks, having built their <font size=-1>ATM</font> networks, made little effort to ensure that customers actually use the machines. First Union is among a few that are trying to undo such negligence. Customers are surprised to find that they can do things faster and more conveniently. The benefit to the banks is obvious. Electronic transactions are much cheaper than people or paper-based ones; allowing for systems and personnel costs, an <font size=-1>ATM</font> transaction costs 25-30 cents, compared with $1.75 for a teller transaction.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  It is not that straightforward, however. Banks have learnt that what ultimately drives their costs is how customers behave. Instead of making a single teller withdrawal of $200, <font size=-1>ATM</font>-happy customers might make five visits to the machine, withdrawing smaller amounts each time and, oh, checking their balance for good measure. Thus, the correct cost comparison may be $1.40 against $1.75; still a saving to the bank, but a far less dramatic one.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Predicting how customers will use enhanced <font size=-1>ATM</font>s is no easy matter, either. The machines are expensive, at around $30,000 each; and their extra functions are seductive. In the Asheville trial, for instance, cheque-cashing has already proved popular, particularly among workers who are paid weekly and who formerly had to wait for their pay cheques to clear into their accounts.<p><b>Root and branch</b><br></b>First Union's Asheville trial is unusual in its scope and potential. Its encouragement to customers is part of an ambitious plan to shift 280m transactions that would have been branch-based to electronic channels by the end of the decade. That represents one-fifth of all transactions forecast by First Union over that period for the southern states of its retail-banking franchise. The bank's aim is simple: if a transaction can be done by <font size=-1>ATM</font> or telephone, that is how it should be done.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, First Union is treading cautiously. Staff in Asheville have been told that their jobs are safe, even as dwindling customer queues reduce the need for them. Yet a big chunk of the bank's assumed long-term cost savings must presumably come from lower personnel costs&#063; Not so, asserts Mr Crutchfield. "This isn't about eliminating jobs through automation; it's about using technology to generate revenue." At worst that means some branch workers being retrained as investment advisers or mortgage specialists, or as telephonists in the bank's fast-growing call service centre. "We need marketing skills far more than we need operations skills," says Mr Crutchfield.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Note that, a few enhancements aside, there is little new technology at work in Asheville. A video kiosk that provides links with specialists for complicated queries is a rare exception. The biggest benefits to the bank will accrue from getting customers to use already existing electronic channels rather than people.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other banks have gone beyond First Union's policy of gentle encouragement, by resorting to the price mechanism. KeyCorp, a Florida bank,  pays 25 cents to customers who make deposits at <font size=-1>ATM</font>s rather than use a teller. Last year First Chicago pioneered an alternative approach when it began to charge for some types of teller transactions. Earlier this year Citibank introduced a bank account that is free provided the customer does not use a teller. There is more to First Union's technology efforts than mere tinkering in branches. Mr Crutchfield has committed the bank to investing in any technology that can be expected to help customers to contact the bank without using a branch. Whether that is a home computer, a smart telephone, an <font size=-1>ATM</font> or a merchant's debit terminal, he wants First Union to have a presence. To that end Mr Crutchfield engineered a huge merger last year with First Fidelity, a New Jersey bank, arguing that First Union needed a bigger capital base if it were to afford the growing bill for technology investment. (See <a href="tf4.gif">chart</a>)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The business logic is persuasive. If banks that use technology more widely and intelligently than their rivals can both realise more value from existing customers and make them happier, they will worry less about losing them--and they may even attract new ones. To take an example, First Union has used the power of new technology to develop what seems a peculiar line of business for a bank: relocation services. (See <a href="tf5.gif">chart</a>)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around 15% of America's households move house each year, routinely closing bank accounts and laboriously opening new ones at a different bank in their new town. First Union used to lose the business of more than 80% of customers who were moving. Then, in 1991, the bank started a small business which had two main goals: to keep the business of more customers who were moving, and to win a large share of the business of people moving into the bank's own region. Using government statistics, First Union creates computer models of patterns of migration. It has also built a network of information suppliers who provide leads on households that might be about to move.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retention efforts were concentrated on trying to predict which customers are about to move, and offering help with their relocation. Many can be directed towards a First Union branch in their new area or to its own telephone banking service. The bank now loses many fewer customers than it did. Its pitch to newcomers to its area is even more striking. As well as opening a bank account and preprinting cheques for them, the bank liaises with local utility companies to ensure that services are connected before the new customers arrive in their homes. Last year, First Union helped to relocate 40,000 households. This year, by the end of September it had already helped another 70,000 to move. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The financial impact of such techniques is significant. In addition to its relocation business, the bank now has a direct sales force that uses information about customers to predict their likely needs. Letters (1.2m of them last year) are generated from individual sales agents offering customers a product or service. First Union estimates that in 1995 it acquired new business worth $1.2 billion this way.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These efforts are part of a broader trend to tailor products and services to individuals rather than to mass markets. Smart banks (and insurers) no longer roll out a new product and try to sell it to every customer. Rather, they assess each customer and ask what he or she might need. Over time, they create a picture of each customer that allows them to market their services more effectively.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early September, for instance, Hurricane Edouard veered ominously towards some of First Union's biggest markets in the Carolinas. If the winds hit home, there would be massive disruption, followed by the chaos of insurance claims. First Union knew that many customers might face temporary financial difficulties. Thanks to its data system, the bank was able to send every account holder living in the hurricane's path a letter reassuring them that it would be understanding. "The only limits to this technology are our imaginations," says one enthusiastic First Union manager. It is a message that is also beginning to affect banks' biggest business of all: lending money.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf4.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

It was a humiliating experience, brought about by years of ill-disciplined lending. "There were three things wrong with our corporate-loan portfolio," says Martin Taylor, who joined the bank in 1993 as its chief executive. "We grew it too fast, so we lost quality; we priced our lending wrongly; and we allowed huge industry concentrations."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even before its nadir, Barclays was taking steps to improve its lending methods. In 1991 it started to build a computer system to support its lending staff by providing them with information and analytics. The project was motivated less by awareness of the gaping holes in the bank's portfolio (that was to dawn only a year or so later) than by frustration that some lenders were obviously much better at the job than others. Barclays had tried extensive training programmes, but wanted to capture more of the best practice of its loan officers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "We wanted a system which would allow us to do a structured financial analysis of our customers," says Brian Fowler, head of credit in Barclays' business-banking operation. The result was Lending Adviser, a software system which the bank had purchased and then extensively customised. It was tested in two branches before being installed throughout Barclays' business banking network during 1994. The system became fully operational in June 1995. Mr Fowler, who was the senior project manager for Lending Adviser, admits that he had initial doubts. "There was a real danger that we did not fully understand the technology we were implementing," he says. "At the very least I felt that it would require cultural changes in the bank if it were to succeed."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the old Barclays lending paradigm, individual lenders acted at local level, triggering referrals up the hierarchy only if they wanted to make loans that would exceed their pre-set limits. So-called "exceptions" were passed first to regional offices and then to head office, where they were dealt with by specialist credit staff. By the time a proposal reached the specialists, it had implicitly been approved further down the hierarchy, encouraging the credit specialists to look for reasons not to make the loan. The bank had no uniform view of a potential loan's riskiness. Indeed, because lenders were trying to "sell" proposals to the institution, that riskiness was greater than anyone realised.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This had several effects. First, individual lenders assumed what Mr Taylor calls a "binary" mindset. Each decision was formulated along the hard lines of whether a given individual would repay or not. "That's fine if you make only one loan in your life," says Mr Taylor. "But if you are a bank and you are making hundreds and thousands of loans, then the right question to ask is 'what is the chance that this loan will be repaid&#063;'--a crucial difference."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nowadays, every potential loan is, with the help of Lending Adviser, marked with a grade that assigns the proposal to one of ten categories separated by perceived riskiness and the likelihood of default. Adding lots of those chances together (that is, making a portfolio) gives the bank a statistical basis for evaluating both individual lending decisions and its overall loan book.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another effect of the old lending system was to make it hugely vulnerable to the attitudes of its central credit specialists. Barclays hit trouble partly because in the late 1980s its lending was growing at an annual compound rate of 25-30%, whereas Britain's <font size=-1>GDP</font> in money terms was not even growing half as fast. This happened largely because the bank's board had signalled an era of growth in an effort to reclaim Barclays' position as Britain's biggest bank. The credit specialists got the message--and switched off their risk antennae. The furious lending that followed, much of it to property companies, led directly to the bank's subsequent write-offs.<br><b><p>Co-operation, not conflict<br></b>Lending Adviser was a conscious break with established procedures. Significantly, it did away with the laborious paper process by which loan proposals reached head office. Moreover, it was incompatible with the bank's old command-and-control management hierarchy. Exceptions are now sent electronically from their point of origin to the bank's credit managers. So-called loan sanctioners at the centre now view the same information as the would-be lender in the field, co-operating with the lender to come to a decision about a proposal.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system was not an instant hit with all of Barclays' lenders. Despite some fancy software, Lending Adviser remains somewhat clunky. It takes time to load a business's details on to the system so that its financial prospects can be analysed. At the outset, staff complained about the long wait before they could achieve anything useful. But this complaint proved short-lived, says Mr Fowler. Once information has been entered into Lending Adviser, it can be manipulated with remarkable speed. Financial ratios are calculated in an instant; "what if" scenarios model a firm's financial condition under varying assumptions, so as to probe for possible weaknesses. "The system", says Mr Fowler, "highlights the risks of each business, which is helpful to our customers as well as to us."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each time a customer is visited, the new information goes into a central file, so Barclays as an institution has a much clearer idea of the state of its loan portfolio than it did in the past. For instance, the bank can monitor how many of its borrowers might slip to a riskier grade. That knowledge can help it to plan its provisions against bad debts with greater accuracy. It can also price its lending to reflect its view of borrowers' riskiness. And the bank can use the information consciously to direct its lending away from particular risk grades. Because Barclays' loan book represents some 90,000 companies, it is a reasonable proxy for the state of the British economy. If its borrowers' finances are slipping, the chances are that the economy is slowing-- which would certainly shape lending policies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for the industry concentrations that so bedevilled the bank, these too can be avoided with Lending Adviser. Each borrower is classified by industry type, so it is a simple matter to calculate the bank's exposure in particular sectors. The bank can also be more selective and responsive in its lending. In time it might even be able to identify some of the things that distinguish its best lenders from the rest. It could then tweak its culture yet again to reinforce what it thinks are sound habits.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this would have been impossible a few years ago. The bank had massive amounts of credit information, but only primitive mechanisms for pooling and collating it. True, Lending Adviser cannot do everything: it does not tell a lender that a particular loan should be sanctioned, nor does it tell managers precisely where the British economy stands in the economic cycle. But it does offer a tool for making better judgments based upon information the bank already has.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barclays is not the only, or even the first, bank to have tried to codify the best elements of its lending culture by using information technology. But it is a striking example of how the introduction of technology into a previously established system can lead to significant, and often unexpected, cultural and operational changes. Whether the technology has also laid the ground for sounder lending policies will become clearer over the coming years.<p><b>Automatic pilot</B><br></b>One important change can already be noted. Aided by Lending Adviser, Barclays has fundamentally changed its business model for lending. Its central aim is no longer to lend as much as possible on the basis of its capital; but rather to lend only as it should according to its risk-pricing disciplines-- and to let that determine how much capital the bank needs. This new approach explains, for instance, the recent trend of share buy-backs among banks who realise they need less capital to make loans. Its significance, to banking and to the financing of industry, can hardly be overstated.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another example of how technology has penetrated to the heart of banks' lending business can be found in America. In recent years there has been much talk of disintermediation, under which competitive and technological changes do away with the need for established intermediaries. Banks have seen much of their business slip away, whether lending to companies that now tap capital markets direct, or gathering retail deposits that now pour into mutual and money-market funds.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there was one area of banking that was supposed to be immune from such change: lending to small businesses. The reason was that the information required to make a success of such lending could be gathered only locally. Banks' branch networks apparently gave them an unassailable advantage over distant would-be lenders, while the customers were intrinsically too small to have direct access to the capital markets.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now a new surge of small-business banking is changing this. With banks such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America in the vanguard, new techniques are breaking down barriers erected by geography. They are based upon lessons learnt from running huge portfolios of consumer loans, whether in credit-card operations or in more straightforward financings. The trick is to focus on volume and canny pricing rather than specific information. A small-business bank has a portfolio of loans, some of which can be expected to default. Instead of gathering detailed local information and hoping to exclude a good proportion of likely defaulters, why not use new technology to price a portfolio of national loans so that the bank can be indifferent to which particular borrowers will default&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea is powerfully seductive to customers. Rather than go through lengthy and detailed loan applications locally, they can respond to solicitations for pre-approved lines of credit and have the finance in a matter of hours. They may pay a bit more in interest charges. But they gain a precious commodity for any harried small employer: time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for the lenders, they incur none of the costs of a national presence--direct mail is a fine way to reach potential borrowers--and only a fraction of the costs of processing more detailed loan applications. Last year, for instance, Wells Fargo mailed some 5m loan solicitations in America. The forms asked only a few key questions designed to elicit relevant facts about the borrower: for example, a history of poor personal credit usually signals an undesirable business customer. The simplicity cuts processing costs to a minimum. So long as the bank gets its credit assessment and pricing right, then it should make money. In 1995 Wells Fargo earned a 32% return on equity on its small-business lending.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf5.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

The eponymous stockbroking firm he founded in 1974 was intended to take advantage of America's scrapping of fixed commissions in securities trading. He believed that consumers would be enticed by cut-price dealing. And he embraced technology and remote service-delivery as the means to a lower cost base. "We were a pure transaction company," he recalls.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For more than two decades Mr Schwab has had the satisfaction of watching his firm grow at an annual compound rate of more than 20%. It now has more than 3.8m active investor accounts. Yet Mr Schwab is not complacent. He declares recent technological developments to be miraculous. Innovations such as the Internet, voice recognition and faster communications have transformed what his and other firms can do for their customers. "For every call we get to do a transaction, we now get ten wanting some other service," says Mr Schwab.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rush of new services has been remarkable. An individual armed with a personal computer and modem can gain access to an astonishing array of price information and analytical software, often by tapping into a single Internet site. Much of the information that is now given away free of charge was only recently the privileged domain of giant financial firms and markets. This year has seen a race among brokers to offer on-line electronic share dealing services: e.Schwab now vies with, among others, e.trade and Lombard, two "virtual" discount-broking firms. Nowhere, it seems, is the shape of the future of finance more obvious.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pause for a moment, however. Charles Schwab was among the first of a new class of stockbrokers in the mid-1970s, the so-called discounters, which undercut the high charges imposed by established full service firms with their networks of brokers and their expensive research base. Not surprisingly, given their low prices, they quickly found a dedicated following. Nearly two decades later, however, discounters have a share of the retail market of only around 25% (big institutions still deal predominantly with full-service firms, though they often get discounted prices from them).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for the discounters' failure to take over the retail market completely is nothing to do with technological shortcomings. Mr Schwab first offered an on-line trade order service more than a decade ago: "It was a horse and buggy compared to today's Internet services," he concedes, "but it worked." Yet it was not widely taken up. Many retail customers did not own a computer until recently, so were unimpressed by such a high-tech service: a case, perhaps, of cart before modem.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather, discounters have had limited success because they have focused on a commodity service, executing trades, that appealed strongly only to a minority of self-confident investors. Most retail customers wanted some advice as well as execution; that is why many remained with their traditional, more expensive, brokers, including Wall Street giants such as Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney.<p><b>A tidy bundle</b><br>These firms justify higher charges by offering such products as investment research and a personal relationship with a broker alongside order execution. That business model has proved just as resilient as that of bank branches. Mr Schwab, for one, does not expect it suddenly to dwindle. He is moving his firm up-market, away from straight execution and towards more valuable services such as investment planning and performance analytics.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because plenty of investors prefer traditional methods for making their trades, just as plenty of bank customers still wander into branches to write paper cheques, firms such as Schwab and Quick & Reilly themselves envisage keeping a blend of access points, mixing branches, 24-hour telephone centres and direct computer links. On-line accounts represent only around 1% of the total American brokerage market, reckons Diogo Teixeira of The Tower Group, a consulting firm. But, like many brokers, he thinks that the computer will take an increasing share.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Therein lies an important clue about how the business of stockbroking may develop. Accept that execution is akin to cheque-processing in banking: a necessary utility function that adds little value. How, then, can brokers make money&#063; One answer might be to control access to a vital ingredient such as price information. Organised financial exchanges and brokers have long known this. As Jay Smith, founder of Leading Market Technologies, a financial software firm, comments, "Many exchanges have in effect taxed access to price information rather than trading activity or volume."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But computer networks such as the Internet defy any institution's ability to monopolise information. In America upstart firms such as Quote.com already provide a bewildering array of information in return for a minuscule monthly subscription fee. Even the crusty London Stock Exchange has discovered the power of networking. Earlier this year it lost a court battle to prohibit real time electronic dissemination of its prices by Tradepoint, a rival share-trading organisation with little more than a few computers to its name (and which still has few trades to its credit). The whole point of network computing is that it costs almost nothing to distribute information.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That means that intermediaries such as stockbrokers must add value in some other way if they are to be useful to their customers. Logic points to those areas into which Mr Schwab and his sort are moving: financial planning, research and analysis.<br><b><p>Spot the difference<br></b>Discounters such as Quick & Reilly already offer investment software of astonishing power and flexibility. These days, offering customers analytics and access via a computer is seen as a standard service for brokers in America. As Peter Quick, president of Quick & Reilly, says, "The point is to make life easier for our customers." There is little to choose between their products and those of their more expensive rivals.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, in recent months those rivals have reluctantly felt bound to follow their competitors into cyberspace. In April Prudential Securities launched an on-line service allowing customers to review their accounts, check prices and exchange e mail with their stockbroker. Merrill Lynch launched a similar service last month. Neither allows investors to enter trading instructions remotely, however; orders must still be keyed in by a stockbroker.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, this jockeying is helping to erode any meaningful distinction between discount and full-service broking, reckons Ken Landes, a consultant with Coopers & Lybrand. If execution and price information are increasingly low-value commodity businesses, and if most brokers can offer snazzy software, what else might justify high brokers' fees&#063; Only two things spring to mind: research (that is, investment ideas) and better products (that is, proprietary funds or software analytics).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Plenty of investors might then ask an obvious question. What is, say, excellent research worth in itself&#063; That could be the key to unbundling traditional full-service broking. And if it is unbundled for retail customers, why not for institutional ones too&#063; There has already been pressure for more transparency, for instance over "soft" commissions which involve brokers giving computers and so forth to favoured clients.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Traditional firms with their heavy fixed costs will no doubt fight to keep customers in their traditional relationships. They may even use the same technologies that their competitors see as the key to their undoing. A traditional stockbroker often neglected some of his clients simply because he lacked the ability to keep track of more than, say, 40 people. Something as simple as e-mail can change that, according to Doug Alexander, president of Reality Online, a software firm: "Technology helps brokers to communicate faster and more easily with personalised e-mail for, say, a research idea on a share in which the customer has previously expressed interest." Add some modern portfolio tracking systems, and a diligent stockbroker might be able to manage the affairs of 300 people, not 40.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, as discount brokers have already discovered, investors change their habits only slowly, even when they are offered what appears to be a compelling deal. That is why, in the end, Mr Schwab is among those who are wary of predicting the speedy demise of traditional broking: "Change won't happen overnight, mostly because many more people have to understand that they now have new choices." Coopers' Mr Landes, however, thinks that the arrival of mature networking technology has fundamentally altered the economics of broking. He predicts traumatic competitive convulsions in the next few years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both men could be correct. Thanks to the impact of technology, stockbroking seems sure to change in major ways. Thanks to people and their persistent habits, it is hard to predict the timing of technology's impact. Thus, the idea of fully automated agents running people's portfolios in linked electronic financial markets may not be far-fetched; it is merely far off. How far off is hard to gauge. But judging by the speed with which the Internet is growing, it may be nearer than you might think.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf6.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

But the rapid evolution of cyberspace is recognised by most people as a change of great significance. In the space of a few weeks, firms have gone from obscurity to worldwide fame and riches. Spin-offs, start-ups, alliances, takeovers: all have been seen of late in the muddled and colliding worlds of virtual and terrestrial financial services.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the importance of cyberspace for finance cannot be assessed in isolation from the physical world. Is Security First, a pioneering virtual bank, a threat to Citibank, an established global consumer franchise&#063; Is Microsoft a potential rival or a necessary ally of today's banks&#063; Should Merrill Lynch and its sort fear Wit Capital, a cyberspace investment bank that is helping small companies to raise capital without paying fat fees to a Wall Street underwriter&#063; Does InsWeb, a virtual insurance marketplace, signal the end of the human insurance agent&#063; Will Mondex, a digital cash system, lose out to Visa's smart cards&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such questions are among many raised by the obvious potential of electronic networks to upset the economics of today's sales and distribution mechanisms in finance. Secure information distribution is the key to cost-cutting. Smarter use of information is the key that will unlock new revenues. Firms that can successfully combine the two have a good future. Pure intermediaries will have a much more difficult time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One problem is that nobody knows how the economics of cyberspace will develop. How will people behave&#063; Cyber-stores have discovered that consumers are happier buying some things than others. Wine and books sell; general household goods do not. Houses are scarcely in the picture, although cars have found a niche. Financial products are now making their appearance, with bank accounts and insurance policies at the forefront.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until people in large numbers exhibit preferences, what should would-be electronic salesmen do&#063; Usage of the Internet is growing fast, and its users are better-off, better-educated and younger than the average American (see <a href="tf6.gif">chart</a>), with all that promises for new business opportunities. But it will probably be a decade before the Net really counts. Security First, America's first federally insured virtual financial institution, is a case in point. From a standing start in October 1995 its deposits have shot up to around $14m this year. One analyst predicts that even a gradual slowdown to a merely opulent rather than explosive growth rate would still take its deposits to $400m by the beginning of 1999. But even then, the bank will scarcely dent America's existing banking market.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So those who would serve customers in cyberspace--whether as payment processors, credit-card brands or digital-money providers--all face a horrid dilemma. They know that if they race too fast to build infrastructures they might simply repeat past investment mistakes in technology. But they also know that cyberspace will eventually be like the real world, in that it will have room only for a few widely accepted and fungible systems. Most of today's names will surely lose out.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Financial-services firms are not good at coping with rapid change--or an uncertain future. Lewis Levin, who runs Microsoft's desk-top finance business, reckons that change so far has rattled many financial firms and caused them to look in the wrong direction for their competitors. "There has been plenty of sniping by financial institutions about technology companies trying to come into their business. But the real battle is between financial firms, some of which are already netting big gains from being better at deploying technology."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Levin is sceptical about the ability and desire of technology firms to compete with, say, banks: "Is Microsoft going to lend money&#063; Not likely. Will it try to gather assets&#063; I don't think so. Or manage assets&#063; Ditto. These are other firms' core skills." Scott Cook, chairman of Intuit, a leading financial software firm, echoes this view, noting that "lower distribution costs will have a dramatic effect on economics and on how and where people buy financial services. But the effect on whom you buy from will be less radical."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The banks are moving in. Already some 300 American banks have Internet sites; that number is expected to triple by next year and to double again by 1999. But, partly thanks to concerns about security on the Internet, only a few are offering more than information and simple inquiry facilities. Solutions to the security problem may continue to hold up Internet banking, though only for a short time. Within five years, a few hundred firms will be offering full banking services on the Internet.<br><b><p>Phoning home<br></b>One much-touted vision is that the Internet offers a chance to solve a long-standing problem: paying bills electronically. A pure electronic medium is technically and financially attractive for both billers and payers. However, as Bill Gorog, chairman of <font size=-1>US</font> Order, a specialist technology firm, points out, "There are already 30m people in America who use touch-tone telephones to check their account balances. If you want to encourage use of electronic channels for bill payments, then the telephone is already in most people's homes."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A new generation of smart telephones is appearing, pushed by telephone companies hoping that customers will buy additional services such as caller identification. These telephones contain a keyboard and enough computing power to ensure that a decade ago they would have passed for home computers. They can be used for everything from telephony to checking the weather forecast, trading shares and paying bills. And it is simple to equip them with a slot for reading and writing information on to a credit card equipped with a computer chip of its own. That information might be no more than a credit-card balance. But there is no reason why it should not be digital money. (See <a href="tf7.gif">chart</a>)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a natural combination of devices and explains why many observers think that the telephone will probably become an increasingly important channel for financial services. Some 40m telephones are sold annually in America. A range of super-smart telephones will reach shops later this year, selling for a fraction of the price of a home computer. The Internet must thus be set in some context. As Diogo Teixeira, of The Tower Group, comments, "Major event though it is, the Internet is only a small proportion of overall electronic channels in financial services."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider Britain, where Direct Line, a telephone-based insurer, grew from nothing to dominate the car-insurance market in the space of a few years; and First Direct, a telephone bank, served customers so much better than traditional banks that it changed the whole industry. Sharelink, a telephone stockbroker that fell on hard times and has since been acquired by Charles Schwab, also had a big initial impact on its industry. Internet firms might have similar effects in years to come. But until computers are in every home, they will fight against other mass electronic channels.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is indeed plenty of room for those other channels to increase their impact on financial services. Mr Gorog says that electronic bill-payment is at a similar stage to electronic credit-card authorisations in the early 1980s. The technical solution was available as early as 1981; it brought down the cost of an authorisation to 15 cents, compared with 55 cents for the manual process. Yet, reluctant to invest in equipment, banks and merchants took years to embrace the electronic channel, delaying its ubiquity until the late 1980s.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly today, there are few technological barriers to electronic payments. But there are quirky hurdles of the kind that often slow down progress. For instance, behind many supposed "electronic" bill-payment services stand armies of cheque-writers who generate the paper payments that must reach billers. The reason&#063; Many billers are reluctant to accept electronic payments because their systems are built around capturing customer information from the magnetic ink printed on cheques. Firms such as <font size=-1>US</font> Order are finding a ready market for computers designed to stand between billers and such payment networks as those owned by Visa and MasterCard, translating instructions into forms acceptable to both sides. Meanwhile the postal system remains clogged with bills moving back and forth.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet, then, is likely to be only one of several channels through which customers do electronic business with financial-service providers. Its existence has certainly accelerated the development of electronic payments systems, although these are being designed to work across several channels rather than solely in cyberspace. As Intuit's Mr Cook concludes, "We're probably talking about a decade or two before we will see significantly new ways of doing things."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one crucial respect, however, the Internet remains different from what has gone before. It is the medium which is helping to make information available in previously opaque industries. It allows people (including those who run financial firms) to compare prices and providers, to scrutinise what once they would have meekly accepted. In time it will probably develop into a formidable marketplace in which digital money, paperless transactions and instant flows of information combine in compelling simplicity.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possibility raised by the sudden ubiquity of cheap and immediate price information is that exchanges will increasingly find themselves out of a job. Some firms, such as Merrill Lynch and Fidelity, are so large that they almost constitute exchanges themselves. In America, electronic systems such as Instinet (a subsidiary of Reuters) that automatically match buy and sell orders have found ready acceptance by large institutional investors. The tiny Arizona Stock Exchange is an electronic securities market which fails to match 95% of the orders placed there, but which has minimal operating costs and recently opened a window on to the Internet. It is a small leap to imagine financial markets that directly connect buyers and sellers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, exchanges offer one vital advantage over existing electronic markets: liquidity. The ability to deal in rough market conditions is a crucial one to investors and is the one feature guaranteed by the professionals who trade on exchanges. With reduced liquidity, investors face far greater uncertainty. In itself, the ability to see prices is a welcome innovation. But it does not outweigh the reassurance of the ability to deal in bad times.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, in time, exchanges themselves have the option of dismantling their physical infrastructure and moving the liquidity they represent into cyberspace. If new electronic competitors appear which, by attracting sufficient business, threaten entire physical markets, then this may well be what happens. But this is likely to be a gradual process.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just exchanges that are challenged by the rise of the Internet and other electronic ways of doing business. So are their regulators. Indeed, regulatory interference is easily the greatest threat to the potential of electronic commerce and finance. Cyberspace will need regulation in some form, if only in its legal codes and transaction protocols that will require trusted referees. It would be a shame, however, if today's regulators hindered tomorrow's markets by jumping in before they understand what they are doing.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf7.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<H1>War on Wall Street</H1>

<P><I>Firms are running an intellectual arms races</I><p >

<br>WHEN it comes to technology, a restructured bank branch or a broker's cool Web site are at the low end of the spectrum. For the fancy stuff, visit one of Wall Street's trading rooms. Amid the din and bustle it is striking that machines are omnipresent: telephones for barking orders, screens for watching data, televisions for absorbing news.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only a few years ago, trading rooms were still relatively primitive. Many consisted of little more than banks of desks with telephones, each with a screen hired expensively from a data provider such as Reuters or Telerate. Traders scribbled orders on paper slips that were passed to back office for confirmation and settlement. Because market data was costly, only big firms could afford to buy it. They competed with gusto, buying mainframe computers and manipulating masses of data to try to create a trading advantage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These days, high finance has gone high-tech. Data is much cheaper. Vendors such as Reuters, Knight-Ridder and Bloomberg allow firms to feed all their information into open computer systems. There it can be analysed at will. Mathematicians and quantum physicists have taken seats once occupied by seat-of-the-pants barrow boys. Head traders talk fondly of their "black boxes", proprietary engines that run trading portfolios of great complexity. Some trading rooms have gone so far as to automate order flows; J.P. Morgan's equity trading works in a seamless electronic environment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Over the past decade trading instruments have multiplied too. Derivatives have gone from obscurity to ubiquity (with occasional infamy along the way). Swaps, already a big business by the mid 1980s, have since exploded into an enormous one and are now indispensable to corporate finance. Financial firms are using improved telecommunications to run their operations continuously, passing trading positions from one time-zone to another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These changes have sent powerful shocks into other financial businesses. Fund management, for instance, has been turned upside down by derivatives, for these allow managers to do such unprecedented things as hedging specific bets, investing internationally or tying their fortunes to a stockmarket index. Funds can invest in a much wider variety of liquid assets than a few years ago using a technique known as "securitisation" that pools assets such as credit-card receivables into securities that can be sold to investors.On the face of it, it might seem that technology has already had its biggest impact on Wall Street. Not so, says Jay Smith, whose firm, Leading Market Technologies, supplies analytical software for traders. As the advantage of simply owning data has shrunk, firms have embraced a "smart weapons" strategy in search of the best applications. Hence the huge demand for people skilled at analysing data sets. "There is an arms race among a financial elite," says Mr Smith. "The weapons range from hiring the best quantitative brains to building the most flexible and helpful software platforms."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One effect has been that big financial firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have acquired huge appetites for both historical and real time data. Increasingly, they are building high speed databanks on their own premises and asking vendors to supply them with entire databases.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What they do with all this data provides another reason for thinking that technology has far from run its course in Wall Street. By analysing price series, firms hope to find relationships that link one asset's future performance to another's. They also test statistical properties such as price volatility-- not hard for a single fixed-rate bond, but tricky for a 30-year mortgage bond, and devilish for an entire portfolio of such instruments. These efforts may be part of a complex attempt to model how a financial market works, or how a portfolio might respond to changes in interest rates. That takes a phenomenal amount of computing power.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The detail of what big trading firms do may be daunting, but the principle is less so. Financial models represent the intellectual software of finance. The model-builders are trying to write programs that confer a competitive advantage over other firms. Advantage was once derived by getting data faster than rivals. These days, the advantage lies in the brainpower and associated computing power that firms can mobilise. It is no longer the receipt of data that determines which firm uses it most profitably; instead it might be how quickly a firm spots a pricing anomaly hiding in a data series. Wall Street firms vie with military defence laboratories not just for the brightest <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font>s, but also for the lead in technologies that make possible the easy visualisation of large amounts of data.
<br><b><p>The risk factor

<br></b>The spread of ever more sophisticated high technology across Wall Street offers one big reason for concluding that intellectual progress in finance is far from slowing down. Indeed, there are signs of the opposite. Modern finance is based upon a body of theory invented largely since the second world war.  But most of the theory's neat equations make assumptions that are impossible in the real world, so there is a constant tension between the theoretical underpinnings and the daily practice of finance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One area where this tension has been fruitful is that of risk management. As firms have built huge trading operations, they have assumed complex interlocking exposures. Some financial instruments, particularly options, are notoriously difficult to price, simple formulae notwithstanding. Yet a firm might hold a trading book made up of thousands of different options. Assuming that it can aggregate its positions across possibly dozens of different trading books, what is its overall risk&#063; The answer clearly calls for both technical and computational skills. But it also requires a judgmental sense of risk that can differ from one institution to another. This has proved a catalyst for a new revolution in finance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ron Dembo, who runs Algorithmics, a specialist risk-management software firm based in Toronto, is among those bridging the divide between financial theory and practice. He questions some established risk-management techniques, particularly a common approach known as Value at Risk (<font size=-1>VAR</font>). <font size=-1>VAR</font> was embraced by bankers and their regulators because it offers a measure of a firm's overall exposure to market risk. And it is indeed useful for understanding how much a given instrument or portfolio might lose or gain over a period of time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But according to Mr Dembo, <font size=-1>VAR</font> has several serious drawbacks. One is that it relies heavily on past volatility as a guide to future volatility. Yet this has been shown to be a poor predictor of a portfolio's actual behaviour. A second objection is that the technique is of limited use at a strategic level, for it does not allow meaningful comparisons across financial markets and is therefore no help for the allocation of capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To understand this, consider two trading desks, each with a standard measured <font size=-1>VAR</font> of $10m. One desk deals in New Zealand equities, the other in American Treasuries. Are these operations equally risky&#063; Certainly not, says Mr Dembo. Each market is different, not least in liquidity. The future behaviour of risk factors (yields, correlations) and their volatility also differs in each market. In other words, risk depends on more than just historic correlations: it depends on the period over which it is measured and the trader's corresponding assessment of, say, a market's liquidity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This problem is familiar to fund managers. To measure performance across markets they long ago invented benchmarks, typically an index, which reflect the peculiarities of each market. Mr Dembo argues that traders should be measured similarly; it so happens that Algorithmics has built software to do just this. In every market there is an almost riskless trade that will yield a small but positive return. That trade should be a natural benchmark against which a trader's actual transactions can be measured. Obviously if a firm chooses a benchmark trade with a high expected return, then a trader must assume more risk if he is to perform in line. Thus this approach recognises different appetites for risk. And it captures otherwise elusive factors such as liquidity risk and how this varies over time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Algorithmics' conceptual breakthrough was to realise that many of the benchmarks adopted by businesses (including financial ones) are too inflexible to be good measures of either risk or performance. For instance, many firms adopt a fixed target for annual return on equity. Yet an appropriate measure should recognise that changing market conditions can mean that what was a fine return at one moment might be poor at another. A useful benchmark should reflect that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best way to measure traders' performance across different markets is to measure them against the different benchmarks appropriate to those markets. The consequences of doing this with <font size=-1>VAR</font> are profound. For one thing, a trading operation can construct performance measures and comparisons that make it easier to assess individuals as well as to run the business with the right amount of capital. That is a crucial step in risk management, for firms today still have little clear idea of whether they are allocating too little capital (perhaps exposing themselves to ruin) or too much (wasting resources).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, it redefines risk, for risk now becomes the risk of underperforming the benchmark. Mr Dembo calls this Benchmark Value at Risk (<font size=-1>B-VAR</font>). Because it is based on guessing and then formalising sensible likely future courses for each benchmark, it is a mixture of the judgmental and the quantitative that mirrors the real world far better than approaches that do little more than extrapolate the past into the future.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is insights such as Mr Dembo's which support this survey's claim that finance's intellectual revolution is still in its early phases. Some will argue that this "software" is not technology at all, but simple evidence of human ingenuity. However, none of it would be possible without the broader infrastructure of modern technology. And in so far as it relies upon fast and reliable computation as its practical foundation, intellectual software is inseparable from the microchips which give it life.

As well as a talking shop, it is a laboratory, devised by Andersen Consulting, that offers an evolving display of new financial technologies. Visiting managers can thrill at a futuristic Internet shopping mall, gawp at a smart phone on the back of an airline seat, watch a high tech call-centre being put through its paces. Gathered in one place, the technology is impressive. So is the message it conveys. Where once each new box of financial technology tricks was a stand-alone marvel, the emphasis now is on how things fit together. Customers are a constant presence. How will this instrument be used&#063; By how many&#063; How can this tool improve what our business offers&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As this survey has shown, the scope of technology in finance is immense. And looking beyond its extensive and fast-growing use by finance, technology is now fundamentally changing the way that business is run. Suddenly and at different rates, geographies are breaking down, business models are eroding, and customers are acquiring new power. Firms that have embraced technology are seeing their businesses shift in unpredicted directions as benefits accrue in unexpected ways. How machines are used is generally far more important than the technical niceties of this model or manufacturer versus that one.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some common themes stand out. The ability to store and manipulate data has become a key competitive weapon, putting dumb data-processing in the shade. Capital, which used to define banks' ability to lend, now limits only their ability to invest in ways to lend more intelligently. Firms such as Citibank fret more about whether their credit-card data systems are up to scratch than about the size of their balance sheets. Physical networks, which used to define insurers' and brokers' reach, have been thrown into turmoil by virtual alternatives that can be delivered down telephone and modem lines. Established financial brands are under threat from unlikely rivals, such as supermarkets and consumer goods firms, as well as from technologically savvier newcomers. Mathematics has moved from being an eccentric companion to being an essential helpmate of modern finance.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the implications of oMoreover, the implications of one industry's changes go far beyond its boundaries. As financial firms discover and improve new ways of conducting commerce, their efforts will spread across entire economies. Money in all its forms is capitalism's essential lubricant. More efficient uses and transmissions of money are not ends in themselves. Banks that can lend better may alter the behaviour of customers who can borrow better. Clamour from small investors who want venture-capital returns will alter how companies fund themselves, and perhaps alter the nature of ownership. Better risk management will strengthen firms' defences, but might also allow them to use capital more efficiently, producing inflation-free economic benefits. Developing countries that can buy off-the-shelf electronic stock exchanges might unleash social changes far faster than anyone predicts. Cheap electronic channels and the automation of benefit and health-care systems may allow poor people a chance to bank and The convergence of powerful information and communications technologies is the enabling force for all of this. But it is how people behave that will ultimately be the decisive force shaping how the finance industry changes. As finance is digitised, each and every one of its products will be expressed in binary code, including money itself. Customers should benefit from that change. The business battle for the future will then be how to turn all those digits into dollars.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h3> A survey of Britain's new politics</h>

<H1>All Tories now </H1>

<P><I>Labour and the Tories have much in common these days. For one thing,
neither party offers Britain the ideas it needs </I><p >

MUCH should be at stake in Britain's forthcoming general election. The
Conservative Party has been in power for the past 17 years, first under
Margaret Thatcher, then under John Major, and the country has changed profoundly
as a result. Now the long Tory reign seems about to end. A revitalised
Labour Party, led by Tony Blair, offers a new vision, and has a commanding
lead in the opinion polls. Politics is uncertain, of course--in 1992 the
polls confidently predicted a Labour victory--but such is Labour's lead
this time, such the Tories' unpopularity, that it would be remarkable rather
than merely surprising if Mr Major were returned to Downing Street.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, therefore, the next election will indeed mark a turning-point
in British politics, no less than the election that first brought Margaret
Thatcher to power? Until recently, Labour was unelectable; now it seems
unstoppable. But whichever party wins, voters are about to choose for the
first time in nearly 20 years between electorally viable yet strongly contrasting
ideas about how the country should be governed. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how it ought to be. If you take the parties strictly at their
word, however, it isn't so. Judged by what the Tories have done and by
what Labour promises to do, surprisingly little appears to be at stake.
Voters, it seems, will soon be asked to choose between five more years
of conservatism under John Major and five more years of conservatism under
Tony Blair. What makes New Labour unstoppable is that it has turned Tory.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Blair's admirers would say that this is nonsense. New Labour, they
point out, repudiates the Tories' record. Mr Blair says that the Conservatives
have spent their time in power not merely governing badly but &quot;tearing
apart the fabric of the nation&quot;. Tory policies have favoured the lucky
few. The less fortunate, those least able to take care of themselves, have
paid the price. Public services have been starved of resources; the welfare
state has come under withering attack. The Tories stand for ruthless individualism;
man's better instincts, his need for community and for social cohesion,
have been denied or denigrated. Slavish regard for market forces has replaced
industrial policy. The rights of workers have been trampled. Britain's
manufacturing industries have shrivelled. Privatisation was a fraud on
taxpayers and consumers. The rich have prospered: the poor, the hopeless,
the insecure and the unemployed have multiplied. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain, says Labour, has become a coarser and crueller place. The Tories
have diminished the country economically and morally. What will New Labour
do? It will start to put all this right. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Labour's description of the Tory legacy were true, and if Labour
really meant to do something about it, drastic measures would indeed be
required. The distance between the Tories' policies and Labour's radical
new alternative would be great. The fate of the country really would hinge
on the next election. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider Mr Blair's most definitive statement of policy to date:
&quot;New Labour, New Life for Britain&quot;, the party's provisional manifesto.
Acknowledging--no, emphasising--that Labour used to make promises that
neither the party nor the electorate expected it to keep, Mr Blair takes
care to promise less, while challenging voters to hold him to his word.
These little promises, &quot;New Labour's early pledges&quot;, have been
printed on little cards, which sceptics are being urged to keep by them,
the better to check up on New Labour in power. The cards promise that Labour
will:&nbsp;</P>

<LI>cut class sizes for five-, six and seven-year-olds to 30 or less, using
money saved from phasing out the assisted-places scheme (subsidies for
children attending private schools);&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>halve the time between arrest and punishment for persistent young offenders;&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>treat an extra 100,000 patients in the National Health Service by saving
&pound;100m on red tape;&nbsp;provide jobs or training for 250,000 people
under 25, paid for by a &quot;windfall tax&quot; on the utilities;&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>set tough rules for public spending, to keep inflation and interest
rates low. </LI>

<P>For the moment, do not ask whether these promises make sense. Never
mind whether the savings from the assisted-places scheme would pay for
smaller class sizes; whether faster punishment for some offenders would
mean slower punishment for others; how, exactly, the <FONT SIZE=-1>NHS</FONT>
money is to be saved; how a once-and-for-all tax can finance an ongoing
expense, or whether the utilities will raise prices (a tax on consumers)
in order to recoup it. Never mind, for the moment, whether Labour can keep
its most important promise, to curb public spending. Instead merely weigh
the five promises against, as Labour would have it, those pitiless years
of fabric-tearing. The analysis and the prescriptions are orders of magnitude
apart. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as though Boris Yeltsin, promising
to dismantle Soviet central planning, had announced a small cut in the
staff of Gosplan, to be phased in over five years; or as if Nelson Mandela,
promising to erase the legacy of apartheid, had said that efficiency savings
in school administration would be used to buy books (really quite a lot
of books) for black children. Mr Blair's modest pledges are what you would
expect of an incumbent government fighting on a steady-as-she-goes platform.
Not only that, the policies are Tory-hued: with the possible exception
of the first (phasing out assisted places) none would be out of place in
the next Conservative manifesto. The fifth, and much the most important,
pledge--the promise to contain public spending-- will certainly be in it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Labour says, or implies, that
it will do many other things too. There is no British problem, real or
imagined, that Mr Blair does not promise to address. But firm-sounding
commitments (already less than &quot;pledges&quot;, you understand) are
becoming less firm. The promise to introduce a minimum wage, for instance,
has been hedged by a plan to refer practical questions (including whether
the minimum would be high enough to raise anybody's pay) to an inquiry.
Even on constitutional reform--the only significant exception to the view
that New Labour offers a Tory programme--the promise to create a Scottish
parliament with tax raising powers in the first year of a new government
has been softened by a promise to have a referendum on the subject. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these vaguer goals, aims, challenges,
commitments and assorted non-pledges, so far as they mean anything, actually
out-Tory the Tories. The proto-manifesto calls for quicker ways to sack
teachers who are not up to the job; for benefits to be withdrawn from unemployed
people who refuse training or a job; for new controls on noisy neighbours,
truants and children out at night. There are plenty of leftist-sounding
half-promises too, suitably dressed up in anti-Tory rhetoric, but these
are consistently the vaguest non-pledges of all. Labour says it will develop
a &quot;successful and modern industrial policy&quot;. So it should, you
might think, if the supposed devastation of British industry is to be repaired.
But what this policy would actually do (apart from introducing &quot;tough
rules on the non payment of small-business debt&quot;) remains unclear.
</P>

<P><B>Let every rule be a tough rule<BR>
</B>Occasionally, and cautiously, New Labour still applies the word &quot;socialism&quot;
to its ideas. Judged by his pledges and non-pledges, suitably discounted,
Mr Blair is certainly no socialist. Were it not for constitutional reform,
the question would be: is he anything more than a one-nation Tory in denial?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Blair were indeed only a remodelled
Edward Heath, that might not be such a bad thing. Nor, for that matter,
would it subtract very much from his achievement in changing the Labour
Party. Judged on policy, Bleathism would undoubtedly be preferable to the
backward and in places absurd Labour programme it has replaced. In electoral
terms, moreover, it may be exactly what the country wants. A great deal
of evidence--starting with the margin that pollsters add to the Conservatives'
count to reflect the shame people feel at supporting them-- suggests that
the median British voter is indeed a Tory who dares not speak his name.
Give us low taxes, he pleads, but save us from our guilt. New Labour is
listening. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let nobody say that this transformation
of Labour was a small or timid thing. If Mr Blair has done nothing but
shift his party to the ground occupied by the Tories before 1979, that
is a remarkable achievement, albeit one he is unwilling to boast about.
Three years ago, who could have imagined Labour's old socialist soldiers--the
David Blunketts, Clare Shorts and John Prescotts--preaching enterprise
and incentives? Never mind their embarrassment: they are doing it. This
was a feat that required of Mr Blair all the authoritarian brutality and
tactical guile of a Margaret Thatcher. No wonder she admires him. This
extraordinary politician might even be able to prevent Labour in power
drifting back to the space it has vacated in opposition. </P>

<P><B>Breaking the mould, etc<BR>
</B>As you would expect, Mr Blair has anticipated this line of attack (if
that is what it is). New Labour says, and Mr Blair may well believe, that
it is much more than old Tory. The reformers dismiss any effort to locate
New Labour on the traditional left-right spectrum: such thinking is simply
pass&eacute;. &quot;New Labour is neither old left nor new right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We offer a new way ahead, that leads from the centre, but is profoundly
radical in the changes it promises&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The individual
does best within a strong and unified society, where we acknowledge that
success depends not just on the striving of the individual but on working
together. seeks to apply that principle entirely afresh to a different
and changing world.&quot; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this appeal to the role of &quot;society&quot;
(contrasting with Margaret Thatcher's memorable claim that there is no
such thing) and in the emphasis he places on notions such as &quot;community&quot;
and &quot;stakeholder&quot;, Mr Blair appears to believe he has a big new
idea, one that transcends old political categories. So he asks to be judged
not just on his pledges and non-pledges, which are only work in progress
after all, but by this larger organising vision and where it might lead.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tories have failed on their own terms,
argue New Labour's radical centrists: they have failed to create a dynamic
economy. But, unlike the Tories, New Labour understands why they have failed.
The conditions of success, even success defined as narrowly as the Tories
have defined it, include a sympathetic understanding of the social roots
of prosperity, and the state's role in tending them. This is where constitutional
reform comes in. Only by aiming for a broader idea of success, one that
gives communities a voice and makes social cohesion a top priority, can
Britain hope to succeed in material terms. Community and enterprise are
not pulling in opposite directions, as both the Tories and old Labour believed:
the truth is that neither can succeed without the other. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such wispy, consoling talk really isn't new,
although enough time has passed since 1979 to make it seem so. But put
the question of provenance to one side. What matters is whether Labour's
new (to them) vision makes better sense than the Tory alternative, such
as it is--or whether different ideas altogether are the best way forward.
Have the Tories failed to create a more dynamic economy? If so, was it
because of their narrow-minded concentration on the individual and neglect
of society at large? Perhaps New Labour is half-right: perhaps a more dynamic
economy has been achieved, but at too high a social cost. What are the
policies that Britain needs now to address the Tories' failures? <BR>

<H1>The state we're really in </H1>

<P><I>The past 17 years have done the British economy a power of good</I>
</P>

<P>CRITICS of the government's economic record have plenty of material
to work with. Since 1979 Britain has suffered two severe recessions. When
Margaret Thatcher took office, 1.2m (just 4% of the labour force) were
out of work; now the total stands at 2.1m (nearly 8%). The rise in long-term
unemployment, especially damaging both socially and economically, has been
far greater. On average, the economy has grown by about 1.9% a year since
1979. That is faster than the growth of 1.5% a year between 1973 and 1979,
but not much so, particularly when you recall that during the earlier period
the economy was hit by two oil-price shocks. Between 1960 and 1973, the
economy grew at a little over 3% a year. So much for the Thatcher miracle.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain's overall economic performance has been poor not only in relation
to its own past, Labour argues, but also in relation to the record of other
countries. Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, never tire
of pointing out that since 1979 the economy has fallen from 13th to 18th
in &quot;the global prosperity league&quot; (see <A HREF="chart1.gif">chart
1</A>). This, they say, is the price that Britain has paid under the Tories
for bad macroeconomic management, persistently low investment and a chronically
underskilled workforce. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at a detailed balance-sheet of economic success and failure
is a complicated business: there will always be plenty of room for disagreement.
However, even allowing for that, Labour's broad assessment of the Tory
years is grossly misleading. The crucial point is that the trend of economic
growth has slowed in almost all industrial countries since the mid-1970s--but
the slowdown in Britain has been very much milder than almost anywhere
else. That may sound like a puny achievement. It is anything but. Until
about 1979, Britain's economic decline relative to other countries was
precipitous; since then, the decline has been arrested, and there are now
signs that Britain is improving its position. If so, no other British government
in modern times can claim as much. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the view that Britain's relative decline has stopped be reconciled
with the further slippage down Labour's &quot;prosperity league&quot;? There
are several difficulties with that measure. One is that the top of the
table now includes Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, countries that were
all below Britain in 1979. It is a pity that Britain has done badly relative
to those three stars--but the same is true of most other industrial countries
and all other European ones (ie, those which may best be compared with
Britain). <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that the measure ignores demography: a country with
a fast-growing population of people over 60, such as Britain, is bound
to suffer in a comparison based on an aggregate measure of output. Third,
the table is sensitive to the estimated &quot;purchasing-power&quot; exchange
rates which are used to convert prices. Where countries are closely clustered
together, as they are at Britain's rank, changes in position mean little.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A far better measure of economic performance is growth in labour productivity--that
is, in output per worker. The ability of any economy to deliver long-term
improvements in pay and living standards boils down to this. Faster growth
in output per worker is the ultimate standard by which any economy should
be judged<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 30 years to 1979, <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> per worker grew much
more slowly in Britain than in most other industrial countries. Over the
period as a whole, Britain's productivity growth was only two-thirds the
average achieved by 12 comparable industrial countries, and in the 1970s
the gap widened appreciably. (Between 1973 and 1979, average productivity
growth in the 12 countries was 2.2% a year; in Britain, it was barely half
that, at 1.3% a year.) For three decades, in other words, Britain suffered
relative--and accelerating--economic decline. In the ten years after 1979,
in contrast, its productivity growth was slightly better than average (1.7%
against 1.6%). Instead of lagging behind almost everybody, Britain was
at last keeping pace. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="chart2.gif">Chart 2</A> on the next page shows this improvement
in <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> per worker alongside two other measures: growth
in <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> per person and growth in &quot;total factor
productivity&quot; (which measures how well the economy is using both labour
and capital). They tell a similar story of arrested decline--and, just
possibly, renaissance. Even more striking than these whole-economy measures
are the figures for productivity in manufacturing (see <A HREF="chart1.gif">chart
3</A>). Manufacturing output per worker grew more slowly in Britain between
1960 and 1973, and between 1973 and 1979, than in almost every comparable
country. In 1979-94, it went up faster than in all but one: Japan. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures accord with the voluminous, albeit unsystematic, testimony
of factory-floor anecdote. Almost anybody who works in one will say that
Britain's factories and offices are much better run and very much more
productive than they were in the late 1970s<B>--</B>and many will say that
the change since then has been revolutionary rather than evolutionary.
Nonetheless, when the improvement in productivity first began to register
statistically in the mid-1980s, many dismissed the numbers as a mirage.
In particular, it was argued that just as a cricket team can raise its
batting average by fielding only its best few batsmen, so an economy can
increase its output per worker by forcing its least productive workers
on to the dole. And just as a cricket team scores fewer runs in total with
this strategy, so an economy is worse off if it does the same. It is obviously
better that relatively unproductive workers do something, however little
(and even if their small output drags down output per worker), than nothing
at all. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is still advanced to belittle the Tories' success on productivity.
Though quite correct in principle, it is no longer at all plausible in
practice. Britain's improvement in productivity was sustained during the
fall in unemployment of the late 1980s, and beyond. Moreover, compared
with other European countries, Britain has since continued to combine good
growth in output per worker with relatively low unemployment. All this
implies that the anecdotes are right, and the improvement in productivity
of the Thatcher-Major years is real.</P>

<P><B>Causes and symptoms <BR>
</B>This is not to say it will continue indefinitely. How lasting an improvement
it proves to be, and what it will come to mean for future living standards,
will depend on exactly why productivity has increased. A first possibility
to consider is taxes. Tories, the &quot;party of low taxation&quot;, would
love to claim that steady progress in cutting public spending and taxes
had spurred enterprise and worked a supply side miracle, as they long argued
it would. Unfortunately, the numbers make this awkward. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, the government has reformed taxes in
a variety of ways that, it would argue, have improved incentives and promoted
effort: the cut in top rates of income tax from 83% to 60%, and then to
40%; the shift from direct taxes (notably income tax) to indirect ones
(notably value-added tax); and so on. These changes, especially the cut
in top rates, presumably helped. But the fact remains that the aggregate
burden of taxation, which is what matters most, has hardly changed. In
1979, the government collected 35.5% of national income in taxes; in 1995,
the proportion was actually 36%. (Public borrowing was also about the same
in both years.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with productivity, this sort of comparison
understates the Tories' achievement somewhat. Until 1979, the trend of
taxation was relentlessly upward; if the trend estimated over the period
1965-79 had continued for the past 17 years, taxation would now stand at
41% of <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT>. Merely curbing this rise in taxes took
some doing--which is why complaints about the spending &quot;cuts&quot;
that made it possible have some substance. Nonetheless, the fact that taxes
failed to decline as the government had hoped means that the improvement
in productivity has to be accounted for in some other way. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else might explain? it Does it, for instance,
reflect a once-and-for-all improvement in working practices, or a persisting
change in the ability of businesses to adapt to new conditions? Perhaps
both, but the more it is the latter the more optimistic one is entitled
to be about the economy's prospects. It is too soon to say for certain,
but there are grounds for thinking that the second kind of change is a
good part of the story. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd as it will seem to those subscribing
to the orthodox account of Tory depredations, one of these grounds for
optimism is the progress that has been made in the quantity, if not the
quality, of education. For all the failings of British schools, especially
primary schools, education has improved in at least one measurable way
since the Conservatives took office--indeed, it has been transformed. In
1979 13% of recent school-leavers (that is, people aged 16-19, not in full-time
education) had no educational or vocational qualifications whatever. By
1995 that proportion had fallen to 8%. The proportion of people with a
first or higher degree more than doubled, from 4% to 10%. So did the proportion
of young people with some form of intermediate qualification, which went
up from 33% in 1984 to 52% last year. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly, again, this reflects demography.
Mainly, though, it reflects a big increase in the rate at which school-leavers
have enrolled in further education. The proportion of 16-year-olds in full-time
education has increased from less than half to more than three-quarters
in the past 17 years--a huge expansion. If you believe that a more educated
workforce is a more productive workforce (as New Labour certainly does),
you would certainly expect such an increase to be yielding an economic
benefit. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the expansion of further education
is unlikely to be the main cause of better productivity. That is because,
of all the difficulties that have beset the British economy since 1945,
one towers above the rest, even above the question of skills: industrial
relations. In meeting this challenge, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher
were at their most radical. </P>

<H1>The Thatcher revolution </H1>

<P><I>The Tories' greatest achievements were to crush the unions and sell
the nationalised industries</I> <BR>
</P>

<P>BRITAIN'S greatest post-war economic problem, to which many other failures
can be traced, was its system of organised labour. The results of this
system were the symptoms of what by 1979 was known worldwide as the &quot;British
disease&quot;: industrial disruption on an epic scale, a persistent tendency
to wage inflation, chronic backwardness in production and management, low
investment, arthritic rigidity in the face of economic change, demarcation
disputes raised to an art form, stone-clad resistance to new ideas, managers
who did not manage and workers who, it seemed, seldom worked. You might
argue that against this background Britain's productivity record between
1950 and 1979 was actually quite impressive. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nicholas Oulton of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research points out, the defects in Britain's system of labour relations
were both entrenched and unusual--a compound of three distinct elements.
First, union membership was high: in 1979, more than half of all employees
were in a union. Second, Britain's unions had developed a dual system of
bargaining, with negotiations over pay and conditions conducted not only
at plant level by local shop stewards but also nationally by the union's
central officers. Third, unions were organised not by company or industry,
but by &quot;craft&quot; (ie, occupation). Often, any given negotiation
in any given company would therefore involve many different unions. In
1980 nearly 40% of large firms (that is, firms with more than 2,000 workers)
had to deal with six or more manual workers' unions. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this complicated and strife-prone structure was added a range of
legal immunities that were extremely generous by international standards
(and which, by the way, seriously infringed individual liberties). For
instance, secondary picketing-- when a union disrupts work at firms not
directly connected with its dispute in order to put further pressure, sometimes
through political channels, on employers--is subject to civil and even
criminal penalties in many countries. Britain's law protected it, and the
unions resorted to it routinely. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 1979 no British government had dared to face down the unions,
though most (old Labour and Tory alike) had known it needed to be done.
Margaret Thatcher's government took up the challenge, and how. With the
brutal clarity Mrs Thatcher brought to such matters, the unions were no
longer seen as a partner to be coaxed or even arm-twisted into greater
co-operation, but as an enemy to be smashed. And smashed they were, to
an extent that would have seemed incredible in the 1970s. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successive rounds of industrial-relations laws severely restricted the
unions' immunities. Their right to recognition was curbed, the closed shop
and secondary picketing were outlawed, the freedom of unions to call strikes
was narrowed (for instance, by a requirement that a secret ballot of the
members be called first). In all cases, infringement exposed the unions
to severe civil penalties. In 1984, in an event of enormous symbolic importance,
the government took on the union that had paralysed the country and broken
Edward Heath's administration in 1974--the National Union of Mineworkers--and,
thanks partly to the incompetence of the union's leadership, crushed it. <BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union membership fell from more than half of the workforce in 1979 to
less than a third in 1995. The number of firms recognising unions fell
sharply too, from about two-thirds to less than half. More important, the
relationship between employers and those unions that continued to be recognised
changed radically. By and large the unions became more co-operative, and
began to regard strikes as a last rather than first resort..

<P><B>Back to work <BR>
</B>Other factors, of course, aside from the Tories' new laws, also helped
to change the industrial-relations climate. Some were inadvertent and in
themselves extremely undesirable--such as the sharp rise in unemployment
and the unintentionally rapid contraction of the economy during the disinflation
of the early 1980s. Others were the deliberate consequence of policy, and
in themselves a good thing. For instance, the adoption of competitive tendering
(&quot;contracting out&quot;) in much of the public sector greatly weakened
the power of many public-sector unions. Privatisation is another example:
it was probably as important for helping to change the overall character
of industrial relations as for directly improving the performance of the
privatised companies. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By pushing &quot;lame ducks&quot; such as
British Leyland (now Rover) and overmanned public enterprises such as British
Telecom into private ownership, the Thatcher government lent new credibility
to its promise to let failing companies fail--a vow that many previous
governments had made and then broken. Privatisation sent a clear message:
taxpayers would no longer give refuge to firms that were unable to make
their way in the world. This set an example to the rest of the economy,
encouraging managers, among other things, to adopt a less indulgent attitude
towards dealing with their own unionised workforces. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that privatisation helped to change
Britain's culture of labour relations, however, is not to deny that the
direct results of the policy mattered in their own right. They did. When
the Tories came to power, the nationalised industries were making heavy
losses. The cost in state support was equivalent to &pound;300 a year for
every taxpayer. The privatised companies now make profits of roughly &pound;2.5
billion a year--and pay taxes on those profits which amount to a rebate
of &pound;100 a year for every taxpayer. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nationalised or formerly nationalised
industries raised their productivity a lot faster in the 1980s than in
the 1970s (see <a href="chart4.gif">chart 4</a>). Some, such as British Telecom and British Steel,
became global standard-setters for their respective industries, another
achievement that few would have bet on before 1979. British Steel succeeded
in becoming much more efficient after 1979 while still in the public sector
(it was privatised in 1988); this has led some to question whether privatisation
was really necessary for better management. It may not have been strictly
necessary: better management under public control was evidently possible.
But privatisation was most likely very helpful. Even where efficiency improved
a lot before the firm was sold, as it did at British Steel, the prospect
of private ownership almost certainly acted as a spur. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sceptics also point out, again rightly, that
the government did too little to promote competition in the privatised
industries. Maximising proceeds from the sales mattered to the Treasury,
and monopolies (albeit heavily regulated ones) fetch a better price than
companies that must compete to survive. But this is only to say that the
benefits of privatisation might have been even greater than they were--not,
on the face of it, a good argument against privatisation. Disappointing
or otherwise, the improvement in performance (the result of a too-small
increase in competition and a big increase in profit-seeking) cannot be
denied. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who has benefited from this better performance?
What of the view, the sceptics' last resort, that the industries' new shareholders
(and overpaid bosses) have gained at the expense of citizens at large? Opponents
of privatisation tend to complain when shareholders have done very well
(grasping investors were sold the companies too cheaply) and when they
have not (poor, unsuspecting shareholders, including many old-age pensioners,
were deliberately misled). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all very silly. Investors in privatisation
shares have done well, but not outrageously so. Taxpayers have gained a
lot, as already noted. And consumers have profited as well. Thanks to better
productivity and a regulatory framework that, for all its faults, divides
the gains of greater efficiency between shareholders and customers, prices
charged by the privatised utilities have mostly risen far less rapidly
than prices in general. For one reason or another, privatisation may have
been unpopular with voters--but in every other way the policy was an unambiguous
success. </P>

<P><B>It ain't broke <BR>
</B>New Labour is at its weakest when it tries to deny that the underlying
performance of the British economy has improved since 1979. Even though
it has no plans to reverse the main policies that have brought this about--the
Tories' anti-union laws and privatisation--it accepts these measures grudgingly.
It says, in effect, that it would not have done these ill-advised things,
but it is too late now to undo them. You can't turn back the clock. New
Labour must make the best of the wreckage the Tories will leave behind.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this position were entirely a matter of
political spin, one might have few grounds for complaint or anxiety. Judging
Labour by what it firmly promises to do (almost nothing), you would conclude
that the Tories' structural repairs of Britain's economy are secure. Why
not then allow New Labour its ritual denunciations of the government? But
the question is whether, and how, this grudging acceptance of the Tory
revolutions in industrial relations and the state-owned enterprises will
express itself in government. It is false reassurance to suppose that the
reforms cannot now be undone. Some could be explicitly reversed, others
implicitly rendered null. Clocks can, in fact, be turned back. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Labour is keen, for instance, on the
idea of a &quot;stakeholder economy&quot;. Again, measured by what Labour
promises to do in office, the idea appears to have virtually no content--which
is fine. But what does it mean to the voters whose support it is intended
to attract?  What might it come to mean? </P>

<P><B>Partners in progress <BR>
</B>At a minimum, it implies a bigger role for workers (organised or otherwise)
in the running of companies. The very term &quot;stakeholder&quot; is intended
to be contrasted with &quot;shareholder&quot;--meaning that companies should
be run with interests other than the &quot;short-termist&quot; demands
of shareholders in mind. The principal stakeholders in any company, after
its owners, are its employees. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Britain's unions hope to recapture
ground they have lost under the Tories if Labour wins the election; undoubtedly,
on the key things, Mr Blair is determined to disappoint them. But &quot;stakeholding&quot;
gives them grounds for hope. It is a commodious term, intended to bring
coherence to Labour's various non-pledges on corporate governance, the
minimum wage and the European social chapter (of which more later). That
makes it a big stick with which to beat the new prime minister after the
election. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates of stakeholding and scourges of
City short-termism are in a paradoxical position. Under the Tories, these
critics of the government would agree, shareholder capitalism has made
great strides. Companies are no longer anything like as constrained as
they used to be by powerful unions; enterprises once owned and run by the
government are now owned by shareholders and run by their agents. Yet,
as the productivity figures make plain, these changes have gone hand in
hand with a marked improvement in the performance of British companies.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, productivity is only one way
to judge industrial efficiency. Critics of British post Thatcher capitalism
emphasise, as you would expect, other measures. Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, often draws attention to Britain's relatively poor record on
investment, calling this the &quot;root cause&quot; of Britain's relative
economic decline. Put to one side the point that Britain has not, in fact,
been in relative economic decline since 1979. Wouldn't its performance
(good, bad or indifferent) have been be a lot better if investment had
been higher? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain does invest less than similarly prosperous
countries. Since 1960, Britain has spent a smaller share of its national
income on investment than almost any other rich economy: its rate of roughly
18% of <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> over the past 35 years was fractionally
less than America's, substantially less than that of France and Germany
(about 22%) and barely three fifths that of Japan (roughly 30%). In this
respect, the record since 1979 shows no improvement. The government, sensitive
to this line of criticism, challenges the numbers and the usual interpretation
of them. It points out that Britain has invested less in housing than similar
countries; its rate of business investment (which excludes housing) has
been second only to Japan's since 1979. Other studies have served mainly
to deepen the confusion: much depends on exactly how business investment
is defined, and the definition varies in large and small ways from country
to country. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost by definition, more of the right sort
of investment would improve Britain's economic performance. It would be
fairly easy for the government to arrange a mere increase in capital spending:
that would require only generous subsidies and/or tax allowances of the
kind that Labour often appears to favour (but has not yet spelled out).
The cost would be higher taxes and, at least for a time, lower living standards,
for what is spent on investment cannot also be spent on consumption; but
a mere expansion of investment is certainly achievable. More investment
of the right sort, however, is another thing. No government is competent
to judge which industries, or which firms, or which activities within firms,
deserve to be subsidised. If a greater quantity of investment is achieved
at the expense of quality, nothing has been gained. If New Labour believes
anything, it surely ought to believe that investment decisions should be
made in the marketplace, not in Whitehall. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of New Labour's intellectual allies
would deny that. In attacking Britain's short-termist corporate culture,
they call frankly for the government to override the pull of market forces
on investment (and other things), and not merely with a bit of subsidy
here or there. The &quot;stakeholder economy&quot;, that splendidly elastic
term, encompasses demands not only for greater participation by workers
in the running of their firms but also for a tempering of shareholders'
power to demand high short-term profits of their managers. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here too Mr Blair has adopted the label but
flinches at the substance. Unlike its forebears and very many of its supporters,
when New Labour speaks on the record it proposes no grand new &quot;industrial
strategy&quot;. That is just as well. Britain doesn't need one. More investment,
especially if it resulted from greater confidence among Britain's businessmen
in the prospects for the economy, would be welcome; better macroeconomic
policy, of which more in a moment, would be the best and simplest way to
foster such confidence. In the meantime, however, talk of Britain's continuing
economic crisis does not deserve to be taken seriously. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some proponents of &quot;stakeholding&quot;
would go along with that. John Kay, a professor at the London Business
School, is one. In &quot;The Foundations of Corporate Success&quot;, published
in 1993, he explains how best to judge the success of a company. He favours
a measure based on &quot;value added&quot; by the business; mere profit,
beloved of shareholders, can be a misleading gauge. Then he examines a
database of all big European companies to discover which were the most
successful in the 1980s according to this definition. Of Europe's ten most
successful firms, seven were British (see <a href="chart5.gif">chart 5</a>). Not bad for a basket-case.

<h1> The outsiders </h1>

<i>Surging unemployment has been the Tories' greatest failure. What can be done about it?</i><p>

NEW LABOUR'S attack on the Conservatives' record at last hits the target when it comes to unemployment. Mr Blair cannot plausibly deny that British companies are better run than they used to be or that, for the majority, this has put higher living standards within reach. What he can plausibly deny, however, is that the fruits of this achievement have been spread to all parts of society. A substantial minority, Labour argues, have been excluded from the broader trend of growing prosperity. The most conspicuous mark of exclusion is joblessness. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;High unemployment has lots of different consequences, all of them bad. Those directly affected, the unemployed and their families, obviously suffer most, not just because their income disappears but also through loss of self-respect and ever-diminishing employability as time spent without work extends. The costs also extend far beyond the principal victims. High unemployment promotes crime; it increases the burden of the welfare state on taxpayers; the greater threat of joblessness spreads anxiety far and wide. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the economy at large, high unemployment represents an outrageous waste of resources. Although a certain amount of unemployment is unavoidable in any economy, high rates can become self-perpetuating. Unemployment is subject to a kind of inertia that economists call "hysteresis": there is a tendency for the long-term unemployed to increase as a proportion of the total. Not only does this concentrate the misery, it also inhibits the dampening effect on inflation that unemployment would otherwise have. The result is that the unavoidable minimum rate of unemployment--the rate consistent with a low and stable rate of inflation-- drifts higher. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joblessness also lies behind most of the deterioration in the various socio-economic indicators that Labour cites so effectively against the Tories: growing poverty, rising inequality, the number of households receiving means-tested benefits, and so on. It accounts for much of the rise in public borrowing witnessed in the early 1990s, which New Labour is also at pains to deplore. (The public-sector borrowing requirement reached &pound;45 billion, or 7% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, in 1993-94; it has since fallen to &pound;32 billion.) Ordinarily, the government might find this close connection between unemployment and other economic ills consoling: as unemployment continues to fall (by the end of next year, it should be about 1.75m), those other measures of economic failure are bound to improve as well. Given the electoral timing, however, such progress is likely to be too little and too late. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Causing a needlessly high rate of unemployment is one of the worst mistakes a government can make. Why did unemployment rise so quickly in the early 1980s and early 1990s? What if anything can be done now to reduce it faster?<p>
<b>If it's Tuesday, it must be M3</b >
<br>Often during the 1980s, the government's critics accused it of using high unemployment as an instrument of economic policy. Millions were shunted on to the dole, it was said, in a cynical effort to curb inflation and quell the unions. Actually, the government was dismayed at the rise in unemployment of the early 1980s. The prevailing orthodoxy had been that a programme to cut inflation, announced in advance and described in detail, could succeed without much, if any, rise in unemployment. The trick was to make sure that everybody believed the government's promise that inflation would fall. If they did, wage demands would moderate and fewer workers would find themselves priced out of work. Accordingly, the government devoted much effort to developing and defending its "medium term financial strategy", a multi-year framework that set the context for each year's budget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a variety of reasons, the policy went wrong. The Tories succeeded in lowering inflation only at an enormous cost in unemployment. Evidently, however, little was learned from the experience. Unemployment soared again in the recession of the early 1990s. And the cause of that recession was essentially the same as before: inflation had risen sharply, so the government was obliged to contract the economy. This time, though, fewer people argued that so patent and embarrassing a failure had been a deliberate act of policy. (Sterling's ejection from the European exchange-rate mechanism made it far harder than before to put a brave face on defeat.) Henceforth, in macroeconomic policy, it was more plausible to mock the Tories for their incompetence than to deplore them for their wickedness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lesson of the past two recessions is that--in a limited sense, and unpalatable as it seems--unemployment is after all an instrument of economic policy. But the lesson would apply as much to a socialist or New Labour government as to a Tory one. Once inflation is rising, curbing it requires higher unemployment, at least for a time. The choices surrounding this short-term trade-off are essentially second-order decisions: should the government curb inflation quickly (implying a more rapid, but perhaps more short-lived, rise in unemployment) or more slowly (implying a gentler, but perhaps longer-lived, recession)? When Margaret Thatcher justified the first Tory recession by saying "There is no alternative", she was almost right: once inflation is up, there are no likeable alternatives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It follows that the best anti-unemployment policy is a successful anti-inflation policy. This is well worth remembering at times like now. Inflation is low; wages are increasing at a relatively modest pace; unemployment is falling; the economy is growing at a steady if unspectacular pace. For some commentators, this is not enough: the government should cut interest rates further and "allow" the economy to grow faster. These are the commentators (from both left and right) who have applauded Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for cutting interest rates against the advice of the Bank of England in recent months, and who regret only that he has not gone further to stimulate the economy. It is safe to predict that they will be the very commentators who will criticise Mr Clarke most bitterly when inflation rises in due course, making higher interest rates (and rising unemployment) necessary once more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments everywhere find it difficult to keep inflation securely in check. No particular technique of monetary policy holds the secret--if it did, Britain, which has tried almost every regime you can think of, would have found it by now. What seems to matter most is not the nuts and bolts of monetary management but a popular demand for, or at least acceptance of, stable prices. This is why a successful anti-inflation policy is especially difficult in Britain, and helps to explain why the record of every British government since the 1960s in this respect has been so dismal. To put it mildly, Britain has a high tolerance of inflation. Recent signs of brisker business in the housing market--often a precursor of a more general rise in prices--were widely regarded as good news.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In several ways, in fact, Britain's inflation problem is linked to housing. Most people in Britain finance their homes with (subsidised) floating-rate debt. This makes them unusually sensitive to changes in interest rates. Fraction-of-a-point rises that would pass almost unnoticed elsewhere are front-page news in Britain, and hailed as a great political setback. Even more than in other countries, therefore, British governments love to cut interest rates and hate to put them up. Tolerance of inflation (to put it at its mildest) together with this great resistance to "safety-first" adjustments in interest rates have given Britain a persistent tendency to high inflation--a persistent tendency, in other words, to spells of high unemployment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Changing this settled pro-inflation culture would be a job of many years. The best hope is to keep inflation down for so long that the economy's institutions begin to adapt to, and then demand, stable prices. The catch of course is that, until then, keeping inflation down is going to be difficult. A step in the right direction would be to make the Bank of England responsible for monetary policy, and to let it discharge its duties independently of the Treasury. This is no cure-all, as some appear to think. Monetary policy would not become apolitical merely because the government said so--as the Bank would quickly discover. The most that can be said is that, with luck, the distance between politics and anti-inflation policy would be somewhat increased. It would be a start.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government had appeared to be adopting this approach. Over the past few years the Bank has been given a bigger say in the operational aspects of monetary policy (eg, in deciding precisely when to change interest rates in the amount and direction chosen by the chancellor), and it has been allowed to say more in public about what it thinks (notably through its own independently produced <i>Inflation Report</i>, and through publication of the minutes of its monthly monetary-policy meeting with the chancellor). As these changes were announced, it was speculated that they might constitute de facto independence for the Bank. Hardly. Mr Clarke has shown his followers how to operate the system: hear the Bank's views, ignore them, and collect extra credit on that account when interest rates are cut.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time it also seemed that New Labour might embrace the idea of an independent Bank of England. But its proto-manifesto is careful to stop short of that. It says only that "We will reform the Bank of England to ensure that decision-making on monetary policy is more effective, open, accountable and free from short-term political manipulation." In other words, "We will make things better but we aren't saying how." Perhaps it was naive to suppose that if Labour gained office, having been denied power for nearly 20 years, it would promptly surrender the most powerful tool of economic policy into another's hands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In most other respects, New Labour spares no effort to reassure voters and the City that its macroeconomic policy will be non-inflationary. Indeed, to most of its supporters, the party's position is cautious to a fault. No talk of the traditional "dash for growth" (the idea is explicitly repudiated). And, as already noted, virtually no firm promises on new public spending. Judged by what Labour's leaders have said, rather than by what their supporters wish they would say, there is little to choose between the two main parties on macroeconomic policy. Both promise to do the right thing: curb the budget deficit, keep inflation low. Neither offers any new reasons for supposing its promise will be kept. 
<p><b>Skills and standards</b >
<br>Though it is true that the best way to keep unemployment low is to keep inflation low, thereby avoiding the need to throttle the economy every few years, curbing unemployment is not just a matter of macroeconomic policy. Much of Britain's unemployment is "structural", meaning that it will take more than a business-cycle recovery to eliminate it. In principle, any of a number of factors may cause this kind of unemployment. For instance, the unemployed may lack the skills that an expanding economy will need; the welfare system may be designed in such a way that some people are better off collecting the dole than they would be going out to work; there may be regulatory barriers of one sort or another preventing would-be workers from finding jobs; and so on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since 1979 the government's assorted interventions in the labour market have avowedly been designed to promote "flexibility"--that is, to improve skills and incentives, and to clear away the barriers that keep the unemployed out of work. It is difficult to judge the success of these measures, overshadowed as they have been by two severe recessions. But the government's various initiatives have undeniably increased the proportion of 16-18-year-olds in formal training. They have substantially reduced the number of people caught in the worst forms of the unemployment-benefit trap. (This was achieved partly by reducing benefits for some recipients and partly by tightening the rules on eligibility; the result is that fewer people are now better off on the dole than in work.) They have weakened the power of trade unions, and ended the power of Wages Councils, to set pay at levels that reduce the demand for labour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this, it seems, has improved the ability of the labour market to match willing employers with would-be workers. The evidence for this is that in the recovery from the second recession, unemployment started falling sooner than in the recovery from the first (see <a href="chart7.gif">chart 7</a>). In other words, employment now seems to respond more sensitively to the state of the economy than before. Many other things changed between the 1980s and the 1990s, of course, but it seems likely that a more flexible market for labour is one of the reasons for that faster growth of jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Labour's proposals on employment are a peculiar mixture. As in other areas, they reflect the party's ambivalence over the respective roles of state and market. The goal of "flexibility" is embraced, as you would expect. Old Labour would have denounced the term, with some justice, as a euphemism for screwing the workers; to New Labour, flexibility in all things is both modern and necessary. Needless to say, however, flexibility must be combined with certain "minimum standards".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour therefore intends to introduce a national minimum wage (its level to be determined by a new Low Pay Commission). It also says it will adopt the European social chapter, which would extend workers' entitlements in matters such as consultation by managers and unpaid parental leave. Less contentiously, the party proposes to expand the existing provision of vocational training, both to increase the proportion of 16-18-year-olds receiving a good standard of formal training and to ensure that the long-term unemployed are given a variety of training choices as a route back to work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On benefits, Labour's policy appears to be more niggardly than the government's. That is, any young unemployed people turning down these improved options for work or training (which include, presumably as a last resort, a job on Labour's "environment taskforce") will have their benefit cut: "There will be no option of remaining permanently on full benefit." Though it bemoans the rise in poverty of the past two decades, New Labour does not propose to restore the real value of benefits. To judge by its proto manifesto, it is more concerned to curb fraudulent claims.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour, haunted by the memory of its election campaign of 1992, is nearly as vague on taxes. The interaction of benefits and taxes for those on low incomes continues, despite the Tories' changes, to be an important obstacle to higher employment. Radical solutions to the tax-and-benefits trap--especially an integrated system in the form of a negative income tax--have a lot to be said for them and should commend themselves to a left-of-centre party. But schemes of this sort would be very expensive. Rather than proposing any such reform, Labour talks blithely about reducing the starting-rate of income tax from 20% to 10% when conditions allow.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the meantime, its purported remedies for Britain's most pressing economic and social problem are a mixture of good and bad. Labour's ideas on training are promising. It is a pity they do not go further. One of the most outrageous anomalies in British public policy is that university education for bright 18-21-year-olds is hugely subsidised by the taxpayer, whereas vocational training for academically unsuccessful 16-19-year-olds is often undertaken at private expense. There is a very strong case on the grounds of equity and efficiency for correcting, and indeed reversing, this bias.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;University students, who will be the most prosperous members of society, and who will themselves capture almost all of the benefit of their higher education, should receive much less subsidy. In contrast, society has a large interest in helping its least gifted people into gainful employment, as opposed to idleness or crime. Many of these rejects are failing to receive training under the government's expanded schemes; Labour's plans would be an improvement, but are still not intended to reach everyone. Here is an opportunity for a left-of-centre party to be both radical and intelligent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No such luck. Labour's proposals on welfare-to work are limited in scope. This is partly, one imagines, so that financing them can be said to require not a fundamental change of priorities, still less an ongoing rise in general taxation, but merely a "windfall levy" on the privatised utilities. This daft way of presenting the policy mars an otherwise worthwhile idea. A "windfall" tax cannot finance a recurring expense; it will probably fail to raise enough money to pay for even one year of Labour's new regime; and it pretends that a tax on the privatised utilities is not somehow a tax on the public at large (which, ultimately, it is). What this stratagem shows is that Labour is unwilling to present even its best ideas as plans that voters might actually be willing to pay for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's other main ideas on employment are not flawed so much as plain awful. The minimum wage, unless set cynically at so low a rate that it would not raise anybody's wages, is a job destroyer. The <font size=-1>EU</font>'s social chapter is constitutionally objectionable (subsidiarity should apply here if anywhere) and threatens to become another heavy tax on jobs. Anything that raises the cost of hiring an extra worker makes it less likely that a worker will be taken on. If reducing unemployment were Labour's top priority, as it should be, it would have no truck with nonsense of this sort. Labour's feeble reply is: "Everybody else in Europe does it." It only remains to add that Britain's unemployment rate, however dire, is one of the lowest in the Union.

<h1>Cradle to grave </h1>

<i>What should become of the welfare state?</i><P>

REPORTS of the death of Britain's welfare state have been exaggerated. Since 1979, welfare spending--broadly defined to include pensions, social security, education, the National Health Service and public housing--has increased by half in real terms. Even as a proportion of <font size=-1>GDP</font> it has increased, from 23% to 26% (see <a href="chart9.gif">chart 9</a>). 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On unchanged policies, it is true, the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s would have driven welfare spending a good deal higher under the Tories. And until 1979 the share of welfare spending in national income had been on a steadily rising trend. In merely halting that growth, at a time when demands on the system were rising for both business cycle and demographic reasons, the Tories had to squeeze hard in some areas. They did it by cutting capital spending and extending means-testing where they could. Housing and education came to receive smaller shares of the total, health care and social-security benefits bigger ones. But the broad goals of the system, and the resulting cost to taxpayers, have changed much less than most of the governments' critics allow--and less than some of its critics would have wished. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the various exceptions to that, one is important. It caused surprisingly little fuss, perhaps because its effects will take years to become conspicuous. This was the decision to link future increases in pensions and some other benefits to inflation rather than to average earnings (which rise faster than prices). The implication is that the basic state pension will provide an ever-diminishing standard of living, measured relative to the incomes of those in work. To avoid poverty in old age, people will increasingly need to provide for themselves, by saving more during their working years. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This decision, in other words, announced the beginning of what could become a long, slow retreat in a central component of the welfare state as it was once envisaged. Whether tomorrow's pensioners fully understand the difference this will make to them is doubtful. Labour opposed the change, as you would expect; as you would expect, it has no plans to reverse it. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That aside, Tory efforts to reform the welfare state have mainly concentrated not on the scale of provision, but on the method of delivery. Here, their thinking has been radical by any standards. A turning-point came in 1988. Up to then, most of the Tories' changes to the welfare state had been mere tinkering, forced upon them by the need to contain costs. But then came the Education Reform Act, which introduced the national curriculum, open school enrolment and provision for schools to opt out of local-authority control. State schools would still be free to their users, but the reforms would begin to change the system from one that allocated resources according to the plans of central and (especially) local authorities into one that worked more like a market--a "quasi-market"--for educational services. The idea was simple enough: schools would compete with each other, and standards would rise. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1988 the government also set up a review into the future of the National Health Service. This yielded a shake-up that was even more radical than the one that had just begun in education. Again, the principle of free provision was not questioned. Instead, another "internal market" was to be established. Hospitals could opt out of health-authority control, and many general-practitioner practices would be given their own budgets to buy services from hospitals or health authorities as they chose. Again, competition was intended to raise standards, by exposing inefficiency, weighing the costs of treatment more explicitly and causing resources to be better employed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The quasi-market idea was also extended to other areas. In public housing, for instance, landlords were allowed to bid for control of local-authority housing, with rents shifted closer to market levels (and housing benefits raised to reflect that). The government's policy on "community care" also intended that public providers would play a smaller role and private providers a bigger one, all at taxpayers' expense. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taken together, these different initiatives suggested the beginning of a deep transformation of the welfare state. Henceforth, even though public services could continue to be paid for out of general taxation, they might be almost entirely provided by a variety of competing private suppliers. According to the purest form of the quasi-market model, most (if not all) schools, hospitals, residential homes, providers of "social housing", and so on would one day be private, as opposed to state-owned and state-run, institutions. The role of government would be confined to injecting money, regulating, promoting competition and monitoring the results. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The model could be extended even further, into the saving-for-retirement and insurance functions of the benefits system. For instance, the government might develop a funded replacement for the state pension system, paying a minimum contribution for each taxpayer into an individual pension account held at any of a multitude of competing providers. The delinking of pensions from earnings might then be seen as a first step in this direction. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, then, there are two questions to ask about the future of the welfare state. The first, and more familiar, is: how big should it be? The other is: should it be organised along traditional public-service lines, or as a series of quasi-markets? It is a politically important fact, however, that these questions are by no means independent. The Tories' reforms of the welfare state are easy to portray as a strategy of dismantling by stealth. This has been Labour's charge throughout.
<p><b>Outsourcing the welfare state</b>
<br>The charge has substance. Once quasi-markets are in place, and the government no longer acts as a monopoly supplier of the service in question, it is natural to ask how far its role as provider of cash should be supplemented, or replaced, by the private sector. Suppose the government pursued the logic of its reforms in education, for instance, and issued parents with vouchers enabling them to buy a place at the school of their choice. It would be in the spirit of such a scheme, some would argue, to let "state schools" (as they once were) invite parents to top up their vouchers with cash. With time, the state's contribution could be allowed to fall, leading by degrees to the privatisation of education.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Higher spending notwithstanding, the Tories' reforms of the supply-side of the welfare state have always been bedevilled by the popular suspicion that this is where they are really heading. New Labour, if it chose, could explore the quasi-market method of delivery with less political difficulty: its assurances that the aim was merely to improve the quality of services would be more readily believed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But does the quasi-market approach, judged solely as a method of delivery, actually give better value for money? It is too early to expect clear answers. Such dramatic changes involve heavy starting costs and great initial disruption; the gains, if any, will take time to come through. Accordingly, the evidence so far is mixed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Audit Commission recently published a report on the economics of <font size=-1>GP</font><b> </b>fundholding. It estimated that up to the end of 1994, practices had received &pound;232m to cover the costs of the extra staff, equipment and computers they needed to make the new regime work. Against that, they had achieved only &pound;206m in efficiency savings within their budgets. The question is whether improvements in the service provided to patients were sufficient to offset that financial deficit of &pound;26m. The commission found many improvements (such as better communication with hospitals, shorter waiting times, greater use of day surgery); but it found also that only the best-managed practices had succeeded in making a big difference in these respects. The best practices showed that the new system offered great potential for improvement, but few as yet were realising that potential.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, competition ought to make sense: in most fields of endeavour, it works miracles. But in its application to the welfare state, there are difficulties. For a start, no doubt recognising the political obstacles, the government has stopped well short of the maximum dose of market forces. The Tories' quasi-markets are even further removed from proper markets than they might be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In primary and secondary education, for instance, the government has not adopted the voucher model. One result is that parents do not act as purchasers within the system, exerting all the pressure they might on schools to raise standards. Similarly, in health care, the power to shop around rests not with patients but with fundholding <font size=-1>GP</font>s. Any health system offering free services needs a "gatekeeper" of some kind if it is not to be overwhelmed. Even so, in a system which continues to discourage patients from switching among <font size=-1>GP</font>s, the question arises whether the reforms have really improved matters for the people the <font size=-1>NHS</font> is intended to serve.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A problem that seems pervasive in quasi-market systems is "cream-skimming". Any scheme that pays a standard fee for each user or group of users gives providers an incentive to search for customers who will be cheap to service. <font size=-1>GP</font>s would prefer to have the young and fit on their rolls; the old and infirm are financially less appealing. Schools would prefer to recruit the brightest pupils, because that improves their record in examination results; if possible, they will avoid accepting backward pupils, or those with particular learning difficulties, because such children do badly in exams and require a bigger investment of teaching effort.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Formulas can be devised to reward doctors and schools for taking on more needy or troublesome users, but unless this is seen to, the quasi-market approach is dangerously flawed. Competition among providers may be counted on, in the end, to raise average performance; but the quality of service provided to those at the bottom (which will often mean those in greatest need) may well decline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if "weighted vouchers" were introduced to correct the bias in quasi-market systems against demanding users, there is a broader point here of some political moment. Even in its present half hearted applications, it is clear that the quasi-market method both decentralises and depoliticises. More decisions are taken by <font size=-1>GP</font>s, fewer by health authority planners; more by parents and school governors, fewer by local-authority bureaucrats.<b>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> Put that way, perhaps, it all seems fine. But decentralisation also means diversity. That is something that the welfare state's beneficiaries are unused to. People are accustomed to thinking of their rights within the system as uniform entitlements, measured not by the cost of providing the service (which has been no concern of theirs) but by the outcome. Suppose a patient with a good <font size=-1>GP</font> gets a hip replacement within weeks whereas a patient with a bad one must wait months. In the traditional regime, that is an anomaly: you either hush it up or call for action from the centre. The quasi-market system works in the first place by making such differences more obvious, which is awkward enough. Then it proposes no external remedy: within limits, the market is intended to heal itself. From a politician's point of view, this is to go from bad to worse. His role has shrunk. There is little or no place, if the model is fully developed, for a grand, politically accountable, harmoniser of services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A welfare state that relied more on markets would probably deliver better standards and better value for money. But one wonders whether that would be a welfare state that Britain will ever want.
<p><bold>Alternative futures</bold>
<br>For now, it appears that nobody is about to offer Britain the choice; not in those terms, at any rate. The first big question about the future of the welfare state was, how much should it cost? New Labour's answer seems to be: about the same, measured as a share of national income, as now. That is the only answer consistent with the party's professed reluctance to raise taxes in the aggregate. Labour's provisional manifesto rightly says that as unemployment falls (which it is likely to, initially, under either sort of government), there will be room within the total for more spending on health and education. One supposes that the Tories, in contrast, would prefer to translate any such fiscal benefits into lower taxes. In the short-term, at least, the difference between these competing visions of the welfare state is puny.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More important, arguably, are the views the parties take on the second question about welfare: how are the services to be delivered? Again, however, the differences are slender. The Tories seem stuck half way between the traditional welfare state and a properly market-driven system. They lack the conviction to proceed, as though the radicalism that seized them in the late 1980s took them by surprise. New Labour seems equally confused. It denounces the <font size=-1>NHS</font> internal market in sternly moralising tones: "the corrosive ethics of the marketplace", and all that. It explicitly opposes vouchers in education, again as though competition taints what it touches. "We favour greater devolution for schools--but within a local, accountable service that ensures fairness and partnership between all schools 
<br>c." Make of that what you will.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What a pity that New Labour cannot seize its opportunity to marry a willingness to maintain spending on welfare with a vigorous commitment to use market systems of delivery. That would be a genuinely intriguing prospect. Labour would find it far easier to present the policy in the proper light--not an attempt to shave pennies, but an effort to improve services. Labour, one supposes, would also take greater care to weight the system in such as way as to limit cream-skimming, and preferably to go further, providing additional incentives to improve services to those most in need. There would be a real possibility of better services not merely for most people, but from top to bottom. Unfortunately, all the signs are that Labour's instinctive revulsion at market forces, though pretty well controlled when discussing the economy, is unquellable when it comes to the welfare state.

<h1> Power and the people </h1>

<i>The most contentious issues for the next government will be constitutional ones </i>

<p>NEW LABOUR is avowedly the party of constitutional reform. Its proposals include referendums on devolution for Scotland and Wales, and on electoral reform; procedural changes for the House of Commons and more radical reform of the Lords; a freedom of information act; and a bill of rights (to be achieved by embodying the European Convention on Human Rights into British law). The Tories, keen for once to emphasise their conservatism, are happy to agree that Labour is radical on the constitution--recklessly so, in fact. The British constitution, in their view, has worked well for centuries&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;envy of the world&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;mother of parliaments. Labour's tampering threatens to disturb its delicate equilibrium. Leave well alone. 

<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One can only admire the Tories' nerve in adopting this position. It is no exaggeration to say that since 1979 they have radically recast Britain's constitution. The adoption of quasi-markets within the welfare state is, properly understood, a constitutional change: in the provision of essential public services, the line of accountability between state and citizen has been redrawn, and in some cases deleted. Privatising the utilities was a constitutional change: what was once a matter of public policy (miners' pay, the price of a phone call) no longer is-- or is no longer supposed to be. Reforms in the civil service, notably the delegation of executive power to quasi-independent "agencies", are another profound constitutional change. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories have emasculated the local tier of government, through rate-capping, through the introduction of the uniform business rate, through their reforms in health and education, through the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering for local services, and in other ways. Altogether, it is hardly going too far to say that the Tories have abolished local government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And then, at the other extreme, there is Europe. The Tories signed the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, both of which fundamentally altered the constitution. In many areas of policy, the executive powers of European institutions now hold sway in Britain. The role of the British Parliament and executive in framing many of the new laws that affect British citizens is limited, obscure and, even within its narrow purview, ineffective. In 1979 Britain was ruled from London--to be precise, from Whitehall. Today, for good or ill, it is ruled from Brussels as well. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories, then, have been zealots for constitutional change. But they have evinced a marked reluctance to discuss or defend these reforms in constitutional terms. Instead they have justified them, by and large, as aspects of their pursuit of efficiency--meaning economic efficiency. That was the rationale for quasi-markets, for privatisation, for civil-service and local-government reform, even for European integration (on this view, the mere handmaiden of regional free trade). They have failed to address the constitutional issues. These are, first, the question of subsidiarity--how much power should there be at different levels of government? And second, the question of accountability--how should the people who come to exercise that power be made answerable to citizens<b>
<p>The centre holds and holds?
<br></b>Almost all of those who criticise the Tories for their constitutional changes complain of the reforms' relentless tendency towards centralisation, towards increasing the power of ministers at the expense of other seats of power. The charge is true, but only up to a point. A constitutional (as opposed to economic) defence of the Tory reforms could run as follows. In most cases the underlying goal was not to centralise political power but to disperse it so widely that it ceased to be political power at all. The goal, in other words, was to shrink the realm of politics. The principle of subsidiarity holds that decisions are best taken as near as possible to the people they will affect. But once you take this seriously, you see that many decisions can be pushed so far down that they fall outside the scope of politics altogether.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If parents have no choice but to send their child to the neighbourhood school run by the local authority, then how the children are taught, and many other aspects of what is correctly termed education "policy", are plainly political matters. If parents are free to send their child to any of a range of schools, each with control over staffing, resources and teaching methods, what is left for politics, local or otherwise, to do? Devise the national curriculum, perhaps; monitor and certify, no doubt. But the realm of politics has been diminished. Recourse to the market mechanism does not, in principle, centralise political power; in cases such as this, it begins to make it redundant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most political commentators, unsurprisingly, are keen on politics. In their view, the more you have, the better. In the same way, accountability is something you can never have too much of. A healthy civil society is one that is perpetually engaged in collective debate to settle every question that matters--and this is obviously a political endeavour. Seen this way, the market mechanisms favoured by the Tories are at a great disadvantage: judged in constitutional terms, they have the lethal defect of being undemocratic. But people also need to ask how much politics they want.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a liberal society, it is surely a step forward in constitutional as well as in economic terms that a miner's pay, or the price of electricity, should be settled in a market, undemocratically. Might the same not also be true of nurses' pay, or teaching methods, or how often your dustbins are emptied? A society in which these are political questions, as opposed to matters of private contract, is not necessarily a healthier society. In at least some of the areas where the Tories have reduced the political accountability of decision-makers to citizens, therefore, might it not be a good thing? Perhaps, in politics as elsewhere, less can mean better.
<br><b>
<p>Fine in theory
<br></b>Unfortunately, the Tories are inhibited in mounting any such line of defence. This is partly because, in some areas, their desire to concentrate political power at the centre was so obvious that it would be futile to deny it. Margaret Thatcher put local authorities (which are mostly Labour-controlled) as second only to trade unions on her list of enemies. They were most definitely not "one of us"--and were dealt with accordingly. More generally, the Tories' trouble is that so few of their reforms, economic virtues notwithstanding, separated the respective realms of politics and the market in an appealing or credible way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is apparent wherever you look. The privatised utilities were sold, by and large, as monopolies rather than as unbundled competing firms. As a result, they had to be regulated--and the regulator's task has been at least as politically sensitive as that of the departmental planners who previously oversaw the industries. In education and in health, the government's half-hearted recourse to quasi-markets has left ministers up to their elbows in decisions affecting the quality of service, the allocation of resources, levels of pay and all the rest. The work of the new "agencies" is regarded by nobody as lying outside politics--least of all by ministers. The separation of policy (ministers' responsibility) and operations (somebody else's) is hopelessly opaque. A businessman is made head of the prison service and then sacked for presuming to run it. The fiasco of the Child Support Agency is an embarrassment first and foremost to ministers: they are briefed in depth to answer questions on it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly, this inability to separate the spheres of state and market, of policy and operations, is due to ministers' own insistence on retaining power--for with power, contrary to rumour, comes responsibility. It is also due to the undoubted technical difficulty of creating quasi-markets and/or delegated agencies, reforms that go against the grain of British experience. If you believe that competition in the provision of public services is a good thing, you owe ministers some sympathy on that account. But it is lastly due--and here is the government's greatest difficulty--to the fact that Britain is, by inclination, an intensely political country with a strongly centralised political culture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;People want to blame the government for everything: mad-cow disease, child-killing maniacs, dirty beaches, dwindling fish stocks, escaped prisoners (and false convictions), the death of the novel (only 4,639 new titles published in Britain last year), crowded roads, declining theatre attendances, our disappointing performance in Atlanta and the crisis in Burundi. The "Today" programme's first choice of interviewee on any of those topics (and a million others) would be a minister, who will be called to account for the government's mistakes and who will, in all likelihood, turn up and say something. Even if the government wanted to stand aside, desirable as it is in many cases that it should, people wouldn't let it. Far from being accountable for less, as critics usually charge, the government is held answerable, much as it ever was, for everything.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proposals for further constitutional reform need to keep in mind, as the Tories' inadvertently revolutionary plans failed to, that national politics is Britain's favourite spectator sport. Labour's assurances on restoring the powers of local government (or, as for some reason Mr Blair prefers to call it, "local civic government") do indeed reflect this reality. For a start, Labour's leader appears to share the authoritarian tendencies of Margaret Thatcher: as far as possible, one imagines, he will want local government to do what he wants, not what local councillors want. Moreover, Mr Blair appears to understand that central government will be blamed for anything that goes wrong in local government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is presumably why the provisional manifesto promises to end "crude" council-tax capping (but not council-tax capping that isn't crude). It explains why local authorities would be allowed to spend their capital receipts for council-house sales, but only under strict supervision as to timing and use. Compulsory tendering will go (a boon to public-sector unions), but councils will be watched to see that they achieve value for money. "It is not for central government to dictate every detail of local service provision," Labour says, "but it must establish the framework." Labour seems hardly more likely than another Tory administration to restore the role of local government.
<br><b>
<p>The realm of the impossible
<br></b>Britain's most pressing, and intractable, constitutional problem is Northern Ireland. Here, Labour and the Tories have come to an even closer meeting of minds. Labour's proto-manifesto says nothing on the subject except to reaffirm its commitment to the bipartisan approach of recent months. To those unfamiliar with Ulster's perpetual enmities, this detente may seem surprising--because the policy has hardly been a great success. And however much the government might deny it, one of the reasons why the policy has faltered is that the prime minister has had to rely on one of Ulster's contending sectarian factions for Parliamentary support. Even if that has not swayed his decisions, it has made it impossible for the government to play its chosen role of honest broker.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government, or its successor, needs to rethink its policy. The "peace process" was founded on the premise that the province's political parties (including Sinn Fein) could be gently guided to agree among themselves to a settlement--that way it would be, as it were, their own settlement. This was worth a try, but it now seems doubtful that such an approach can succeed. Ulster's political parties are too extremist and uncompromising--more so (one hopes) than most of the people they represent. At some point, the government will have to offer a constitutional settlement (of the kind anticipated in the agreement on the Anglo-Irish framework) directly to Northern Ireland's people, for their approval in a referendum, without the poisonous intermediation of the province's politicians.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On Scotland, in contrast, Labour and the Tories part company in the most dramatic way. Mr Blair's plans for Scottish devolution are much more radical than anything he proposes for local-government reform. And yet they betray a similar hesitation over the question of subsidiarity. The party proposes an elected assembly with severely limited tax-raising powers. The case for an elected body of some kind is very strong: opinion polls say that most Scots want it, and many areas of policy are already dealt with on an exclusively regional basis through the Scottish Office. But why limit the assembly's tax-raising powers? The answer is that Labour fears it will be blamed if Scotland's parliament votes to put taxes up sharply--and it is probably right. Yet the logic of devolution surely requires that Scotland's representatives vote the taxes that will pay for their spending. To separate the two threatens to make the Scottish parliament a mere pressure group for more spending at others' expense--call it the English-local-government model.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That in itself would increase friction within the union. To make matters worse, Labour has no answer to the West Lothian question: why should Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s be able to vote at Westminster on English domestic matters when English <font size=-1>MP</font>s cannot vote on Scottish ones? It is wrong to dismiss this as a constitutional nicety of no wider significance. Circumstances are easy to envisage in which Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s hold the balance of power in Westminster, and vote through controversial legislation which affects England and Wales, but not Scotland. This would be not so much a nicety as an outrage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Scottish devolution, much demanded by Scots, is to succeed, Labour will have to think harder about questions of constitutional justice. Any assembly should have matching powers to tax and spend; and the role of Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s at Westminster will have to be correspondingly curtailed. Finding a fair way to do that is easier said than done. Merely denying Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s the right to speak or vote on "English" matters could well cause deadlock, with the government secure in its overall majority yet unable to pass laws for England. A better solution, arguably, would simply be to reduce the number of Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s. At any rate, Labour must spell all this out before its ideas on devolution can be judged.
<p><b>Making the best of a unitary state</b>
<br>The principle of subsidiarity has much to commend it, within the United Kingdom as well as within Europe (of which more in a moment). Britain's polity would be a healthier one if decisions on collective spending and the means to pay for them were pushed to lower levels--provided that popular discussion and deliberation moved down at the same time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the case of Scottish devolution, this further requirement poses no great difficulty: Scotland is already a distinct political and cultural entity within the United Kingdom. In the case of local government in the rest of the country, it is doubtful that this necessary supporting culture exists, or whether it ever will. It might be worth the effort to attempt to create it. One possibility, mooted by Labour but not examined in any detail, would be to let cities elect mayors with executive powers. Innovations of that kind might be more promising than attempting to restore, partially and grudgingly, the pre-Thatcher functions of local authorities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Applying the principle of subsidiarity within Britain may be difficult. Applying the principle of accountability is both easier and more urgent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, Britain's constitution guarantees accountability through the concept of the sovereignty of Parliament. The government, meaning Parliament, faces few formal checks on its power. Unlike in most countries with written constitutions, for instance, the legislature and the judiciary are both joined to the executive: none provides a truly independent scrutiny of the others. No such scrutiny is needed, the theory goes, because political power in Britain is vested in the House of Commons--a directly elected, and hence directly accountable, body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguably, this view once made sense. Today, it certainly does not. Over the years, the sovereignty of Parliament has been corrupted; it has become instead the sovereignty of cabinet, a profoundly undemocratic idea. Exercising immense powers of patronage and intimidation, ministers rule the House of Commons, and hence the country. Parliament no longer even makes a plausible pretence of curbing the executive. Partly thanks to party discipline, its debates are a pitiful charade, and its committees are for the most part ineffective. The Tories' reluctance to countenance reform is hard to understand: the case for change seems unanswerable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crucial things are to strengthen the judiciary and the House of Commons at the expense of the prime minister and cabinet. Two of Labour's ideas, worthy of enthusiastic support, would do this. Incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into British law would give judges a clearer role as scrutineers of the executive. And a freedom of information act would make it easier for the Commons, not to mention ordinary citizens, to keep an eye on the government. Labour also talks (vaguely, as yet) of further steps to reform the Commons. Such steps would be welcome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If <font size=-1>MP</font>s are to be constitutionally effective rather than merely ornamental, their job must be made interesting and useful, not just something that the able and ambitious must endure until a ministerial post turns up. Serving as an <font size=-1>MP</font> should no longer be regarded as a part-time job. Reflecting that, <font size=-1>MP</font>s should be given more responsibility and more pay--and be forbidden to accept other employment. Every <font size=-1>MP</font> should have an office and adequate access to research staff. It should be possible for somebody to spend his or her entire political career as an <font size=-1>MP</font>, and yet be regarded as a great success. If Parliament could offer that, it would greatly reduce the power of prime-ministerial patronage. And there is plenty of useful work for a more professional cadre of <font size=-1>MP</font>s to do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In enlarging the duties of Parliament, the role of committees is crucial. Their powers to scrutinise the executive should be broadened. Ministerial appointments to agencies and other quangos could be subject to confirmation by the relevant committee, for instance; and, once appointed, heads of such bodies could be required to present themselves regularly for questioning. Chairmen of committees should be paid extra. They and their fellow members should have their own lawyers to help them draft amendments to laws under scrutiny. Committees should be appointed by the whole house, and not by party whips. Reform of the Lords is less urgent, perhaps, than reform of the Commons, but there can be no serious objection to Labour's proposal to deny hereditary peers their right to sit and vote there: that right has no place in a liberal democracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's other big idea on the constitution is electoral reform. But the provisional manifesto is terse to the point of invisibility on the subject--"We will provide a referendum on voting reform" is its discussion of the matter in full. Mr Blair has said he is doubtful about the merits of proportional representation; expect him, and many of his Parliamentary colleagues, to become a lot more doubtful if they win a big majority in the general election. Certain forms of proportional representation do seem extremely attractive. But it would be churlish to criticise Labour too harshly for its equivocation on the subject. Their ideas about Scottish devolution need to be repaired, but otherwise their thinking on constitutional reform far surpasses that of the Tories, who show little sign of having thought about the matter at all.

<h1> The reluctant European </h1>

<i>No less than its partners, Britain needs a clearer view of what the European Union is for </i>

<p>IN ONE way, the charge that the Tories bring nothing but a dull complacency to the debate on constitutional reform is unfair (quite apart from the fact that their record as constitutional revolutionaries belies their soothing words). Europe, after all, is a constitutional matter. You might argue, in fact, that the constitutional issues it raises are more important and more difficult than any others currently facing Britain. It would be too kind to say that the Tories are thinking hard about this subject; they are too busy shouting at each other to be giving the matter much thought. But you can hardly accuse them of ignoring it. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's next government will have to confront two big questions about the country's future within the European Union. The first and more immediate is what part, if any, Britain should play in the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s plans to create a single European currency. The other, less urgent but in the end more important, concerns integration in the broader political sense: how far, if at all, should Britain join others in pursuing the idea, enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, of an "ever closer union"?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The questions are obviously connected--but not so inextricably as is generally supposed. With no significant exceptions, people who want closer political integration in the <font size=-1>EU</font> also favour the euro (which is what the single currency will be called). Indeed, they want the euro less for its economic benefits, such as they may be, than because it would be in their view a big step towards that grander political goal. In the same way, again with no large exceptions, those who oppose the euro do so less for its supposed economic costs than because it would, they say, advance the cause of political integration. Nearly everyone with a strong view about the euro, for or against, agrees that the issue is inseparable from the question of political union. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a pity. There is a respectable economic case for creating a single currency in Europe. Respectable, and unexciting. Judged in economic terms, no plausible estimate of the balance of costs and benefits could be big enough, one way or the other, to arouse passions like those excited by political union. This may explain why the question is rarely examined except in that larger context. The fact remains, it would be entirely possible to have the euro without further political integration. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The classical (ie, pre-1914) gold standard was just such a system. It worked well for decades, without it even occurring to anyone that irretrievably fixed exchange rates might require the pooling of political sovereignty, harmonised fiscal policy or harmonised anything else. All that was required was the shared conviction that the value of money was not something which governments were free to manipulate. Plainly, that conviction has vanished, a fact that certainly alters the prospects for any new monetary union. For this and other reasons, the classical gold standard does not make a compelling case for the single currency--but it should at least disturb the certainty of those who say that political and monetary union are inseparable.
<p><b>A close-run thing</b>
<br>The single currency has two main economic advantages. The first is the range of gains that may be grouped under the heading of "transactions costs". This is not just a matter of avoiding the traveller's commission costs of switching from one money to another at the border: in the bigger scheme of things, these are trivial. Far more important are the risks that fluctuations in exchange rates add to the cost of doing business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is true that some kinds of currency-risk can be hedged in the financial markets, at a cost. But a long-term investment in Germany, say, remains riskier for a British or Italian company than it is for a German one. The single currency would remove this impediment to the operation of the single market. Those who say that costs of this kind are small enough to ignore are saying, in effect, that the American economy would lose little if each of its states had its own currency--an improbable claim.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The euro's other main benefit would be conditional: as long as the new monetary institutions were well designed and did their job properly, the benefits of low inflation would be spread more widely in Europe than before. The blueprint for the institutions is still vague on some important matters; in any case, it will be impossible to judge the competence of the central bank until it has been tested in practice. Nonetheless, the potential to improve on the record of domestic, politically driven monetary policy is there, and should commend the euro particularly to countries with a proven record of incompetence in the field. If that category has any members, Britain (the leading euro-sceptic) is certainly one. By the same token, Germany (a leading euro-enthusiast) has less to gain than most of its partners. That goes to show how much political factors have driven what could and should have been a mainly economic debate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against these substantial advantages must be weighed one big cost: the single currency would deny its members the independent use of monetary policy. Clearly, even a country that has been bad at monetary policy loses something valuable when it gives up the right to set its own interest rates. If a recession struck that country but not the rest of the <font size=-1>EU</font>, its interest rates (set by the single central bank) would be too high, and its slowdown would be worse than it needed to be. This is an important point, but against it note that most recessions (the Tories' two are examples) are caused by earlier mistakes in domestic monetary policy. You need to ask whether national monetary policy would be better for Britain than the euro over the whole course of the economic cycle, rather than saying "Assume a recession: what happens then?" It is a poor case for national monetary policy that you need it to mitigate the recession it created in the first place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many other arguments often made against the euro are simply wrong. The most common fallacy is that a single currency would "lock in" differences in living standards across the community. By condemning the poorer countries to stay poor, it is further argued, the euro would add to demands for centralised fiscal policy aimed at narrowing the differences. Here lies the main supposed link between monetary union and political union. But the economic premise of this argument--that devaluing your currency shifts real resources into your country, thereby helping you to grow faster--is patently false. Devaluation does no such thing. At its theoretical best, it is a way to ease adjustment pains through the course of the economic cycle, not a way to raise long-term living standards. In practice, it would be harder to think of an idea that has been more conclusively refuted by the facts than the claim that devaluation makes you richer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, one other argument, which for some reason euro-sceptics mention much less often than the devaluationist fallacy, does call for greater caution in Britain's case than in most other countries. As noted earlier, Britain's economy responds far more sensitively to changes in interest rates than most others do. More than elsewhere, people in Britain own the houses they live in and finance the purchase by borrowing at floating rates. This is the legacy of chronic inflation. In the past, buying a house was the best hedge against inflation that most people could find (after tax, no other form of saving preserved its value so well); lenders, for their part, demanded floating rates because the monetary future was so uncertain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the causes, the result is that even a modest change in interest rates in Britain is a big political event with a perceptible financial effect (for good or ill) on very many households. As a result, the political context for monetary policy is different from that in Germany or France. The Maastricht treaty's criteria for membership of the euro system require "convergence" in various ways: some of these criteria are beside the point, others harmful. The one thing above all on which convergence is advisable is sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The treaty doesn't mention it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Britain, then, the economic pros and cons of the single currency are finely balanced. But the decisive point, for now, is that the idea is widely unpopular: no such undertaking should go ahead (anywhere in Europe, not just in Britain) without strong popular support based on an understanding of the risks and why they may be worth taking. But since that test could one day be met, and since the euro has the potential to be a good thing, Britain should not oppose it on principle, still less rule out membership for all time and under any circumstances-- the hysterical demand of the Tory sceptics. Britain has its opt-out; it can wait and see what happens. That is John Major's policy and Tony Blair's as well. There can be no sensible objection to it.
<p><b>Wider still and deeper</b>
<br>The trouble is, a policy of "watchful waiting" can be difficult to distinguish from one of "we don't know what we think, and never will." However sensible it may be for Britain to bide its time on the euro, the country and its politicians ought surely by now to have worked out what Britain's broader place in Europe should be. The bitterness of the Tory party's split over Europe, and the signs that similar (if less intense) divisions are latent in the Labour Party, show how far that is from being true.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Collectively, Britain remains emotionally at arm's length from Europe: the very word still means "them" more often than it means "us". The comic aspects of this posture--as when the Tory government sought to blame "Europe" for Britain's mad cow scare--should not disguise the harm it may do. A discussion about Europe's future is going on. Britain should be fully engaged in that discussion, not jeering uselessly from the sidelines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scepticism about the course set for Europe by the Maastricht treaty is fully warranted. History may judge that the European Community (as it then was) took a wrong turn when, in response to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, it sought to integrate more deeply rather than, as a higher priority, prepare itself to accept new members. Moreover, this decision came not in response to the demands of citizens, but was the expression of a grand political strategy. Public opinion was expected to catch up in due course.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulties that many governments encountered in ratifying the Maastricht treaty--not least, the wafer-thin support for it in the French referendum--showed how ill-advised this top-down approach had been. The lesson from that period for leaders intent on deeper integration ought to have been: go slower, build support first. Judging by the renewed promises in France and Germany to secure monetary union within the Maastricht timetable, despite lukewarm backing at best from their electorates, the lesson has not yet been learned.
<p><b>A place for Britain</b>
<br>So in the debate about the future of the <font size=-1>EU</font>, it is well that Britain's voice should be heard. Its traditional pragmatism, its scepticism about grand designs, and (post-Thatcher) its more liberal instincts on economic policy have much to commend them. Britain should be arguing vigorously, in others' interests as well as its own, for several things.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most urgently, the <font size=-1>EU</font> needs to produce a working definition of "subsidiarity". Following the Maastricht-ratification trauma, various attempts were made to lend substance to the idea, to appease those who feared that the treaty moved too much power to Europe's centre. But the thinking remains vague, albeit much wordier than before, and it continues to emphasise the "effectiveness" of policy as a criterion for deciding where power should reside. A better formula would define subsidiarity in terms that would take powers to the centre only when that was absolutely necessary, not merely when it was "more effective".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A definition along these lines, once developed, should be written into a simple new constitution for the <font size=-1>EU</font>. That would have other merits. The doctrine of "ever closer union" for all the members served its purpose during the years when the European Community was under construction. But a point must come, and probably now has, when such an idea costs more in destabilising existing arrangements than it gains in improving them. In other words, a point must come when Europe's union is close enough. A constitution would be obliged to define that point, and would require governments to build a consensus around it. As part of that exercise, defects of the present regime could be addressed--in particular, the widening of the "democratic deficit", as powers have moved to the centre without adequate accountability to citizens. Beyond that, the implications of "variable geometry"--the idea that in future some countries will integrate more closely than others--also need to be thought through.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On constitutional matters like these, Britain should be arguing its corner. Similarly on matters of policy--the future of the common agricultural policy (<font size=-1>CAP</font>), the Union's external trade relations, co-operation on defence, enlargement, you name it--Britain's voice should be heard. But Britain cannot expect its sceptical-liberal instincts or the merits of its particular arguments to be warmly recognised by its partners unless the country regards itself as a settled member of the club. After all these years, it still isn't. Britain's prevailing attitude often seems one of sneering contempt for all things continental. Lately, national politics has stirred such ideas even more to the surface. Much of the commentary on Europe offered by Tory Euro-sceptics and their supporters in the media is outright xenophobia. In the country's discussion of Europe since the government's humiliation in the <font size=-1>EMS</font> crisis of 1992, a puerile and insufferable smugness about Britain has once again become not merely respectable but fashionable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such sentiments are damaging as well as ugly. Warranted scepticism about further ambitions for European integration needs to be balanced by an understanding of the gains Britain has had from the European project. The greatest of these--long neglected only because the European Community allowed one to take it for granted--is security. A region riven this century by two appalling wars is now one of the safest parts of the world. Beside that immense prize the economic achievements of European integration are bound to seem small, but by any other yardstick they too are impressive. Trade in Europe has grown enormously since the 1970s, expanding opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. Britain has fared especially well lately, because its position within the <font size=-1>EU</font>, together with its friendly business climate, has attracted a lot of inward investment (see <a href="chart10.gif">chart 10</a>).
<p><b>By jingo</b>
<br>That many in Britain welcome these achievements so grudgingly, if at all, doubtless says more about post-imperial chagrin than it does about the defects of the <font size=-1>EU</font>. As a medium-sized economic and military power, Britain still has some growing up to do. But what a dilemma this poses at the next election. A substantial minority of Tories is intellectually paralysed by its hatred of "Europe". It is hard to imagine a Tory government advancing with any success a sensible agenda for reform of Europe's policies and institutions--simply because the good faith of any Tory government is bound to be questioned, and rightly, by other Europeans.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, New Labour seems a much better bet. Its proto-manifesto says: "If we can build alliances with those in Europe who share our views we can achieve a Europe that is open, outward-looking and anti-protectionist." Gosh, marvellous. Labour also wants reform of the <font size=-1>CAP</font>, greater openness in Europe's institutions and "a far more vigorous approach to the single market". Better and better. But then it goes and spoils everything. At the top of Europe's agenda for reform, says New Labour, should be "action on unemployment".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What? This is not a reference to the need for a Europe-wide monetary policy (reasonably enough, Labour reserves its position on the single currency). So it can only mean that Labour seeks Europe-wide initiatives on labour-market measures aimed to promote employment. This is arrant nonsense. Such measures as may be advisable are either national initiatives (changes in taxes, benefits, education and training) or local (subsidies or other forms of special assistance, say, tailored to meet the needs of a particular area). Europe-wide policy is singularly ill-fitted to play any useful role. Indeed, in so far as the <font size=-1>EU</font> has a Europe-wide policy on labour markets--the social chapter--it is actually a destroyer of jobs; and Labour has said that Britain should surrender its opt-out from it. This implies not merely that Labour fails to understand unemployment but also that it regards a wider range of action for European policy as a good thing in itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A fine choice, then. The Tories have, for the most part, sound anti-statist prejudices and broadly the right economic ideas, but they carry an intellectually and diplomatically debilitating strain of jingoism. Labour seems to have a clearer view of Britain's place in the modern world, but favours damaging interventionist remedies in areas of policy where the <font size=-1>EU</font> has no useful role.

<h1> An <i>Economist</i> manifesto </h1>

<i>A few ideas </i>

<p>FOR the moment, <i>The Economist</i> has no plans to run for office. But you never know. If we were to seek a mandate for government, what might our manifesto say? To begin with, of course, it would deplore the intellectual incoherence and weak leadership of the present government. Tradition demands as much and, on this occasion, the charges are fair. No doubt we would also deplore the intellectual incoherence and dishonest leadership of the main opposition party. Again, one could do no less. As to our own policies, the highlights of our programme would be as follows. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On macroeconomic policy, we would emphasise the folly of risking a rise in inflation for a temporary surge in growth: that way lies higher unemployment. Recognising the bias for inflation that is built into Britain's political culture, we would grant the Bank of England independence to determine interest rates, and give it a statutory duty to keep inflation below 3% a year. (A vote in Parliament could change that target in extraordinary circumstances.) The tradition of levying taxes sufficient to cover spending over the medium term would be revived, not as an end in itself but because it is the best way to keep interest rates down and investment up at any given level of economic activity. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On industrial policy, we could be brief: there wouldn't be one. Our view is that companies themselves are better equipped to make decisions on investment, staffing, location, working practices and the rest than the government. The goal of industrial policy, such as it is, should be to get out of their way. There would be but two small exceptions. We would aim to promote competition more vigorously than the Tories have done. (This would mean, among other things, changing the remit of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission so that its task was defined more narrowly in terms of promoting competition rather than, as at present, balancing that goal against the "public interest".) And we would take further steps to increase (not reduce, as Labour seems to favour) the accountability of managers to shareholders. Beyond that, we would privatise the postal service, the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, and any other enterprises we found remaining in public ownership and/or control. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our priorities in employment policy would be to lower taxes on the working poor, and to institute a marked shift in education spending away from universities (where students would be obliged to pay their own way) and towards vocational training for 16-18-year-olds. No minimum wage, no social chapter, no other initiatives calculated to put people out of work. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We would aim to increase public spending on primary and secondary education. Here, and across the welfare state, "internal markets" would be developed with greater determination, using vouchers and other methods to improve providers' accountability to users. The Tories' policy of squeezing the state pension (which Labour is not pledged to change) would be explicitly embraced as a long term policy of abolition. Personal taxes would be reformed to encourage people to save for their own retirement. In due course, we would introduce a mandatory, state-subsidised, saving-for-retirement scheme, using competing private pension funds. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, and in the long term, we would aim to keep the taxpayer-cost of the welfare state on a gently falling trend as a proportion of national income--an extremely demanding goal that allows for very little growth of spending in real terms. Except in the priority areas of education and training, therefore, pressures of the sort applied since 1979 would need to be maintained or increased. Even then, the scope for lower taxes would be limited. We would concentrate the savings on tax cuts for the low paid, aiming to take gradually increasing numbers out of income tax altogether. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are constitutional reformers. Unlike Labour, and supposing the Scots vote for it in a referendum, we would give Scotland a parliament with matching control over taxes and domestic spending; the rights of Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s to sit and vote at Westminster would be correspondingly curtailed. (Wales would be offered the same arrangement, in the confident expectation that it would not want it.) On Northern Ireland, the constitutional settlement indicated in the government's framework document would be more resolutely pursued. The strategy of allowing the province's political parties to reach such an accord in their own good time would be abandoned: a settlement would be put directly to the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are sceptical about a bigger role for local government in Britain: many of the traditional tasks of this tier (notably education) can be brought more closely under users', rather than local bureaucrats', control. Elsewhere, it is doubtful that local communities have strong enough identities to support a healthy local politics. But we recognise that it is desirable to foster stronger local communities and would support local initiatives aimed at developing them, provided they were locally financed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We would introduce a bill of rights and a freedom of information act. We would reform the Commons to increase the power of <font size=-1>MP</font>s, and especially committees of <font size=-1>MP</font>s, in relation to ministers. We regard other proposals for constitutional reform as much less important than measures such as these. Nonetheless, we favour denying hereditary peers the right to sit or vote in the House of Lords; further reform of the Lords would be considered. We will reveal our plans on electoral reform when we see how big our majority is. Labour says: "We have no plans to replace the monarchy." We do. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On Europe, our policy would be one of constructive engagement. We are in the European Union, glad to be there, and have strong views about how it should develop from now on. We regard the single market as a remarkable and valuable achievement, and we wish to see its benefits spread more widely (by including new members in Eastern Europe). Scrapping the common agricultural policy is a top priority. So is liberalising the union's external trade policy. Further political integration is undesirable. Subject to that, we have an open mind on <font size=-1>EMU</font>: even if Britain chooses not to join soon, or ever, we recognise the potential of the project to do good and want it to succeed.
<p><b>Send your contributions to&#160;. &#160;. &#160;.</b>
<br>How such a manifesto might fare in a general election must remain (fortunately) a matter for speculation. With apologies to Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalists, Plaid Cymru, Greens and what have you, the big choice that Britain will shortly make will be between another term for the Tories and a new start with New Labour. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>The Economist</i> doesn't have a vote either, but if it did how would we cast it? We disagree with the Tories about many things, but our biggest quarrel with them is over constitutional reform. Their complacency on the subject is deplorable. We also disagree with many of Labour's plans, but especially over industry and employment. In these areas, Labour's policies are much less dangerous than they used to be, but the desire to meddle harmfully (the minimum wage, the social chapter, managers' responsibilities to "stakeholders") has not entirely gone away. For different reasons, we regard both parties as hopelessly unsound on Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that is to speak only of the parties' expressed goals. The choice between the Tories and New Labour is a confusing one because, although the parties affect to despise each other, their policies sound pretty similar. If New Labour's conversion is to be believed, the forthcoming election does not matter much after all. But is it to be believed? By and large, this survey has judged the Tories according to what they have done up to now, and Labour by what they say they will do. Yet ballots are cast on the basis not of what the parties say, but of what people expect them actually to do. In Labour's case, this credibility gap is already large, and may well grow larger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of those who believe that Mr Blair will yield to the left in office, at least as many will vote Labour on that account as will vote Tory. Labour's traditional supporters, the millions who voted for the party when its policies were crazy, will support it next time in the hope that, once in power, it will drop the modish new talk about enterprise and initiative and get down to its rightful business of soaking the rich. If Labour wins, it will be because those voters act in concert with others, courted so assiduously by Mr Blair, who believe that the party will not relapse. To hold such a curious coalition together until polling-day would be a political masterstroke: to maintain it much beyond then would require a political genius.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But perhaps Mr Blair <i>is</i> a political genius. Without a doubt, what appeals most about New Labour is that the party is superbly led. Mr Blair is forceful and passionate. His manner, if not his manifesto, radiates purpose and conviction. John Major may have broadly the right policies (as New Labour seems to agree), but as a leader he is a sorry sight. The harder he tries to project a big idea--and he has had so many--the more ridiculous he becomes. The country is sick of him and so, frankly, are we. Who gets our vote? We're still thinking about it, but we will be sure to let you know in good time.

<h1>The birth of a new species</h1>


<i>Software is a booming industry controlled by giants. But the Internet is changing the rules to favour the small and nimble, argues Christopher Anderson</i>

<p>ABOUT 570m years ago, in the ancient oceans of the early earth, something odd happened. In the space of just a few million years, the seas, which had previously held only microscopic organisms, exploded with a huge variety of life, from a metre-long armoured slab of a fish with a mouth like a rubbish disposal chute to a bizarre beast that walked on 14 stilts and had seven mouths on stalks. For the next few hundred million years, evolution progressed at its usual stately pace. Then, 225m years ago, something else odd happened. Perhaps an asteroid hit the planet; scientists cannot agree. Whatever it was, it caused 96% of marine species to disappear and dinosaurs to appear. There followed another uneventful interval, until 65m years ago it was suddenly out with the dinosaurs and in with the large mammals, including, eventually, man.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sort of progression, described beautifully in Stephen Jay Gould's "Wonderful Life", is called "punctuated equilibrium". Over millions of years species adapt to fill every imaginable niche. Then along comes some external force--a volcano, an asteroid, an ice age--that changes all the niches and launches a mad scramble for survival. Evolution favours new forms of life that, through a sort of biological lateral thinking, can find a whole new way to thrive. Wings, legs, lungs: all were revolutionary mutations once. Life down the ages has tended to evolve in sudden great leaps, separated by long periods of slow change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same is true for technology, though the time scale is a little more compressed. In the past half-century, computer technology has evolved in three large jumps, each one followed by an explosion of new companies, a period of rapid change, and then the gradual emergence of a few dominant species that rule until the next digital disturbance. Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset, a Spanish philosopher, once said that "a revolution lasts only 15 years, a period that coincides with the effectiveness of a generation." As it happens, computer revolutions have taken place at roughly the same intervals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Start around 1950, with the <font size=-1>IBM</font> mainframe, when the term "data processing" entered the language. The next big upheaval came in the mid-1960s, when the minicomputer arrived to open the computing market to a host of upstarts such as Digital Equipment, and programmers--the spiritual fathers of today's code geeks--started to abandon their ties. Then, in 1981, <font size=-1>IBM</font> introduced the personal computer, causing a market explosion from which emerged some of today's strongest companies: Intel, Microsoft, Compaq.
</p><p><b>Tomorrow's dinosaurs</b>
<br>Now the time has come round for another shock, duly delivered in the shape of the Internet, which has emerged practically overnight from 25 years of boffin obscurity into the light of mass-media ubiquity. It was made possible by the serendipitous convergence of three technological developments: the spread of <font size=-1>PC</font>s and computer networks in offices; a rapid drop in communications costs; and the appearance of the World Wide Web, a brilliantly simple way of linking multimedia documents around the world over the Internet. But there was nothing planned about it: it grew, organically, simply because people used it, each adding to its reach and depth by virtue of the parts of their world they brought to it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet will shake up plenty of established industries, from telecoms to travel. It is everywhere, it is cheap, and it is, above all, open. For the price of a dinner for two a month, any company can now reach the world through a virtual shopfront on the Internet that will look just as impressive as the one used by General Motors. Cheap, global data communications will shape the 21st century as much as the telephone did the 20th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Doerr, one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capitalists, has calculated that the introduction of the <font size=-1>PC</font> caused the largest creation of wealth in the history of the planet; just Microsoft, Intel and Compaq between them have a market valuation of $130 billion, more than all the film studios in Hollywood, or all of America's television and cable companies. Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, one of the computer industry's most respected analysts, reckons that the Internet has the potential to become even bigger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The starting point for realising that potential is the software industry. The Internet is mostly software. The big advantage of today's digital world is that machines--from <font size=-1>PC</font>s to telecoms networks--can assume radically different shapes when they are colonised by new code. The Internet consists largely of the existing telephone and office data networks linked up by Internet software, which runs over their lines and equipment. Just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> was little more than an exotic novelty before the appearance of Lotus <font size=-1>1-2-3</font>, a spreadsheet that helped to change companies, so the Internet lay in the shadows until the arrival of software that could give it wings, from Web browsers to Internet telephones, payment schemes and search services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But just as software has transformed the Internet, so the Internet will transform software. This is not just because software is the ultimate information industry, tailor-made for distribution through the digital ether. Software has also reached its dinosaur age, ripe for transformation. The success of Microsoft, Oracle, <font size=-1>IBM</font>/Lotus, Computer Associates and other giants marks out a relatively mature industry, as rooted in the past as in the future (see <a href="tsu442.gif">table</a>). For example, to maintain compatibility with older programs, Windows 95 must include millions of lines of code carrying the ghost of Windows past, and of the <font size=-1>DOS</font> operating system before it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With revenues of more than $200 billion and a growth rate of some 13% a year, software is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries. Even so, it has recently been in danger of becoming a rather dull and closed club. In the early 1980s, when the <font size=-1>PC</font> was still new, the niches it opened up seemed innumerable. In 1983 Philippe Kahn, then a recent arrival in America from France, started Borland, a programming-tools company, by convincing a computer magazine to run his ad on credit. A month later, he had 100,000 orders and the beginnings of a company that would at its peak be worth $2.1 billion. Making software did not require a factory, just an idea and a computer. It was an exciting time when many software fortunes were started up. Today the tally includes half a dozen dollar billionaires and several thousand millionaires.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But for most of the 1990s, software has increasingly been dominated by big companies making big, complicated programs. At a time when the operating system that comes with each <font size=-1>PC</font> already includes a word processor, e-mail, all the disk utilities you might ever need, and even a few games, it has become hard to imagine much of a role for a handful of enthusiasts in the proverbial garage.

</p><p><b>Glamour stock</b>
<br>Now, suddenly, the fun is back. Last August Netscape Communications, a software firm then 14 months old, went public, triggering a stockmarket frenzy that at its height valued the firm at $6.7 billion--before it had made a single dime. Software firms that had not even existed two years earlier, such as CyberCash, Yahoo, Spyglass, Spry and Ubique, commanded huge sums as they went public or were bought by established firms. Broadview Associates, a consultancy, in 1995 recorded mergers and acquisitions worth $28 billion in the software and related services industry, a rise of more than 60% on the year before. Venture capital investments in software firms hit $1.2 billion, up 57% (see <a href="csu343.gif">chart</a>). Nobody knows just how many software firms have been founded in the past year, but everybody is sure it must be more than 1,000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put it down to the Internet. It will change the software industry even more, this survey will argue, than the <font size=-1>PC</font> did a decade and a half ago. Just like the <font size=-1>PC</font> then, the Internet is a new "platform"--a fundamental technology on which a new market can be built. Platforms are not unique to the computer world: in the entertainment industry, for example, they include television and music <font size=-1>CD</font>s. All these are technological standards for products that will work everywhere the medium extends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A new platform by itself will not necessarily cause a revolution. Attics are full of odd computers that did not take off, along with digital audio tape, laser discs and other failures. New platforms are often troubled early on by a nasty chicken-and-egg problem: consumers will not buy them until lots of compatible products are available, and companies will not develop compatible products until they see a market. But the platforms that succeed can change the way most of us live. Once <font size=-1>VHS</font> had conquered Betamax in the videotape-standards war, sales skyrocketed. Within 15 years, more than three-quarters of American households had a video recorder. <font size=-1>CD</font> players took off even faster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PC</font> won acceptance because it was backed by a then-mighty <font size=-1>IBM</font>. Mostly by accident, the Internet has taken a stealthier tack. It achieved near-ubiquity on the back of existing computer and communications networks in part because it offered a uniform way to connect otherwise incompatible computers. Just as a modem turns a regular telephone line into a data link, the Internet turned the world's telephone networks into an information highway, without much extra effort or expense. Only now, with critical mass already attained, is this network revealed as a platform, too.

<h1>Back to the garage</h1>


<i>The best software revolutions start small</i>

<p>THE boffins in Switzerland who invented the World Wide Web in 1991 did not see fit to include such frivolities as clickable pictures or sound. It was a tool for scientists, who after all could read. Text was quite good enough, and would avoid wasting the Internet's scarce transmission capacity with graphics files simply for decoration.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took a 23-year-old programmer at the University of Illinois called Marc Andreessen to cast a vote for the common man. In 1993 he developed Mosaic, a multimedia Web "browser" that made it easy to view documents on the Web and jump between them. It was the first piece of Internet software to recognise that the network's future lay not with scientists but with ordinary people, who liked their information dressed up in multimedia frills. A year later Mr Andreessen joined up with Jim Clark, a wealthy computer industry entrepreneur, to launch Netscape and jump-start the Internet software market. Netscape's sophisticated browser quickly came to dominate the market (it has a share of more than 80% today), and is now a de-facto standard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As more and more companies, from banks to airlines, began to offer their products and services on the Web, the technology grew with the demand: documents began to look as good as paper, and then better, with animation and interactivity. Users began to realise that the Web could be a place to work, not just a way to distribute information. Already some investment firms let their customers manage their portfolios remotely via Web pages. Companies allow their employees to monitor their pensions the same way. In "intranets" within firms, Web browsers are being used to retrieve information from databases of all sorts, from customer records to inventories.

</p><p><b>Happy browsing</b>
<br>The attraction is simplicity. The language of the Web, known as <font size=-1>HTML</font>, is a "cross-platform" standard, a universal tongue, understood just as readily in the Windows and Macintosh worlds as by Unix workstations. The same is true of the Internet as a whole. Together, the network and its multimedia face have opened up a new way of computing, where the type of computer on your desk matters less than your connection to the Internet. In this world most information is stored and generated on powerful machines known as "servers" somewhere in the network. Your <font size=-1>PC</font>, running a browser, is simply a window on that world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape's browsers already run on most desktop computers. But similar browsers from other companies run on all sorts of other devices, from Philips video-games machines and Nokia's newest cellular telephones, to a "Network Computer" being developed by Oracle to sell at less than $500, and interactive television "set-top boxes". You might not want to run a spreadsheet on most of them, but people who need to run spreadsheets tend to have <font size=-1>PC</font>s already. These other machines have advantages the <font size=-1>PC</font> lacks. Some are cheap, some fit in a jacket pocket, and some play great games. No wonder computer visionaries such as George Gilder are prophesying the advent of a new computing world, less dominated by the <font size=-1>PC</font> or by a desktop computer of any kind: the Internet is not fussy about machinery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few years ago, when Federal Express wanted to give its customers the tools to track packages in real time, it had to develop software for their computers (in separate Windows and Macintosh versions), promote it, distribute disks, and arrange a network of dial-in numbers for customers to call. But when the Web came along, FedEx simply hitched the same database to a Web site, with nothing like the sort of effort it took to develop its own software. Now customers use whatever browser they have on whatever computer they are using to reach the Web site by whatever means they usually gain access to the Internet. No matter how they get there, the site looks and works the same: there is no new software to learn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By moving to a cross-platform, open computing standard, FedEx was able to get out of the desktop software development business, the telecommunications business and the software distribution business, none of which it wanted to be in, to concentrate on what it does best: shipping packages (although it still has to offer the old proprietary software for customers who are not on the Internet). Customers now track more than 13,000 packages a day on the Web site.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Netscape, this and similar stories from other companies looked like the emergence of a new platform. The further computing moved away from the <font size=-1>PC</font> and to the Web, the more Netscape's browser, not Microsoft's operating system, became the key link. Netscape claimed that Windows would eventually be reduced to an obscure bit of necessary plumbing in a <font size=-1>PC</font>, just as Windows subsumed <font size=-1>DOS</font>. Or, as Mr Andreessen once tauntingly predicted, the rise of the browser will turn Windows into "a partially debugged device driver", by implication downgrading Microsoft's beloved <font size=-1>PC</font> to the status of a printer or monitor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This tapped into a discontent already brewing in the software world. Over the past decade or so, many companies have switched from mainframes and minicomputers to <font size=-1>PC</font>s, in the hope that putting computing power directly into the hands of users would somehow unleash their creativity and make them more productive. It probably helped, even though the gains are hard to measure. What is showing up very clearly, however, is an unexpected side-effect: <font size=-1>PC</font>s have made life a lot tougher for corporate systems managers.

</p><p><b>Control freaks</b>
<br>In the days of the mainframe, programs ran from a central computer in some glass-enclosed room. Users simply had "dumb terminals" on their desks. The centralised control this implied may now be out of fashion with the management gurus, but for the systems managers it was bliss. There was just one copy of each program and just one configuration, safely locked out of reach of meddlesome users. Technicians did not have to spend their weekends moving from desk to desk upgrading software or fixing problems. And the software was often simpler, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, entire consulting industries have grown up to tackle the complexities of huge "client-server" systems. Some managers reckon that moving from a mainframe system to <font size=-1>PC</font>s can require a doubling of the support staff; the costs can add up to $6,000-8,000 a year for each <font size=-1>PC</font>. "While decentralised client-server computing was supposed to lower <font size=-1>IT</font> costs, the opposite has happened," argues the International Centre for Information Technologies in Stockholm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, <font size=-1>PC</font> users seem caught in a pincer movement of rising costs and falling rewards. Software companies make a good part of their money by coaxing users into buying new versions of their programs every other year or so, promising new features to those who upgrade and implicitly holding out the threat of incompatibility to those who do not. It is hard to say no. Yet each new version is bigger and uses up more computing power, eventually forcing the user to buy a new <font size=-1>PC</font> just to maintain performance at the same level.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the mid-1980s, Intel has released five processing chips, each more powerful than its predecessor. Over the same period, Microsoft has released four progressively bigger upgrades to its operating system. Yet the average user, having invested, say, $10,000 in new hardware and software over the past decade, may wonder what he has to show for it. True, his word processor is easier to use, and the screen looks better, but it works no faster than it did at the start. The cost of replacing a "delete" key with a picture of a rubbish bin has been high.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the saying goes in the industry, "Intel giveth, and Microsoft taketh away." This unholy alliance certainly helps the sales of those two companies, along with those of the rest of the computer industry; but with many users beginning to wonder whether <font size=-1>PC</font>s were really such a good investment after all, enthusiasm is growing for a move away from the desktop. That does not mean a return to the mainframe. What users have in mind instead is a half-way house in which information is held and often processed on large, shared machines, but viewed and used on personal ones, and accessed via an open network that encourages all the collaboration, communication and information-sharing that management theorists hold so dear. In a word, the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is splendid in theory, but somewhat less magnificent in practice, for two reasons. The first is that, as anyone who has used the Internet can attest, tasks involving travel along a network tend to take longer than on your own desktop; that is the cost of a shared resource. Secondly, it is worth recalling why the <font size=-1>PC</font> became so popular in the first place: it allowed users to work out their own ways of doing things, rather than just choosing between options predetermined by someone else.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conventional Web pages, convenient as they are, are essentially no more flexible than the old mainframe terminal screens. In the spring of 1995, however, Sun Microsystems, a workstation maker, came up with the missing link: a computer language called Java that was designed explicitly for networks. It is a way of writing small programs, each designed to do a single task, that reside in the network until needed. When you click on a Java-enabled Web page, one or many of these "applets" is downloaded to your machine, where it runs. It could be something as simple as an animation or as complicated as a mini-spreadsheet.

</p><p><b>Less palaver with Java</b>
<br>Whereas Web pages are static documents, Java applets are real programs that you can control like any other software. Once they are downloaded, they run locally on your <font size=-1>PC</font>, largely free of the network's delays. You request only the applets you need, which will be no bigger than they need to be to do their one job. When you are done with them, they can be disposed of, or your <font size=-1>PC</font> can store them to save the downloading next time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Best of all, you may not even notice they are there: content and software can be seamlessly merged. When you click on an analyst's company report, it seems only natural that the company's share price and latest financial results should pop up in a chart that can be manipulated, or that news headlines on the firm should scroll underneath. These are Java applets, working automatically in the background. They point the way to the future of computing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Computer languages come and go without sparking revolutions. Java is different, because it is more than a language. It is also, in a strange way, itself a computer. The applets that zip down the line when you click on a Java-enabled page are not written in the usual sort of code that processor chips can understand. They have to be decoded by a special program on your computer, known as a "Java virtual machine" that translates them into instructions the computer can understand. To the Java applet, the sort of physical hardware it has landed in does not matter; it need talk only to the virtual machine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This method has two main advantages. The first is protection from computer viruses: Java applets have no access to the computer itself, but can do only what the virtual machine lets them do. The second is that Java is an agnostic in the holy wars of the operating systems. Like the Web's <font size=-1>HTML</font>, Java is a cross-platform language; the same applet will work on any computer running a Java virtual machine. These programs are already part of the Netscape browser for the <font size=-1>PC</font>, Unix machines and the Macintosh, and are now being written for Oracle's Network Computer and other similar machines.
</p><p><b>All you need is an idea</b>
<br>For the software industry, the arrival of the Internet was the blinding flash of an <font size=-1>H</font>-bomb. Java is the shock wave that follows, toppling buildings and flattening trees. The language has suddenly opened the industry wide for start-up software companies again (see <a href="csu341.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a market dominated by Microsoft, small firms found the barriers had been raised too high. They could not afford the huge teams needed to write massive programs. They did not have the marketing clout to compete with Microsoft's brand, nor the distribution clout to win scarce shelf-space in the shops. If they chose to develop software for any computer other than the <font size=-1>PC</font>, perhaps to avoid competing head-on with Microsoft, they were stuck with a small and probably shrinking market. And even if they did find a market, they quickly had to move into the cycle of perpetual upgrades to keep making money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Java, and Internet software like it, promises to lower the barriers again. Because it is designed for small programs meant for specific tasks, a single person can develop a useful applet in a few weeks. Since Java applets typically live in the network, to be downloaded on demand, distribution or shelf-space is no problem. And the emerging technologies for Internet commerce suggest a whole new set of ways of selling software, from pay-per-use to pass-along revenues from information services firms which might, for example, include Java portfolio-management software with share prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;James Breyer, a venture capitalist with Silicon Valley's Accel Partners, reckons that 90% of the business plans that cross his desk these days are Internet-related; 90% of those are focused on Java. With Java-enabled Netscape browsers already sitting on millions of desktops, the market for Java software is huge, and not just for new companies. Micromuse, a British software firm, is developing its next-generation network-management tools in Java. Applix and MarketVision, two firms that make financial software for the zoo of workstations that populate trading floors, are switching to Java: it is the easiest way for them to make their offerings accessible to the greatest range of computers without the cost of multiple teams of programmers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the enthusiasm, Java is no instant panacea. For a start, some technical hitches remain to be resolved. Before most software is shipped, it is compiled into a code that a processor chip can understand. Java, however, is translated line-by-line by the virtual machine as it arrives. That means it can be as much as ten times slower than conventional software. Several companies are developing "just-in-time compilers" that can shrink the difference to a factor of two or less, but Java will never be the fastest language around.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Java is also still incomplete. To put together a Java application that has all the bells and whistles of a full-featured Windows program, you would have to cheat by using part of Microsoft's operating system. This would not work on other computers, wiping out much of Java's advantage. Plenty of companies are working on Java versions of these gadgets on various computers, but Java's cross-platform strength may become a liability if the software is reduced to the capabilities of the least powerful device it might run on (a cellular telephone?).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, the enthusiasm for the language suggests that, one way or another, most of these problems will be solved. Java has the hearts and minds of thousands of developers, just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> did 15 years ago. Even Microsoft cannot resist this tide. It has announced that it will build a Java virtual machine into the next versions of Windows, and is subsuming its own prize languages and software technology into a package, called ActiveX, that is built around a Java core. Apple and its partners are doing the same with the Mac operating system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Silicon Valley and software hotspots around the world, the Internet, the Web and Java have lit a fire that is burning on pure geek energy. "We've never seen anything like this," marvels Mr Breyer. Everyone, it seems, has an idea, and starting a company these days requires little more than that. Bill Gross, a software entrepreneur, set up the Idealab early this year when he realised that he and his friends had some 20 ideas between them, each of them good enough to support a stand-alone firm. He has spun out three of them so far. Charles Cohn gave up a high-powered job as a partner at McKinsey, a consultancy, to head CitySearch, one of the new companies. He is sleeping on the floor of a shared house and has not been paid in seven months. He could not be happier. "It's really exciting. All the big franchises and fortunes are up for grabs again," he says.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These adrenaline-fired young entrepreneurs are the foundation of a new industry, just as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and their friends were in the late 1970s. But first they must work out how to make it pay.

<h1>Teatime</h1>

<p><p>FOR a glimpse of the new software industry, turn to a rosy-cheeked 28-year-old in a rented San Francisco office, wearing a Toy Story <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt. This is Karl Jacob, the chief executive of Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>, a thoroughly modern software company, right down to its <i>Zeitgeist</i>-friendly name.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> is an archetypal Java start-up. Just 15 months old, it has already grown from the original seven people to 28 (average age: about 25), and is now looking for bigger office space, perhaps a few dozen blocks across San Francisco to SoMa, where dozens of similar young software and "new-media" firms have colonised the lofts of an old industrial district. The firm makes Java animation tools for companies designing Web sites and entertainment software. Like others in the Java league, Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>'s first order of business was to find a caffeine beverage to name its products after. Symantec had taken "Caf&eacute;", Borland "Latte", Applix "Espresso", Natural Intelligence "Roaster", and Microsoft and Cadis had played the even more recondite island-near-Java card with "Jakarta" and "Krakatoa", respectively. Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> was left with "Tea", which it reverse-engineered to stand for The Easy Animator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like many young software firms, Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> started off by consulting for other companies to help pay the bills. While it designed custom-made Java Web sites for its clients, it was also building its own, stand-alone, tools. Mr Jacob funded the early days by tracking down old friends from college, of the sort that had once said over a beer, "If you ever do anything interesting, give me a call." They did not know much about computers, much less the Internet, but they knew Mr Jacob, and that was enough.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the time came for a second round of financing, Mr Jacob wanted more than money. He looked for people who had invested in similar Internet ventures before, and could also bring contacts and advice. Since the next step for this sort of firm is a public offering, which in the current Internet frenzy might value the firm at hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr Jacob knew he needed to bolster his business team too. He thought he was a pretty well-qualified chief executive, having started his management career in the hardest of all jobs, running his fraternity house at university. And the finance director, he notes with pride, "is in his 30s". But he is now adding more grown-ups, including a marketing person who has actually worked in a big computer company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a crowded space with more computers than windows, Mr Jacob counts the reasons why this is such a good time to be a young software company. The first advantage, not to put too fine a point on it, is "the hype". Java is the hottest thing in the software industry right now, and a sure way for a start-up to get money and attention. Second, software houses are happily riding the wave of innovation that the Internet has set off. Every day brings new Java tools and opportunities, making Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>'s job easier and the company's potential market bigger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final advantage is generational: a feeling for what tomorrow's media consumers are going to want. Today's software is mostly worthy, useful stuff: spreadsheets and the like. But tomorrow's software will increasingly be an integral part of the media stream: less balance book, more "Beavis and Butthead". The point is not to replicate television on a computer, but to add a computer's responsiveness to media of all sorts. "People can't stand being in a room with a 15-year-old and a <font size=-1>TV</font>," says Mr Jacob. "It's click, click, click. But they don't want to click faster, they want to control the flow." What those 15-year-olds want is interactivity--just what the Web and Java do best.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>'s twentysomethings do not watch much <font size=-1>TV</font> these days, Mr Jacob says. Instead, they have "bookmarks"--pointers to dozens of favourite Web sites. If short attention spans and an insatiable desire to click on things are the lasting cultural imprint of the 1990s, Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> and the hundreds of software start-ups like it will be on to a very good thing.

<h1>The tyranny of success&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</h1>


<i>.&#160;.&#160;. and the success of tyranny.
Microsoft knows both


</i><p>THE <font size=-1>PC</font> Forum, an annual conference that attracts some of the biggest names in the computer industry, is a hard place to get noticed, especially if you are a relatively obscure economist. It is a place for networking and deal-making, where the industry's big wheels get together to schmooze. Yet when Brian Arthur reached the podium to give his speech last year he had to utter only one word to freeze a hundred conversations in mid-sentence: "Microsoft". Bill Gates and his empire command fear, respect and curiosity in the world he helped create. Microsoft dominates the software world like no other company in a major consumer industry. More than three-quarters of <font size=-1>PC</font> "productivity applications"--the largest packaged-software category, including word processors, spreadsheets and databases--sold today comes from its campus in Redmond, Washington. Even Coca-Cola only has half-of the soft-drinks market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Microsoft announces that it is entering a new software category, it causes panic among the incumbents. WordPerfect and Lotus once had seemingly unassailable domination of word processing and spreadsheets, their respective categories. But when Microsoft released its own Windows products, it cleverly bundled them into Office, a "suite" that cost less than half as much together as its stand-alone competitors apart. Today Microsoft has 90% of that market, and both Lotus and WordPerfect have been bought by other firms. Over the years Microsoft has expanded the definition of an operating system to include dozens of functions, from back-up utilities to e-mail software, that were once the profitable domain of independent companies, some of which have now gone bust.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No wonder some of Microsoft's competitors look on it as a force of evil in the industry. They claim that it unfairly exploits its ownership of the <font size=-1>PC</font> operating system in a hundred little ways (for example, by including secret parts of Windows that help its own applications). Never mind that these charges usually evaporate under scrutiny: much of the software world is convinced that Microsoft simply does not play fair. For most of the 1990s, companies have been badgering America's antitrust authorities with complaints about Microsoft's alleged monopolistic abuses. Yet a series of investigations by the Justice Department (and later the competition authorities of the European Union) have turned up little of substance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the complaints are sour grapes from lesser companies. But Microsoft does play rough, and some of its technology decisions do look suspicious (installing Windows 95 and The Microsoft Network, for example, can disable rival on-line services). The battles have left a cloud over Redmond. Much of the enthusiasm for Netscape, network computers and Java is generated by the fact that they are simply Not Microsoft.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even Microsoft's customers, who have seen their computing headaches diminish with the company's ascendancy, think of Microsoft as the firm they "hate to love, not love to hate", in the words of Forrester Research, a consultancy. A <font size=-1>PC</font> that runs nothing but Office, Windows 95 and other Microsoft software is easy to set up and will probably work well. But if such convenience comes at the cost of squeezing competitors out of business, thus stifling innovation, only Microsoft wins in the long run. Customers know that choice, even if it comes with complexity, is worth preserving.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may explain why so many industry pundits claim, perhaps wishfully, that the day in August 1995 when Windows 95 was released marked Microsoft's peak: not, perhaps, in absolute terms (the firm continues to grow at an extraordinary rate) but in sheer industry dominance. The arguments to support the claim come in two parts. First, the pundits say, Microsoft has conquered all the easy ground already: as its traditional markets become saturated, growth will become slower and less profitable. Second, they continue, the Internet changes everything. It will turn Microsoft's operating-system advantages into so much surplus baggage, slowing it as nimble newcomers sprint ahead.
</p><p><b>Thinking the unthinkable</b>
<br>To consider the decline of Microsoft today seems almost perverse. After all, the company has never done better: it is on track for net profits of over $2 billion, a rise of more than 40%, on sales of over $8 billion this year. It has some of the cleverest programmers in the industry, and still seems able to attract the best talent. Its products, although in most categories not the best, come a very close second. Some of its smaller bets have failed, such as its backing for interactive <font size=-1>TV</font> software, a version of Windows for telephones and fax machines, and a cartoon-like interface called "Bob". But the big bets usually pay off. Windows 95 may not have matched its hype, but it is undeniably a success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet <font size=-1>IBM</font> also looked good when the <font size=-1>PC</font> was born in 1981. The Internet amounts to another such revolution, which Microsoft must face at the same time as its traditional businesses are starting to slow. Just as <font size=-1>IBM</font> is still a huge and profitable company today, so Microsoft is likely to continue to prosper. But over the next decade its domination of the industry will become increasingly hard to maintain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For most of Microsoft's history it has grown between 30% and 40% a year, almost always faster than the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry as a whole, itself one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Wall Street is counting on more of the same. Were Microsoft to slow to, say, the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry's expected growth rate of 18% this year (great for most companies, but half Microsoft's usual rate), the share price might slide. Yet stock options are one of the carrots that Microsoft uses to attract the brightest software engineers and get them to give up all semblance of a life. More than 2,000 Microsoft employees have become millionaires that way. If the share price were to stop rising, let alone fall, the 14-hour days might seem a lot less bearable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a sense, the company has been too successful. It is approaching saturation in its core markets, and no new markets as lucrative as the Office suite (which now generates more than a third of the company's revenues) have emerged (see <a href="csu396.gif">chart</a>). Virtually all new <font size=-1>PC</font>s are already sold with Microsoft's operating systems. There is no market in suites left to take from other firms, and most of the biggest corporate customers already have all the word processors and spreadsheets they need (more than half of new <font size=-1>PC</font>s sold to companies are now replacements).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the past few years, Microsoft's main growth plan has been to encroach further on the "client-server" turf: the industrial-strength software (such as large databases and internal communications software) that runs big companies. When earlier this year Microsoft put the finishing touches to its "BackOffice" package of database and communications software, there was none of the Windows 95 razzmatazz; the corporate world is a conservative place. But Windows <font size=-1>NT</font>, Microsoft's operating system for servers--computers that hold data and programs to be shared across a company--is starting to take off; sales have doubled over the past year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, rich though the client-server market may be, it is harder going than the <font size=-1>PC</font> productivity applications were. The competition in this big-business market is tougher (from <font size=-1>IBM</font> to Oracle), the buyers more cautious and demanding, and the growth slower. Microsoft is already winning market share, but not without a large investment of time and effort, at a time when it can least afford to take its eyes off the Internet.
</p><p><b>The beam in Microsoft's eye</b></b>
<br>As Microsoft marshalled its troops for this assault on the corporate ramparts, it almost missed what was happening on the public networks under its nose. Not until the winter of 1993, when a Microsoft employee sent back a memo from Cornell University reporting that ordinary students there were more wired than Microsoft's own engineers, did Mr Gates consider the possibility that the Internet, though not invented on his own campus, might have to be taken seriously. Even so, it took Microsoft another two years to grasp what the Internet might do to its business unless it embraced radical change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, the company introduced the Microsoft Network with great fanfare in August last year, even though both the network and its content were based on proprietary standards, closed to others on the Internet. It was a curious mistake, especially since established on-line services had already acknowledged that such proprietary networks had no future in a world opened up by the Web.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last December, Microsoft admitted defeat by moving the Microsoft Network and its much-touted publishing tools for developers to the Web, infuriating those companies that had invested their time and money developing content for the network. It licensed Java, and announced that it would be adapting all of its main products, from its word processors to the Windows <font size=-1>NT</font> operating system, to work on the Internet. It has largely delivered on its promise, releasing dozens of new Internet products in an extraordinarily rapid turnaround for such a large firm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft seems at last to have become serious ("hardcore", as Mr Gates puts it) about the Internet. Cynics say this is not so much because of the clarity of its vision but because it is terrified that Netscape and Sun might be right: the Internet really could be a new platform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The very combination of the words "platform" and "Internet" is a red flag to the Microsoft faithful. From Mr Gates downwards, they rubbish the idea that a simple ("trivial", in Mr Gates's language) browser and yet another programming language (and a slow one at that) can seriously be considered a platform. It is easy to see why they find it threatening: Microsoft rose with the <font size=-1>PC</font>, and might fall with it. If the Internet were to become the dominant computing platform, then the <font size=-1>PC</font> would be just one of many machines that can access the Internet. Its relative importance--and sales--would decline, and so would Microsoft's operating-system revenues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it makes sense for Microsoft to preserve the <font size=-1>PC</font>'s--and hence its own--dominance at all costs. It sees little Netscape as one of its most serious threats. When Netscape won the browser market by initially giving away its software, Microsoft developed its own browser and promised to give it away indefinitely. In response to Netscape's success in selling Web server software, Microsoft gave away a Web server with its Windows <font size=-1>NT</font> operating system. And after Netscape licensed Java and built it into its browser, Microsoft went one better by announcing that it would not only build Java into its own browser but that it would integrate it with its own Java-like programming standard for Windows, a package of technologies known collectively as ActiveX. This April it went the full way, agreeing to incorporate Java into Windows itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Microsoft is successful, it will preserve the <font size=-1>PC</font> as the favoured Internet access device, and therefore protect its place on the desktop. But that will not stop the software market from increasingly shifting to the Internet itself. The battle for this market is very different from that in the early days of the <font size=-1>PC</font>. Then, it was winner take all. On the Internet, there may be no single winner at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Mr Andreessen puts it, the <font size=-1>PC</font> had two "control points"--the microprocessor and the operating system. The companies that took the lead there--Intel and Microsoft--have been able to control the pace and direction of the machine's development, usually to their own benefit. Depending on how you look at it, the Internet has either infinitely more such points or none at all. Dozens of companies are trying to set their own standards for everything from telephony to security and electronic commerce. Yet so far the only true standards, from the underlying technology of the network to the basic language of the Web, have been open--developed by committees or academics or otherwise in the public domain. This may not last: the financial rewards for standard-setters are as great on the Internet as anywhere else. But seeing how far the Internet has come without such ownership, it will be hard for anyone, even Bill Gates, to gain as much control of the Internet as Microsoft has of the <font size=-1>PC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft, as it happens, agrees. But it does not think it needs such an advantage to extend its success to the Internet. It rejects the idea that its gains in word processors or spreadsheets had anything to do with its domination of the operating system: it simply sold better products at a better price than its competitors. This is a bit of revisionist history--it discounts, among other things, the cross-subsidies possible when you are assured $50 from the price of virtually every new <font size=-1>PC</font>--but it is more true than the operating-system-as-manifest-destiny version that is painted by its competitors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year, the betting in Silicon Valley was that Netscape was too far ahead and too nimble for Microsoft to catch. Now the geeks have recovered their respect for Mr Gates. Microsoft could still lose: although it has come a long way, it is still about six months behind Netscape. That is a big lead on the Internet, said to move in "dog years" (one for seven). But at least nobody could accuse Microsoft of failing to understand how these markets work.

<h1>Microsoft's media mania</h1>


<p>ON MICROSOFT's sprawling campus, one of the many glass-and-chrome buildings yields an unexpected sight: a big room that looks to all the world like a television newsroom on full alert. It is the morning of April 3rd, and the aeroplane carrying the American secretary of commerce has just crashed. A news director shouts out instructions as reporters hang on the phones and producers hunch over banks of computers to get the story on the air. As it unfolds, a wall full of television monitors shows a live press conference, news channels and satellite feeds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the newsroom of the Microsoft Network (<font size=-1>MSN</font>), and it offers a hint of how serious Microsoft is about moving beyond the software business. Bill Gates may have started his career as a programmer, but he seems to want to end it as a media mogul. If money can buy that, he is well on his way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beyond <font size=-1>MSN</font>, Microsoft has a $400m partnership with <font size=-1>NBC</font>, the television network, to produce <font size=-1>MSNBC</font>, which will include a cable <font size=-1>TV</font> news channel and an Internet news service. It has invested $30m in Dreamworks, Hollywood's newest studio, and is collaborating with Tele-Communications Inc, a cable <font size=-1>TV</font> giant. Last year it hired Michael Kinsley, a former editor of the <i>New Republic</i> (who has also worked on <i>The Economist</i>) to start a political magazine on the Internet. It is planning on-line magazines in several big cities, covering arts and entertainment, and setting up a host of other Internet services, from a car<i>-</i>shopping bazaar to a childcare information centre.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates exchanges deal-making gossip with such entertainment industry giants as David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, and greatly admires Disney's brand. "Content is king," he writes in his syndicated newspaper column<i>. </i>He studies the economics of the newspaper business and watches the rise of on-line advertising dollars. "We are in essence trying to figure out how to be an interactive media company," explains Peter Neupert, who negotiates Microsoft's content deals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates's media obsession goes deep, from his voracious reading habits to his admiration for the broadcasting industry. But his confidence in Microsoft's potential in this market comes straight from "Encarta". Microsoft's foray into multimedia encyclopedias has been indisputably successful. Within two years of its release in 1993, Encarta had become the best-selling encyclopedia of any sort, whether on paper or <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, its success seemed almost effortless. Microsoft licensed most of the content from a second-tier encyclopedia maker, then wrote the software to make it easy and fun to use. As sales took off, the lesson seemed clear: traditional firms in this business did not have the understanding or the technical skills to succeed in the computer world. Microsoft did, and beat the experts at their own game. Perhaps the rest of the media world would succumb to the same strategy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or perhaps not. Encarta may simply have been a fluke. Microsoft makes dozens of other education and entertainment <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s, from Microsoft "Dogs" to a wine guide, and none of them is anywhere near as successful. Analysts reckon that, but for Encarta, the division would be losing money. Indeed, the shine even on Encarta may be wearing off: most copies are included free with new <font size=-1>PC</font>s, not bought in stores, and the rest of the encyclopedia industry, jolted by Microsoft's success, has taken a crash course in going digital. Encyclopaedia Britannica, which was hurt most, is now on the Internet. The site may have none of Encarta's multimedia fun, but it does have deep and rich information on any subject--something Microsoft had to scrimp on to make room for the videos on the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>. In the end, consumers may remember why they wanted an encyclopedia in the first place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft acknowledges that it knows little about the news business or, for that matter, any other media business. But it does know about software, and it reckons that in tomorrow's interactive world the successful media companies will be those who master both content and technology. And it is betting that it can buy and nurture talent and creativity more easily than traditional media giants can master interactivity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the medium really is the message. But it is early days yet in the Internet revolution, and the media giants have plenty of time to catch on. Meanwhile, in the <font size=-1>MSN</font> newsroom, Mark Pawlowsky, a harried ex-newspaperman, is trying to teach youngsters wearing baseball caps the wrong way round how to be reporters. "We're not a racehorse yet," he says. Microsoft has a lot of money to bet on this experiment, but the odds do not look enticing.

<h1>Doomonomics</h1>


<i>Software is stretching traditional economics

</i><p>WHAT does a chainsaw-toting marine with a taste for blood have to do with the economics of business? Perhaps more than you think. The tale of how "Doom", a drippingly gory computer game, took its creators from obscurity to riches in just four years holds a lesson of striking relevance to tomorrow's information economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early 1991, three computer-game designers left their jobs at a middle-tier games company and set up shop as id Software in a small office next to a freeway exit in Mesquite, Texas. They had just released a game, "Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons", into the so-called "shareware" market, and wanted to develop other games on their own. Shareware games operate on the free-sample principle. The first few levels of the game can be downloaded from the Internet and played without charge, as a taster. But once hooked, users have to pay extra to get the more difficult levels so they can have even more fun.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Id did modestly well until 1992, when it wrote Wolfenstein 3-<font size=-1>D</font>, a fairly standard blow-away-the-Nazis game souped up with a three-dimensional interface. Millions downloaded the free version, and 250,000 paid for the fancier edition. In late 1993 came Doom, with more gore, lots of demons to kill, and an even better 3-<font size=-1>D</font> interface. It became a global phenomenon, with an estimated 15m people downloading the free game. By now id had become famous, and Doom a recognised addiction. In late 1994 the company released Doom II through regular stores. It has already sold 1.6m copies. Id's founders now drive Ferraris.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Id is not the first company to make a fortune by giving away free samples of its products. But, by harnessing the economics of the software world, it was able to spend less and make more than any company in a traditional industry could hope to. The advantage derives from a basic characteristic of software (and indeed any sort of digital information): making perfect copies and distributing them costs virtually nothing. When it released Doom on the Internet and other computer networks, id let the marketplace do its distribution, marketing, even advertising for it. Its only costs were to write the program in the first place, and to man the telephones to take credit-card numbers when people called to pay for the full version.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape, the leading Internet software company, was sufficiently impressed to adopt the same model to make its mark. It put its browser on the Internet, free to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged others to distribute it widely. Once it dominated the market, it started to charge for the browser and related software. Revenues in its first full year of operation ran to over $80m. Most other Internet companies are following in its path, giving away software to build market share and brand, and then finding some way to make money later.
</p><p><b>The industrial age ends here</b></b>
<br>Id's strange business plan encapsulates the real software revolution: its stretching of a central principle of traditional economics, the law of diminishing returns. This says that, as production expands, every individual producer will eventually find that his costs per unit start to rise. This may happen for a variety of reasons: what matters is that, beyond a certain point, size breeds inefficiency. The result is profound: firms stop growing, and competition can flourish.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Production of software does not appear to obey this rule--or, at any rate, not in a straightforward way. Once a program has been written, it costs next to nothing to manufacture and market. That is why software companies can choose to sell their products very cheaply or indeed give them away. As Doom proved, once market share has been gained, it becomes easier to sell follow-on products at higher prices. Microsoft and others recognised this years ago by offering "competitive upgrades": owners of competing software can buy the Microsoft version at a huge discount. Since each copy costs Microsoft only a tiny fraction of even the discounted price, each sale generates revenue it would not otherwise have had, and produces a new customer who might be persuaded to buy the next upgrade at the full price.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This stretching of the law of diminishing returns has other implications too. In the mid-1980s, Brian Arthur, a Stanford economist, noticed three common factors in the booming computer industry of Silicon Valley. First, software, in common with other high-technology products such as pharmaceuticals, has very high development costs, but very low production costs. Second, networks of users want compatible software. And third, customers, once they have chosen a program, tend to "groove in"; learning to use software takes time, and information is often saved in proprietary file formats, so switching programs is painful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this seemed to Mr Arthur to add up to a different economic model: one of increasing returns. Simply stated, this describes the tendency of market leaders to get even further ahead. The cost of developing a program is the same whether a company sells one copy or 10m. Thus, while the market leader and the followers have the same costs, the leader makes more money. The winning firm can invest that money in developing new products, lengthening its lead. Network effects and customer groove-in further strengthen its hold on the market.

</p><p><b>Winner takes all</b>
<br>Increasing returns is not a new idea. However, Mr Arthur argues that the development of high-technology industry lends it an altogether new significance. This is a controversial position, and for good reasons: an economy ruled by increasing returns is a scary thing to contemplate. Free markets work well because they tend to reach equilibrium, with many companies competing and no one firm dominating for too long. In the world of increasing returns, this equilibrium would seem to break down: the big tend to get bigger without limit. Monopoly power becomes pervasive, and the need for vigorous regulation by government correspondingly great. Indeed, Mr Arthur himself argued in a brief submitted by a group of software companies to America's Justice Department that the effects of increasing returns gave Microsoft unfair monopoly powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Justice Department--wisely--chose not to prosecute. Software economics is not as threatening as it seems. To understand why, consider it in the traditional two parts: supply and demand. Increasing returns primarily influence the supply side: more market share leads to more profit, which leads to more new products, and so on. Network effects influence demand: the more customers you have, the more you get.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But both have their limitations. On the supply side, the Internet's new economics of production and distribution lower the cost for everyone, and languages like Java will lead to a proliferation of small programs that will be relatively cheap to develop. This will reduce the cost of entering the software market; technological ingenuity and a spirit of innovation will matter more than marketing clout, manpower and other expensive resources. The smaller the initial cost, the smaller the financial advantages of increasing returns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasing returns eventually run out of steam, too. As the previous article argued, Microsoft is reaching saturation in its biggest markets. Climbing from a market share of 98% to 99%--converting the most tenacious hold-outs--costs more than simply riding the rising tide between, say, a share of 60% and 70%. All software products will eventually reach such limits. Diminishing returns still kick in, just later than they might in other industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the demand side, network effects also have limits--most obviously because not all software is used by people on networks. Games and personal organisers, for example, are generally a matter of personal choice. Where networks are involved, they may be mostly local rather than global ones. One company may settle on Microsoft's Excel as its spreadsheet throughout the firm, but another will choose Lotus <font size=-1>1-2-3</font>. Since spreadsheet files are rarely exchanged between firms, global standards are not an issue. Indeed, Lotus <font size=-1>1-2-3</font> once did have a dominant market share, and lost it to Excel, despite having the force of increasing returns on its side. The same happened to WordPerfect's word processor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Furthermore, network effects hold only until a new technology takes over, changing the entire market. In a world of e-mail and fax, it no longer matters much who controls the telex market. Likewise, American Express's travellers'-cheque network does not count for much when tourists discover that their regular bank cards work around the world. Because the Internet allows technology to proliferate so quickly, these shifts will occur more frequently, knocking incumbents off their network-effect perches.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These factors limit the effect of increasing returns, but do not render them illusory. Costs are lower on the Internet, but not zero; and the Internet, which is nothing but a big computer network, tends to amplify network effects. The more computers are connected, the more their software must work together, and the more software works together, the greater the need for a single standard. In the real world, a telephone need only connect to a standard outlet: any of them will do. On the Internet, "telephones" are intelligent programs that will work only with compatible software; communication is possible only among those that obey the same protocols. Hence the tendency for a market leader to emerge and dominate, at least until the next technology--videophones, say--takes over.
</p><p><b>The software economy</b></b>
<br>The economic implications of the digital revolution extend far beyond the software industry. Any information-based industry will be subject to the same forces as it automates and moves on-line. Banking, for example, has traditionally been a diminishing-returns business. But as banking moves on-line, the work of processing customers' business is done by cheap computers, not expensive staff. The bank that has the greatest reach and can spread its fixed costs over the largest number of customers will be able to offer the best rates and deals, thereby attracting even more customers. Enter increasing returns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same can be said for all sorts of service industries, from processing insurance-claims forms to managing inventories. Whenever computers and networks can greatly diminish variable costs, volume suddenly becomes all-important: the more the better. What worked for Doom can work for Deutsche Telekom. "Everything's going software," says Mr Arthur, with a gleam in his eye.

<h1>The importance of being American</h1>


<i>Can the rest of the world catch up?

</i><p>IF EVERYTHING is going software, most of the world is in trouble and America is laughing. It makes an estimated three-quarters of the packaged software sold worldwide, worth $100 billion now and growing as the <font size=-1>PC</font> becomes a global standard. The next largest, Britain and Germany, have less than 10% of the market between them. Most of the world's rich countries, and now increasingly some of the poor ones too, have domestic software industries, often with hundreds of companies (see <a href="csu342.gif">chart</a>). But none has even come close to challenging America on the world market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first reason for this imbalance is that software simply follows hardware: America is where computing started and where it has grown fastest. Nearly half the world's computing power is in America, seven times more than in Japan, its closest competitor. America offers software companies a single market of more than 60m <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Germany's <font size=-1>PC</font> market, the second biggest, is no more than a quarter of that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same factors that spawned Silicon Valley's hardware industry are at work in software. America has the largest venture-capital market in the world. It has a stockmarket, Nasdaq, made for small, fast-growing firms. Its various technology meccas have attracted a critical mass of other firms in the computer industry that serve both as suppliers and customers, and provide a source of inspiration and ideas for each other. And on both coasts it has world-class university computer departments and research centres.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's software strength has created its own positive feedback cycle. The international language of computing is English. Non-American software companies with international ambitions have tended to incorporate themselves as American firms simply to be taken seriously (a habit that makes it difficult to get accurate figures of other countries' software strength). Bill Gates has become an American hero. Geeks are cool.
</p><p><b>The new internationalists</b></b>
<br>The Internet, too, is largely an American phenomenon, but it has helped software firms everywhere. By creating a single global market for software, the Internet cuts through many of the distribution and marketing barriers that have kept foreign software firms from making headway in America. And since a company's Web presence often provides no clue to its physical location, firms that market and sell their software on-line no longer have to set up shop in America to be taken seriously.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;VocalTec, <font size=-1>VDO</font>net and CheckPoint are three of the hotter Internet companies, making, respectively, an Internet telephone, video software and security software. Many of their customers may not know that all three of them are Israeli firms. NeuronData, a French programming tools company, and Micromuse, a British network software firm, are able to keep quiet about their national origins in the same way. On the Web, companies appear to reside in the here and now, open for business round the clock somewhere on your screen. It may be the middle of the night in Herzlia, Israel, but VocalTec's Web site gets busiest when America takes a lunch break.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet cannot eliminate all of the disadvantages non-American firms face. There are still the problems of financing, language and such intangibles as the number of people at the local coffee bar whose idea of a gripping conversation is an analysis of the latest Java compilers. But it does help their prospects. Here are a few of the countries that are already a force in software, and stand to benefit most from the Internet's global market:
<ul>

<font size=-1><li></font>Germany owes its relative software strength mostly to the meteoric rise of a newcomer, <font size=-1>SAP</font>, and the continued growth of a giant from the mainframe days, Software <font size=-1>AG</font>. Both now specialise in client-server software, having developed their skills by writing custom accounting and database software for large German companies. With a sophisticated package of products already in hand when it entered the American market, <font size=-1>SAP</font> became one of the fastest-growing software firms in the industry, and now ranks fifth in the world. But popular though its software is, it is also big, complicated and expensive to install. Analysts reckon this will soon slow <font size=-1>SAP</font>'s climb; so far no other German software rocket has emerged to take its place.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>Britain, it seems, has always been just on the verge of a software boom. It has most of the right ingredients: world-class computer research institutions, hundreds of small software companies, and proportionately more <font size=-1>PC</font>s and Internet connections than most other European countries. It even speaks the right language. Until Germany's <font size=-1>SAP</font> took off, Britain had the strongest software industry outside America, with three companies--Misys, <font size=-1>JBA</font> International and the Micro Focus Group--in the world's top 50. But none of its software firms has become a billion-dollar world-beater. Why not? The answer seems familiar: the big firms are mostly in slow-growth mainframe markets, and the newer <font size=-1>PC</font> software firms have been hampered by the lack, until recently, of a small-company stockmarket and enough venture capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too often promising British firms have put technology ahead of marketing, and have been beaten by louder American competitors. And most of the consumer-software companies that sprouted up in the 1980s developed programs for the Acorn computer, a proprietary design that has been largely buried under the <font size=-1>PC</font> avalanche. Britain's software future may lie in its cottage industry of small computer-games makers, which have developed some of the best 3-D graphics technologies.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>France loves technology, and its computer researchers are some of the best in the world. Perhaps they are just too good: French firms are best known for state-of-the-art programming tools; they are less successful at using those tools to create mass-market applications software. Business Objects, NeuronData, <font size=-1>ILOG</font>--all have grown quickly with the industry's move to "object-oriented" programming, a French speciality. But making software for other programmers is by definition a niche market, something Philippe Kahn, often described as France's most successful software export, learned to his cost when Borland, his programming-tools company in Boston, imploded after trying to challenge Microsoft.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>Israel has long had a stronger technology industry than the country's size would suggest, and is doing especially well in Internet software. Like most of the country's technology industries, this one has been helped by military funding. Like the Internet itself (which was designed to resist atomic attack), many of the technologies of warfare--such as signal processing and encryption--have found new applications on-line. Signal processing lies at the core of video and audio compression, and encryption is the key to the tough problem of Internet security. Israel's traditionally close ties with American business and financial markets are likely to ensure that its software firms will prosper over the next few years.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>India is pushing hard to become a force in the software industry, with some success. It reckons its domestic firms will sell $1 billion-worth of software and services next year. But most of this is work being done for others: India biggest software firms are contractors who offer cheap programming services, mostly for American firms. With an average Indian programmer's salary less than a third of his American counterpart's, Indian firms reckon they can undercut American firms by 40% or more, even after allowing for telecoms and other costs of such long-distance work. The Indian government, having failed in the 1970s to coax a domestic computer industry into life by imposing high tariffs on American computer technology, is investing in satellite links to bypass the country's appalling telecoms networks, and most software firms have power generators to weather the frequent brown-outs. But although India has become the world's favourite software jobshop, it has yet prove that it can come up with software products of its own.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>Japan is a software cipher. Even though it has the second-largest number of programmers in the world, it cannot claim a single success abroad in packaged software (other than in video games). The explanations for this baffling failure include language, the dominance in Japan until recently of various proprietary and incompatible <font size=-1>PC</font> standards, and the preference of Japanese firms for commissioning software unique to their company. In a 1994 study on Japan's software problems, Edward Feigenbaum, a Stanford computer scientist, calculated that such custom software accounts for about 90% of the Japanese industry's output. In the past year, sales of standard <font size=-1>PC</font>s have rocketed in Japan, as have Internet connections. But with software engineering still considered a less respectable occupation than hardware engineering, where the country has traditionally been strong, a Japanese Bill Gates seems a long way off.

<h1>The new world&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</h1>


<i>.&#160;.&#160;. &#160;looks a bit like the old world, but with a difference: software every where, but never a program in sight.

</i><p>SOFTWARE is so abstract and ephemeral--just ones and zeros, recorded in tiny magnetic fluctuations or microscopic pockmarks--that its true economic significance is not always recognised. Computer hardware is much easier to quantify by the usual measures of the industrial age: chips, boxes, lorryloads. To use the language of Nicholas Negroponte, the <font size=-1>MIT</font> Media Lab's digital guru, computers are atoms. Software is bits. Atoms can be weighed, seen and felt. Bits, like genetic code, are inanimate--until they are placed into the right vessel. Then they use that vessel's machinery to create life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The beauty of the computer--indeed, the basis of its world-changing success--is that it is totally unspecialised. A toaster has just one job: it toasts. A <font size=-1>PC</font>, on the other hand, is more like a blank sheet of paper: it is a generic device that serves as a carrier and a repository for ideas of any sort, from "Rebel Assault II" to "Richard III". Partly for this reason, the hardware and software worlds have grown up very differently. Hardware exists to do the bidding of software, not the other way around. Both can be good businesses to be in, but on balance software has the economic edge. Microsoft enjoys gross margins of 85% while Compaq, the leading <font size=-1>PC</font>-hardware maker, makes do with 23%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the early 1980s, all the fun and games in the computer industry was in the battle between hardware companies. Would <font size=-1>IBM</font> lose its lead to clone makers? Would Apple's Macintosh beat the <font size=-1>PC</font>? Would the <font size=-1>PC</font> beat the mainframe? Today all those questions have been answered; the <font size=-1>PC</font> won, but unlike in software, no single company won with it. The <font size=-1>PC</font> industry is now becoming a rather dull and conventional consumer-electronics market, with most of the competition focused on brand, price and quality. The excitement in the industry has shifted to the bits, and those bits are now starting to move away from the <font size=-1>PC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This move from the desktop to the network has become a kind of Rorschach test for the giant software companies. Each of them sees in the Internet only what it wants to see. Every one of them believes that, either by good luck or good management, the network plays right to their strengths.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>IBM</font> points out that the shift away from desktop computers and back towards servers is a vindication of its dogged loyalty to the mainframe, which it now calls a "superserver". Oracle argues that servers are really only machines running big, specialised databases, of just the sort it has been making all these years. Computer Associates thinks that the gaping security holes exposed by the Internet-driven boom in servers of all sorts will open up a great market for security specialists--such as itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sun never tires of reminding punters that it coined the then-baffling slogan, "The Network is the Computer", back in 1988. Microsoft notes that the Internet is in large part an expansion of the client-server strategy it has been building up for years. <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s Lotus subsidiary explains that the Internet is all about collaboration and communications, just like its Notes groupware. Novell claims that the Internet is built on a foundation of office networks, where it happens to dominate, and believes that the Internet will extend Novell's software all the way to appliances in the home. When Adobe looks at the Web, it sees a booming publishing industry, much like the paper-based desktop publishing market it has already claimed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They could all be right: the Internet is a broad church. But history suggests that when industries shift direction, most existing companies are left behind. "Some companies will make the transition," says James Breyer, a venture capitalist, "but the vast majority of the software leaders today will lose their leadership over the next two years."
</p><p><b>Changing places</b></b>
<br>This is a clash of the old world and the new. But they are not mutually exclusive. Just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> did not replace the mainframe, the Internet will not somehow replace the <font size=-1>PC</font> (nor will Java, nor the $500 Network Computer, nor even the mainframe reinvented as a server). It is worth noting that today, 15 years after the <font size=-1>PC</font> revolution began, <font size=-1>IBM</font> is by far the largest software company in the world, with software revenues of nearly $13 billion last year--getting on for twice those of Microsoft.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the roles have been switched, in a strange sort of way. Microsoft is now in the position formerly occupied by <font size=-1>IBM</font>, deeply committed to the status quo and in danger of missing the new opportunities if it tries too hard to protect its existing business. <font size=-1>IBM</font> is in the curious position of oversized underdog. Having fumbled the <font size=-1>PC</font>, it talks about leapfrogging straight from the mainframe to the Internet. With its share price near a five-year high, it runs taunting advertisements insisting that its stubborn vision was right all along. "Correction," reads one full-page <font size=-1>IBM</font> display. "Over the past few years, several publications have predicted the demise of the mainframe. This was a typographical error. What they meant was the 'rise' of the mainframe, not the 'demise'..."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Irving Wladawsky-Berger, who heads <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s Internet division, argues that once companies move from internal networks supporting a few hundred people to sophisticated Web sites supporting thousands, they will rediscover the charms of Big Iron's security and reliability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet seems to have a magical ability to make the old new again. One of the hottest services on the Web is a search site at Digital Equipment, a minicomputers-to-workstations maker that almost went under a few years ago. Larry Ellison at Oracle has a vision of a cheap Network Computer (<font size=-1>NC</font>) that sounds a lot like an <font size=-1>X</font>-terminal, a technology that has been struggling for acceptance for nearly a decade. The <font size=-1>NC</font> itself goes back to a design by Britain's Acorn, one of the many proprietary home-computer makers to fall under the wheels of the <font size=-1>PC</font> train in the mid-1980s. And even Java is based on a language originally designed for interactive television "set-top boxes" before that market imploded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For software, the Internet requires an entirely new model. Today most packaged software is sold in a big and mostly empty box for somewhere between $50 and $300. Tomorrow it will be sold on-line for much less, perhaps a few pennies per use. It may take the form of Java applets, downloaded on demand, or run remotely as a paid-for service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape's Mr Andreessen thinks software, as a stand-alone product, will simply fade away. "Software application, content and services used to be three separate things. They just merged." After all, he argues, most users do not want to run a program, they want to do their work, find information, or be entertained. Software will be hidden in content, like closed-captioned information in a television signal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of today's software will probably remain largely as it is. There is no need to reinvent the word processors and spreadsheets we use now. But the overall software pie will grow immeasurably, as specially tailored software finds its way into everything from the morning on-line newspaper to a downloaded tax form.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It may also open the industry to a multitude of newcomers who have not been able to surmount the barriers to entry of today's <font size=-1>PC</font> software distribution channels and monolithic applications. "Software will look more like publishing," says Paul Cubbage, a former analyst with Dataquest, a consultancy. "There's a huge well-spring of people who are willing to develop software--they just don't want to get into marketing and starting a company. The Internet will be like cable <font size=-1>TV</font>: a huge monster that eats up interactive content."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an Internet computing world, prices will drop but (remember Doomonomics) volume will rise spectacularly (see <a href="csu340.gif">chart</a>). "What's been propping up the price of software is the perceived value of the big box and the manuals," says Mr Cubbage. "Would you pay $299 for a bare <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> or an Internet download?" Sun, having released Java into the world without an obvious way of cashing in on it, now hopes to make its money as a broker, keeping track of the micro-payments each time a user downloads a Java applet. In a volume business, a few cents here and a few cents there can add up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These network programs, then, are the new species of software's next epoch. They will populate the thousands of new niches that will open as the Internet's combination of global reach, infinite capacity and near-zero marginal costs infiltrates the traditional economy. At first some of them will seem as strange as the armoured tankfish or the mammoth when they first appeared on earth, but they will be better suited to their new wired world than their predecessors were. Software, like life itself, adapts wonderfully to change.

<h1>Coping with the ups and downs</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Fears about systemic risk in banking have led to calls for ever more rules and regulations. But, asks Martin Giles, would they be part of the solution or part of the problem?</i>

<p>"IF YOU see a banker jump out of the window, jump after him--there's sure to be profit in it," said Voltaire. In recent years, anybody rash enough to follow that piece of advice from the 18th-century French philosopher and satirist would probably have ended up in intensive care, along with the bankers. The list of financial institutions hospitalised after more or less spectacular defenestrations grows longer by the day. Big chunks of banking systems in some rich countries, as well as in many emerging markets, have had to be put on taxpayer-financed drip-feeds. This is not the first time that banks have proved to be remarkably accident-prone, nor is it likely to be the last.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was abandoned in the early 1970s, the banking industry seems to have jumped from one drama to another, including the Latin American debt crisis, the $150 billion American savings-and-loan (<font size=-1>S&L</font>) fiasco and, more recently, a property-related lending binge that forced several Scandinavian governments to bail out large chunks of their banking systems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On top of this there have been some breathtaking individual problems, such as the collapse in February 1995 of Britain's Barings Bank after a rogue trader managed to blow an &#163;860m ($1.4 billion) hole in its balance sheet, and Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais, a state-owned French bank that earned itself a place in banking's house of horrors by running up losses amounting to some FFr21 billion ($4.2 billion) in 1992-94. The list grows longer by the day. In March the Italian government announced an emergency rescue plan for Banco di Napoli after the bank owned up to having lost over 3 trillion lire ($2 billion) last year.
</p><p><b>Bubble trouble</b>
<br>Until 1990, Japan seemed to be immune from banking headaches, but now its system--which includes many of the world's biggest banks (see <a href="images/tsu112.gif">table</a>)--looks thoroughly sick too. At the end of March, the country's 21 largest banks announced &#165;9.3 trillion ($86 billion) of provisions against their bad debts. Many of these are the legacy of the country's economic bubble, which burst in the early 1990s. In view of the important role bank finance plays in Japan's economy, the myriad links between its banks and its industrial companies, and Japanese banks' large investments abroad, the country's banking crisis is undoubtedly one of the most worrying in recent financial history.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to stories of reckless lending and, in some cases, corruption, bankers in Japan are now widely seen as sharp-suited gamblers rather than sober-suited financiers. This explains public opposition to a government plan to spend &#165;685 billion of taxpayers' money on paying the creditors of Japan's troubled housing-loan companies, or <i>jusen</i>, whose bosses had lent vast sums for speculative property development in the days of the bubble economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's taxpayers are not the only ones that face a huge bill for banks' financial follies. The French are still waiting to see whether they will have to pay even more for the rescue of Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais, which last year spun off FFr135 billion-worth of its dud assets into a new company whose losses will be covered by the state. And in Scandinavia, bailing out troubled banks has cost anywhere between 2.8% and 4% of their home countries' <font size=-1>GDP</font>, according to the International Monetary Fund.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just the bankers who made the bad loans that are under fire. Banking regulators, for their part, are being blamed for complacency. In Britain, one Bank of England official resigned after the Bank was criticised for failing to see the Barings disaster coming. In France, a parliamentary report on the Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais affair scolded watchdogs for allowing the bank's problems to grow. And in Japan, the country's finance ministry, which oversees banks, has also been castigated for letting them get out of control. In December Kyosuke Shinozawa, Japan's top finance official, stepped down to atone for past mistakes. There has even been talk of stripping Japan's most powerful ministry of some of its regulatory responsibilities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What caused so many banks to crash in such a relatively short space of time? Part of the answer is that in the mid- to late 1980s, interest rates in the economies that subsequently suffered banking crises stayed relatively low, while their economies grew strongly. At the same time, deregulation swept away many of the rules that had previously limited competition within the banking industry. The result was a breathtaking, credit-driven boom in property and share prices (see <a href="images/csu116.gif">chart</a>) that encouraged bankers to lend to all comers. When interest rates rose sharply in 1989, puncturing the bubble, borrowers began to default in droves and banks in many countries were quickly submerged by bad debts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, bankers in Britain and America had lent enthusiastically to the property sector in the hope that the fat margins on such risky loans would offset declining profits in their more traditional corporate-lending business. These were being squeezed in two ways. On the one hand, mutual funds (unit trusts), which offer higher returns by investing people's cash directly in the money market, stocks and bonds, had broken the banks' monopoly over cheap deposits (or liabilities, in banking parlance). On the other hand, many banks' best corporate customers were deserting them, preferring to raise money directly from the capital markets by issuing bonds and shares.
</p><p><b>Why banks are special</b>
<br>Banking is not the only industry that has been transformed by the dual forces of deregulation and stiffer competition. Many other kinds of firm are having to cope with the same trends. Inevitably, some companies go bust as a result. Usually, they promptly disappear--unless a government decides for some reason or other that a firm such as an airline or a car maker is "strategic", and bails it out. When it comes to banking, however, politicians everywhere seem especially reluctant to let the industry's flagships fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? One reason is that governments fear the political backlash that the failure of a big bank would cause. Most of these financial giants have thousands of small depositors, many of whom keep a substantial portion of their wealth in their accounts. Ensuring that Aunt Agatha, Anna and Akiko-san have somewhere safe to invest their savings is widely considered to be the government's responsibility. Hence the strong political will to keep large banks afloat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is another, even more serious threat associated with bank failures that strikes fear into the hearts of politicians and central bankers everywhere. Dubbed "systemic risk", this is the danger that the sudden and unexpected demise of one or several banks could trigger a domino-like collapse throughout an entire banking system. The prospect of a financial meltdown is such a serious worry because its impact is likely to be felt on Main Street as well as Wall Street.
</p><p><b>On the run</b>
<br>It is the side-effects (or externalities, in economists' jargon) associated with bank failures that make them such a special case. When, say, a steel producer collapses, its disappearance is unlikely to cause trouble for other steelmakers; indeed, they should benefit by picking up some of the failed firm's clients. But when a bank suddenly goes bust, its rivals may experience problems too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To see why, consider a typical, profitable bank that takes in deposits and uses the money to make long-term loans. Just in case some depositors want their cash back quickly, it also keeps a small amount of liquid assets handy, a practice known as "fractional reserve banking". Now suppose that some unforeseen event--a sharp rise in interest rates, the collapse of an important borrower, a stockmarket crash--raises doubts about whether the value of a bank's assets (mainly loans) is enough to cover its liabilities (mainly deposits). Because loans are hard for outsiders to value, some depositors may assume the worst and withdraw their cash. As banks work on a "first come, first served" basis, others will follow suit, leading to a "run". This will force the bank into a fire-sale of its less liquid assets to raise cash, further weakening its finances and prolonging the run.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A systemic risk arises if the first bank's failure causes depositors who have doubts about other banks' financial solidity to run on them too. This can happen either because they think that their banks have the same problems as the one that has just failed, or because the failed bank's fire-sale has depressed the market price of other banks' assets. Whatever the cause, once a system-wide panic has begun, it is devilishly difficult to stop.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It can also have a potentially devastating effect on the real economy. As banks struggle to stay afloat, they will call in their outstanding loans and refuse to make new ones, creating a credit crunch that can aggravate an economic downturn. This was precisely what happened in the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1933, some 9,000 American banks fell like ninepins; in Europe, the collapse in 1931 of Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank, also led to a series of other failures. These created the mother of all credit crunches, which made the Depression "Great". No wonder governments are anxious to ensure that history does not repeat itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Runs by small depositors still pose a threat to banks, as demonstrated by television pictures of people lining up to withdraw money from financial institutions in Japan, Taiwan and the Baltic states within the past year. An even bigger, though less televisual, threat comes from the wholesale markets. These include the interbank loan market, through which banks lend to one another, and payments systems, through which they make and receive payments on their own and customers' behalf. Such systems make problems more contagious among banks than among other types of firm. One example is Continental Illinois, a bad-debt-laden American bank that ran into trouble in 1984 after several Asian and European banks cut their lending to it. When rumours began to fly that other American banks might suffer the same fate, the Federal Reserve stepped in to rescue Continental.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To tackle systemic risk, governments have developed a three-legged approach. The first leg is to establish a lender of last resort, usually a country's central bank, which will provide liquidity during a financial crisis, either to individual banks or to the system as a whole. The second leg is to offer deposit insurance. Typically, this involves the government insuring small deposits, either in total or in part, so that a bank's customers are less likely to run if they suspect that it is in trouble. The snag with a safety net is that it tempts banks to take big risks in the knowledge that taxpayers will foot the bill if they fail. This danger, known as "moral hazard", creates a dilemma for governments. Without a net, bank failures could devastate an economy; with it, the number of banks that take excessive risks could rise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To resolve the dilemma, governments rely on the third leg of their strategy: regulation and supervision. Yet in spite of volumes of rulebooks and armies of regulators, the cost of bank bail-outs continues to rise. In response, politicians, pundits and the public are apt to call for ever more regulation and more regulators. But a few central bankers are now beginning to admit what some academic experts have been telling them for some time: that this traditional approach to banking regulation is ineffective and needs to be rethought.
<p><b>A route map</b>
<br>This survey looks at what has been learned about bank regulation over the past decade or so, and asks whether there is a better way to ensure the safety and soundness of the system in future. It begins by considering the nature of the threat posed by systemic risk today, the flaws in the current approach to tackling it, and attempts by regulators to correct them. On the way, it looks at the role of banks in the derivatives business and some of the lessons from Japan's recent banking crisis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then it examines several of the proposals for improving financial stability floated by academics and practitioners, such as scrapping the safety net and banking regulation altogether, privatising deposit insurance, and limiting public support to only a narrow range of banks' activities. It goes on to explain why national bank regulators are bound to have a tough time tackling an increasingly international problem: systemic risk ignores borders. And it concludes by examining the links between sound banking and macroeconomic policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the main emphasis will be on rich countries, the issues raised are important for emerging markets too. Some South-East Asian countries that eased interest-rate and other restrictions on banks in the early 1980s, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, have already experienced banking booms and busts. In Latin America, banks in four countries--Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina--are struggling with crises of varying severity. And in Russia, the government is trying to restructure or close hundreds of its ailing banks. As they reshape their financial systems, all these nations have a chance to decide what they want a bank to be. A good way to start answering that question is to look at what has gone wrong in the rich countries.

<h1>System failure</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Collapse is less likely than it used to be, but the possibility is no less frightening</i>


<p>IN THE City of London and on Wall Street, this may seem an odd time to talk about financial problems. After all, for the past three years many banks on both sides of the Atlantic have been enjoying an unusually long run of record profits and soaring share prices. Yet this is no cause for complacency, if only because experience shows that banks' bad-debt problems tend to surface only once an economy begins to slow. Besides, it is not so long ago that British and American banks were also in trouble. During the dark days of the early 1990s, even some of the biggest looked decidedly shaky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On balance, however, banking is probably a sounder business today than it was in the past. For a start, banks now have fatter capital cushions than they used to, which should help them to cope with unexpected shocks. As part of the Basle capital-adequacy agreement, which came into effect fully in 1992 and set minimum standards for international banks' capital levels, these banks are supposed to hold capital equal to at least 8% of their risk-weighted assets. In addition, they must also have "tier-one" capital (mostly equity) equal to at least 4% of their risk-weighted assets. Most countries' big international banks are now comfortably above that minimum figure (see <a href="images/csu254.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As another form of self-defence, banks have also developed their own sophisticated risk-management systems. These have enabled them to identify more clearly the risks that they are running in both their lending and trading business, and to hedge, or insure themselves, against those that do not offset one another; and they have made senior managers focus more sharply on the profitability (or lack of it) of different businesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some big banks, such as America's J.P. Morgan, have even touted part of their risk-management packages to rivals. They have several motives. One is that there is money to be made from advising statistically-challenged bankers, who have not developed sophisticated systems of their own. Another, more public-spirited one, is that the more sophisticated the banking system's component parts can be made, the safer it will be as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deregulation has also strengthened banks in several ways. In America, it has allowed them to begin diversifying geographically. This should reduce some banks' dependence on the economies of single states and, with luck, make a re-run of the Texas and New England banking collapses of the 1980s less likely. At the same time, banks have continued to diversify beyond their bread-and-butter lending business. This makes sense because their role as middlemen is being undermined by the securities markets, which match borrowers and lenders directly. That is why many American and Japanese institutions have set up their own underwriting and trading operations in legally distinct subsidiaries, thus partially getting round the legal restrictions that separate commercial and investment banking in both countries.

</p><p><b>Fatter ratios, fitter banks</b>
<br>In Europe, where banks have long had a foot in both camps, the trading one is getting bigger: witness the unseemly rush by Swiss and German bankers to lay their hands on medium-sized British merchant banks with large trading outfits. Another form of diversification, <i>bancassurance</i>--tie-ups between banks and insurance companies--is still all the rage in Europe too. American bankers would love to sell more insurance, but have met stiff resistance from the country's insurance agents. They have, however, built up their fund-management operations and other fee-earning activities. Income from these and from trading has helped to offset what they have lost in their traditional lending business. According to a recent study* for New York's Federal Reserve Bank by two economists, Franklin Edwards and Frederic Mishkin, non-interest income from fees and trading as a proportion of American commercial banks' total income rose from an average of 19% in 1960-80 to 35% in 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fatter capital ratios, fancy risk-management systems and faster diversification: all of these things are undoubtedly creating a fitter banking system. At the same time, they are probably reducing the threat of a systemic crisis. To see why, consider what makes a banking system vulnerable to disruption if a bank fails. Although in some way every case is unique, there are some common themes. According to Philip Bartholomew and Gary Whalen, two economists at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees America's nationally chartered banks, these can be summed up in a few words: concentration, homogeneity, information and connections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The greater the <b>concentration</b> of a bank's loan portfolio in a single company, industry or country, the greater the chance that it will collapse if a single borrower, or group of borrowers, defaults. The same principle holds true for its trading business. Concentration is not necessarily a bad thing: it may simply reflect the bank's competitive advantage in a particular area. Moreover, by focusing on a narrow set of borrowers or counterparties, a bank may get to know them well and therefore become a better judge of their creditworthiness. But, in general, the less diversified its relationships, the more vulnerable it is to a shock.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If it does fail, others are likely to follow only if depositors at these banks think that there is a great deal of <b>homogeneity</b> between the casualty and the rest. If they conclude that there is, the result may be a bank panic. They may of course have got it wrong. But they can tell only if plenty of good <b>information</b> about banks' finances is widely available. The more there is, the easier it will be for depositors, creditors and counterparties to distinguish between good and bad banks. Sometimes word of mouth will suffice. For example, many institutions knew at an early stage that the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (<font size=-1>BCCI</font>) was crooked, and therefore avoided dealing with it, which explains why its closure in 1991 had no knock-on effect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other factor that determines the gravity of a systemic threat is the extent of the <b>connections</b> between different financial institutions. If a bank that collapses is a lone wolf that has had little to do with other banks (as in <font size=-1>BCCI</font>'s case), regulators can wash their hands of it. But if it is a big player in a particular market, a sizeable lender to other banks or an important link in payments and settlements systems, then they may think twice before allowing it to fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In two respects, matters have improved somewhat. First, lenders claim to have become savvier about assessing credit risk, or the chance that a borrower will default. Some banks, such as Britain's Barclays and Australia's Westpac, are trying to measure this risk more accurately and put a price on it. Barclays even sets aside a specific provision for credit risk when it makes loans. Such calculations rely on the risk-reducing benefits of diversification.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, more information is now available about banks' finances. Much of this is provided by private credit-rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and <font size=-1>IBCA</font>, which rate various types of debt issued by banks. Their job has been made easier because banks have been securitising more of their loans--packaging them into bundles that can be traded in a marketplace. Among the most common debts that have been sold in this way are banks' mortgage repayments, credit-card receivables and sovereign loans. By establishing a market price for these and other debts, such as loans to small businesses, securitisation allows outsiders to estimate the value of some of a bank's assets with greater accuracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Welcome though these trends are, they have not banished systemic risk for good. For a start, it seems that not all bankers may have cottoned on to risk management in lending. Over the past year or so, regulators have repeatedly given warning that margins have become dangerously thin in the syndicated-loan business, in which banks club together to lend collectively to large firms (see <a href="images/csu216.gif">chart</a>). And last month Michael Foot, the Bank of England's new head of supervision, said that stiff competition for mortgage business between banks and building societies (thrifts) could cause lenders problems if loans later turn sour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The process of securitisation is also a double-edged sword. Many of the loans that banks have disposed of in this way are top-quality, low-risk credits that appeal to a broad range of investors. Those left on their balance sheets are poorer-quality ones, which are more likely to cause problems.
</p><p><b>Cock-ups will happen</b>
<br>Even if banks have decent risk-management systems, they are not immune from what they like to call "operations risk"--a polite word for management cock-ups. At Barings, Nick Leeson, the bank's nemesis, was able to disguise huge losses because the bank committed a cardinal sin at its futures operation in Singapore: it let him keep his own books. Such lax internal controls are not as rare as they should be. Toshihide Iguchi, a bond trader in the New York branch of Japan's Daiwa Bank, somehow managed to hide his mounting losses over a period of 11 years. When he finally owned up to them in October 1995, they had reached an astonishing $1.1 billion. This blew a hole in Daiwa's balance sheet, but luckily it was not fatal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another caveat is that the financial figures available from banks often do not give an accurate picture of their true net worth. Most of their accounts are still drawn up on the basis of historic-cost accounting, so they inevitably fail to capture rapid changes in the risks being run. This gap between financial reporting and reality has grown as banks have taken on more fast-changing market risk--the risk that the price of their holdings of securities or derivatives may fall--via their proprietary trading operations, which bet the banks' own capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the threat of a systemic crisis has probably diminished, the damage that one could do if it did happen has increased exponentially. This is because financial liberalisation and the growth of global trade have brought about changes in national and international financial systems that have reinforced links between banks, as well as their ties with the financial markets. The following figures are only a snapshot of a few of these connections, but they tell a startling story.
</p><p><b>Doomsday scenario</b>
<br>In 1980 the size of America's interbank loan market was $74 billion; by 1995, it had almost doubled, to $170 billion. The international interbank lending market has grown rapidly too, reaching $5.8 trillion in June 1995.
<ul><font size=-1><li></font> According to the Bank for International Settlements (<font size=-1>BIS</font>), a sort of central bank for central banks, turnover in the foreign-exchange market, in which banks are the principal players, has reached an estimated $1.2 trillion a day, almost double the figure in 1989.
<p><font size=-1><li></font> Commercial banks are also heavily engaged in over-the-counter (<font size=-1>OTC</font>) derivatives (ie, those that are not traded on a recognised exchange). A survey of the market published under the auspices of the <font size=-1>BIS</font> showed that at the end of March 1995 the total amount of outstanding <font size=-1>OTC</font> contracts had reached an eye-popping $41 trillion.
</ul><p>In short, banks are doing more business with one another. This proliferation of relationships, together with the large amounts of money that are riding on them, has made it even more important for banks to manage the risks involved. Fortunately, the very things that have created this state of affairs--faster computers, improved communications, innovative financial instruments--have also made it easier for them to do so. This is often overlooked in the debate on whether banks' role in the <font size=-1>OTC</font> derivatives business is a bomb waiting to go off (see <a href="ibsu3.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more worrying source of systemic risk, but one that gets much less public attention, are the world's payments and settlements systems. These are often taken for granted; yet banks put unimaginably large amounts of money at risk in them, albeit for short periods. If one of the big systems were to break down, it is not just banks that would be in serious trouble, but entire economies.

<h1>Dangerous deriving?</h1>

<br><p>WILLIAM MCDONOUGH, the president of the ederal Reserve Bank of New York, has dubbed it "derivatives angst": the nagging feeling that sooner or later a transaction involving some swap or option will go wrong, causing panic in the banking system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Concern that derivatives may pose a threat to banks has been fuelled by recent derivatives-related disasters at big firms such as Japan's Kashima Oil and Germany's Metallgesellschaft; by a messy legal battle between Procter &amp; Gamble and Bankers Trust, an American bank accused of selling its client dud interest-rate swaps; and by the huge losses on Nikkei and Japanese government-bond futures that sank Britain's Barings. The main culprit was often not derivatives but lax internal controls or a failure to price risk properly; yet the impression that derivatives are dangerous has stuck. Do they really pose a new and particularly pernicious form of systemic risk?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, swaps, options and the like actually help to reduce the chance of a systemic crisis by providing a cheap and efficient mechanism for shifting risk from those who do not want it to those who do. As Martin Taylor, the boss of Barclays Bank, puts it, "Risk, like energy, is neither created nor destroyed, merely passed around." If it ends up in the hands of those who know what to do with it, the system will emerge stronger as a result.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, banks are not putting as much money at risk in derivatives as hysterical commentators sometimes suggest. When a bank makes a loan, it runs a big credit risk. If the borrower defaults, in some cases it can lose all of its money. But derivatives contracts are different. The size of a contract, or its "notional" value, is simply a reference point for calculating how much is actually owed. For instance, an interest-rate swap may have a notional value of $40m, but the cost of replacing it if one party defaults will reflect only the movement in interest rates since the contract was drawn up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Often, this is a small fraction of the notional value. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the cost of replacing all of the over-the-counter (<font size=-1>OTC</font>) derivatives contracts (ie, those not traded on an exchange) outstanding at the end of March 1995 was $1.7 trillion, or just 4% of their notional value. A recent study for the New York Fed shows that--except for J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust--most banks' credit risk from derivatives is tiny compared with that from lending (see <a href="images/csu120.gif">chart</a>). So if they are going to go bust, it will probably still be in the old-fashioned way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The outcome of the Barings affair has also confounded Cassandras who had predicted that the collapse of a big trader would badly hit both the derivatives exchanges involved and the underlying market (in this case, Japan's stockmarket). In the event, both the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange coped with the shock; and when the Japanese market opened on the Monday after Barings closed, the Nikkei average fell just 4% before bouncing back the next day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some regulators worry that derivatives make it easier for banks to "leverage" themselves because the downpayment for a contract is much smaller than the amount of money it puts at risk. But there are plenty of other ways in which banks can take huge bets on markets. As for worries about derivatives' complexity, the recent disasters mostly involved relatively simple contracts. The true cause of the fiascos was not complexity but greed, hubris or mismanagement--and sometimes all three.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another much-cited cause for concern is the biggest banks' domination of their industry's derivatives business. According to the same Fed study, at the end of 1994 the seven largest bank derivative dealers accounted for more than 90% of all contracts held by American banks. But by and large these firms have also invested more heavily in risk-management systems than smaller banks, and have good credit ratings. A more fragmented market would not necessarily lessen the risk of a systemic crisis; it might even increase it by bringing in many less experienced players.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lack of widely available information about some areas of the <font size=-1>OTC</font> derivatives business is worrying. But at last banks everywhere seem to be recognising that it is in everybody's best interest to know as much as possible about their counterparties, and their counterparties' counterparties. In the past couple of years a stream of reports from industry groups and regulatory bodies have recommended changes in disclosure and accounting policies to clear away much of the statistical fog.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This does not mean that regulators can afford to relax. Banks' derivatives activities need no less attention (but no more either) than the other parts of their business. The fact that they have become far bigger forces in derivatives than, say, securities houses, is striking. One possible explanation for this comes from a report on derivatives published in 1994 by America's General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog. This hints that banks may run bigger risks (relative to their capital) because they have a government safety net to fall back on. If so, the real problem is not derivatives, but governments' willingness to underwrite too much risk. Time, perhaps, for some taxpayer angst?

<h1>Can't pay, won't pay</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Watch out for blockages in the financial plumbing</i>

<p>IT IS the stuff of which nightmares and movies are made. The scene is New York, late one Friday the 13th. Wall Street is in turmoil. The stockmarket is plunging. Suddenly a big bank announces that it needs help because trading losses have wiped out its capital. It refuses to settle up with the banks to which it has sent $10 billion-worth of payment instructions earlier in the day. This spells serious trouble for those banks, which have already paid the cash to their customers. So they, in turn, renege on settlements with other banks. Eventually, the entire banking system grinds to a halt. Chaos quickly spreads to the rest of the economy as companies discover they cannot make or receive payments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mercifully, this is fiction. But the threat is real because many of the world's wholesale payments and settlements systems--networks that allow banks to send large amounts of money to one another and settle foreign-exchange or securities deals--operate on the basis of "netting". This works as follows. In the course of a day, two banks, <font size=-1>A</font> and <font size=-1>B</font>, send thousands of payments instructions to each other, but no cash. The bank receiving an instruction simply credits its customers' accounts while the system keeps track of the two banks' net position. At the end of the day, if <font size=-1>A</font> owes <font size=-1>B</font> money, it settles by transferring the amount owing from its account at the central bank (if the payments system is a public one) or the clearing house (if it is privately run) to <font size=-1>B</font>'s account. If that payment cannot be made, then it may affect <font size=-1>B</font>'s ability to meet its settlement commitments to other banks, creating chaos and, just possibly, a string of defaults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to the growth in payments systems, netting now operates on a multilateral basis, involving many different banks. Tom Labrecque, the president of Chase Manhattan, an American bank that recently merged with Chemical Bank, reckons that the money passing through the world's payments and settlements networks each day now adds up to $6 trillion. The sheer size of the amounts at stake was also highlighted by recent figures from the <font size=-1>BIS</font>, which showed that in some countries the annual value just of interbank payments had more than doubled as a proportion of <font size=-1>GDP</font> since 1985 (see <a href="images/csu125.gif">chart</a>). Payments systems as a whole in America, Germany and Japan now turn over the equivalent of their annual <font size=-1>GDP</font> every few days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time, the amounts that banks owe one another during the day has rocketed. The chart found <a href="images/csu131.gif">here</a> shows a combined figure for America's privately run Clearing House Interbank Payments System (<font size=-1>CHIPS</font>) and Fedwire, a system run by the Federal Reserve. These "daylight overdrafts" are sometimes larger than banks' capital bases. Trying to work out exactly who owes what to whom is tricky. At a recent conference on payments systems hosted by Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, Gerald Corrigan, the chairman of the bank's international advisory council and a former president of New York's Fed, said that these systems "constitute an extraordinarily complex chain of financial flows and resulting credit interdependencies that I dare say nobody fully understands."
</p><p><b>Clear as mud</b>
<br>It is this opacity, coupled with the size of the credit exposures involved, that creates a potential systemic risk. Mr Corrigan fears that banks have become more defensive, and may refuse to meet their settlement commitments at the first sign of trouble. A senior executive of one big European bank agrees. As he delicately puts it, if an important link in a payments system were to break, "it would be every man for himself and screw the rest of you." But what if a troubled bank simply delayed settlement for, say, a day rather than refusing to pay outright? That way the other banks would eventually get their money. But they would still have to raise money to bridge the gap, perhaps by selling assets. If they could not do so fast enough, they might need help.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To start tackling these risks, some central banks have assumed a more active role in payments systems. In Fedwire's case, the Federal Reserve guarantees payment "finality", meaning that transactions will not be unwound if a bank fails to settle. The central bank will pick up the tab if a bank defaults. Private-sector systems, such as <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> and Britain's Clearing House Automated Payments System, have imposed limits on their members' overall indebtedness to one another. <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> and Japan's private-sector payments system have also introduced loss-sharing arrangements, so that one bank's failure will not stop others from settling.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A number of countries, mostly in Europe, have gone for another approach: real-time gross settlement (<font size=-1>RTGS</font>). This involves banks settling their large payments with one another immediately, assuming their accounts with the central bank have enough money in them. This should dramatically reduce systemic risk because if a bank fails, it will owe little to others. The difficulty with <font size=-1>RTGS</font> is to ensure that enough credit is available to smooth payment flows, but without making it so cheap that it encourages banks to take big risks. Some <font size=-1>RTGS</font> systems, such as the Bank of Japan's, forbid daylight overdrafts; instead, banks have to raise loans from an interbank market. Others, such as those in Britain and the Netherlands, require banks to provide liquid assets as collateral before their settlement accounts can be overdrawn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Progress has also been made in reducing systemic risk in other areas. One is securities settlement, where there is often a lag of several days between, say, the delivery of a share and payment for it. This is gradually being reduced (for equities in America, from five business days to three last year) and may eventually disappear. <font size=-1>RTGS</font> also helps here by ensuring that, once it has been made, a payment for a security is irrevocable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for derivatives, those traded on exchanges pose less of a problem because multilateral netting keeps settlement flows small, members are required to put up collateral ("margin") against their positions and these positions are subject to limits. Some <font size=-1>OTC</font> contracts also include margin arrangements, though it is difficult to say how widespread this practice is. This has prompted some people to recommend that the clearing-house concept should be extended to the <font size=-1>OTC</font> market, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some regulators fear that the international links that derivatives create could complicate settlement problems if a bank defaults. But again, this risk is not new. And because netting arrangements mean that the amounts involved are small, a glitch here is less worrying than in some other areas. Indeed, by far the biggest settlement threat looms in the foreign-exchange market, where bankers still quake in their boots at the mention of "Herstatt risk"--the danger that a bank, having fulfilled its side of a foreign-exchange trade by delivering currency, suddenly discovers that its counterparty has not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1974 Bankhaus Herstatt, a medium-sized German bank, was closed down by the German authorities. Herstatt had been in the middle of over $620m-worth of foreign-exchange trades, and had received <font size=-1>D</font>-marks from a number of American and other banks. But it was shut before New York's settlements system had opened, and so did not transfer dollars in return. This caused a panic in America, where banks that had sent money to Herstatt refused to make other payments on their, or their customers', behalf. <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> wobbled, but fortunately did not go down.
</p><p><b>Keep going round the clock</b></b>
<br>Since then, Herstatt risk has been reduced by measures such as extending the opening hours of national settlements systems to reduce the troublesome gap (next year, for example, Fedwire will stay open an extra six hours). But more needs to be done. Last month, a hard-hitting report from a <font size=-1>BIS</font> committee headed by William McDonough, the New York Fed's boss, said that settlement risk in foreign exchange can sometimes stretch out over more than three days, and berated banks for failing to measure and manage their exposures properly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bankers finally seem to be getting the message that something needs to be done to tackle this problem. Shortly before the <font size=-1>BIS</font> report appeared, a group of the world's biggest banks, dubbed the <font size=-1>G-20</font> (even though there are only 17 members; who said bankers could count?), announced plans to create a 24-hour organisation for foreign-exchange settlements within the next few years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that the world's payments and settlements systems have proved reasonably solid over the past 20 years partly reflects improved risk management. But there have been several close shaves. In November 1985, for instance, the New York Fed lent $23 billion to the Bank of New York--more than 20 times the bank's capital--after a computer glitch caused it accidentally to run up a daylight overdraft of almost $30 billion. The Fed also had to step in after the 1987 stockmarket crash to encourage commercial banks to keep lending to securities houses which were supporting troubled customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Small wonder, then, that central banks take a great interest in the design and development of payments systems. They are worried that, left to their own devices, banks might not develop real-time systems, which are safer than netting but more expensive. But should central banks run as well as oversee payments and settlements systems? After all, there is no shortage of initiatives from the private sector, such as <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> and the proposed global clearing house for foreign-exchange deals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Central bankers argue that close involvement on their part creates confidence and therefore reduces the chance of a systemic crisis. But it also creates a significant moral hazard. Safe in the knowledge that the central bank will provide finality and a safety net, banks could become slapdash about managing credit and liquidity risks, thus making daylight overdrafts soar and increasing the likely cost of bailouts. This has already happened on Fedwire. To tackle the problem, the New York Fed has recently begun to charge fees for daylight overdrafts and to require collateral from banks that regularly run up large credit positions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tougher rules are probably justified, but the Fed is worried that these may cause banks to decamp to rival systems. This is just one example of how government action can inadvertently increase systemic risk. A much more worrying case of this kind of regulatory failure is the perverse effect of deposit insurance and banking bailouts.

<h1>A financial horror story</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>How safety nets create banking zombies</i>

<p>WHY is the banking system so fragile? The answer seems obvious. On the deposit-taking side of their business, banks are vulnerable to contagious runs by uninformed and flighty customers; on the payments side, they can easily become the innocent victims of someone else's problems. End of story. Or is it? According to some economists, leaving the government's safety net off the list of causes of instability in banking is like leaving the Prince of Denmark out of "Hamlet". The net's operation, they say, has created a perverse set of incentives in banking that is contributing to the rising cost of bank failures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The debate about the safety net is liveliest in America, which has long relied on deposit insurance to prevent systemic problems in its atomised banking system (at the last count it still had over 10,000 banks). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>FDIC</font>), which manages the bank insurance fund, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>FSLIC</font>), which manages the <font size=-1>S&L</font>s' one, were both set up in 1934, after the worst period of instability in American banking history. The aim was to reassure worried depositors that even if their bank ran into trouble, their money was safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other countries with more concentrated banking systems have largely relied on a lender of last resort to deal with troubled banks. Although many of them have set up their own insurance schemes, these have been intended mainly to protect depositors, not to prop up the system. Most of these schemes offer less generous coverage than America's 100% of deposits up to $100,000 (see <a href="images/tsu258.gif">table</a>), and come in 57 different varieties. Britain's, for instance, is statutory and, in effect, compulsory; Germany's is informal and voluntary. America's scheme is administered by the government, whereas those in Germany and France are privately run. Most rely on contributions from the banks, with governments chipping in once a fund has been exhausted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the 1980s, government insurance of deposits in America seemed to be that rare thing, an economic policy that worked as intended. In the 1920s the country lost roughly 6,000 of its 30,000 banks, and thousands more between 1930 and 1933, amid numerous runs. But between the establishment of the <font size=-1>FDIC</font> and the early 1980s, on average only about 15 commercial banks a year failed. Much the same was true for <font size=-1>S&L</font>s. Yet by the end of 1991, 1,000 banks were on the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>'s problem list; and by 1992 almost half the 4,000 thrifts that had been around at the start of the 1980s had disappeared. <font size=-1>FSLIC</font> went bankrupt, requiring a $150 billion government bailout.
</p><p><b>Betting the bank</b></b>
<br>What went wrong? Part of the blame has been laid on rising interest rates, incompetent management and lax oversight. But the main lesson of the thrift crisis in particular is the "moral hazard" created by comprehensive deposit insurance. Knowing that their money was safe, the thrifts' small depositors had no incentive to monitor the risks these institutions were taking. At the same time, stiffer competition encouraged thrifts to take bigger risks with depositors' money, safe in the knowledge that if the worst came to the worst, the government would protect depositors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A paper by Arthur Rolnick of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis*<font size=1>(1)&#160; </font> provides a neat illustration of the problem. Assume, he says, that a man who has $200,000 in cash uses $100,000 of it to open a bank, which becomes a member of the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>. Assume, too, that he offers a rate of interest slightly above his competitors' and attracts $900,000 of deposits. The bank now has $1m of reserves (his $100,000 of equity plus $900,000 of deposits). To put the bank's $1m to work, he goes to Las Vegas, finds a casino with a roulette wheel and bets the entire amount on black. At the same time, he bets his remaining cash of $100,000 on the only other colour, red.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the bank's point of view, this is an extremely risky investment, but to the shareholder it looks perfectly safe. If the red comes up, the bank goes bust, making its stock worthless. But the shareholder's winning private bet on red takes his cash to $200,000, back where he started before he opened the bank. If the black comes up, he will have lost his $100,000 bet, but the rise in the value of his bank stock will more than compensate for that. As for the bank's small depositors, they do not care what the bank does because their money, including the interest on it, is protected by the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>. This example shows that, provided shareholders can either hedge the risk of their investment in a bank, or are relaxed about it because it represents only a small fraction of their overall portfolio, they will want the bank to pursue the riskiest strategy possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is this what happens in real life? The parallel depends on the financial health of a bank. In good times, its managers are unlikely to take huge risks with depositors' and shareholders' money, not least because they have their jobs and reputations to protect. But their attitude could change if the bank is close to insolvency. By raising rates to attract new deposits and then betting everything on a few risky investments, they can try to turn it around. This "gambling for resurrection", in economists' parlance, is what happened at many troubled thrifts, which often tried to avoid liquidation by spending billions of dollars on risky junk bonds, or investing in shopping centres in the middle of the desert. Some banks also took reckless gambles, only to end up in the arms of the insurance fund.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surely, you might think, big, uninsured depositors at a bank or thrift would put a stop to this? Not necessarily. For a start, governments often bail out all the depositors of big banks that run into trouble. When Continental Illinois became insolvent in 1984, the <font size=-1>FDIC</font> announced that it would protect all depositors, not just small ones. The rescue of France's Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais, state support for big banks in Sweden, Finland and Norway, and Latin American governments' efforts to protect their banking flagships all bear witness to a "too big to fail" policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even big depositors in smaller banks have little incentive to keep an eagle eye on their bankers. To see why, consider the ways in which governments deal with the corpse of a bank that has gone bust. These include:
<ul>
<font size=-1><li></font>Burial (or liquidation). This involves paying off a bank's insured depositors and then selling its assets to help reimburse any uninsured creditors, including the deposit insurer itself. <font size=-1>BCCI</font> was laid to rest in this way.
<font size=-1><li></font>Reincarnation (or merger). If there is still some value in a deceased bank's franchise--its customer base, its labour force, its branch network--another bank might be willing to buy it and to take over its liabilities, possibly with some financial help from the deposit insurer. An example of a bank reborn is Barings, which was bought by <font size=-1>ING</font> of the Netherlands in March 1995.
<font size=-1><li></font>Resuscitation (or state guarantee). A bank may be revived either by providing it with a state guarantee of its borrowings, or by stripping some of the worst loans off its balance sheet and placing them in a state-financed "bad" bank. Both France and Sweden have used this method.
<font size=-1><li></font>Divine intervention (or nationalisation). This is the most extreme solution, reserved for occasions when a government fears that the collapse of a bank could trigger a systemic crisis. The Norwegian state took over some of the country's biggest banks in the early 1990s because it feared a run on them.
</ul>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When a bank is "buried", its uninsured depositors are unlikely to get much, if any, of their money back. In <font size=-1>BCCI</font>'s case, for example, the British government steadfastly refused to pay out more than the official limit. But under the other methods, both big and small deposits are usually fully protected. So the prospect of lots of burials would provide a strong incentive for big depositors either to stop their banks from taking big risks or to pull their money out fast if they do. Unfortunately, burials are rare. In a study*<font size=1>(2)&#160; </font>of 120 bank failures in 24 countries, mainly between the early 1980s and early 1990s, Charles Goodhart and Dirk Schoenmaker of the London School of Economics found that two out of three failed banks were bailed out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This highlights another problem. Regulators routinely tell banks that if they become insolvent, they will be dealt with harshly. But when banks, especially large ones, get into trouble, the same regulators often work hard to keep them afloat. This "regulatory forbearance" undermines the credibility of the threat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why do regulators forbear? They may be worried that closing one bank could trigger a run on others, or they may be under pressure from politicians to show leniency. Whatever the reason, the cost of procrastination can be high, as America's thrift crisis showed. When rising interest rates tipped many thrifts into insolvency in 1982, regulators tried to sweep the problem under the carpet by altering the accounting rules they applied to the industry. They knew that the alternative--closing the thrifts down, at an estimated cost of $20 billion--would bankrupt the <font size=-1>FSLIC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regulators were encouraged in their efforts by national and state politicians who lobbied on the thrifts' behalf. Thus they helped keep alive what Ed Kane, a professor at Boston College, calls "zombie" <font size=-1>S&L</font>s--living-dead institutions that distorted the rest of the market by offering higher interest rates and slashing loan prices in a gamble for resurrection. This forced healthier thrifts to follow suit, turning them into zombies too. In the end the industry had to be bailed out anyway, by which time the price tag had risen to an exceedingly painful $150 billion.
</p><p><b>Cheques, but few balances</b></b>
<br>In their defence, regulators argue that sometimes forbearance is essential to avert a run on a bank. The same argument is often used to justify the intervention of a lender of last resort to prop up an ailing bank. Take America's Continental Illinois, mentioned earlier in this article. When, in 1984, it suffered a disastrous run on its interbank deposits, nearly 1,000 other banks had money in its accounts. Without government support, a systemic crisis might have erupted. But some academics have since questioned the case for a rescue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George Kaufman, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, has claimed that before the bailout, regulators were assuming that the recovery rate on Continental's assets would be around 97%--a level at which only two creditor banks would have lost between half and all of their capital. In the event, the recovery rate was a little above 95%, close to the original estimate. Yet when the crisis occurred, the size of the bank's losses and the time it would take to recover its assets were both unclear. This uncertainty could have triggered a much wider run if the Federal Reserve had not provided the bank with emergency loans. The Bank of England also invoked the threat of a widespread run to justify a &#163;240m ($360m) rescue plan in 1991 for several small British banks that had got into trouble after lending heavily to the property sector.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some scholars, including Mr Kaufman, argue that bank runs are not as threatening as they seem because they generally involve a flight to quality, with depositors pulling their money out of sick banks and redepositing it with healthy ones. This means bad banks close faster. But what if fleeing depositors simply stick their cash under mattresses instead of putting it into another bank? In such cases, the academics say, governments should pump money into the banking system as a whole to offset the effects of a monetary contraction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their case for restraint at first sight seems compelling, but it takes no account of the other economic costs of bank runs. They can destroy long-standing relationships between banks and their customers, who have to spend time and money finding new sources of finance. Moreover, those banks that survive may be reluctant to take risks with new borrowers. It is these side-effects--call the problem "systemic mess"--that make bank failures so damaging to an economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this is an excuse for lenders of last resort to hand ailing banks a blank cheque, however. More than a century ago, in his book "Lombard Street", Walter Bagehot, a former editor of this newspaper, provided central bankers with a classic guide to handling the problem. They should, he wrote, lend only to banks that are solvent but illiquid, and then only at a penal rate. He also said that lenders of last resort should make their intentions clear in advance to discourage banks from taking excessive risks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A handful of central bankers have heeded this advice, including Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. He has publicly stated several times that the Bank will prop up institutions only if their failure poses a systemic risk, and that any support given would be on particularly onerous terms. The collapse of <font size=-1>BCCI</font> and, in particular, Barings provided proof that the Bank means what it says. Most other central banks have left their intentions unspoken--a policy known as "constructive ambiguity". Yet their actions have often been far from ambiguous. Time and again, they have leapt to the aid of big banks, reinforcing the impression that, solvent or not, some of them are "too big to fail". In many cases, they have been unwilling to let even small banks collapse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that by being too generous with their support, most lenders of last resort have eroded the penalties for excessive risk-taking in banking. Japan is one of the countries that has discovered just how dangerous and expensive it can be to ignore Bagehot's advice.

<h1>Trouble in Tokyo</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Moral hazard has played a part in Japan's banking disaster, too</i>

<p>WHEN, in December 1995, America wound up its Resolution Trust Corporation, the body set up to dispose of the bad assets of savings and loan associations, it closed the book at last on an awkward episode in its financial history. Most European countries have also put their banking crises behind them. But Japan's refuses to go away. Among the culprits being blamed for the mess are hapless bankers, greedy property developers and even the <i>yakuza</i> (Japanese gangsters), who apparently built up property businesses with cheap credit from banks. But, in some ways, the real villains of the piece are bank regulators.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese banks' problems are especially worrying because bank finance plays a crucial role in the country's economy. At the end of 1995, total bank credit as a proportion of nominal <font size=-1>GNP</font> in Japan was 105% compared with just 37% in America, where domestic capital markets are much bigger. So if several of Japan's big banks were to collapse, the resulting credit crunch might devastate Japan's economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese officials have been hard at work trying to prevent anything of the sort. When the depositors of Cosmo, the country's fifth-largest credit union, began a run on it last July, the Bank of Japan stepped in with emergency loans--the first time it had done so since 1965, when it bailed out Yamaichi, a stockbroker. More recently, the government has been trying to push a &#165;685 billion ($6.3 billion) rescue package for seven all-but-bankrupt <i>jusen</i>, or mortgage lenders, through parliament against bitter political opposition. Even if the package gets through, the <i>jusen </i>are the tip of the iceberg. On some estimates, their bad debts are no more than a tenth of the banking system's as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan got into a mess in much the same way as did several European countries that suffered banking crises in the early 1990s. Like European banks, Japanese ones faced a profit squeeze in the 1980s as interest rates on deposits were progressively deregulated. By 1990 the proportion of deposits paying market rates of interest at Japan's city (or commercial) banks had risen to 70%, from only 22% in 1985. To compensate, banks lent aggressively to the property sector, either directly or indirectly via non-banks, many of which were big property lenders too (see <a href="images/csu149.gif">chart</a>). When the property market crashed, they were left with huge bad debts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What made Japan's headache even worse was that its big banks had invested especially heavily in equities during the stockmarket bubble. This created what Andrew Smithers, an economic consultant, calls "a doomsday machine". Under the Basle capital-adequacy rules, Japan's banks are allowed to count up to 45% of the unrealised gains on their equity holdings towards "tier-two" capital. That is fine if the market is rising, but dangerous if it is falling sharply. Last year some analysts predicted that if the Nikkei stockmarket average slipped below 13,000, the aggregate Basle ratio for the country's biggest banks would fall below the 8% minimum. Thanks to various official efforts to prop up the Japanese stockmarket, the Nikkei only fell to 14,485 before it began climbing again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; How did Japanese banks get into such trouble? Not because of deposit insurance, which in America has generally been blamed for encouraging banks' follies. The Deposit Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>DIC</font>), Japan's version of America's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is puny by comparison. It covers deposits up to a limit of &#165;10m, but exhausted its meagre resources by helping to arrange the mergers of a few small troubled banks last year.
</p><p><b>Blame the bureaucrats</b>
<br>One important culprit is the country's finance ministry, which supervises the banking industry. Until the 1970s, it ran what became known as the "convoy system", under which banks were all expected to steam in the same direction and at the same rate of knots. The ministry's officials more or less took the helm, telling banks what they should and should not do. No wonder bankers did not bother assessing risk. When some banks ran into trouble, officials persuaded healthier ones to bail them out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now the ministry is finding it increasingly hard to persuade Japanese banks to come to one another's aid. Rei Masunaga, the deputy president of the Japan Centre for International Finance, a research institute, says that even relatively healthy banks have some bad debts, so they are less keen to stump up cash for others. This harder-nosed attitude has been obvious in the debate over who pays for rescuing the <i>jusen</i>. These were originally founded by the big banks, which have refused to foot almost all of the bill for a rescue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the mandarins have been guilty of forbearance, it may be partly because they have had difficulty in finding buyers for troubled institutions. A preliminary report by an advisory committee, appointed by the finance ministry to look into the causes of the crisis, concluded last September that some financial institutions had been allowed to stay in business "even though [their] financial condition had worsened practically to the point of failure... Consequently, disposal costs tended to be larger." A good example of this is Kizu, an Osaka credit union. In 1994 regulators found a &#165;600 billion hole in its balance sheet, but still allowed it to stay open. When it eventually closed in August 1995, the loss had risen to &#165;960 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regulators were also slow to tackle the problems at many of the <i>jusen</i>. Cynics ask whether this might have had something to do with the large number of former finance-ministry officials who hold senior jobs at these institutions. Whatever the truth, the common practice (known as <i>amakudari</i>, or "descent from heaven") of bureaucrats moving to posts at banks they used to supervise has created the impression, as one foreign consultant puts it, that these people are simply "regulating their pre-retirement income".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The finance ministry has also been reluctant to force the banks to own up to the full extent of their bad loans. Better information matters because if creditors and depositors cannot distinguish between good and bad banks, in the event of a failure they are more likely to cause a run on all of them. Indeed, the ministry's own uncertainty about the true size of the banks' bad-debt problem--put at &#165;40 trillion in June 1995 and &#165;50 trillion only a month later--helped unnerve the market last year. David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, argues that until banks are forced to own up to and realise all of their bad loans, and then refinance borrowers, the country's property market is likely to remain moribund.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For now, though, the ministry seems to be hoping that a combination of low interest rates and tax breaks will be enough to tide most institutions over. Belatedly, it has also allowed some banks to go bust. Until last year, not a single Japanese bank had failed since the second world war. Since then, several small ones have gone under, including Taiheiyo Bank, which collapsed last month. But depositors should not have to worry. Officials have promised that they will not let any of Japan's 21 big banks fail, and that deposits at smaller ones will be protected until the end of the decade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what then? The finance ministry says it intends to get tougher with its charges. At the end of last year it announced a series of reforms which included beefing up the deposit-insurance fund, hiring more examiners and creating an early-warning system to alert regulators to trouble. Bankers seem unworried by this prospect: there is still no formal commitment to banking burials, and the reforms do not include any proposals to improve financial disclosure. That is a pity, because regulators in other countries increasingly feel that the only effective way to supervise complicated beasts such as banks is to harness market forces to the task.

<h1>Safe banking</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Like safe sex, safe banking requires effective precautions</i>

<p>THERE is a simple solution to the problem of moral hazard. The bosses of Japanese banks that fail could be made to fall on their swords. American bankers could be tossed from the top of the Empire State building, French ones from the Eiffel Tower. That would make bankers much more cautious in future, and banks much less fragile. But leaving aside the humanitarian objections, there is another snag: lending would dry up. Companies and individuals would find it far harder to get credit, and society as a whole would be worse off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Striking the right balance between efficiency and financial stability is a devilishly difficult task, as America's <font size=-1>S&L</font>s and Japan's <i>jusen</i> have demonstrated. Academics, consultants and regulators are still trying to come up with ways of avoiding the pitfalls. One school of thought argues that the present system of regulation can be modified in ways that will help to reduce, though not eliminate, moral hazard. Another argues that more far-reaching changes are needed in the structure of the safety net that underpins most of the world's banks. This article considers the regulators' responses to the increasing complexity of banking risks. The next looks at some of the radical suggestions for reforming the structure of the banking system to make it safer.
</p><p><b>Tightening the screws</b></b>
<br>An obvious answer to the problem of moral hazard is to tighten regulation dramatically, while retaining comprehensive deposit insurance. But there are several problems with this approach. For a start, it probably would not work, because banks are past masters at finding loopholes in laws. Worse, an attempt to turn the screws might simply drive business to more lightly regulated offshore havens. It would certainly impose an even heftier burden on banks, which would pass it on to their customers. A study by the London Business School last year found that the annual direct cost of financing regulators' activities in Britain was almost &#163;90m ($140m); in America, it was $795m. On top of this, banks also have to foot the bill for the paperwork that regulators demand. The American Bankers Association has estimated the cost of this to its members at $14 billion a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So rather than introducing new restrictions, some governments are looking for other ways of getting banks to behave more prudently. One option is to give all depositors a greater incentive to monitor their banks by limiting government insurance to a fixed percentage of deposits--a system known as "co-insurance". Under such a scheme, which is currently used in Britain, all depositors have a strong incentive to watch the activities of their banks carefully. At the same time, there is less of an incentive for regulators fully to protect depositors when a bank does go bust.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another way of encouraging banks to be cautious is to tie their deposit-insurance premiums to the riskiness of their portfolios (at present, most premiums are calculated as a straight percentage of a bank's assets). This amounts to charging banks for the risks that they are asking taxpayers to bear. America's <font size=-1>FDIC</font> is in the van: since 1993, it has based its premiums on banks' capital-to-assets ratios and the results of bank examinations. But assessing the exact riskiness of a bank's portfolio is tricky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regulators, too, are trying something different. Their idea is to create rules that encourage banks to behave as they would if there were no safety net--a strategy that Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, the chairman of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, has dubbed "market-friendly" regulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Padoa-Schioppa argues that the original Basle capital ratios on credit risk were a move away from credit ceilings and other administrative measures, and a first step towards market friendliness. But they failed to recognise that some risks cancel each other out; banks must still put capital against them. They also failed to distinguish between different categories of credit risk: for example, loans to a blue-chip corporate giant and a tiny high-tech start-up both carry a risk-weighting of 100%. And so the list of gripes goes on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the rules covering market risk--the threat of losses on securities because of price movement--the Basle committee has taken a new step. Instead of stipulating a framework of detailed capital ratios for everyone, it has given banks a choice. Either they can use their own financial models to calculate how much capital to hold against their risks (although the result is subject to a multiplier laid down by the committee), or they can use the regulators' standard formula. Each bank must calculate a "value at risk" for itself: the maximum amount that it might expect to lose by holding a particular position for a certain period. If all goes according to plan, this new way of measuring market risk will be implemented by the end of 1997.
</p><p><b>Do-it-yourself regulation</b></b>
<br>The advantage of this method is that it should minimise the distortion of banks' activities caused by rigid capital rules. At the same time it is intended to encourage banks to improve their risk management, because the best risk managers should face relatively low capital charges. In the same spirit, America's Federal Reserve has floated another idea for calculating capital requirements for market risk, called "pre-commitment". This would allow banks to decide for themselves what their likely maximum loss will be on a trading portfolio over a certain period and to set capital aside against this. If the actual losses exceed the limits the banks have set, regulators can "fine" them by, say, imposing extra capital charges.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This carrot-and-stick strategy is based on the realisation that regulators will find it hard to judge which risk-management models will work. Under pre-commitment, they need not bother with such assessments. The problem is that such penalties may not always be an effective deterrent to excessive risk-taking. If a bank has run up far bigger losses than expected on its trading portfolio, a hefty fine might push it into bankruptcy, so regulators might think twice before imposing one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is another snag with both the model and the pre-commitment approaches. Neither provides a direct answer to the problem of sloppy internal controls. Yet it was these that caused both the Barings and Daiwa Bank crises. Regulators are trying to give banks an incentive to sharpen up here, too. Some are adding a new form of oversight, which America's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (<font size=-1>OCC</font>) calls "supervision by risk". Eugene Ludwig, the agency's boss, talks about developing "a risk vocabulary for banks" on the basis of the new method that the <font size=-1>OCC</font> began using this year. The idea is for watchdogs to rate banks' internal processes as well as their finances. To do this they must assess, among other things, how much directors know about a bank's risk-management strategy and how independent its internal audit teams are.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But without the powers and resources of a secret police force, regulators will find it hard to monitor banks' affairs so intimately. Better, some say, to rely even more on market forces by making banks issue some form of subordinated debt, if they have not already done so. The idea behind this is simple. Because holders of this debt know that, if a bank fails, their claims will be the last to be honoured (hence the term "subordinated"), they should have a big incentive to monitor banks closely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even subordinated debt might not change banks' behaviour if the debtholders believe that governments will tend to rescue troubled banks. Could something be done to cure this habit, too? George Kaufman of Loyola University in Chicago and George Benston of Emory University in Atlanta think so. They are the brains behind a scheme called Structured Early Intervention and Resolution (<font size=-1>SEIR</font>), which tries to mimic what would happen to banks in the absence of deposit insurance by creating a sort of bankruptcy code. Typically, shareholders of an ordinary company whose equity has shrunk dramatically are asked by creditors to recapitalise the firm. If they do not, the creditors may force it into bankruptcy. Yet troubled banks rarely face such ultimatums because their depositors know that the government will rescue them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>SEIR</font> changes this by forcing banks to hold plenty of capital, and by prescribing a series of progressively tougher actions that regulators must take each time a bank's capital-to-assets ratio falls below certain pre-determined levels. When the bank's net worth has reached a pre-set low point, but before it goes into the red, the regulators are meant to shut it down. This system has three big advantages over the status quo. The first is that the sanctions make it far harder for banks to gamble with depositors' cash as their fortunes decline. The second is that at the point when banks are shut, they should still have enough money in their coffers to pay depositors. Lastly, at least in principle, under such a system no bank should be too big to fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese and other taxpayers might be delighted at the chance to tie their regulators' hands. But will <font size=-1>SEIR</font> work in practice? America has had its own version, known as "prompt corrective action", since 1991 (see <a href="images/tsu142.gif">table</a>). Among other things, this forbids weak banks from accepting brokered deposits--large sums of money broken up into small amounts so that they qualify for deposit insurance--and restricts the interest rates they can offer. But there have been few big-bank failures in recent years, so the system has not yet been fully tested. Moreover, Messrs Kaufman and Benston complain that the American system has watered down their proposals by, for example, including a get-out clause enabling regulators to offer banks special help in some circumstances.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Market-friendly regulation, supervision by risk and prompt corrective action all seem like perfectly good ideas. But there is no guarantee that they will work, or that the proliferation of rules they imply will be cost-effective. One thing is certain, however. None of them will do any good unless banks are forced to provide more information about their business more quickly. At least one country, New Zealand, is relying on greater disclosure as a substitute for much of the traditional paraphernalia of supervision (see <a href="ibsu8.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some officials are beginning to suggest that the present system may need to be adapted in more radical ways. In a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos in February, Thomas Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Board of Kansas City, said that regulators would find it increasingly hard to keep up with large global banks dealing in complex financial instruments. To do so effectively, he said, they would need to know "as much about a bank, its model and control procedures as the rocket scientists who built the model and the management who designed the risk-management strategy." Given these difficulties, Mr Hoenig suggested that it might be time to remove the safety net from such banks altogether. That is just what many financial economists have been saying for some time.

<h1>A novel bank statement</h1>


<br><p>WOULD a bigger role for market forces in disciplining banks make the system more stable? Many financial economists are convinced that the answer is yes, but they have no recent empirical evidence to support their view. That is about to change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the start of this year, New Zealand, which has no deposit-insurance scheme, relied on a system of bank examinations to ensure financial stability. That system has now been scrapped. Instead, every bank must produce a comprehensive quarterly financial statement for the country's central bank, listing items such as the quality of its assets, the sectors it has lent to and its ratings from private credit-rating agencies. A bank's statements must be audited twice yearly, and a two-page summary must be posted in all of its branches. The first statements, for the year to end-March, should appear soon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not all. Under the new regime, bank directors will have to validate these reports and state publicly that their bank's risk-management system is suitable for its business and that it is being properly implemented. If a bank subsequently goes bust because of a lapse of control, woe betide its directors: creditors can sue them and they may face unlimited liability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The aim of the reform, says Don Brash, New Zealand's central-bank governor, is to improve banks' internal governance. It will also give investors and depositors more detailed and timely information on the banks' financial health. The banks, for their part, will escape the central bank's rules on internal control systems and its examination fees. They will, however, still have to meet the Basle capital-adequacy ratios, and will be promptly dealt with if they fail to do so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Zealand's approach to disclosure is anathema to regulators almost everywhere else. Some argue that the country was able to choose this route only because around 90% of the assets in its banking system belong to subsidiaries of foreign banks, which are in effect supervised by their home countries' regulators. Mr Brash insists that the reason for the central bank's decision to switch arose purely from its conviction that the traditional approach to regulation was flawed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other central banks point out several problems with New Zealand's experiment. One is that unlimited liability might discourage good people from taking up directors' posts. Another is that, in some circumstances, too much information can be as dangerous as too little. For example, if a big investment made by a bank suddenly turns sour, the bank's depositors might panic when they see the red figures. Moreover, say the critics, banks will be more willing to own up to difficulties if they know the information will be kept private. The role of father confessor allows regulators to solve potentially serious problems behind closed doors. In short, the market's ignorance is sometimes bliss.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these arguments is conclusive. If a bank knows that it will have to come clean about its finances every quarter, it is less likely to take a risk that could sink it. Besides, the new regime gives banks a big incentive to build up their financial strength to impress credit-rating agencies. "Banks will be competing for deposits not just on [interest] rates but on ratings," says Mr Brash. As for central banks' ability to keep information under wraps, this has no doubt helped all concerned out of some tight spots; but, as this survey has shown, it may also have led to costly forbearance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is another problem, too. The secrecy of bank examinations encourages the belief that the government is somehow in league with the industry, and is therefore to blame when it allows a bank to fail. This puts pressure on regulators to prop banks up. One reason for New Zealand's change of approach is that the central bank wants to dispel the notion that individual banks carry a public guarantee. Its experiment may not be perfect, but it is worth watching.

<h1>Private ideas for public policy</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>A different insurance policy would produce a very different type of bank</i>

<p>IS THERE a better way of tackling moral hazard and reducing systemic risk than the insure-and-regulate approach to banking? A number of academics and consultants, mostly in America, have envisaged various ways of bringing about a largely unregulated and uninsured banking system, all of which share a common theme: to make explicit the cost of the subsidy that deposit insurance provides and to pass it on to banks and/or their customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most extreme suggestion now being debated is to privatise deposit insurance and bank regulation altogether. This would force banks to pay a market rate for their insurance coverage and encourage insurance firms to stop the banks from taking excessive risks. But there is a snag: the thought of underwriting banks' deposits fills most insurers with horror. They prefer their risks to be predictable, a quality which bank runs by their nature do not possess. And when a run happens, the cost can be steep--so steep that it can bankrupt insurers, leaving governments to pick up the bill. America's experience has confirmed the worst fears. During the thrift crisis, the state authorities in Maryland and Ohio had to step in to help depositors left in limbo by bust quasi-private insurance funds covering the <font size=-1>S&L</font> industry.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might another version of private insurance work? Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, has long championed an intriguing plan under which banks would in effect underwrite one another's risks via a system of "cross-guarantees". Before a bank could set up shop, it would have to persuade a syndicate of guarantors (largely other banks) to underwrite all of its liabilities. If the bank subsequently went bust, the guarantors would cover all liabilities left after its equity had been wiped out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to charging a premium for the guarantee, the guarantors would also draw up a contract with the bank laying down operating guidelines; and they would appoint a specialised supervisor, or "syndicate agent", to enforce it. The result would be a complex web of interlocking contracts binding the industry together. A small government agency would ensure that all guarantors were themselves guaranteed and that their contracts met certain minimum standards (see <a href="images/csu088.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main attraction of this plan is that, by removing deposit insurance, it cures the moral-hazard problem. At the same time, it encourages banks to police one another and gives syndicate agents an incentive to watch them like hawks; an agent responsible for supervising a bank that goes bust is unlikely to get more business. Moreover, banks could tailor their contracts with guarantors to fit their strategy--a big advance on the present system of regulation, which tends to have one set of rules for everybody. Given the resources of big American and European banks, Mr Ely reckons that cross-guarantee systems in both regions would be able to withstand all but the most epic shocks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this sounds fine in theory. But in practice, switching to such a system would be a huge gamble. Some of the plan's critics argue that by connecting banks even more tightly together, it would increase systemic risk. Under the scheme's rules, banks are supposed to pay first and complain later if problems do crop up. But what if they refuse to cover a loss? And if the government was still involved in the system via the cross-guarantee agency, would it not have trouble convincing people that it had abandoned its role as a backstop altogether?
</p><p><b>Narrow-minded</b></b>
<br>According to another school of thought on banking reform, the state safety net should not be abolished altogether but merely shrunk. This would be done by splitting today's risk-loving, accident-prone banks into two disparate halves: a super-safe, government-insured "narrow bank" that sticks to traditional business and invests only in secure assets, and an uninsured institution--call it a "broad bank"--that could range more widely under a much lighter regulatory system. Savers who invested in the broad bank would get a much higher return because it could invest in riskier assets; but they would also lose their shirts if it went bust. Narrow banks could be owned by broad ones (or indeed any other kind of institution), but a series of legal barriers, or "firewalls", would prevent broad banks from dipping into narrow banks' coffers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All banking boffins agree that narrow banks could not get involved in risky activities such as property lending, securities underwriting and derivatives, but they differ on details. For instance, Lowell Bryan of McKinsey, a management consultancy, has proposed a system under which narrow banks (or "core" banks, as he likes to call them) could lend to individuals as well as to small and medium-sized businesses, on the ground that such loans are relatively safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This bothers other narrow-bankers, who consider such illiquid loans too risky for an institution intended as a safe haven. Moreover, they say, the point of narrow banking is to isolate and insure only the unique and critical functions that banks perform. Lending does not qualify because many other kinds of institutions, such as insurers and credit-card companies, also make loans. So what does fit the bill? James Pierce, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, has suggested that "monetary service companies"--his label for narrow banks--should provide only basic payments services and accept deposits, and that their investments should be limited to highly liquid assets, such as Treasury bills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such narrowness appears to offer a neat solution to several of the problems identified earlier in this survey. It reduces systemic risk in the payments system by allowing only highly liquid banks access to it (others must channel payments through these banks). It tackles moral hazard by limiting deposit-insurance coverage. And it lightens the regulatory load on broad banks, making it easier for them to compete with loosely regulated non-bank rivals. A national commission looking into the effects of the thrifts crisis in America in 1993 was so impressed that it included narrow banking as one of its recommendations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics, however, point out that the system has costs as well as benefits. One is that it prevents broad banks getting information about depositors that would help guide their lending decisions. Another is that even a narrow bank will not be entirely safe because other institutions using it to make payments could run up daylight overdrafts and then go bust before settling them. To tackle the first problem, Frederick Carns, an economist at the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>, has suggested that rather than splitting banks in two, they should instead be allowed to offer savers a choice between "insured" and "uninsured" accounts. The second objection could be met by introducing real-time gross settlement for payments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more serious criticism of narrow banking is that, in certain circumstances, it could lead to more runs on banks. In good times, everyone would want to invest in broad banks; but during bad ones, cash would flood into safe narrow banks, perhaps forcing broad ones to call in some of their loans. Of course, money-laden narrow banks could help channel money back to solvent broad banks by buying their securities. But this might not be enough, and if governments then bailed out some broad banks to avoid a credit crunch, this would undermine the whole point of narrow banking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To avoid this problem, some economists have turned to another banking model, originally thought up in the 1930s by a group of Chicago economists as an alternative to deposit insurance. Instead of breaking banks up, this would force them to back any deposits they hold with an equivalent amount of Treasury bills and other safe assets. In a recent book*, Robert Merton and Zvi Bodie of Harvard University argue that this would not only produce a sound payments system and protect any synergies between deposit-taking and lending, but also force banks to fund their loans by, say, issuing securities rather than relying on deposits. But this approach, too, has its critics, who argue that the banks it would create would be unable to make a profit. Customers, they claim, might even have to pay to deposit their cash with them. The banking system would shrink dramatically.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a crystal ball, it is impossible to say for certain what economic and social impact narrow-banking models would have. However, there are good grounds for thinking that they would create more stable banking systems. Most regulators, however, remain sceptical about narrow banking's practicality. Instead, they are concentrating their efforts on creating common international standards of financial safety. That is easier said than done.

<h1>A standard dose</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Cross-border prescriptions for banking systems can sometimes do more harm than good</i>

<p>AS MEDICAL science progresses in parallel with the appearance of each new disease, so progress on international co-operation in banking is often linked to crises. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, founded in the aftermath of the Herstatt affair in 1974, has gradually developed a global framework for dealing with the industry's problems. Many of its achievements are impressive. But occasionally the rich world's central bankers have allowed politics to get in the way of prudence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The original agreement drawn up in 1975 on supervising international banks, known as the Concordat, has been revised twice since then: in 1983, following the collapse of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano, and again in 1992 following the <font size=-1>BCCI</font> affair. Its minimum standards now require, among other things, that all international banks must be supervised on a consolidated basis (ie, looking at their entire business worldwide) by a capable authority from the country in which they have their head office. At the same time, if other countries in which the bank has branches do not think that the "home-country" supervisor is doing a good job, they can restrict the bank's activities there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;International co-operation has not always gone smoothly. Witness the decision last October by Daiwa Bank's American hosts to make it sell its local operations for failing to inform the Federal Reserve immediately after it found one of the traders in its New York office hiding trading losses of $1.1 billion. The Barings affair, in which a gaggle of regulators in Britain, Japan and Singapore failed to spot what a rogue trader was up to, also showed up gaping holes in the system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But at least the committee provides a forum in which such problems can be tackled. At the same time, it is valiantly trying to harmonise some of the prudential rules that govern countries' banks. Why bother? After all, domestic lenders of last resort should be able to deal with most banking crises except, say, Herstatt risk. The answer is that, in the absence of harmonisation, countries that tried to tighten their rules unilaterally could find that their entire banking industry had decamped to other, more relaxed regimes, making the system as a whole more fragile.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble with the Basle approach is that any deal requires a lot of political horse-trading. Often, the separate aims of ensuring the system's stability and creating a level playing field between banks from different countries are mixed up. Consider the original Basle capital-adequacy agreement that covers banks' credit risk. Its main backers were American and European banks, which saw it as an ideal way to rein in the lending of Japanese rivals they considered undercapitalised. Smaller countries went along with this, fearing that otherwise their banks would find themselves shut out of several of the world's main financial markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The European Union's Capital Adequacy Directive (<font size=-1>CAD</font>), which came into effect in January, is another example of a harmonised rule that puts level playing fields before level-headedness. In a recent paper*, Harald Benink of the University of Limburg and David Llewellyn of Loughborough University argue that the directive is flawed because it applies the same capital standards for market risk--the chance that the price of a security will fall--to banks with securities operations and to ordinary securities firms. Yet securities firms are less risky beasts than banks: they have highly liquid portfolios, unlike banks' illiquid loan books, and are not directly linked to the payments system. By failing to insist on higher capital standards for banks, Messrs Benink and Llewellyn argue, the new European rules may have increased risk in the system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this undermines the case for closer international co-operation among the world's financial regulators, though it does argue for caution in rule-making. One of the most useful things that the Basle committee does is to collate and publish figures on activity in areas such as derivatives. Together with a group of securities regulators, it has also issued joint proposals aimed at improving the quality of the information that banks and securities houses report about their trading activities.
</p><p><b>Three into one</b></b>
<br>Banking watchdogs have also been working with securities and insurance regulators on the risks posed by the growth of financial conglomerates. In Japan, and to a lesser extent in America, rules and regulations restrict the number of hybrids that can combine securities, banking and insurance (or indeed any two of these) under one corporate roof. But in Europe they are all the rage. In two of the most notable deals concluded last year, Barings was bought by <font size=-1>ING</font> (itself the product of a merger between a Dutch bank and an insurer), and Swiss Bank Corporation gobbled up S.G. Warburg, another British merchant bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany, whose banking groups have fingers in many pies, have largely managed to avoid banking hiccups. This suggests that diversified financial groups are in fact more stable than narrowly focused ones. But a preliminary report published by a joint group of banking, insurance and securities supervisors last July noted that the growth of such conglomerates also makes it harder for outsiders to get an overall view of the risks that they are running. And it pointed out that problems in one part of a group could quickly spread to other areas, as happened at Barings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way of dealing with this blurring of boundaries between different businesses might be to switch from regulation by institution, the most common form now, to regulation by function; in other words, let banking watchdogs supervise the banking operations of all financial firms, insurance regulators the insurance operations and so on. This would ensure a consistent approach to regulation across the industry, but it might cause problems too, because no single body would be able to take an overall view of a group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some academics have even suggested a variation on this theme that would split supervision between two bodies: one responsible for ensuring systemic stability across the financial industry, and another responsible for consumer-protection issues. Such novel schemes would probably be better than the status quo, but they would not be foolproof. Besides, fiddling with the regulatory system will do nothing to tackle the underlying cause of financial instability: governments themselves.

<h1>Extinguishing banking's fires</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Bad banks are usually the product of bad macroeconomic policy</i>


<p>EVEN Adam Smith fretted about systemic risk in banking. In his book, "The Wealth of Nations", he drew an analogy between the need of governments to violate the natural liberty of bankers by regulating them, and the need to make neighbours build party walls to stop fire from spreading through a community. Fortunately, since the Great Depression, the legal and other firewalls installed by governments throughout the world's banking systems have stopped all kinds of potential catastrophes from spreading. Somehow, though, that is less reassuring than it should be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a moment, put aside the methods used to tackle these financial conflagrations, and the side-effects that they have. The real point is this: whereas governments have managed to prevent systemic banking crises, they have singularly failed to tackle their underlying cause. This is not because of short-sightedness among bankers, but rather because of myopia among countries' economic policy-makers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This judgment may seem harsh. After all, there have been plenty of occasions--for example, after the 1987 stockmarket crash and during the recent property bust--when swift government action to pump liquidity into the financial system or to lower interest rates has helped to defuse a potential crisis. But in these and many other cases, governments have simply cleared up financial messes that were to a large extent of their own making. Much of the blame for this lies with the volatile monetary policies that caused the boom-and-bust cycles. It is no coincidence that the worst banking crises in recent years occurred in countries where interest rates rose sharply in the late 1980s. Nor is it a coincidence that banks in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, both paragons of monetary stability, escaped the traumas of the early 1990s largely unscathed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, almost every financial catastrophe can be traced back to some failure or other of economic policy. There is a simple lesson in that. The greatest single contribution that any government can make to better banking is to create a stable macroeconomic environment in which banks can flourish. That means resisting the temptation to respond to sluggish growth by slashing interest rates and stimulating demand with all manner of tempting tax breaks. And it means ensuring that economies get richer gradually and boringly, rather than in a series of spectacular booms and busts.
</p><p><b>The $64 billion question</b></b>
<br>But do not pin too much hope on these things happening. The governments of rich countries may profess to have learnt the lessons of the most recent banking crisis, but a glance at the financial history books shows they have often made such claims in the past and failed to live up to them. Rather than concentrating on fire prevention, they will continue to reach for the extinguishers every time that banks go up in flames.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a strategy, as this survey has shown, simply stores up more costly problems for the future by aggravating moral hazard. Some economists have argued that even though safety nets may have led to excessive risk-taking and wasteful investments by banks, this is a small price to pay for preventing a systemic crisis. Perhaps. But unless the present system is changed, the cost of the safety net is likely to rise inexorably. For one thing, the wave of mega-mergers that is sweeping the industry--including those between Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank in America and between Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank of Tokyo in Japan--is creating ever bigger banks that in the event of failure would cost more to rescue. Moreover, as banks' traditional franchise is invaded by competitors, they are rapidly moving into ever riskier businesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What can be done to solve the problem of moral hazard? Trying to return banking to its original, heavily regulated state would be a mistake, even if it were possible, which is doubtful because the industry has changed so much. As well as destroying the economic benefits that liberalisation has brought, a <font size=-1>U</font>-turn would reinforce the impression that governments are there to ensure that banks do not go bust. A move to a system of private insurance also seems impractical, although some elements of this could complement government schemes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, what is needed is a mechanism which would make it possible for most, if not all, banks to fail without causing a systemic crisis, and which would inflict heavy penalties on those that are bailed out as a deterrent to others. Making bail-outs unpleasant is relatively easy. Even if central bankers break Bagehot's rules by lending to troubled banks at subsidised rates, they can still ensure that the banks' shareholders are wiped out and that their managers are replaced, no matter what the size of the institution. Even if some banks are too big to fail, none should be considered too big to suffer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Allowing bank failures without inviting systemic crisis is much more difficult. Domestic insured deposits are now only a tiny percentage of the liabilities of some of the world's biggest banks. In exchange for a lighter regulatory regime, some of them might be persuaded to relinquish their attachment to the safety net. But because they would still play a central role in payments systems, governments might feel duty-bound to support them if they got into trouble. Some form of narrow banking could resolve this dilemma by separating payments from the rest of a bank's activities. But it might take several more banking crises to convince governments that this is worth trying.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the meantime, they will continue to muddle along with the present insure-and-regulate system. This can certainly be improved by, among other things, more co-insurance, more disclosure, greater reliance on subordinated debt and a system of prompt corrective action that makes it harder for regulators to support ailing banks for no good reason. But even with all these improvements, the task of monitoring the far-flung activities of global banking giants seems beyond the wit of many supervisors--just as, it seems, it is beyond some of the managers of the banks themselves. The Barings and Daiwa cases hit the headlines, but many similar, though rather less costly, fiascos have been kept under wraps by embarrassed banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One change is afoot, however, that is making it easier to let even big banks fail. As more and more countries' payments systems move towards real-time gross settlement, the chances of one collapse causing a domino effect is diminishing. With efforts now focused on exorcising the ghost of Bankhaus Herstatt in foreign exchange too, international banking is moving towards what one central banker has called "real-time everything". The vital but unglamorous job of fixing the world's financial plumbing will still take years to complete, but once it is done, many bankers who persist in leaping out of windows before looking will suddenly discover that there is nobody there to catch them.

<H1>The death of distance</H1>

<P>
<I>Thanks to technology and competition in telecoms, </I>
<P>
<I>distance will soon be no object. The effect on people's</I>

<P>
<I>lives will be dramatic, says Frances Cairncross</I><HR>

<P>
ON MOTHERS' Day this year <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>,
America's second-largest long-distance telephone company, offered
many of its domestic customers free calls. Struck by an annual
outbreak of filial sentiment, Americans make more long-distance
calls on Mothers' Day than on any other day of the year. Americans
also have almost a quarter of the world's telephone lines, so
Mothers' Day traffic in the United States is probably the heaviest
anywhere in the world. Yet MCI felt it could offer a free service
without overloading its network.
<P>
In time, every day may well be Mothers' Day, everywhere. Relentless
technological change is driving down many of the elements in the
cost of a telephone call. Already, the cost of carrying an additional
call is often so tiny that it might as well be free. More significant,
carrying a call from London to New York costs virtually the same
as carrying it from one house to the next.
<P>
The death of <A HREF="tc1.gif">distance</A> as a determinant of
the cost of communications will probably be the single most important
economic force shaping society in the first half of the next century.
It will alter, in ways that are only dimly imaginable, decisions
about where people live and work; concepts of national borders;
patterns of international trade. Its effects will be as pervasive
as those of the discovery of electricity. Who could have foreseen,
in Michael Faraday's time, that electricity would eventually release
women to go out to work, transforming the shape of the family,
or allow the development of cities such as Manhattan and Hong
Kong, whose skyscrapers could never have been built without the
lift?
<P>
The discovery of electricity created new industries, but it killed
some too. The change in the cost structure of telecommunications
will do the same. For the moment, telecoms is a business on the
crest of a wave. (See <A HREF="tcch2.gif">chart</A>) Profitability
has climbed almost without interruption for a decade, and is still
accelerating. In 1994 the ten largest telecoms giants made bigger
profits than the 25 largest commercial banks (see <A HREF="tcch11.gif">chart</A>).
Demand is soaring: over 38m new subscribers were connected to
the fixed network in 1994, more than twice as many newcomers as
in 1986. Another 19m joined a mobile network in 1994 alone. Yet
costs have tended to fall faster than prices, which is why the
industry has been so profitable. Now those fat profits are coming
under attack from an ever-growing band of competitors.
<P>
There was a time when telecoms seemed to be a natural monopoly.
Most governments liked it that way because they owned the monopoly
and siphoned off some of the profits. Even now, most homes are
served by only one wire, so customers cannot switch telephone
services in the way they can change their hairdresser or their
lawyer. But as new technologies reduce the costs of entry, competition
is spreading. Enthusiastically in some countries and gingerly
in most, governments have begun to accept that competition offers
the best way to ensure that changing technology is fully translated
into lower tariffs.
<P>
In each of the world's three big markets, reforms are in train
to foster competition. In the United States, if the <A HREF="http://www.bell.com/">telecommunications proposals</A>
that passed Congress in August become law, the long- distance
carriers, the regional Bell companies and the cable-television
operators will be able to compete freely in each other's markets.
In Japan, the government is wondering how to reduce <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>'s
iron grip on the local network. In Europe, the <A HREF="http://www.cec.lu/Welcome.html">commission </A>in
Brussels is determined to create a single market in telecommunications
services.
<P>
The benefits to an economy of even a little competition are tremendous.
A recent study by the <A HREF="http://www.oecd.org/">OECD</A>
(``Telecommunications Infrastructure: The Benefits of Competition'')
concluded that liberalisation not only reduced prices, but expanded
the market and improved customer choice. This is true not just
in developed countries but in developing ones too. In the Philippines,
for example, the government's decision in 1993 to allow new entrants
to provide local telephone services on a large scale persuaded
PLDT, the country's main operator, to make a serious effort to
cut waiting lists.
<P>
The case for competition is dawning even on China. A new telecoms
operator, United Telecommunications Co (Unicom), was set up in
1994 by the ministries of electronics, railways and power, the
industries from which many competitors have emerged in the rich
world. Using the railway ministry's routes as a backbone, Unicom
is constructing a fibre-optic network, starting with 15,000-20,000
subscribers in each of four large cities.
<H3>Changing shape</H3>

<P>
Competition has already begun to transform some of the companies
gathering in Geneva for next week's <A HREF="http://www.itu.ch/TELECOM/">Telecom 95</A>,
a giant jamboree for the industry. A dramatic instance came on
September 20th, when <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>
announced it was splitting into three. Where competition is toughest,
telecoms giants are slimming their enormous workforces and trying
to add value to their basic services. AT&amp;T itself has built
a popular credit card on its brand name and billing skills. Hongkong
Telecom and <A HREF="http://www.bell-atl.com/">Bell Atlantic</A>,
among others, are exploring ways to provide interactive entertainment.
Several giants, including <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>, are building alliances
to provide sophisticated telephone packages for international
business customers.
<P>
Their competitors are more diverse still. They now include not
just other telecoms companies but also cable-television operators,
software manufacturers, banks, water companies, railways and many
more, all nibbling at the $500 billion market for global telecommunications.
They are bringing new skills and new approaches, helping to transform
telecommunications from an industry that builds and maintains
networks into one that offers communications as an incidental
part of a host of other services. In particular, telecommunications
will vastly extend, and in its turn be extended by, the reach
of the computer as the two technologies increasingly converge.
<P>
The direction of these changes is fairly clear, but their speed
is uncertain. This survey will argue that the pace will be set
not just by technology but by the interplay of regulation and
competition. Governments can delay the revolution; they cannot
prevent it. If they try, they will merely fail more spectacularly
later. <HR>

<H1>All change</H1>

<P>
<I>From dearth to glut</I><HR>

<P>
THE technological changes that have swept across the telecommunications
industry have two distinct effects. One is to create glut instead
of the capacity shortages of the past. The other is to reduce
barriers to entry and make possible new sorts of competition.
Together, they will transform the industry -- although the pace
at which they take effect will be partly set by regulation.
<P>
The increase in capacity is essentially due to two changes. The
first is the increasing use of fibre-optic cables. These now cost
much the same as copper wire to lay down and much less to maintain,
but carry vastly more traffic. A single fibre thinner than a hair
can carry 30,000 simultaneous telephone conversations. Second,
switches -- telephone exchanges -- have moved on from eavesdropping
operators and clunky electro-mechanical devices to become increasingly
like computers, their costs falling and their capability expanding
inexorably. New cable has been laid most lavishly across the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans and on routes between cities in the United
States. Gluts are already appearing: more than one-third of the
capacity under the Atlantic is unused (see <A HREF="tcch3.gif">chart</A>).
The growth in capacity will continue as competitors lay cables
of their own. The most ambitious such project, the Fibre-optic
Link Around the Globe (FLAG), is run by a consortium in which
Nynex, one of America's regional Bell companies, has the largest
stake at 40%; but most of its partners are from outside the industry.
<P>
Technological change will also allow huge reductions in the running
costs of the network. ''Maintenance accounts for a quarter of
the costs of running a network, and the maintenance costs of a
fibre-optic network are around one-fifth those of a wired network.
Sending guys out in trucks is expensive,'' says Jeffrey Camp,
a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, explaining the pressure
on <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT </A>to replace copper with
fibre. Clever switching installed in the basements of business
premises allows telephone companies to press a button rather than
send a workman.
<P>
The implications of these changes are enormous. Unlike the computer
industry, which thanks to a similar increase in power and memory
has been able to offer customers more sophisticated devices at
the same price, the telecoms industry will have to offer the same
product at a small fraction of its former price. Operators everywhere
are struggling to find ways to add value to the basic telephone
call, but prices are likely to fall more quickly than premium
products can be marketed.
<H3>Loopy</H3>

<P>
Up to now, the main impact of technological change has been on
long-distance calls. In the United States, where four nationwide
fibre networks have been built in a decade, long-distance revenue
per minute has halved during that period. Now other technologies
are cutting the cost of the ``local loop'' -- the connection between
the nearest exchange and the subscriber's home. This connection
is usually made with a twisted pair of copper wires, a technology
unchanged for almost 120 years. As a rule of thumb, local distribution
accounts for 80% of a network's costs. <A HREF="http://khht.com/huber/home.html">Peter Huber</A>,
a telecoms specialist based in Washington, DC, reckons that it
costs around $1,200-2,000 to connect a new customer with copper.
<P>
Two less expensive and more flexible alternatives to copper have
now become available. One is to run telephone services over the
same system as cable television. A breakthrough in laser design
in the late 1980s made it possible to send analogue television
pictures along optical fibres. Since then cable systems, like
telephone systems, have increasingly acquired backbones of optical
fibre. Adding telephony to an existing cable system usually costs
much less than extending the copper-wire network.
<P>
The trouble is that a cable-television system, like a telephone
network, involves high fixed costs and passes homes that do not
want it, as well as homes that do; so building one from scratch
(as in Britain) is expensive. These problems are avoided by the
other technological breakthrough: the use of wireless transmission.
Its extraordinary flexibility and low cost will allow the development
of a new kind of network -- or networks -- competing directly
with fixed wires. ''Wireless is the answer to the local monopoly,''
says Robert Pepper, head of the office of plans and policy at
the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</A>
(FCC) in the United States.
<P>
``If local telcos were to rebuild from scratch today, they would
do so mostly with radio, at a cost of about $800 per subscriber,''
say Peter Huber, Michael Kellogg and John Thorne in ''<A HREF="http://khht.com/huber/geo2/geo2.html">The Geodesic Network II</A>'',
a 1993 review of competition in the industry in the United States.
Mobile telephones will increasingly compete head-on with fixed
systems. But the most important innovation is likely to be a digital
wireless link to a small fixed radio antenna in the home, which
can make extraordinarily efficient use of the radio spectrum:
unlike a mobile phone, the antenna is always tuned precisely to
the correct base station.
<P>
Such systems of wireless local access are now being developed
by several companies including Hughes in the United States and
Ionica in Britain, but are not yet in commercial use in OECD countries.
Nevertheless, calculations by <A HREF="http://www.analysys.co.uk">Analysys</A>,
a British consultancy, bear out the enthusiasm of Mr Huber and
his colleagues for fixed wireless access as potentially the least
expensive way to make the final link to the home.
<P>
If cable companies can supply bandwidth -- the capacity to send
lots of information -- and if wireless telephony will do almost
everything else that wire connections can do more cheaply, what
will that do to the established telephone operators? ''Technological
change always presents a problem for the owners of the old technology,''
says Philip Sirlin of <A HREF="http://www.hydra.com/wertheim/">Wertheim Schroder</A>,
analysts in New York. ''Capital intensity worsens the problem,
and the telephone industry is certainly capital intensive.'' The
big operators still have immense advantages. But are they now
doomed to be the railway magnates of the 21st century, saddled
with vast fixed costs for a network of dwindling value? Certainly
they will have to restructure their tariffs. Once costs are no
longer distance-sensitive, a premium becomes harder to maintain.
In Sweden, it costs the same to call from Malmo to Kiruna, 1,400km
(870 miles) away, as to Helsingborg, some 80km away. ''When you
tell people,'' says Martin Bangemann, an EU commissioner who has
been pushing for reform, ''they think it is a fairy tale.''
<P>
But why end the fairy tale at that point? When many parts of the
network are no longer constrained by capacity, why charge subscribers
by the number of seconds they spend on the telephone? Why not
simply charge them a regular fee based on the speed and capacity
of their line, and something extra for any fancy services they
buy? The pressure for such a change will grow as charges decline
and billing becomes an increasing burden.
<P>
That pressure is being reinforced by the growth of the Internet,
most of whose users pay a flat-rate subscription to cover un-limited
use, plus the cost of a local call to get connected. As more and
more people communicate by Internet across continents for next
to nothing, they will ask why telephone calls should be different.
<P>
Their question is now being answered by a New Jersey company,
<A HREF="http://www.vocaltec.com">VocalTec</A>, which is offering
the software to enable telephone calls to be made over the Internet.
Early versions of the software required both parties to have a
computer and to speak in turns, as with citizens' band radio,
but this has changed with the launch of ''one-end-only'' software
and the technology to allow ordinary two-way conversations. As
Bill Gates, chairman of <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>,
said recently: ''I'm not sure what the Internet is good for commercially,
but I don't know why you would want to be in the long-distance
market with that thing out there.''
<P>
If the Internet were to become a serious rival to long-distance
telephony, the increase in traffic would require a vast amount
of additional investment -- which probably only the existing telecoms
operators could provide. But even with a tiny share of traffic,
the Internet's impact on prices may be large. That presents the
operators with a problem.
<P>
Until now, tariffs have been based on a cat's cradle of cross-subsidies.
Although a high and rising share of the costs of a network are
fixed, charges in most countries are still based mainly on us.
(See <A HREF="tcch4.gif">chart</A>) Moreover, the price of local
calls is widely subsidised from long-distance and international
calls, where tariffs have long been kept deliberately high. In
many countries local calls are free or extremely cheap. Everywhere,
too, domestic telephone users are subsidised and businesses overcharged.
<P>
Such cross-subsidies from business to domestic users -- and presumably
voters -- have suited governments down to the ground, putting
a lid on political enthusiasm for deregulation. Once competition
hits the more profitable markets, cross- subsidy becomes untenable.

<H1>The end of monopoly</H1>

<P>
<I>Farewell to those fat margins</I><HR>

<P>
FOR years, telecommunications was considered a natural monopoly.
Just in case it was not, governments almost everywhere hedged
it about with regulations to discourage competition. Gradually,
and more quickly in some countries than others, competition has
been allowed to creep in. To flourish, it needs not just the acquiescence
of governments but their willing support.
<P>
New entrants come from three directions. Some have built networks
of their own. Others have found ingenious ways to use infrastructure
leased from other businesses. And some are using new kinds of
infrastructure, mainly cable-television systems and the wireless
spectrum. The effect everywhere is the same: to drive down prices
and expand the range of services.
<P>
Long-distance rates and business customers -- the two areas where
tariffs were most out of line with costs -- have felt the effect
of competition first. Large business customers often begin by
putting together their own internal networks, to link office telephones
and personal computers. The <A HREF="http://www.cec.lu/en/comm.html">European Commission</A>
reckons that there are now around 700,000 private networks in
the United States, but only 14,000 in the less competitive European
Union. The proliferation of personal computers encourages companies
to link them into networks which can cover anything from a single
office to the whole world. Examples of global networks include
those used by the banking and airline industries, or the Internet,
the largest of them all.
<P>
These networks may be purpose-built, or they may run on leased
lines (of which some 20m are now in use). Once such networks are
constructed, spare capacity on them can be resold to other businesses
and operators, local legislation permitting. For example SITA
(Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale de T&eacute;l&eacute;communications
A&eacute;ronautiques), the airline industry's immense global network,
has plans to offer voice services to multinationals.
<P>
Many other businesses have suddenly noticed either that they have
rights of way along which they can easily run fibre-optic cables,
or that they already have networks for their internal communications.
For example, a group of European railways has set up an organisation
called Hermes to carry telephone traffic across Europe's many
international borders; in France, G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux
expects telecommunications to provide 10% of its turnover by the
end of the century; and in Japan a group of regional electricity
utilities is building a network. <A HREF="http://www.mfsdatanet.com/mfs/mfs1.html">MFS</A>,
an American company, has built 46 fibre-optics networks in the
business districts of many big cities around the world, most recently
in Frankfurt and Paris.
<P>
The market is still patchy. Marc Destr&eacute;e, in charge of
international development for MFS, complains about the cost of
buying long-distance capacity in Europe: roughly ten times what
his company pays in the United States. But the important thing
about the market is that lines are usually charged at a fixed
fee, not priced by the amount they are used. That creates an opportunity
for arbitrage against the tariff structure of the big operators.
<P>
Everywhere, but especially in Europe, the big operators have fought
a furious rearguard action to prevent space on the networks being
resold, or to confine resale to closed-user groups such as the
branches of a hotel chain or a bank. But as the market develops,
they have as much interest as anyone in selling their spare capacity.
In the United States in particular, this wholesale market is huge,
with long-distance carriers such as <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
selling large amounts of spare capacity to specialist companies
which have sprung up to take advantage of the pricing constraints
imposed on the big companies.
<P>
As restrictions are loosened, these resellers will enter the domestic
market too. With freedom to price on the basis of plenty rather
than shortage, they will undercut the dominant players. There
will be many more companies such as the bizarrely named 10297,
which advertises itself in the United States as a long-distance
wholesale club. It buys capacity in bulk from <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>,
MCI and <A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A> and retails
it to individuals, who need only dial the five digits that make
up the company's name before calling any number to get price discounts
of up to 50%. Such ''systems integrators'', as <A HREF="http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/citi/staff.html">Eli Noam</A>
of the <A HREF="http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/citi/index.html">Columbia Institute of Tele-Information</A>
calls them, will proliferate, using their bargaining power to
bring individuals benefits hitherto available only to companies,
but not actually running the facilities themselves.
<P>
Foreign gold. Even before that, the market in spare capacity will
have a dramatic impact on international tariffs. International
calls produce only 12-15% of the revenues of the big operators,
says the <A HREF="http://www.itu.ch/">International Telecommunication Union </A>(ITU),
but generate 30- 40% of profits (see <A HREF="tcch10.gif">chart</A>).
Margins are high everywhere, but especially in continental Europe.
The share of operators in high-cost markets has come under increasing
pressure from the use of calling cards, which allow callers to
charge calls at lower rates, and from the call-back market.
<P>
Call-back services have been so effective in keeping a lid on
international rates that some countries, including China and Singapore,
are trying to ban them. A caller in a high-cost country, say Germany,
telephones a number in a low-cost country, usually the United
States. A computer identifies the caller without answering the
telephone, rings back and connects the subscriber to a third country,
say France. ''All over the world,'' says Howard Jonas, head of
IDT, a New York call-back company which he says is the world's
largest, ''countries 500 miles apart have rates double or triple
or quadruple the cost of calls from the United States. Rates are
not so much distance-sensitive as politically sensitive.'' Used
mainly by small and medium-sized companies, the call-back market
is not huge -- perhaps $300m a year, guesses Mr Jonas -- but its
impact on rates is disproportionately large.
<P>
Some governments are now trying to use the spare-capacity market
to break the complex settlements system for splitting the proceeds
of international calls among an oligopoly of big operators. Already,
sales of spare capacity between the gateways at which international
tolls are collected mean that international calls take increasingly
complicated routes, making the settlement process harder to police.
Some governments have turned a blind eye to a bit of bypassing.
But now the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Britain,
Finland and Sweden specifically allow resellers of capacity to
bypass the gateways. This has caused rates between these countries
to be slashed. (See <A HREF="tcch9.gif">chart</A>) For instance,
after Britain's agreement with the United States, <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>'s
transatlantic tariffs promptly dropped by a third.
<P>
As their fattest margins are squeezed, the large operators will
be forced to charge domestic subscribers more realistic prices.
Up to now, the combination of high costs and cross-subsidies has
made local distribution the least attractive part of the system
for would-be competitors. It has also been the part guarded most
fiercely by telephone operators. As a result, fewer than 1m people
worldwide have any choice in the fixed-line telephone they can
have. The remaining 650m or so subscribers have to take what the
local operator offers. But restructuring not only encourages more
rational local pricing; it also makes many governments keener
to see competition in the local loop. That is likely to come from
cable companies and from wireless. <HR>

<I>Bandwidth delivered to your doorstep</I><HR>

<P>
WOULD people rather have bandwidth or <A HREF="tc2.gif">mobility</A>?
The answer will determine which of the two main competitors to
the telecom giants will come out on top. Cable -- provided by
the cable-television operators -- offers the bandwidth; wireless
-- used by the mobile telephone companies -- the mobility. The
global test-bed for cable is Britain, where cable companies have
been offering public telephone services in their own right since
1991, longer than anywhere else.
<P>
The cable-television operators have much in common with telephone
companies. They tend to have a local monopoly; they have a fixed
link with their subscribers; they bill their customers, and they
know quite a lot about their habits. The main difference until
now has been that their system is designed to pump information
in one direction only, while the telephone companies send it two
ways, and can switch it among many different subscribers. Yet
the coaxial cable traditionally used for cable systems provides
much more bandwidth than the telephone network's copper wires.
<P>
Now these differences are starting to matter less. Cable companies
are rebuilding their systems with optical fibre, and their costs
are coming down further as switching capacity gets ever cheaper.
Doug Regan of TeleWest, Britain's biggest cable company, says
that adding telephony increases the capital cost of a cable system
by 20-25%, but boosts revenue per customer by over 50%. Customers
who take the telephone service are also less likely to drop out
than those who take television alone, which means the cable company
saves on disconnecting customers and selling to new ones.
<P>
Mr Regan's arithmetic shows why, wherever they are allowed, cable-television
operators are offering telephone services as well. Not only is
the market much larger, but the double set of revenues makes it
easier to justify the vast cost -- some $10 billion of investment
in Britain, only half of it spent so far -- of digging up the
streets. Britain's cable operators are now investing as much annually
as <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>. In some parts of the country
they are signing up one-third of BT's customers. But not one of
them is yet making an operating profit. Moreover, they now face
a nasty squeeze on their margins. BSkyB, the satellite-television
company that provides most of their programmes, has been pushing
up its charges. At the same time, BT has begun to cut its prices
aggressively. The cable companies have to follow suit: the main
selling point of their telephone service is that it costs 10-15%
less than BT's.
<P>
Is Britain's experience a cautionary tale for cable companies
elsewhere? Not necessarily: Britain has been building a cable
network from scratch. Besides, one of the main attractions of
cable television in the United States -- the quality of transmission
-- counts for nothing in Britain, which has high-quality terrestrial
coverage. And because the cable companies depend heavily for their
programming on BSkyB, which already supplies a well-developed
market for satellite television, the quality of their entertainment
has not been a big selling point.
<P>
In some other countries cable telephony may well be more competitive.
In Hong Kong, for example, where the local monopoly of Hongkong
Telecom expired at the end of June, Alex Arena, the director-general
of telecommunications, licensed three new local telephone carriers.
One of them, New T&amp;T, is owned by the Wharf group, a large
property conglomerate which also owns Wharf Cable. In June 1993
this company won a 12-year licence to provide cable television,
with a guarantee of no competition for the first three years.
Up to now, it has distributed programmes mainly with a microwave
link. The group is now running an optical-fibre loop around Hong
Kong's subway system, a stone's throw from the basements of most
of the island's tower blocks. Servicing tower blocks that house
perhaps 500 families a time clearly costs less than digging up
Britain's suburban streets.
<P>
Competitors offering cable television and telephone together are
springing up in more and more countries. In Japan, two consortia
of Japanese and American companies are amalgamating the fragmented
cable-television companies. One of them is Jupiter, which hopes
to launch a telephone service by the end of 1996. Its president,
Yasushige Nishimura, notes that <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>,
the former state monopoly, charges &#165;72,800 (about $750) for
installing not just the first line but each and every subsequent
one as well. ''If you can offer a second line for free, that is
attractive in a country where grown-up children tend to live with
their parents until they marry,'' he points out. As the company's
capital expenditure per customer connected is less than &#165;72,000,
the economics makes sense -- for the moment.
<P>
By running telephony on the back of existing cable-television
networks, systems operators in several countries can offer telephone
services more cheaply than the established telephone operators.
But to win a big chunk of the market, they will have to offer
something more than price competition.
<P>
In the United States, the move into cable telephony will be led
by a group built around <A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/">Tele-Communications Inc</A>
(TCI), America's biggest systems owner, and two other large cable
operators, Cox Cable and Comcast, which have allied themselves
with <A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A>, the third-largest
long-distance carrier. Their path will be smoothed if this year's
telecommunications bill becomes law: it will then become much
harder for a state to veto cable telephony. With 60% of households
subscribing to cable television, and almost all homes within easy
reach of a systems operator, the cable companies are keen to get
going.
<P>
They still face formidable obstacles. ''The great weakness of
the cable industry is its fragmentation. Every one of the regional
Bells is bigger in its region than all the cable operators in
that region combined,'' admits Brendan Clouston, executive vice-president
of TCI. Moreover, in America ''the cable industry does not have
a great perceived reputation for service. And it has no national
brand.''
<H3>Interactive too</H3>

<P>
Bandwidth is the key advantage the cable companies have over the
telephone operators. It allows them to offer any number of fancy
interactive video services -- and even more once they carry digital
broadcasting. TeleWest's Mr Regan talks of providing 700 channels
once his customers have boxes to decode the digital signals coming
into their homes. That might happen in 1997. Such capacity will
not only offer more television programmes than the most ardent
fan could conceivably want, but allow the interactive use of the
screen, with messages or pictures being sent to and from the home
or office.
<P>
Not many telephone operators can yet rival that. One that may
do so is Hongkong Telecom, where William Lo is exuberantly inventing
new services to offer on the company's state-of-the-art fibre-optic,
digitally switched network. He has already set up a trial based
on 400 households, offering them digital video on demand: by clicking
a mouse, they can order a film, pause or rewind it. In time, they
will be able to shop, bank, draw money from their account by swiping
a smart card through a set-top box and perhaps even gamble: the
Royal Hongkong Jockey Club is one of the partners in the scheme.
Mr Lo plans to have the service commercially available by July
next year. ''If we cannot make this work in Hong Kong, with the
great interest in new products and the low cost of additional
investment, it cannot work anywhere,'' he says.
<P>
How much will customers, or the companies that want to reach them,
pay for such novelties? Enough, maybe, to justify the relatively
small extra investment that existing cable companies have to make;
not enough to reimburse the telephone operators for replacing
their copper wires. So the telephone companies are racing to find
ways of cramming more into their present networks. These include
Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line or <A HREF="http://www.sbexpos.com/sbexpos/associations/adsl/home.html">ADSL</A>,
a technology which allows television pictures to travel along
copper wires. At present this is expensive, and the quality of
the pictures is not as good as the alternatives. Meanwhile, many
telecoms operators are pinning their hopes on <A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~henker/dank.html">ISDN</A>
(Integrated Services Digital Network) as a stopgap to expand the
capacity of copper wires.
<P>
If their stopgaps work, and they can squeeze more bandwidth out
of their elderly networks, what will the telecoms operators do
with it? All are desperate for ways to charge their customers
more than they can for a plain old telephone service. ''Rich people
in Nassau County spend well over $100 a month on magazines and
videos,'' says Ivan Seidenberg, boss of Nynex, the Bell in the
New York region. ''They spend only one-third as much on Nynex
services.''
<P>
To extract more, Nynex and two other Bells have set up their own
television venture; other Bells formed an alliance with <A HREF="http://www.disney.com/">Disney</A>,
in the days before Disney itself owned a television network. <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
bought a 20% stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. All may find
they have wasted their time and money. It is difficult to imagine
America's telephone companies as future media moguls.
<P>
More fruitful may be the attempts by some to become Internet service
providers: the personal computer and the Internet are more likely
to be the model for future interactive services than are fancy
experiments with television sets. Undoubtedly, demands for bandwidth
will increase as more people own computers with modems, and want
to use them to contact each other. The launch of <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>'s
Windows 95, with its built-in capacity for Internet access, will
give a boost to this market. But it will be many years before
on-line services or the Internet make much money. France has the
world's nearest approximation to a mass-market interactive service
with its <A HREF="http://www.minitel.fr/">Minitel</A>, which offers
26,000 services. The most popular, after directory inquiries,
is train timetables. No wonder Minitel has taken ten years to
turn a profit.
<P>
In the contest with the cable companies, the telecoms operators
can point to considerable strengths. Frank Biondi, chief executive
of <A HREF="http://www.mcp.com/general/news5/via.html">Viacom</A>
(which is getting out of operating cable systems to concentrate
on content), points out that the telecoms operators tend to be
bigger and richer than the cable companies. They cover large regions,
whereas the cable companies tend to cover only patches. The telecoms
operators have the cash, the skills and the customer base to develop
new software applications and charge extra for them.
<P>
But they are still vulnerable. Moreover, their grip on the local
loop faces a potent threat from another direction: the wireless
spectrum.<HR>

<P>
<I>Wonderful wireless</I><HR>

<P>
THE advent of mobility is by far the most striking change in telecommunications
in the past decade. It amounts to the introduction of an entirely
new product, with huge new potential. Many people working in telecommunications
assume that mobility poses no threat to the existing networks.
They are almost certainly wrong. But wireless technologies will
also change the economics of fixed networks, providing another
inexpensive way of linking up with customers.
<P>
Worldwide, one new telephone subscriber in six gets a mobile phone
(see <A HREF="tcch6.gif">chart</A>). At the moment, wired and
wireless coexist, often owned by the same big operator. Almost
all the world's 50m cellular subscribers also have a fixed-wire
telephone. But Simon Forge of <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/london-calling/csmg.html">Cambridge Strategic Management Consultants</A>,
author of an influential study of ''near-zero tariff tele-communications'',
argues that mobile telephones may in time do to the public networks
what the railways did to the canals. The canals initially saw
railways as feeder lines, bringing them traffic rather than competition.
The railways, in turn, initially thought the roads would increase
their total traffic. Both were cannibalised. Owning a network
counts for little if others can build a better one.
<P>
Not everybody in the telecoms business is complacent about the
impact of mobility on their business. Sir Iain Vallance, chairman
of <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> (which has a stake in Cellnet,
a mobile service), accepts that most conversations will eventually
shift from fixed to mobile telephones: ''It has already begun
in Scandinavia, driven by all those second homes.''
<P>
In Sweden one person in six has a mobile phone. Indeed, fixed-line
connections are now declining: flighty young people choose to
have a mobile phone when they leave home, rather than pay for
a new fixed-line connection every time they move. Signs of head-on
competition are emerging elsewhere. In parts of Asia, the cost
of a long-distance call between mobile subscribers is well below
the cost using the public network, which has boosted mobile connections.
In Europe, a proposed EU directive allowing mobile operators to
use leased capacity could produce the same result. In most parts
of the world, mobile phones still represent a triumph of hope
over experience. Britain's Consumers' Association claims to have
been inundated with complaints from mobile-phone users, mainly
about the terms of the contracts they had to sign. And quality
of reception is often maddeningly poor. ''Cellular is full of
holes, but consumers buy it anyway,'' says David Goodtree of <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<P>
At present, few countries allow more than one or two mobile operators.
Regulation hamstrings demand. Jerry Hausman, economics professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has compared American
states that regulate prices and terms for cellular telephony and
those that do not. He has found that in the regulating states
prices are about 17% higher and the use of cellular phones lower.
For the state of California, he estimates the overall annual loss
to consumers caused by regulation at about $1.4 billion a year.
``Even imperfect competition'', he concludes, ''usually provides
greater consumer welfare than regulation.''
<P>
Japan, notes Alastair Grieve of <A HREF="http://cwix.com/cwplc/">Cable &amp; Wireless</A>
in Tokyo, had the world's first public cellular service in 1979.
Yet by the start of 1994 it had only 2m subscribers. In April
that year, the rule preventing customers from buying their telephones
was dropped; two more competitors entered the market; differentiated
tariffs were introduced; and prices fell. Within a year the number
of subscribers had doubled.
<P>
Competition will grow as new sorts of wireless telephone evolve.
Eric Gan of Goldman Sachs in Japan envisages a sort of pyramid,
rather like that in the airline industry. At the apex, the Concorde
equivalent will be expensive global satellite systems that will
allow subscribers to cross national borders. The next layer, akin
to club class, will be cellular services, used mainly by businesses.
In the United States, for example, Fortune 1,000 companies account
for only 5% of subscribers but 19% of revenues, estimates Forrester
Research. In time, digital services will lure customers away from
analogue, solving three of the system's most irritating shortcomings:
crackle, lack of security and fraud (but not fade-out). Operators
will also be able to cram more services into the same spectrum.
<H3>Enter economy class</H3>

<P>
''What you are missing in the mobile-telecoms market is the equivalent
of the airlines' economy class, where they make 70% of their money,''
says Mr Gan. That is now about to arrive. In the United States,
the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC</A>, in a move of great importance,
is auctioning an immense amount of radio spectrum: ''Vastly more'',
says <A HREF="http://khht.com/huber/home.html">Peter Huber</A>,
''than is currently allocated to local television stations. And
the transition to digital will eventually expand its carrying
capacity between tenfold and a hundredfold.''
<P>
The aim is to encourage the growth of <A HREF="http://www.wiltel.com/perspect/93fa12.html">Personal Communications Services</A>
(PCS), a new generation of wireless telephones that will be combined
in all sorts of flexible ways with cordless and fixed-wire telephones.
Other countries are following suit: in Hong Kong, for example,
up to six new PCS licences are being made available (but not auctioned).
<P>
In Japan, a promising economy class is already up and flying.
The ''personal handiphone system'' (PHS) was launched in July
by two operators, an affiliate of <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>
and DDI Personal Pocketphone. A third service, Astel, will be
launched next month. Using small, low-powered base stations sited
close together in large cities, it offers a telephone about the
size of a powder compact. The best-selling model has 400 hours
of battery life on standby, and five hours of talking time. Its
airtime charges are only a fifth of those of cellular systems,
and local calls cost less than calls from payphones. They are
priced to compete with pagers and aimed at a new market: teenagers
and housewives. Sachio Senmoto, DDI's ebullient co-founder, remarks
modestly: ''As it costs &#165;72,800 to get a phone installed
by NTT and only &#165;7,200 to join the PHS, a student might prefer
our system.''
<P>
Inevitably there are snags. The monthly subscription, at &#165;2,700,
is higher than NTT's &#165;1,900. And the PHS cannot be used in
fast-moving cars. That should not stunt its popularity in the
dense cities of Asia, where Japan hopes to promote it, but it
will be a handicap in countries such as the United States, where
car use is high and density low.
<P>
But the handyphone has one enormous advantage that may catapult
it to the top in Asia. Unlike conventional cellular telephones,
which use lots of their bandwidth to switch quickly among base
stations, its many base stations mean it uses bandwidth extremely
economically. (Britain's Rabbit, a sort of early PHS, failed because
it had too few stations and could not receive incoming calls.)
The PHS will have enough bandwidth to transmit moving pictures
as well as sound. By 1997 users should be able to use it to download
games software. Fitted into a personal stereo, it will allow parents
to contact <A HREF="tc7.gif">roaming</A> teenagers. Attached to
a notebook computer, it will allow the transmission of slow-moving
pictures or digital fax. Small wonder Mr Senmoto describes his
little device as ''wireless multimedia'', and boasts that DDI
will one day be larger than NTT.
<P>
At the very bottom of the pyramid, the pager offers the equivalent
of the airlines' charter class. Although it may one day be driven
out of business by Mr Senmoto's gadget, for the moment it is flourishing.
Hong Kong's 6m people carry more than 1m pagers, provided by 37
companies. Anybody who wants a vision of the mobile-telephone
market of the future will find it here. Companies enter and leave
the business all the time, endlessly innovating, chasing different
markets. Ask Peter Tsang, managing director of New World Telephone,
one of the three new local-service licensees, how he expects to
make money in a city where a residential telephone line costs
HK$62 ($8) a month and local calls are free, and he points to
the pager market. ''It's because services are so cheap that we
expect to make money,'' he says. ''People want more value, and
don't mind paying.''
<P>
Mr Tsang helped to set up New World Paging in 1990, even though
700,000 people already had pagers. He offered Asia's first secretarial
paging service. Calls to the colony's myriad owners of small businesses
can be routed to a communal switchboard which tells callers that
Mr Chan will call them back. Mr Chan, bleeped by his pager on
a street corner, can pretend that he has been summoned from a
meeting to return the call.
<P>
If wireless is a potentially devastating competitor for the telephone
companies, it could also be their saviour. They, too, can use
it, to connect subscribers to the network much more cheaply than
with copper. As that realisation has dawned, television stations
have become hot properties in the United States, valued not for
their viewers but for their spectrum allocation (see <A HREF="tcch5.gif">chart</A>).
<P>
Two of America's long-distance carriers are using wireless to
build direct links with their customers. In 1994 <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>
spent $11.5 billion to buy McCaw Cellular, which made it America's
largest mobile operator. It spent a further $1.7 billion at the
FCC's spectrum auctions. Some observers, such as MIT's Professor
Hausman, wonder whether it will eventually team up with <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@qu81DJBMQQEAQNgy/pathfinder/welcome.html">Time Warner</A>
too. Meanwhile, It is following the same strategy abroad, buying
stakes in wireless operators in a number of countries, often in
exchange for equipment it manufactures.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A> and its three cable
partners invested $2.1 billion in the March auction for wireless
spectrum, making the consortium the biggest successful bidder.
It now has enough coverage to provide a national digital service
on a single-frequency band. It will also be able to use wireless
to connect customers who do not have cable television.
<P>
Increasingly, what the vast majority of customers will want most
from their telephone will be portability. They will be able to
get a single device, containing what would now be two or three
different sorts of telephone (say satellite, cellular and PHS),
capable of switching automatically among systems and allowing
a subscriber to be reached at any time on a single number.
<P>
Mobility will create all sorts of new gadgets and applications.
Already, says Forrester's Mr Goodtree, a Ford car contains some
50 tiny computers: link them to a mobile phone, and they could
be used to tune an engine or do spot maintenance, in effect servicing
the car by phone. Other car-borne telephones, linked with global
positioning devices, are being developed by Germany's Mannesmann
to direct a driver to a less congested route, track stolen cars
-- or, perhaps, charge a motorist for driving down certain streets.
<P>
For the big telephone operators, the development of wireless represents
an opportunity. But it forces them to confront a harsh reality.
Their most valuable assets are not their copper wires, but their
customers, their billing ability and their brand names. There
is nothing much that a fixed network can do that wireless will
not, quite soon, do as well and more cheaply. An established,
capital-intensive business with high costs and an entrenched culture
will find it hard to make the most of a rival technology. It was
neither the 18th-century canal magnates nor the Victorian railway
bosses who built this century's successful trucking companies.

<H1>Dealing with dominance</H1>

<P>
<I>Can't just be left to the market</I><HR>

<P>
COMPETITION in telecommunications may appear to be thriving wherever
governments have allowed it. But it is an odd sort of competition.
A new <A HREF="tc4.gif">entrant</A> must be able to connect to
the existing network. A telephone is useful only because it connects
to other telephones, and the larger the network, the more useful
it is. Yet the network is owned by the very operator with whom
the new entrant plans to compete. It is as if a supermarket had
to use its competitor's in-house distribution system. So the key
to opening markets lies in the terms on which a new entrant has
access to the existing network. How much (to use the supermarket
analogy) does it pay for distribution? Can it use its own drivers,
and paint its name on the vans? If so, who pays? And how are disputes
settled? By the existing supermarket's board?
<P>
Bizarre as such questions may seem, they are central to telecommunications
policy. The power of the incumbent operator to fight off would-be
rivals is so great that governments have to intervene to restrain
it. As a result, competitors -- whether they be America's <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>,
Britain's Mercury or Japan's IDC -- frequently owe their existence
to government-imposed constraints on their larger rivals.
<P>
Using such asymmetry to kickstart competition is a Faustian bargain.
In Britain, the government has found itself trying to shelter
the cable-television companies -- most of them subsidiaries of
large, mainly American telephone companies -- from possible inroads
into their returns. ''They are building an alternative local telephone
network,'' goes the implicit bargain, ''so we should limit the
risk to their investors.''
<P>
The greatest threat to the investment made by new entrants everywhere
is that their competition will achieve the very goal that governments
hope for: a sharp drop in the tariffs charged by the main operator.
If competition succeeds, a regulator may eventually have to persuade
or compel the incumbent to moderate its price cuts, going against
both its own interest (the pursuit of greater market share) and
that of its customers (cheap calls) for long enough to allow rivals
to get established.
<P>
Without intervention, though, the big operators can be guaranteed
to make life difficult for would- be rivals. They benefit from
a familiar brand and (usually) a protected cash flow to finance
new products. A would-be telecoms company in France grumbles:
''It's hard to compete with a company that uses the France T&eacute;l&eacute;com
name to advertise mobile services.'' Bernd J&uuml;ager, a telecoms
consultant in Bonn who advises potential new players, argues that
<A HREF="http://www.dtag.de/dtag/telekom_.html">Deutsche Telekom</A>
has used revenue from its monopoly services to halve the cost
of services which have been liberalised, such as data transmission.
The result has been to confine competitors to a 10% share of these
markets. Even without such cross-subsidies, DT's brand name, experience
and ownership of a largely depreciated network give it huge power.
''The first winner of liberalisation is always the former monopoly,''
observes Mr J&uuml;ager.
<P>
In most countries, one of the strongest cards in the hand of the
former monopoly is numbering. Customers are often reluctant to
switch to a competing telephone company if it means changing their
telephone number. They may risk losing business. Hong Kong's telecoms
watchdog, Mr Arena, calculated that even discounts of 10-15% were
not enough to compensate. He therefore took over the allocation
of numbers from Hongkong Telecom, the island's erstwhile monopoly,
and insists that customers who change operators should automatically
be given the option of keeping their number. The luckiest numbers
will be auctioned for charity, just as lucky car numbers already
are.
<P>
As ever, regulation in the face of a truly determined dominant
player is not straightforward. Last year Don Cruickshank, Britain's
director-general of telecommunications, removed responsibility
for numbering from <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> and demanded
portability. After much wrangling, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is now adjudicating on who should foot the bill. Mr
Cruickshank believes that ''the true cost is very low.'' BT disagrees.
<H3>Only interconnect</H3>

<P>
Important though numbering is, the fiercest battles have always
been over interconnection, and in particular over the rates charged
for access to the local network -- the hardest part to make money
out of (see <A HREF="tcch8.gif">chart</A>). As almost every call
either starts or finishes on the fixed network, such charges set
a floor to the price competitors can offer.
<P>
That competitors who share the network should pay some part of
its cost seems, on the face of it, entirely fair. But how big
a part? Most of the costs of the network are capital: the electrical
pulses that new entrants send down the wires do not add to the
wear and tear. In most countries, much of that capital has been
stumped up by taxpayers. Even where it has not, there is plenty
of room for argument over how to share the cost. A network owner
who is allowed to recover his costs has little incentive to curb
them. And where the operator is obliged to guarantee universal
service -- affordable access for every citizen to a telephone
-- the debate shifts to a new plane. A monopoly can cover the
extra cost with cross-subsidies. But if there is competition,
the most lucrative customers are picked off and offered price
discounts, leaving no one to foot the bill.
<P>
In the case of universal service, most governments allow the main
network operator to recoup some of the cost from competitors --
who promptly complain that the operator inflates the numbers.
Often with reason: studies suggest the true cost of providing
a basic telephone service for unprofitable customers and areas
is usually tiny. Indeed, some think it is ludicrous to regard
universal service as a burden. ''We say it's a franchise,'' says
Robert Annunziata, chairman of Teleport, a company that plans
to offer a telephone service in New York. He argues that serving
low-income customers could be profitable, and would like to see
a negative auction in which companies would bid to serve a high-
cost area at the lowest subsidy.
<P>
Large operators are not usually keen to help new rivals (or regulators)
by providing them with the basis for their calculations. It was
just such a point that persuaded America's Department of Justice
to order the Bells to be hived off from <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>'s
long- distance operation in 1984. AT&amp;T had been haggling over
the proper price of access to its network ever since 1969, when
Microwave Communication Inc (now MCI) was given permission by
the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</A>
to build a microwave link between Chicago and St Louis and sell
space on it to outsiders.
<P>
But while the split created competition in long- distance traffic,
it left a monopoly in the local network. So the arguments about
interconnection go on. AT&amp;T and its long-distance rivals,
MCI and Sprint, complain constantly about having to pay 40-45%
of the cost of a call over to the Bells. ''Local access is our
largest single cost,'' says Mike Rowny, vice-president responsible
for MCI's strategic planning. That may merely reflect the true
cost of the local loop: but as long as local access is, in effect,
a monopoly, it remains a grievance.
<P>
America's proposed telecommunications bill is, in part, an attempt
to promote competition in the local network. If adopted, it will
remove the regulatory barriers that have kept the long-distance
carriers, the Bells and the cable-television operators from competing
for each other's business. Once the long-distance carriers take
calls directly from customers, perhaps by wireless links, the
argument about interconnection will change: in time, perhaps,
no single carrier will dominate the network.
<P>
In Japan, the three long-distance carriers sound just like Mr
Rowny when they talk about <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>.
They pay some 40% of their revenues to NTT in interconnection
charges. Although Japan has allowed competition in every area
of telephony since 1985, NTT has kept its grip on the local network
mainly by its power to set access charges. The government has
set up a review and aims to decide by next spring whether to split
up NTT.
<P>
At the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Kouji Hamada,
director-general of the telecommunications business department,
admires the American model of deliberately setting a number of
companies at each other's throats. The break-up of AT&amp;T, he
says, has created several world-class companies in place of one.
Splitting NTT into a group of local companies and a long-distance
carrier would allow it to team up with one of the international
companies and compete in the global market, from which (''like
Gulliver'', says Mr Hamada) it is now largely barred. In fact,
the best reason for splitting NTT is rather different. If NTT's
local and long-distance activities were separated, the local company
would almost certainly have to raise its charges to reflect the
real cost of local distribution. Since local calls cost next to
nothing in Japan, that prospect makes politicians quail.
<P>
Splitting the network is one way to bring clarity to the argument
about costs. Jonathan Solomon and Dawson Walker of <A HREF="http://cwix.com/cwplc/">Cable &amp; Wireless</A>
have recently argued for separating the provision of telecommunications
services from the operation of the infrastructure. The network
owner would manage the wires and exchanges, offering access on
the same terms to providers of services of all kinds. At present,
the owner of a local network has every incentive to make it hard
for competitors to use it. But separation would create a powerful
incentive to fill the pipe rather than keep traffic away.
<H3>Better unbundle?</H3>

<P>
In the United States, a few companies are already voluntarily
``unbundling''. Ameritech is planning to split into a network
business unit, levying a non- discriminatory access charge, and
a dozen retail units marketing capacity. In New York state, Rochester
Tel has split itself into a network and a competitive retail arm.
One reason for that, say critics, is that the company wants to
deter others from building rival networks. Another approach has
been used in Stockholm, where the city has set up a company to
build a fibre network which rents capacity to all comers.
<P>
Should <A HREF="tc3.gif">unbundling</A> be imposed by law? The
difficulty with the Solomon-Dawson version, say critics (including,
not surprisingly, BT), is that separating the network from services
is technically difficult. The more intelligence is built into
the network, the harder it is to disentangle the parts, and the
greater the danger that mandatory separation will create new distortions.
<P>
In any case, unbundling alone does not resolve the basic issue:
how should the underlying cost of the network be allocated? ''The
options range from supporting new entrants to protecting the established
monopoly,'' argues <A HREF="http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/citi/staff.html">Professor Noam</A>.
An instance of the first approach would be to adopt an Internet
model, basing access charges not on length of use but on a flat
fee plus some charge for maximum capacity, and letting the company
that sent the calls keep the proceeds. This would work in favour
of new entrants, since they would send far more calls to the main
network than vice versa. But it would leave the question of capital
costs unresolved, as they are for the Internet itself.
<P>
This kind of solution turns the problem of asymmetry on its head.
If the true cost of putting an extra call over a network is almost
zero, will any charging structure allow a network operator to
make a living, especially if he cannot discriminate between customers
by price? With such a model, the regulator's job may one day be
to protect the network, not its users. In most countries, though,
that day is an aeon away.<HR>

<H1>Welcome to the world </H1>

<P>
<I>With ever-cheaper international calls</I><HR>

<P>
TO CALL Penzance from London during the working day costs 9.9p
(15 cents) for a minute; to call Paris or Bonn, a similar distance,
35.5p. The members of the European Union (EU) treat each other,
from a telephonic point of view, as lands sufficiently distant
to justify a premium tariff. The <A HREF="http://www.cec.lu/en/comm.html">European Commission</A>
wants them to behave like the single market they say they are.
Nothing illustrates more clearly the political, as well as the
economic, gains that could flow from making charges insensitive
to distance. Moreover, if the commission triumphs, the whole structure
of international call rates will change.
<P>
At present, international calls are often a monopoly or at least
a cartel. Usually only one operator -- the national giant -- has
the right to hand calls across the international gateway that
separates one country's telephone network from another's. At the
gate, predictably enough, it pockets a charge. This lucrative
custom is backed up by the system of international accounting
rates, which allocates the cost of a call between countries. The
two operators agree on a price for handling the call and split
it, usually down the middle. If one operator puts through more
calls to another than it receives, it hands over a settlement
payment to even things up.
<P>
For some developing countries, such payments are an important
source of hard currency -- more important than foreign aid. They
allow Guyana, for example, to make a tidy living as a base for
<A HREF="tc5.gif">sex-chat</A> lines. But most settlement payments
go to rich, overpriced markets. The system is biased against countries
that send more calls than they get because they have relatively
low tariffs. In countries where prices have fallen fastest, the
rates at which operators are now having to settle are above what
they charge their customers. The system particularly irritates
the United States, which has a deficit of some $4 billion, aggravated
by a lively charge-card and call-back business. ''It is a way
for carriers to extract monopoly profits,'' says Scott Harris,
chief of the international bureau of the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC</A>.
''We want to drive them down to cost.''
<P>
Nowhere do these arcane rules appear more anachronistic than in
the EU. Prodded by the commission, the EU countries have committed
themselves to opening every market for telecoms services -- voice,
mobile and satellite -- at the start of 1998. Except for the poorer
countries of southern Europe, which can delay a bit, every market
should then become even more open than those of Britain, Sweden
and Finland already are.
<P>
In theory. But Europe has set off down this path before, and been
waylaid. On paper, many of these markets were opened by the 1990
telecommunications services directive. In practice, progress has
been patchy. The two EU commissioners steering the latest attempt,
Martin Bangemann and Karel Van Miert, are only too aware of the
gap between agreement and implementation. Mr Van Miert cautiously
argues that ''the mentality in the Community has changed considerably
in the past four to five years.'' But the main reason for the
failure of the 1990 directive, he says, was that the market in
infrastructure was not open: would-be competitors could not acquire
spare capacity to carry their calls. This time he is determined
to avoid that mistake.
<P>
He is therefore threatening to push through a directive that would
allow alternative infrastructure to be used from January 1996
for services that are already liberalised. That essentially means
everything except public voice telephony (which, however, still
constitutes 85-90% of the market). Moreover, mobile operators
can either own or lease the infrastructure they use. Mr Van Miert
is using article 90 of the Treaty of Rome, which does not require
the agreement of the Council of Ministers, but he knows that he
needs to carry member governments with him.
<P>
If Mr Van Miert succeeds, the implications for long-distance tariffs
could be tremendous. All over Europe, companies with distribution
networks in businesses other than telephony have been laying fibre-optic
cables along their routes. At present, they cannot lease out capacity
at will, as they could in the United States or Britain. But once
traffic is allowed to travel across borders along capacity that
does not belong to the established operator, the forces for change
will become irresistible. Mr Van Miert's proposal would mean that,
from the start of 1996, <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> and
its partner Viag, a German utility group, could build their own
network and deliver calls directly to large business customers.
<P>
Even more significant changes could follow once public voice telephony
is liberalised. From the start of 1998, says Andrew Entwistle
of <A HREF="http://www.analysys.co.uk">Analysys</A>, BT will have
an incentive to deliver the international traffic it pipes into
Germany not to <A HREF="http://www.dtag.de/dtag/telekom_.html">Deutsche Telekom</A>,
as it does now, but to Viag -- which would then deliver the calls
to Deutsche Telekom, which would not know whether they came from
Birmingham or Bonn. Until now, Deutsche Telekom with its high
rates has done well out of the international settlement system
because Germany has tended to receive more calls than it makes.
But if BT and Viag were to by-pass the settlements system, DT
would become a large net exporter of calls. The stability of the
settlements system would be threatened.
<H3>Will it happen?</H3>

<P>
At first the telephone companies might hold on to some of the
cash they now hand over in settlements. But as competition on
international and long-distance routes in Europe hotted up, rates
would have to come down with a bump. In continental Europe, these
tariffs are even further out of line with costs than they were
in America when that market was liberalised a decade ago, says
Mr Entwistle. And the floor in Europe would fall faster as all
those fibre- optic cables come on stream, causing a capacity glut
just like that in the United States. It is easy to find sceptics,
especially in the companies that have most to lose. Reform in
Europe always takes longer than expected. The telecoms giants
have considerable opportunities for obstruction, which are being
brutally exploited in Germany. Gerd Tenzer, a board member of
Deutsche Telekom, is adamantly opposed to the liberalisation of
infrastructure in 1996. It would, he complains, pre-empt the decisions
needed to translate the broader liberalisation of 1998 into German
law (which is, of course, precisely why the commission wants it).
The German government plans to privatise DT next year in what
will be the country's largest ever flotation; its officials are
torn between a desire to open the market and anxiety about the
effect.
<P>
Yet the benign impact on European unity of eliminating distance
from Europe's telephone tariffs will surely be greater than anything
else the EU has ever done. If calling from Tipperary to Thessalonika
cost no more than ringing next door, the squabbling Europeans
might at last begin to think of each other as neighbours. Certainly
Europe's businesses would think again about location.
<P>
If Europe liberalises, can the rest of the world be far behind?
In Geneva, a committee chaired by Neil McMillan of Britain's industry
ministry is racing to meet an April 1996 deadline to open global
markets in telecommunications services. Now that the countries
of the European Union, which negotiate as a block, have agreed
to open their markets to each other, they could -- if they wished
-- agree to do the same to the rest of the world. If the Geneva
talks were to succeed, as they may well do, unrestricted competition
on the larger routes would take effect by the end of next year.
That would probably deal a fatal blow to the system of accounting
rates. Countries might move towards one of two systems. One, ``sender
keeps all'', would copy the Internet model. The other, favoured
by the <A HREF="http://www.oecd.org/">OECD</A>, would impose a
single access charge: whether France T&eacute;l&eacute;com took
a call from BT or <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>,
the sender would pay the same.
<P>
Either way, inflated international tariffs and a goodly slice
of telecoms operators' profits would vanish. With so much of their
revenue under threat, what is the future of the old giants?<HR>

<H1>A giant effort </H1>

<P>
<I>To keep on top, it is no longer enough to be big</I><HR>

<P>
AT THE start of the 1980s, the international airline industry
was booming. Ten years later, after privatisation, deregulation
and cut-throat competition, it was in deep trouble. In 1990-92,
it arguably lost more money than it had made in profits in all
of the first 60 years of its history. Only this year have airlines
in the United States begun to creep back into profit. Elsewhere
in the world the shake-out continues.
<P>
Over the coming decade telecoms, an industry now at least twice
as big as the airline industry, faces even greater upheavals.
Airlines have not had to cope with the relentless onrush of technological
change in telecoms that is destroying old barriers between industries.
Liberalisation will attract new entrants lured by huge returns
on capital, especially in Europe. If America's telecommunications
bill becomes law, the competition it will trigger will be just
a foretaste of what lies ahead elsewhere. Companies as diverse
as America's <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>,
Japan's <A HREF="http://www.toshiba.com/">Toshiba </A>and Germany's
RWE all expect a slice of a business now in the hands of a relatively
small number of giant oligopolies or monopolies.
<P>
Such competition will carry considerable risks. ''In a business
with small variable costs and huge overcapacity, a price war would
be nuclear annihilation,'' says <A HREF="http://www.hydra.com/wertheim/">Wertheim Schroder</A>'s
Mr Sirlin. ''Serious price competition in telecommunications would
make the airline business look terrific.''
<P>
Even without an all-out price war, the industry will head in two
different directions at once: fragmentation and consolidation.
The first will follow from the sheer range of activities covered
by the term ''telecommunications''. A host of smallish companies
will flourish, especially in the areas closest to the customer,
trading on their skill in buying commodity transmission capacity
and adding value with ingenious new services.
<P>
For the big established operators, (see <A HREF="tcch7.gif">chart</A>)
life will be rougher. They will have to cut costs, shed thousands
of employees and innovate as never before. To survive, they may
have to bring in fresh blood. ''We have found a direct correlation
between corporate success and managers who don't have phone-company
backgrounds,'' says Robert Morris, director of international equity
research at Goldman Sachs in London. He points to the examples
of Alex Mandl, a former shipping-company boss now at the helm
of <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A> Communications Services,
and Michael Hepher, who came from the life-assurance industry
to <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>. <A HREF="http://www.dtag.de/dtag/telekom_.html">Deutsche Telekom</A>'s
new boss, Ron Sommer, used to work for <A HREF="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</A>
Europe.
<P>
Where an established operator is well run, it will still have
huge advantages. In a business with massive overheads and very
low marginal costs, notes MIT's Professor Hausman, the number
of competitors is likely to be small. The winners will tend to
be vertically integrated and have good access to the customer.
Size will also make it easier to carry the costs of developing
ever more fancy services: not necessarily entertainment or home
shopping, although those will come, but more ingenious ways to
integrate the technology of the telephone into everyday products
and services. ''This is essentially a consumer-services business.
The product is the software that sits on the switch,'' says Mr
Morris. But software development costs AT&amp;T or BT the same
as it costs Mercury or <A HREF="http://www.uswest.com/">US West</A>.
What is different is the size of the customer base over which
the development cost can be spread.
<P>
The incumbent giants have other strengths, such as their billing
skills and their financial muscle. They also have a well-recognised
brand, which AT&amp;T has taken great care to preserve. Victor
Pelson, chairman of the company's global operations team, says
its highly successful credit card was launched because ''we were
concerned that we didn't have a direct link with our customers.
They got their bills from the local exchange company. We found
that a customer with an AT&amp;T card was much more likely to
stay with us as a long-distance carrier.'' According to a review
of prospects for the Bells by <A HREF="http://www.salomon.com/">Salomon Brothers</A>
in New York, two Americans in five still believe that AT&amp;T
is their local phone company.
<P>
The benefits of size will encourage mergers. Ten years from now,
America's 11 large telephone companies -- the successors of the
seven Bells, <A HREF="http://info.gte.com/">GTE</A> and the three
long-distance carriers -- are likely to have taken on a different
shape. Some will have merged with each other; some will have found
new lives in adjacent markets such as television, computer services,
finance and travel. For some other countries, mergers will raise
political problems. Will they be willing to accept part or full
foreign ownership of their national giant, or will they prop it
up in the same way as they have subsidised national airlines?
<H3>Going global</H3>

<P>
The economies of scale and scope in the transmission of information
are such that, by the second quarter of the next century, only
a handful of really big international providers may be left. Most
national operators will shrink and mutate as their peripheral
business is picked off by competitors. The big operators in the
rich world are getting ready to grab a share in the global market
by forming alliances with partners in other countries.
<P>
Global business is still only a tiny teaspoon of most operators'
revenues, but many hope that it will provide tomorrow's jam. As
the operators' business customers become more global, says Ted
Schell, head of corporate development at <A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A>,
''they will want one global provider to integrate services such
as voice mail and electronic mail.'' Several international alliances,
such as AT&amp;T's WorldPartners, hope to win contracts to run
big companies' global telecoms networks.
<P>
Some of these groupings -- such as Unisource, a bunch of operators
in some of Europe's smaller countries -- consist of national networks
tacked loosely together. Some, such as Atlas, an alliance between
France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Deutsche Telekom, and Phoenix,
their joint alliance with America's Sprint, are awaiting approval
from suspicious regulators. Others, such as <A HREF="http://cwix.com/cwplc/">Cable &amp; Wireless</A>'s
minority stake in Germany's Veba, amount to little more than a
memorandum of understanding.
<P>
Can such cross-border alliances really work? One of the more coherent
ones is led by BT, which has chosen second-division players as
allies. It now has a 20% stake in MCI Communications, and marketing
partnerships with Viag in Germany and with a couple of banks in
Italy and Spain. ''We reckoned'', says Sir Iain Vallance, ''that
the joining of any two major players would be fraught with regulatory
difficulty.'' Concentrating on banks and utilities brings access
to large networks, large customer bases and lots of money. It
also allows BT to insist that its partners accept its network
architecture. Even so, some customers claim that BT and <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
quote them different prices for the same services.
<P>
For the time being, rich-country telecoms giants have this business
to themselves. They are also pouring money into the world's fastest-growing
markets -- in the developing world. (See <A HREF="tcch1.gif">chart</A>)
''Half the world's population has never made a phone call,'' says
Richard Klugman of PaineWebber in New York. While operators in
the rich world worry about getting more people to use their systems,
poor countries worry about their immense waiting lists. ''Almost
without exception, there is huge unmet demand, even at the prices
the incumbent monopolies charge,'' says Bj&uuml;orn Wellenius,
telecoms adviser at the World Bank.
<P>
For the rest of this decade, demand will grow fastest in Asia.
Andrew Harrington, director of research at Salomon Brothers in
Hong Kong, expects the region to install 15m-20m new lines annually
for the next half- dozen years: three to four times as many as
are being added in the United States every year. China alone is
now adding the equivalent of a new Bell a year. By 2000 it hopes
to have 140m lines, which would put it not far behind America's
figure of some 160m today.
<P>
The boom in the developing world is a golden opportunity for the
telecoms operators of the rich world -- for the moment. It has
been seized eagerly by those operators whose domestic markets
are most competitive, and therefore most under threat. Thus Nynex
is one of the most active foreign companies in Asia, with stakes
in Thailand and the Philippines, a small joint venture in China
and a bid for a fixed-wire licence in India. <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/">Telstra</A>
of Australia, one of the first foreign companies to invest in
Asia, is active in Vietnam and Cambodia. Among other things, it
has installed payphones in Phnom Penh. <A HREF="http://www.bell-atl.com/">Bell Atlantic</A>,
together with a large Mexican cellular operator, hopes to install
a fixed-wire network in Mexico; <A HREF="http://www.bst.bls.com/">Bell South</A>
has stakes in several Latin American cellular operators; US West
has permission for a build-operate-transfer scheme in southern
India.
<P>
What if, as privatisation and liberalisation progress, the concept
of national operators becomes an anachronism? Odd though it may
seem for one country to provide the telephone service of another,
there are precedents: for example, the service in the Maldives
(as in many other small countries) is run by Cable &amp; Wireless.
If C&amp;W in the Maldives, why not Nynex in Belgium or AT&amp;T
in Britain? And if some global giants emerge from the rich world,
might the developing countries not grow their own? Already China
makes many of the world's telephones. By the late 2020s, might
it not handle many of the calls too?<HR>

<H1>Communicating freely </H1>

<P>
<I>Near-zero tariffs will change the world</I><HR>

<P>
WHAT will it be like to live in a world where it costs hardly
any more to make a phone call to another continent than to the
house next door? Some countries will be well on the way to such
a world before the end of this century. And what will happen when
the cost of communications comes down to next to nothing, as seems
likely some time in the first decade of the next century?
<P>
The <A HREF="tc6.gif">death</A> of distance will mean that any
activity that relies on a screen or a telephone can be carried
out anywhere in the world. Services as diverse as designing an
engine, monitoring a security camera, selling insurance or running
a secretarial paging service will become as easily exportable
as car parts or refrigerators.
<P>
Already, first glimpses of this world are beginning to appear.
India has built a flourishing computer-software industry around
Bangalore. Its exports more than doubled between 1990 and 1993,
to $270m. India is now attracting back-office work from airlines
such as Swissair and British Airways. Some of Hong Kong's paging
services are manned from China. In Perth, in Western Australia,
EMS Control Systems monitors the air-conditioning, lighting, lifts
and security in office blocks in Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Indonesia and Taiwan. <A HREF="http://www.broadcom.ie/telecom/dupjmc/teprofile.html">Telecom Ireland</A>
has been trying to build itself up as the main call-centre for
Europe, handling toll-free 0800 calls from all over the continent.
Last April it launched an intercontinental service to allow companies
to link their European and American call- centres and to take
advantage of the time differences between them.
<P>
All this will expose white-collar workers in rich countries to
the same competitive pressures that have already squeezed manufacturing
workers. But it will also offer educated workers in poor countries
the chance to attain a standard of living that they can now get
only by emigrating.
<P>
Countries that want to take a share of such markets have a huge
incentive to make telecommunications as inexpensive as possible.
That is a lesson few developing countries have yet learnt. Among
the exceptions are some Asian countries such as Malaysia and South
Korea, which are installing state-of-the- art telecommunications
networks and have a relatively high density of telephone lines.
<P>
As prices fall, companies will change the way they do business.
Detlef Linssen, in <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>'s
office in Bonn, remembers that when he first joined from a German
telecoms company, he was amazed to discover that once a month
AT&amp;T held an hour-long telephone conference with 120 participants
from all over the world. ''In Germany, the one that arranges the
call carries the whole cost; in the US, each participant carries
his own share,'' he points out.
<P>
Within countries, work-related travel may decline, and so may
the demand for office buildings, as people increasingly work from
home. Big cities will thus increasingly have to look to a future
as entertainment centres. Regional development policies may at
last become effective when white-collar jobs can be relocated
more easily than manufacturing ones ever could.
<P>
Many services now provided by government will be changed out of
recognition. Welfare and social-insurance payments will increasingly
be made by plastic card rather than by relays of officials. Monitoring
crime will be made easier by remote surveillance, perhaps carried
out by people in a different time zone, and by global positioning
devices to track cars and miscreants.
<P>
Teaching, too, will be less constrained by distance. At present,
Kentucky's National Guardsmen frequently have to be flown to retraining
sessions. Richard Jay Solomon and his colleagues at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology are developing a way to use distance-learning
instead. ''We're going to teach them to kill people in their homes,''
he says jovially, ``but train them in paramedicine first.'' Health
care will benefit in similar ways. In Alaska, more than 100 villages
are linked by a dedicated medical telephone network on which local
health workers can have regular telephone consultations with <A HREF="tc8.gif">doctors</A>
at the regional hospital.
<P>
For the old and the isolated, cheap communications will be a godsend.
If a telephone costs nothing but the initial subscription, why
not keep a line open all day, just as people now leave the television
on all the time? For women racing from job to nursery to home,
accessibility on the move will make life easier. Staying in touch
will acquire a new meaning. Starting next month, customers of
New World in Hong Kong can have their calls switched to wherever
they want them: their mobile telephone, hotel room abroad, voice
mail or computer.
<P>
Inevitably, with all these benefits will come drawbacks. Privacy
and security may suffer as everybody leaves a trail of data and
transactions across the globe. Theft of ideas, films and music
will become ever more difficult to stop. Policing shipments of
information across borders is infinitely harder than policing
shipments of goods and human beings (which is hard enough). That
may be all to the good when the information flow brings useful
knowledge or helps political freedom, but unwelcome when it serves
pornography, sedition or crime. Just as the death of distance
brings far-flung communities closer together, so it undermines
national sovereignty, without a countervailing improvement in
global regulation.
<H3>The unknowable and the predictable</H3>

<P>
Predicting the future of a new technology is a mug's game. Marconi
thought radio would be useful mainly for ship-to-shore calls.
Guessing the social impact of a new technology is even more hazardous.
Who would have foreseen that the invention of the post box would
contribute to women's liberation -- by enabling new generations
of young ladies to post letters to their sweethearts without their
parents' knowledge?
<P>
It is possible, then, only to ask questions. Will everyone acquire,
in time, a telephone number or name for life on which they can
be reached anywhere in the world? How will society regulate the
intrusion of near-free communications? How will national governments,
their power bounded by geography, be affected by a technology
that makes distance irrelevant?
<P>
Big changes driven by technology can happen relatively quickly
in the economy. Social changes lag behind. People will take many
years to come to terms with many of the consequences of near-costless
communications. But as they do, the world will become, on balance,
a better place. <HR>

<H1>The accidental superhighway</H1>

<P>
<I>The explosive growth of the Internet </I>
<P>
<I>is not a fad or a fluke, but the result </I>
<P>
<I>of a digital free market unleashed.</I> 
<P>
<I>Christopher Anderson considers its future.</I><HR>

<P>
FOR the past few years the titans of media and communications
have waged a war for the digital future. With great fanfare, <A HREF="http://www.cablelabs.com/NR/telco_page.html">telephone</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cablelabs.com/NR/cable_tv.html">cable TV companies</A>
have launched dozens of trials to demonstrate their vision of
speedy electronic networks, connecting homes to a boundless trove
of information, communication, education and fun. Shambling towards
their distant goal of a wired world, they have been too busy to
notice the unruly bunch of computer hackers, engineers and students
scurrying about at their feet.
<P>
They should have paid more attention. For while the giants have
just been talking about an information superhighway, the ants
have actually been building one: the Internet. For almost all
of its 25-year life, this loose confederation of interconnected
networks has been the arcane domain of computer scientists and
academics, a private line for electronic conversations that no
one else would understand anyway. It grew, fast, because it was
left to its own devices and filled unmet needs. The Internet's
builders laid no cables and dug no trenches; they simply leased
existing telephone lines. When the Internet linked up with public
and commercial networks in the mid-1980s, its growth accelerated.
Yet most big telephone companies still wrote it off as nothing
more than a playground for bitheads and boffins.
<P>
In mid-1993 something new happened: the Internet sprouted multimedia
wings. A combination of special software and a way of connecting
documents allowed users to travel the network with pictures, sound
and video, simply by pointing and clicking a mouse. Suddenly the
light dawned. The Internet was not just a way to send e-mail and
download the occasional file. It could be a place to visit, full
of people and ideas: <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@AJNd1wAAAAAAAGr1/time/magazine/domestic/1995/special/special.cover.html">``cyberspace''</A>.
It was a new medium, based on broadcasting and publishing but
with another dimension added: interactivity. Internet veterans
had known this for years; they could see the potential behind
the screens of plain text and baffling computer commands. But
thanks to the friendly, multimedia side of the Net, called the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/WWW/">World Wide Web</A>,
a much broader audience started to catch on to it.
<P>
Last year the Internet as a whole doubled in size, as it has done
every year since 1988. It now reaches nearly <A HREF="http://www.catalog.com/zone/WWW/top.html">5m ``host'' computers</A>,
each of which may connect several individual users (see <A HREF="chart1.gif">chart</A>).
At the same time the <A HREF="http://www.netgen.com/infoarea/growth.html">Web grew</A>
almost 20-fold; in just 18 months users created more than 3m multimedia
pages of information, entertainment and advertising. No one knows
how many people are behind this, but an estimate by <A HREF="http://www.tic.com/mids/pressbig.html">John Quarterman</A>,
an Internet analyst, put the number of users at 13.5m in October
1994. Whatever the number is today--20m is not an unreasonable
guess--it will be at least half as big again a year from now.
No communications medium or consumer electronics technology has
ever grown as quickly; not the fax machine, not even the PC. At
this rate, within two years the citizens of cyberspace will outnumber
all but the largest nations.
<P>
What does that mean? This survey will argue that the Internet
revolution has challenged the corporate-titan model of the information
superhighway. The growth of the Net is not a fluke or a fad, but
the consequence of unleashing the power of individual creativity.
If it were an economy, it would be the triumph of the <A HREF="http://opal.cencom.net/~jen/life/ertelt/polrsc.html">free market</A>
over <A HREF="http://ccme-mac4.bsd.uchicago.edu/DSADocs/SocFAQ.html">central planning</A>.
In music, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Music/Jazz_and_Blues/">jazz</A>
over <A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/bach.html">Bach</A>.
<A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~pcllgn/id.html">Democracy</A>
over <A HREF="http://www.pinsight.com/~write/cybrary/Facts.root.nazi.html">dictatorship</A>.
<P>
As a result, the information superhighway will arrive sooner,
but it will be a very different kind of road from the one the
giants intended. Cable and telephone companies will still build
their high-speed networks to people's homes, but what will pour
through them will be the Internet, not just the network providers'
canned content. This will be a grown-up version of the Internet,
made much easier to use. It may even be called something else.
But the basic ingredients of success will be the same: openness
and interactivity, making it a combination of community and marketplace.
<P>
Some people argue that the Internet already is the information
superhighway; it simply looks different from the television-based
version promoted by the cable and telephone companies. Others
say that some important features are still missing: the real superhighway
will combine not just computer networks but all sorts of other
communications links, from telephone to wireless and satellite.
It will be fast where the Internet is slow.
<P>
Yet the Internet already offers, albeit in embryonic form, most
of the services and technologies that cable and telephone companies
are still a decade from delivering. You can make a <A HREF="http://www.vocaltec.com/">telephone call</A>
on the Internet; watch a <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/mbone-faq.html">video</A>;
listen to an <A HREF="http://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/radio/ITRintro.readme.html">audio broadcast</A>,
or broadcast yourself; <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Shopping_Centers/">shop</A>;
learn; and, of course, communicate. Every day the Internet delivers
more of the features of the fabled superhighway. It may be doing
these things clumsily, unreliably and slowly, but it is doing
them, now.
<H3>Electronic potholes</H3>

<P>
Sceptics abound. The Internet, they say, is chaotic, frustrating
and intimidating. Only those lucky enough to be able to afford
a high-speed connection can really enjoy its multimedia side;
for those using a modem, it simply takes too long. Finding what
you want can be maddeningly slow: in an ocean of information,
sense and understanding is often lost in a flood of random facts
and rhetoric. Moreover, you need a computer equipped with some
telecommunications link to use the Internet in the first place,
which excludes most of the world's homes. Even in America, where
a third of all households have a PC, only about half of those
also have a modem connected to a phone line.
<P>
All true, the believers concede, but just wait. Already the Web
is making the Internet easier to use, and hundreds of companies
are developing software to make it easier still. Hundreds more
are developing software and services to make sense of the sea
of data on-line. At the same time the equipment is becoming much
more widespread. Private consumers are expected to buy some 15m
PCs worldwide in 1995: the home is now the fastest-growing market
for such computers. And the cost of high-speed data links is falling.
<P>
This survey will argue that the Internet's fans have a better
case than its foes. The Net will suffer plenty of growing pains,
and it may not change the world as much as the cyber-Utopians
would have us believe: compared with the richness of real life,
even the best on-line ``virtual spaces'' are cartoons. But it
is here to stay, and it will allow people to exercise one of their
most basic desires: to communicate. This they will be able to
do on an unprecedented scale: globally, openly, to one person
or many. In that sense, the Internet will almost certainly have
a stronger impact than the PC alone. PCs put computing power in
the hands of ordinary people; the Internet gives them something
compelling to do with that power (other than play games). How
important this revolution will eventually turn out to be is as
yet impossible to say. A reasonable guess might put it ahead of
the telephone and television but behind the printing press and
the motor car.
<P>
Such a ranking is clearly subjective. But <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/people/marca/index.html">Marc Andreessen</A>,
the main creator of <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A>,
the software program that made the Web easy to use and thus launched
the mainstream Internet revolution, suggests a mathematical reason
why it may be quite near the mark. Computers owe their growth
and impact to a phenomenon dubbed Moore's Law (after Gordon Moore,
the founder of <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</A>), which
says that computing power and capacity double every 18 months.
This exponential growth has led to the digital revolution, and
it has only just begun.
<P>
Networks have their own growth rule. According to Metcalfe's Law
(named after Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of the Ethernet standard
commonly used in PC networks), the ``value'' of a network--defined
as its utility to a population--is roughly proportional to the
number of users squared. An example is the telephone network.
One telephone is useless: whom do you call? Two telephones are
better, but not much. It is only when most of the population has
a telephone that the power of the network reaches its full potential
to change society. The Internet owes its extraordinary growth
and impact to its ability to harness both these laws at the same
time. The world has never seen a technology like this before.
``Data dialtone''--networking as widespread as the telephone--suddenly
seems not only possible, but likely.
<H3>The fish-tank phenomenon</H3>

<P>
This is the sort of brave talk one hears about all sorts of plans
for the information superhighway. The difference is that the Internet
is already there. Today a handful of cable TV and telephone companies
are conducting interactive television trials, giving a few thousand
homes a limited taste of video-on-demand, games, home shopping,
advertising, education and information. Yet if those same homes
have a PC, they can get all this (bar video-on-demand, although
that too may come) and more on the Internet. It is not yet as
fast, but there is infinitely more of it: a whole world of content,
from the glossy digital fa&ccedil;cades of the Fortune 500 to
thousands of ``home pages'' created by people who have assembled
some unique information--or just want to show the world their
<A HREF="http://www2.netscape.com/fishcam/fishcam.html">fish tank</A>.
<P>
Of the two, the fish tank is actually the more profound. In its
audacious uselessness--and that of thousands of ego trips like
it--lie the seeds of the Internet revolution. The Internet allows
everything: anyone can be a publisher, and publish anything he
wants. Set up a home page to show all comers what you are <A HREF="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~milesm/ontv.html">watching on TV</A>
at that moment, and it will stand side-by-side with <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A>,
competing equally for visitors.
<P>
That is why the Internet has exploded past commercial on-line
services such as <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>
and <A HREF="http://webcrawler.com/AOL/">America Online</A> (although
they, too, are growing quickly, in part because they offer Internet
access). Many of its users are not just information consumers,
they are producers as well. For them, the Internet serves as personal
printing press, radio station and billboard, all in one. No commercial
service can ever hope to rival the quantity and quality of the
output of 20m people. True, much of what they produce is rubbish;
but much is astoundingly creative, sometimes even useful.
<P>
This is a lesson the PC revolution should have taught us already.
PCs toppled mainframes and changed the world because they put
power in the hands of individuals, bypassing centralised control.
The same is true of the Internet. Yet a remarkable number of those
who rode the PC revolution to greatness missed the significance
of the Internet. Even <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>
underestimated its impact. The company designed its forthcoming
commercial on-line service, the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/services/msnet/msnintro.htm">Microsoft Network</A>,
around a proprietary network technology. Only last year, when
the Web took off, did Microsoft adopt the Internet standard as
well.
<P>
The big names on the Internet are not <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A>,
IBM or <A HREF="http://www.nec.com/">NEC</A> (at least not yet),
but a motley collection of young companies, university students
and entrepreneurs. <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape Communications</A>,
started in 1994, rules the Internet software market; <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco Systems</A>
(1987) and <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</A>
(1982) sell the most hardware. The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web</A>
was invented by a software engineer at a physics lab in Switzerland,
and the software that popularised it was written by an undergraduate
at the University of Illinois. Almost anything that made a difference
on the Internet was produced by people whom the corporate world
might consider nobodies.
<P>
Equally, it was not the telephone companies that built the Internet,
although it uses their networks. They carry its data for a fee,
just as they carry data from thousands of other sources. The companies
that lease this capacity to bring the Internet to users around
the world (see <A HREF="chart2.gif">map</A>) are mostly newcomers:
<A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">Performance Systems Internationa</A>l,
<A HREF="http://www.netcom.com/">Netcom</A>, <A HREF="http://www.pipeline.com/">Pipeline</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.alter.net/">UUNet</A>, <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/">Demon</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.pipex.net/">Pipex</A>. America alone has more
than 600 of them. Almost all of them are under five years old.
<P>
This is what Tony Rutkowski, executive director of the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</A>,
calls ``bottom-up information infrastructure''. In the late 1970s,
telecoms and computer titans tried to chart the future of communications
for decades to come. They planned to build their own digital highways
and sell videophones, Videotex and other such wonders. It never
happened--consumers were not buying. Instead, the PC arrived,
spawning office networks. Once telecoms competition had lowered
the cost of connecting these networks, the makings of a highway
of a very different kind began to emerge.
<P>
Mr Rutkowski recalls visiting America's <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commissio</A>n
in 1990 and seeing an official excitedly waving two charts. One,
from the FCC, showed the traditional telecoms investment, worth
several billion dollars and growing at the same rate as for the
past few decades. The other, from the <A HREF="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</A>,
showed all network infrastructure investment--including office
PC networks and private long-distance data networks. It had started
at about the same level as the telecoms investment a few years
earlier, but had grown exponentially to double that figure by
the late 1980s. The gap was widening rapidly, representing something
altogether new; something, the FCC official admitted, ``we know
nothing about''.
<P>
It was the foundation for the Internet, even though the true importance
of that development did not become clear for another decade. The
Internet not only challenges the traditional way of building networks;
it is so chaotic, decentralised and unregulated that it also defies
conventional understanding of such networks. <HR>

<H1>Like a flock of birds</H1>

<P>
<I>How the Internet works without really trying</I><HR>

<P>
MOST people imagine that anything as complicated as, say, an economy
or a global computer network must be designed and run by some
central authority. Take the Internet. Those who know little about
it usually reckon it is run by a company to whom you pay a subscription
fee and an hourly charge to use the network. The way it works,
they think--if they think about it at all--is that once you are
in the system, your computer sends requests or messages to a central
data centre. Big computers in this centre send out information
in answer to your requests or pass your messages to other users.
If you want to put some of your own material on to the network,
you approach the company and strike a deal.
<P>
It all sounds perfectly plausible, but it is completely off the
mark. In his book ``Being Digital'' (Alfred Knopf, 1995), Nicholas
Negroponte, the director of MIT's famed <A HREF="http://www.media.mit.edu/">Media Lab</A>,
gives an example of the ``centralised mind-set'' fallacy that
leads to such expectations. We usually assume ``that the frontmost
bird in a V-shaped flock is the one in charge and the others are
playing follow-the-leader. Not so. The orderly formation is the
result of a highly responsive collection of processors behaving
individually and following simple harmonious rules without a conductor.''
<H3>Parcel force </H3>

<P>
This is as good a description of the Internet as any. For collection
of processors, read all the computers and wires that make up the
thousands of smaller networks connected by the Internet; for harmonious
rule, read a method of transferring data called TCP/IP, stemming
from the Internet's <A HREF="history.html">military origins</A>.
The rule says simply that data shall be broken up into chunks
called ``packets'', and that the first part of each packet shall
consist of the address it should go to. That is all. What happens
next is not laid down in any master plan. There is no central
computer; indeed, there is no centre at all. Far from being a
hub with spokes, the Internet is more like a spider's web, with
many ways of getting from point A to point B.
<P>
Physically, it has little substance: most of it is simply leased
space on existing telephone networks, with some dedicated computers
at connection points. <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>,
a consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimates that total
sales of Internet-specific hardware this year will be only $50m;
like a parasite, the Internet uses the multi-billion dollar telephone
networks as its hosts and lets them carry most of the cost. That
makes it largely a ``virtual'' network, running on top of the
physical network of the telephone companies.
<P>
This works because the Internet does not need what telephone companies
consider to be their main assets: the centralised mainframes and
big switches they use to control their network. Instead, the Internet
uses distributed intelligence, taking advantage of the telephone
companies' lines while bypassing their tollgates.
<P>
Imagine you wanted to make a telephone call from New York to Los
Angeles without paying the long-distance charge. If you had the
right kind of telephone and knew enough people across the country,
you might call someone at the western limit of your local zone,
who would call someone at the western edge of their local zone
and patch you through, and so on across the country. This may
be an impractical method of making telephone calls, but it hints
at the way the Internet uses the telephone networks without being
controlled by them.
<P>
All the content on the Internet is held in computers known as
``servers'' at the edges of the network, usually owned and operated
by the companies and organisations that want to distribute the
information. <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>
has servers; so do thousands of other companies (including The
Economist). In response to a request, the machines parcel up data
in a lot of packets with an address on each one, and send them
blindly down the nearest connection to the Internet.
<P>
When they arrive on the network, they are read by a computer (called
a ``router'') that has a rough idea of where things are on the
Internet. It reads the addresses and sends the packets in the
right general direction, using the best path available at that
moment. The same thing happens at the next intersection, and so
on until the packets reach their destination. The network's best
path from A to B at any one time may bear no relation to real-world
geography. At the moment this paragraph was written, for example,
the best path from London to Amsterdam, using one Internet provider,
was via New Jersey. Other providers might have used different
routes.
<P>
None of the routers has a map of the whole Internet; it just knows
the best way to the next router at that time. That makes it impossible
to predict what path a particular packet will take. It all depends
on what is available at that moment; the individual packets making
up a single message may end up taking different routes, only to
be sewn back together again at their destination.
<H3>Free-for-all</H3>

<P>
This is the power of networked intelligence. The Internet does
not need any particularly smart computers to run the show, just
a lot of dumb-but-fast ones that know how to work together. The
secret of its success is an idea of breathtaking simplicity. Think
up a universal way for networks to share data that will work with
any kind of network, of any size, carrying any kind of data, on
any sort of machine. Let anyone use it, for free, with no restrictions
or limitations. Then just stand back.
<P>
Networks want to connect. As Metcalfe's law states, the value
of a network increases geometrically with the number of people
who use it. Local area networks linking PCs within offices have
been widespread for years, but isolated from each other. The Internet
broke that bottleneck. It offers a standard method of transmitting
data that works equally well for anything from voice to e-mail.
Most importantly, it is in the public domain. Nobody owns it and
nobody charges a fee for its use.
<P>
Proprietary networks using different data standards can be part
of the Internet as long as they package their data to the TCP/IP
standard when they meet each other. But increasingly they use
TCP/IP internally, too, because otherwise they miss out on the
thousands of Internet software programs. These allow the Internet
to be used for things its founders never imagined, from telephone
calls to live rock concerts. An open standard means more users
speaking a common language, and hence a potentially huge audience,
which makes it worthwhile producing such programs.
<P>
But software is just the beginning. Internet content--everything
from classic books to underground music--is exploding even more
spectacularly. This same critical mass of users has stimulated
a creative outpouring not seen since the arrival of the PC (another
open standard). Without any prospect of profit, thousands of individuals
have put millions of pages on-line--anything from complete libraries
of technical information to day- by-day personal diaries or mini-directories
to their favourite part of the Internet. Some of them do it because
the Internet has the remarkable power to make an ordinary person
an on-line celebrity; it bypasses distribution channels and public-relations
machines. Others do it because they see a new world emerging on
the Internet, and want to contribute to it. Still others do it
simply because the Internet is there, and nothing stops them.
If the site is interesting enough, it might be visited by hundreds
or thousands of people a day.
<P>
All this activity keeps the wires humming and attracts millions
of new users each year. It also puts a great deal of pressure
on the network; the companies that provide access and store data
are often swamped by the relentlessly rising tide of traffic.
In theory, the solution is simple: buy more and faster equipment.
But that takes more money, and therein lies a problem. The Internet's
economics are still stuck in its non-commercial past. <HR>

<H1>A changeling's tale</H1>

<P>
<I>From cold war to cyberspace</I><HR>

<P>
SAY Internet, and you instantly conjure up a picture of creative
anarchy. Yet, incongruously, that cheerfully chaotic child was
fathered by cold-war paranoia and born in a military laboratory.
It started life in 1969, as ARPAnet, named after its sponsor,
the Pentagon's <A HREF="http://www.arpa.mil/">Advanced Research Projects Agency</A>.
The aim was modest: to allow computer scientists and engineers
working on military contracts all over America to share expensive
computers and other resources. As an afterthought a few researchers
cooked up a way of sending messages, too. ``E-mail'', as it became
known, quickly turned the network into a new communications link.
<P>
The Internet owes its main technical advantage to its military
origins. Splitting data into tiny packets which can take different
routes to their destination makes it hard to eavesdrop on messages.
And a ``packet-switched'' network can resist large-scale destruction,
even a nuclear attack; if one route is knocked out, packets will
simply travel along one that remains intact.
<P>
Until 1983 the Internet consisted of fewer than <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isoc.org/isoc/charts/90s-host.txt">500 ``host'' computers</A>,
almost exclusively in American military labs and academic computer-science
departments. But the word was getting out to other academics.
By 1987 the Internet had grown to include 28,000 host computers
at hundreds of different universities and research labs.
<P>
Using it was still difficult and frustrating, but its power was
already obvious. No other method to network universities around
the world was so universal and so flexible. Internet users invented
ways for many people to participate in open discussions, created
software and document libraries on the network and made them accessible
to all. This was exciting stuff for computer scientists and some
other academics, but it remained a cloistered world.
<P>
Yet during the late 1980s, while the Internet was growing in the
academic world, a networking revolution of another sort was taking
place outside. Businesses realised that, having traded their mainframes
for a multiplicity of PCs, they needed some way to recapture the
mainframe's ability to share data and devices such as printers.
So they strung wires around their offices and connected the PCs
together.
<P>
These internal ``local area networks'' (LANs) did more than save
money; they changed the way people worked. E-mail took off within
offices, and soon between them, as companies created ``wide area
networks'' to connect distant workplaces. But there it stopped.
Different software and hardware standards used by different companies
made creating wider networks a nightmare of incompatibility.
<P>
At home, PCs had made computer power affordable, and modems had
allowed them to be connected up over telephone lines to commercial
``on- line'' services and ``bulletin boards''-- electronic discussion
groups and software libraries usually set up by enthusiasts. Both
of these grew steadily, but not explosively. Each had disadvantages.
The networks offered by <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>,
the leading on-line service provider, and others that followed
in its wake were national, even global, but they were closed.
The providers controlled what was available. Private bulletin-
board systems, which had sprung up in their thousands, were unrestricted
but usually confined to a small group of users near the host computer.
<P>
Around the same time the American government was relaxing its
hold on its network. The <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A>,
a civilian agency, was now paying for most of it, originally to
connect the agency's supercomputer centres, but later as a way
to allow all kinds of academic and government researchers to communicate.
For the first time companies were allowed to join, although not
to use the network for purely commercial purposes.
<P>
Still, that was enough. Having conquered the academic world, the
Internet began to serve as a connection point for commercial networks,
both to reach academics and to communicate amongst themselves.
``The Net came at a unique time when the computers and networks
that existed were waiting for a way to bring them together,''
says John Curran, chief technical officer at <A HREF="http://www.bbn.com/">Bolt Beranek and Newman</A>,
a Cambridge, Massachusetts, technology company widely credited
with creating much of the early Internet. Commercial use skyrocketed
as restrictions were eased, and last year companies passed universities
as the dominant users. In April all remaining curbs on commercial
use were lifted, and the National Science Foundation began to
phase out the last direct federal subsidies for the network. The
Internet had grown up. <HR>

<H1>Freeloading as a way of life</H1>

<P>
<I>The strange economics of cyberspace</I><HR>

<P>
A SIMPLE question: if the Internet runs over telephone lines,
why does it cost the same to send an e-mail message around the
world as it does to send it next door? Answer: no one really knows;
maybe it should. Just as the Internet has overturned the conventional
wisdom on building telecoms networks, so it has challenged their
archaic pricing systems. Unhelpfully, though, it offers nothing
more substantial than a vacuum in their place. When Internet builders
lie awake at night worrying that the whole thing might fall apart,
as often as not their nightmares are about its economics.
<P>
Start with the distance puzzle. The first reason why distant messages
costs no more than local ones is that the Internet, although it
runs on telephone lines, uses them much more frugally than voice
calls do. A voice call is an analogue signal which needs a lot
of electronic space to avoid interference, so it takes up an entire
line for the duration of the call. By contrast, the Internet is
digital, so its data bits--ones and zeros--can be compressed.
<P>
Second, and more important, the Internet data is split up into
packets, which do not need a line to themselves. Packets from
hundreds of sources are mixed up by the computer and shoved down
the pipe in a jumble. The router at the other end of the line
receives each one, reads its address and sends it in the right
direction. When you make a telephone call, you are consuming a
scarce and expensive resource: a whole line. When you send a message
on the Internet, you are sharing a plentiful and cheap resource:
the entire bandwidth on the line. Your packets are just a drop
in a passing river.
<P>
But there is a third reason: telecoms pricing is a notorious scam.
A large part of the price of a telephone call (often more than
40%) goes to the recipient's telephone company for taking it the
last few miles. Through a complicated accounting scheme known
as ``settlements'', telecoms companies exchange billions of dollars
each year to pay for the local component of international calls.
<P>
The Internet bypasses all this. It usually operates on leased
lines, out of reach of national telecoms accounting. Even if these
companies could track the traffic, they would simply find a constant
stream of ones and zeros, 24 hours a day.
<P>
Digital data makes short work of all the anachronistic pricing
schemes and implicit cartels of the international telecoms market.
Telephone calls are priced at what the market will bear. Data
transmission on leased lines is priced somewhere nearer to what
it actually costs. The difference can take several noughts off
the amount you pay. Talk to a friend abroad for an hour and you
may be charged $50. Make the same call on the Internet, using
software from companies such as <A HREF="http://www.vocaltec.com/">VocalTec</A>,
and you pay nothing, or nothing more than the cost of a local
phone call. Even after allowing for your monthly fee, the call
costs just a few cents.
<H3>Forget economics, let's surf</H3>

<P>
One of the many remarkable things about the Internet is that once
you have paid your monthly connection charge--say $20--it appears
to be free. Send one e-mail message around the world or send a
thousand, the price is the same: $0. In fact, each e- mail message
does cost somebody something, because it consumes a tiny bit of
``bandwidth'', the capacity of the expensive data pipes that make
up the Internet. But since the Internet providers have no way
of billing for such infinitesimal consumption, they have settled
for a rough approximation instead. They multiply the number of
their subscribers by the average network usage to calculate the
capacity they need to lease, which gives them a fair idea what
to charge. As long as the average usage does not change much,
this works.
<P>
But usage does change. Until recently the Internet has been mostly
a world of text, which is an efficient way to communicate. A million
bytes can capture the text of a 700-page book, but only 50 spoken
words, five medium-sized pictures or three seconds of video. Yet
people are now flooding the Internet mainly for the sake of byte-hungry
multimedia. The World Wide Web lets users navigate the network
by simply clicking on colourful screens of words, pictures, sound
and video. Already the Web accounts for more than a third of the
traffic on the Internet, and will soon chew up more bandwidth
than any other service. Assumptions about average use may need
to be revised.
<P>
This worries some network analysts. The Internet is a shared resource,
like the fish in the sea. Economic theory is gloomy about these:
individuals tend to exploit shared resources, but look after private
ones. Eventually that leads to depletion which ruins the resource
for all its users: the sea becomes fished out, the Internet gets
swamped.
<P>
At the moment users have every incentive to exploit the Internet.
The more they use it, the more they get for their monthly fee.
And many users would rather click on data-rich pictures than read
lots of frugal lines scrolling down the screen. Some analysts,
such as <A HREF="http://gopher.econ.lsa.umich.edu/EconInternet.html">Hal Varian and Jeffrey MacKie-Mason</A>,
two economists at the University of Michigan, now argue that those
who spend all day surfing the Internet should pay more than those
who just send the occasional e-mail message. Pricing, they say,
should be based on usage.
<P>
That is easier said than done. At the moment, individual useage
is usually not even measured, much less charged for. Counting
all those packets just means more work for some overloaded computer.
Likewise, the most obvious sort of usage pricing--a charge per
packet--would consume more computer capacity than is needed to
transmit the packets in the first place. A simpler way to charge
(which is actually incorporated in the next version of TCP/IP)
is to allow each packet to carry a ``priority''. High-priority
packets--live transmission such as voice or video--would flow
through the network without delay; low-priority packets--such
as e- mail--would wait for a lull. Internet providers would charge
more for high-priority items.
<P>
The reason why usage-based pricing on the Internet is so controversial
is that it would abolish one of the system's big attractions:
the ability to surf at whim, with no meter running. Users do not
have to work out if the latest picture of someone's fish tank
is worth a few cents. They can have a look because it is fun,
and free. Critics fear that usage-based pricing might kill the
vitality that built the Internet. Where it has been tried--in
New Zealand, Chile, and some universities--usage growth has usually
slowed.
<P>
Compromises may be possible. Users may decide at the outset what
level of service they can afford. A high-priority connection would
cost more than a low-priority one, but it would still be charged
at a flat fee. Or providers could charge on tiered usage: users
would pay a fixed monthly fee up to a certain level; if they exceeded
that, they would pay more. This might discourage excessive use
without that ticking-meter feeling.
<P>
There is one other option: do nothing. The Internet has come this
far without complicated charging systems, and although the traffic
jams today are bad, they have been worse in the past. The existing
system does already include a crude form of usage pricing. Big
pipes cost more than little ones: a leased line that can handle
up to 64,000 bits per second can cost 50 times more than a dial-up
connection at only 14,400 bits. Perhaps this is enough. In competitive
markets, the cost of bandwidth is dropping almost as quickly as
usage is climbing. The computers that route Internet traffic are
getting faster. Maybe market forces, along with the rough limits
of pipe size, will set prices at the right levels. Nobody really
knows. <HR>

Some of those suits have set up <A HREF="http://www2.pcy.mci.net/marketplace/marketplace.html">MarketplaceMCI</A>,
a ``virtual mall'' created by <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>,
an American long-distance telephone company. It does not look
like much in the real world; just another big room of cubicles.
But a few computers create a more mall- like illusion on-line.
Seen from a netsurfer's screen, there are plenty of stores to
``visit'' (a bit like looking at a mail-order catalogue), and
a mall-like range of unrelated items--from software to bathrobes--to
see and buy. MarketplaceMCI, along with dozens of other new <A HREF="chart3.html">on-line shops</A>,
has proved that it is possible to market in grand style over the
Internet.
<P>
The idea sounds compelling. You look up the company you want in
a sort of Yellow Pages, click on its name to be taken to its Web
site, and are presented with all the information you need, and
usually some way to order. In reality, buying on the Internet
today is still chaotic: there are hundreds of directories, each
organised differently, and none lists more than a fraction of
all the stores on-line.
<P>
But for many merchants, especially small ones, the Internet is
hard to resist. It is inherently global, so a corner florist can
become an international flower power simply by getting an Internet
connection (and some good marketing). Overheads are minimal. In
some businesses, distance may not even affect delivery costs because
the merchant may pass the order to a regional warehouse, or ship
the goods electronically. And on the Internet, no one knows whether
you are a giant multinational company or a one-man band.
<P>
A handful of companies have shown that on- line commerce can work
if you pick your product carefully. Software, technical books
and flowers seem to do well on-line. They are easy to describe
in a few pictures and text, and they suit the market: Internet
users tend to be computerphiles who sometimes spend too much time
in front of their screens, hence the occasional need for flowers.
But what else will sell?
<P>
This is not just a question for stores. Huge consumer-goods companies
such as <A HREF="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</A>, <A HREF="http://www.vmg.co.uk/">Virgin Records</A>
and <A HREF="http://planetreebok.com/">Reebok</A> are now turning
to the Internet for marketing. Newspapers, magazines and music
and book publishers see the on-line world as a combination of
threat and opportunity. As a new medium with almost no distribution
costs, the Internet has the potential to reshape the media world,
letting new competitors in and forcing established giants to evolve
or die. Already sales of the <A HREF="http://www.eb.com/">Encyclopaedia Britannica</A>
have collapsed in the face of competition from CD-ROMs; the next
battlefield will be on-line.
<P>
The commercial world now dominates Internet use. More than 80,000
companies are connected. Between them, they have more than 1.4m
Internet hosts, each of which may support many individual users.
Some of them are joining as consumers, but many are there to sell.
For the moment the market is probably small: estimates put it
at no more than $100m last year. But its potential is huge. Analysts
point to the existing $53 billion catalogue and $2.5 billion TV
home-shopping markets worldwide, and they wave surveys showing
that the average Internet user earns 50% more than the national
average and likes mail-order shopping.
<H3>A world of window browsers</H3>

<P>
But it is early days for that. Mr <A HREF="http://www.tic.com/mids/pressbig.html">Quarterman</A>
calculates that by the end of 1994 about 8m Internet users had
the right connections to use the Web; perhaps half of them actually
did so. It is the Web--with its multimedia gloss, interactivity,
and emerging secure areas--that most companies would choose as
their Internet marketplace. However, most Web users are in companies
and universities with leased-line Internet connections; for the
average home user, downloading the Web's graphics-rich pages over
a modem connection is too slow and clumsy. This balance will shift
as more home consumers get faster modems, ISDN connections and
other high-speed links, but only gradually. <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>
reckons that it will take at least four more years for consumer
users to pass corporate ones in America; by that time there should
be about 10m American home users on the Web.
<P>
If Forrester is right, Internet commerce may take off a lot more
slowly than the suits at MCI think. Home consumers are the key
to on-line shopping. Browsing through catalogues and chasing discounts
tends to be a leisure-time activity. But the technology that makes
the Internet bearable usually stays at work. Cathy Medich, the
director of <A HREF="http://www.commerce.net/">CommerceNet</A>,
an industry consortium aimed at getting this market going, has
perhaps more reason to be sanguine than most other people; yet
she admits that ``I don't have time to shop on-line at work, where
I've got a fast connection. But at home all I've got is a modem.''
<P>
Moreover, browsers are not necessarily buyers. Many Internet merchants
record hundreds or thousands of visits each day, but ring up only
a few sales. This is not a problem unique to the Internet: commercial
on-line services such as <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>
have had electronic marketplaces for more than a decade, but total
retail sales have never exceeded $75m annually.
<P>
There are good reasons for consumers' reluctance. Compared with
the security and ease of telephoning a company they know and placing
an order, buying on-line is still mostly for the brave and curious.
For the average home Internet shopper, for example, finding a
particular music CD on the Internet can easily take half an hour.
And even when the would-be buyer has eventually located the goods,
he may hesitate. After all, anyone can scan in a few pages from
a CD catalogue, register an Internet address and start taking
credit-card numbers. By the time buyers realise that they are
not getting their wares, a crook may have collected hundreds of
credit-card numbers. If he lives abroad, he may be hard to bring
to book.
<P>
Then there are technical problems. Internet merchants are just
starting to adopt encryption techniques that allow credit-card
numbers to be sent safely, but the competing standards may take
a while to sort out. <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>,
maker of the most popular Web browser software, as well as CommerceNet,
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft </A>(with <A HREF="http://www.visa.com/">Visa</A>)
and others are working on ways to check the identity of both the
merchant and the customer to limit fraud, but results could be
a year or more away.
<P>
Other forms of payment seem even further off, from the on-line
accounts offered by <A HREF="http://www.fv.com/">First Virtual</A>,
which aggregates purchases from merchants and bills the buyer's
credit card, to the futuristic ``digital cash'' of <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/">DigiCash</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cybercash.com/">CyberCash</A> and others.
None has made much headway so far. ``We have a business model,''
Dan Lynch, a co-founder of CyberCash, recently told a conference,
``but we don't believe it. We don't know what we're doing, and
the other guys don't either.''
<H3>Selling bits and pieces</H3>

<P>
But home shopping is just one of many commercial possibilities
on the Internet. Companies selling news and other information,
such as financial data and research, may well hold greater appeal
for those with fast corporate Internet links. The same is true
for services that make the Internet easier to use, such as <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com:80/Home">InfoSeek</A>,
which lets subscribers search its database of Internet content.
And many firms are exploring the Internet as a way to conduct
electronic transactions with suppliers, which at the moment take
place over expensive private lines.
<P>
The biggest market for the Internet, however, is advertising and
marketing; and here business is already thriving. Most of the
corporate ``home pages'' on the Web amount to little more than
the usual marketing gloss, polished to an extra shine by electronic
means. But the best ones offer something potentially useful as
well. <A HREF="http://www.fedex.com/">Federal Express</A> offers
a way to track the status of a package. The site for <A HREF="http://www.zima.com/">Zima</A>,
a drink, offers links to bar and restaurant directories across
America. <A HREF="http://www.holiday-inn.com/cgi-bin/Web.ksh">Holiday Inn</A>
offers direct booking for its hotels, and <A HREF="http://www.visa.com/locator/atm_region.html/">Visa</A>
lets visitors search for the nearest hole-in-the-wall cash machine.
<P>
Companies are starting to include the address of their Web sites
in their traditional print and television advertising. Others
are paying to place a link to their home page on a popular site,
such as the <A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/index.html">on-line version of Wired</A>
magazine (which is said to have made $2m from selling such placements
last year). Some firms sponsor on-line magazine articles or an
entire publication. The advantage of Web advertising over the
traditional variety is that consumers are free to explore as little
or as much of the information as they want, instead of having
all of it shoved down their throats. ``If the remote control was
the great equaliser in the battle between advertiser and television
viewer, [the Web] and the mouse may shift power completely to
the hands of the consumer,'' writes Gerald O'Connell, of the Internet
advertising firm <A HREF="http://www.modemmedia.com/">ModemMedia</A>.
<P>
But this increasingly sophisticated Internet advertising carries
a cost: a return to domination by the traditional giants. It takes
money to stand out in the Internet's sprawl. Big companies can
pay to promote themselves in the most popular sites. Little companies
may not be able to afford to advertise their Web page anywhere
but locally. Suddenly the Internet is beginning to look a lot
less like the much-hyped global-village market. <HR>

<H1>Paradise by the modem lights</H1>

<P>
<I>Remove your prejudices before entering</I><HR>

<P>
NEW technologies tend to create new cultures. Early radio pioneers
had to learn Morse code and soon developed their own language
and conventions. A similar mystique grew up around the earliest
computers and the PC. Eventually these technologies all entered
the mainstream, relegating the insider culture of their infancy
to fringe groups. The Internet is still in its pioneer phase,
and its culture is still like nothing else on the planet.
<P>
The network's main language, inevitably, is English: the Internet
was born and raised in America. At the beginning of this year
America still had twice as many users as the rest of the world
put together (see <A HREF="chart4.gif">chart</A>), although other
countries are now slowly catching up). Most of the Internet's
key resources--not only software but things like directories and
information libraries--are in English. And e-mail, newsgroups
and other text areas are generally limited to roman characters,
forcing more of the world to use fiendishly complicated phonetic
versions of their languages.
<P>
Although the Internet is global in reach, much of its content
is surprisingly narrow and local in focus. Anyone with an Internet
connection can go to Amsterdam's <A HREF="http://www.dds.nl/">Digital City</A>,
but they need to speak Dutch to get around: this is a local outpost,
built by and for natives. The same is true for hundreds of local
discussion groups, from German ``help wanted'' to New Zealand
politics.
<P>
But despite the local variations, there is a recognisable flavour
about the way Internet users talk among themselves, accentuated
by a highly developed insider's language. The Internet dialect
is full of mysterious abbreviatons. Some of them--FTP, PPP, IRC--refer
to technologies and services. Others take some of the labour out
of typing: BTW (By The Way); IRL (In Real Life); IANAL (I Am Not
A Lawyer). Yet more characters, called emoticons, try to compensate
for the limited ``emotional bandwidth'' of text communications
by using letters to sketch a facial expression sideways on; a
wink, for example, becomes ;-).
<P>
The content of the messages is often as distinctive as the language.
The classic user takes a libertarian stance, is suspicious of
government, disdainful of politicians, and actively hostile towards
those who would screw up his paradise with indiscriminate advertising,
stupid questions and ``newbie'' (naive newcomer) behaviour. But
the Internet attracts people of all leanings: liberals welcome
it as a tool of empowerment for the disenfranchised; conservatives
love it as a free marketplace.
<P>
Fundamental to the Internet credo is the protection of free speech
and the right of every group to be heard. This has given an international
voice to cat fanciers and quilting clubs, but it has also brought
out more worrying sides of human nature. As one would expect,
there is lots of talk about sex of various kinds; at the same
time the Internet provides a home for hate groups, from Holocaust
revisionists to Turkish Armenian-bashers.
<P>
Internet debates can easily become heated to the point of mutual
vilification. Just as no one needs any special permission to speak
up, nobody is accorded any special courtesy either. Yet Internet
users will often go to extraordinary lengths to help perfect strangers
with information, tips, even research on their questions. The
Internet is still a surprisingly altruistic place.
<H3>Life, but not as we know it</H3>

<P>
Enthusiasts see the Internet as a sort of digital Utopia, not
because everything on it is admirable, but because it is there
at all. The Internet defies centralised authority; its mantra
is ``do your own thing''. The Internet's most passionate evangelists
believe that its radical heritage is not about to be swept away
by a tidal wave of conventionality and electronic shopping. Its
interactive culture, they think, will take root and flourish.
Once introduced to the powerful consensual illusion of cyberspace,
people will surely choose to embrace it, spending hours on-line
in virtual places and joining vibrant electronic communities.
<P>
In this future world, people will read not only newspapers but
books--embellished with multimedia hypertext--on-line. ``Intelligent
agents'' will act as personal butlers, travelling the networks
on their masters' behalf, bidding against other agents for theatre
tickets and making dinner reservations. Users will telecommute
to work, and their children will be taught on-line. Much of this
is already possible; soon it will be technically easy.
<P>
To the evangelists, this is a message of hope and optimism about
the future. They are puzzled that it seems to make other people
bristle. Earlier this year Louis Rossetto, the editor of <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</A>,
sketched out his vision of the digital future to a large audience
in London. The first response from the audience was typical. ``We've
heard this before. This was <A HREF="http://www.intac.com/~dimitri/dh/learywilson.html">Timothy Leary</A>
telling us the drugs were going to make this a better world. It
didn't happen then; why should we believe it will now?''
<P>
By comparison with the electronic nirvana of the information superhighway
prophets, today's Internet is easy to ridicule. Yes, things are
quite difficult to find; yes, 90% of what is available is rubbish.
True, information is not the same as knowledge. And quite right:
everything takes far too long.
<P>
But while the hype of the information superhighway is setting
dreamers off on flights of disembodied fancy, the Internet is
already becoming ensconced in daily life in all kinds of prosaic
ways. Lots of people send each other e-mail. They may follow a
newsgroup or two. Increasingly, their daily routine now takes
them to a few Web sites, for news or stock prices or whatever
else they may want to know. Indeed, rather than Internet culture
pervading the world at large, the reverse seems to be true. The
centre of Internet activity is shifting from the anarchic if enjoyable
chaos of the newsgroups to the commercial and more passive Web,
a place of fascinating images, places and information, but little
real contact with other people.
<P>
So the culture of the Internet is changing. For 20 years its users
managed to maintain a world with the core values of a hippy commune.
Now Mum and Dad and the suited advertising smoothies have moved
in, bringing with them their consumer culture and corporate values.
For now the two cultures coexist uneasily, but the numbers are
on the side of the mainstream. This is beginning to challenge
many of the principles of Internet culture. Calls for more government
involvement are getting louder. If one day the Internet is to
become a ``data dialtone'' like the telephone system, those critics
argue, then perhaps the principle of universal service should
apply here too--which would mean subsidising some of the poorer
Internet users with revenues from some of the richer ones.
<P>
The flood of new users on the Internet is also putting a strain
on its egalitarian principles. When everyone is talking at once,
how can you tell sense from noise? Increasingly, the old filtering
prejudices are creeping back, creating new hierarchies that mirror
those of the real world. If an open discussion triggers hundreds
of e-mail messages, even Internet junkies must start weeding.
Predictably, comments from big companies (microsoft.com), the
government (senate.gov) or prestigious universities (mit.edu)
tend to get read. Those from some obscure free library connection
in Cleveland fall victim to the ``delete'' key. <HR>

<H1>Lawless</H1>

<P>
<I>Too many loopholes in the Net?</I><HR>

<P>
THE net interprets censorship as damage, and routes around it.''
This quote from John Gilmore, a founding member of the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</A>,
often appears on the Internet. It reflects its users' confidence
that their electronic world, designed to resist nuclear attack,
can also shrug off government regulation. By nature of its global
reach and its decentralised design, they believe, it is unpoliceable.
<P>
They may be mistaken. On April 27th the US Congress held a hearing
on terrorism in the wake of the bomb that killed 167 people in
a federal building in Oklahoma. Senator Edward Kennedy waved a
76-page ``Terrorist's Handbook'' that his staff had downloaded
from the Internet, and explained that it contained instructions
for building different types of bombs, including the ammonium
nitrate bomb used in Oklahoma: ``Right now we're considering a
telecommunications reform bill in the Senate that is trying to
do something about porn on the Internet--we should do something
about this terrorist information, too.''
<P>
The telecoms reform <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/s652_95_a1362_exon_coats.amend">bill </A>the
senator mentioned would do more than something about pornography
on the Internet. It would criminalise the sending of any content
deemed (by some unspecified definition) ``obscene, lewd, lascivious,
filthy, or indecent''. The bill was passed on June 15th; similar
legislation is moving through the House. In Washington state the
legislature has already passed a bill that would make Internet
access providers liable for any obscene content going through
their lines. At least a dozen other states have proposed similar
legislation.
<P>
Internet activists claim that such legislation puts <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/cda_passage_eff.analysis">unconstitutional restrictions on free speech</A>.
But that would not stop it from becoming law before it is challenged
in the courts. Since screening for all obscene content is impossible,
network providers in states that passed such laws might have to
shut down. Even the Internet cannot route around that.
<P>
Internet providers have so far ducked responsibility for what
they transmit by claiming ``common-carrier'' protection. They
argue that they are not like publishers, who can be held responsible
for the contents of their publications, but like telephone companies,
acting simply as a conduit for messages they have no knowledge
of.
<P>
The current round of congressional hearings indicates that the
common-carrier exemption is not enough. Somebody has to take responsibility
for protecting vulnerable groups from obscene material. Usually
this would be the person who had put the material on the network
in the first place. But that person may live in a place where
such material is perfectly permissible. And besides, it is quite
easy to put material on the Internet anonymously. This leaves
the Internet community with two broad options: to regulate itself
or be regulated. Most Internet users prefer self-regulation, but
the nuts and bolts of that are a technical nightmare.
<P>
The problem is that obscenity on the Internet can appear under
an infinite number of guises. Some of them are obvious, including
newsgroups with names such as alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children,
along with Web sites put up by Penthouse, Playboy and a host of
amateurs. Others are harder to find: live ``keyboard sex'' on
<A HREF="http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRC.html">Internet Relay Chat</A>
channels; secret libraries known only to porn traders; even a
live video-sex service, where real women obey the typed commands
of paying viewers. Cutting off the more obvious pornography newsgroups
is easy, but that will merely make them adopt a heavier disguise.
More generic filters are bound to fail. No computer on earth can
recognise an obscene picture.
<P>
One possible self-regulating solution seems to be voluntary ``tagging''
of adult material, so that specially configured software on users'
computers can screen it out. Parents could set the software to
view such material only with a special password. Several companies
are already developing software that would allow this. Smart kids
can no doubt get round it; but users hope that such gestures may
yet save the Internet from being regulated to death.
<H3>Inadvertent criminals</H3>

<P>
But it is not just pornography that concerns the would-be regulators:
they also paint the Internet as a haven for piracy and crime.
There is something in that. Software programs by the hundreds
are illegally copied on-line, and hackers are having a field day
breaking into poorly guarded sites. But some of the problem also
has to do with the failure of legislators to keep up with new
technology.
<P>
Copyright law is having particular trouble with adjusting to the
new age. It has not been able to come to terms with a unique property
of digital information: the ease of making an infinite number
of perfect copies, essentially for free. Copy an article, casually
post it to a newsgroup, and at a keystroke you may have robbed
a company of thousands of sales. For publishers who still see
a threat in the photocopier, the Internet looks like the end of
the world.
<P>
The problem with copyright law is that it is unable to distinguish
between abuse and ordinary use. On the Internet, any number of
normal activities may inadvertently break the law. The simple
act of reading a document on-line often makes a copy of it in
a user's hard disk. Internet providers often keep copies of popular
Web sites on their local servers so their subscribers do not jam
their long-distance lines. Then there are innumerable deliberate,
but essentially innocent violations without a commercial motive:
copying an interesting electronic article and e-mailing it to
a friend, or putting it on a company LAN.
<P>
In the end copyright laws must change to reflect this new digital
domain. Publishers need some assurance that their work will not
be pirated to the point where they have nothing left to sell,
yet a way must be found to avoid criminalising normal use.
<P>
Cyberspace has no respect for trademark law, either. An <A HREF="http://rs.internic.net/rs-internic.html">arm</A>
of the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</A> issues
``domain'' names--mcdonalds.com, for example--to companies on
request. But it does not usually check to see if the person requesting
it owns the trademark; indeed, when a journalist took mcdonalds.com
as a prank, the company had to threaten to sue him to get it back.
Worse, different companies may own the same name in different
countries, yet an Internet domain is inherently global. As the
writs fly, groups such as the International Trademark Association
are desperately trying to find some solution.
<P>
Crime is another mess. The trouble is not so much that criminals
will use the Internet, but that the police will not be able to
keep track of them there. Techniques for encryption--scrambling
messages so that only the intended recipient can read them--are
now so advanced that they can be virtually uncrackable, even with
the biggest computers. Encrypted messages make Internet wiretapping
nearly impossible. This is why the American government has <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/export/export.html">banned the export</A>
of strong encryption technology, and law-enforcement agencies
want to set up a <A HREF="http://www.quadralay.com/www/Crypt/Clipper/non-tech.html">system</A>
which allows them to decode messages sent within the country.
Internet users, fearing invasion of their privacy, have mounted
the virtual barricades. But the battle has slowed the deployment
of encryption technology in general, ironically making it even
easier for criminals already on-line to steal information.
<P>
Crime, the maintenance of public decency and the protection of
intellectual property are the problems of any mature and complex
society. No doubt the Internet will find solutions to them in
time; but meanwhile they act as a reminder that building a real
electronic nation involves a lot more more than laying down the
pipes. <HR>

<H1>The shape of nets to come</H1>

<P>
<I>There could be one, or many</I><HR>

<P>
IN THE early 1970s, a new communications network began to take
off in America. It bypassed traditional links and grew from the
bottom up. Millions of people joined it to communicate and share
information. It developed its own culture and language. Visionaries
saw it unleashing creativity and opening the door to an egalitarian
future. It was CB radio. By 1980 it was almost dead; it had collapsed
under the weight of its own popularity, its channels drowned under
a sea of noise and chaos. Could the Internet go the same way?
<P>
For parts of it, the answer seems clearly yes. In some newsgroups
and mailing lists the ``signal-to- noise ratio''--the fraction
of messages that are even remotely interesting--is becoming quite
unrewarding. Sensible people will go elsewhere and those newsgroups
will die.
<P>
But as a whole, the Internet seems safe from CB radio's fate.
Where CB radio had just 40 channels, the Internet has an infinite
number. Broadcast chatter is just one of its many forms of communication;
the Web, moderated mailing lists and private e-mail are not as
easily swamped. Technically, there is some concern about the system's
ability to make the leap from a few thousand computers to tens
of millions. But so far nothing has emerged that experts feel
they cannot set right.
<P>
Most important, the Internet has commercial potential. A critical
mass of companies have now bet heavily on it. Already some of
the world's biggest telecoms companies are developing ``industrial-strength''
parts of the Internet for such businesses. <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>, <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>--along
with some of the regional Baby Bells, and smaller networking companies
such as <A HREF="http://www.bbn.com/">BBN</A> and <A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">PSI</A>--are
rolling out services with lots of bandwidth, security, reliability
and a help desk to call when things go wrong.
<P>
There is plenty of scope for growth. At the moment fewer than
100,000 of the many millions of businesses around the globe are
on the Internet. Even in America, the most wired society in the
world, less than 7% of the population is connected up. And yet
the network seems to be straining at the seams already, with long
delays during the American business day.
<P>
For a while, more users will continue to strain the network. But
much of the congestion that users chafe at is not within the network
itself, but at its periphery: in the hundreds of thousands of
servers owned by companies, universities and local Internet providers.
This is where the Internet content is stored, spread among many
private computers. Firms can reduce the queues by buying more
and faster servers, or bigger links to the Internet. If they want
people to come back to their sites, they will spend what it takes
to keep up with demand.
<P>
Even if the jams can be avoided, though, some users fret about
information overload. They see themselves surfing a sea of random
facts, half- baked thoughts and blabber. But the Internet is not
a database. It is a world with many facets: information of varying
quality, entertainment, people and places. Just like the chaotic
real world, the on-line world contains too much information to
make sense of. But this is evidence not of its unmanageability,
but of its vitality. Like newcomers in a foreign land, people
will have to find their place on the Internet. But they will get
plenty of help. Entire industries will grow up to make sense of
the information available on-line, just as a plethora of guides
do in the real world.
<H3>The empire strikes back</H3>

<P>
Today no one in particular owns the Internet; which is to say
that hundreds of companies own small parts of it. Over the next
few years a shake-out seems inevitable. A dizzying number of companies
are clamouring for a share. Beyond the big telephone companies,
America alone has 600 small Internet providers. Cable TV companies
have suddenly realised that the Internet has bypassed their fitful
interactive TV trials. Led by <A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/">TCI</A>'s
<A HREF="http://www.home.net/">@Home</A> effort, they are racing
to offer Internet and other data services on their own networks.
<P>
In this new world, the commercial on-line services--mostly <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>,
<A HREF="http://webcrawler.com/AOL/">America Onlin</A>e and <A HREF="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</A>,
with the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/services/msnet/msnintro.htm">Microsoft Network</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.eo.net/">Europe Online</A> due to be launched
later this year--have an uncertain future. At the moment, the
Internet explosion means that their business is booming. They
can provide their subscribers with a safe home from which to explore
this teeming jungle.
<P>
But already hundreds of other companies are developing software
to make the Internet easier to use. Until now, the commercial
services have made their money by keeping their subscribers within
their own service, paying for something that they alone can offer.
But content providers are looking for a better deal. There is
little incentive to limit their clientele to the 3m subscribers
that, say, CompuServe can offer when they can get at least 10m
on the Web. <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>
projects that the commercial services' growth will peak around
1998; after that the growth is all Net.
<P>
Providing Internet access may soon become a tough commodity business.
The companies that will continue to make money are those who offer
more. Users will need--and be willing to pay for-- Internet directories
and guidance. Businesses will pay Internet companies to run their
on-line storefronts, as some already do.
<P>
Yet the best business prospects lie not in carrying other people's
bytes or running their stores, but in having something to sell
yourself. Telephone companies agree, which is why so many of them
are getting into the content business. In May <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
committed itself to investing up to $2 billion in News Corp, following
the path taken by <A HREF="http://www.ba.com/">Bell Atlantic</A>,
Nynex and <A HREF="http://www.pactel.com/">Pacific Telesis</A>
(which invested $300m to start a new content shop), <A HREF="http://www.bst.bls.com/">Bell South</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.sbc.com/">SBC Communications</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ameritech.com/">Ameritech</A>
(which put $500m into a deal with <A HREF="http://www.disney.com/">Disney</A>),
and <A HREF="http://www.uswest.com/">US West</A> (which bought
a quarter of <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@olU4xQAAAAAAAEz5/pathfinder/welcome.html">Time Warner</A>
for $2.5 billion).
<P>
In the meantime, the telephone companies are fighting to regain
the pipes. The explosive growth of the Internet may have caught
them off-guard, but they are now believers. ``A year ago,'' says
Lance Boxer, MCI's data services chief, ``we thought of the Internet
as an interesting model, but not as a necessary model. Now we're
probably investing more in the Internet than any company has in
history. We've never had an opportunity like this.''
<P>
Or a threat? If the Internet does become a ``data dialtone'',
regular dialtone might find itself out in the cold. It is already
possible to make telephone calls on the Internet from specially-equipped
computers; the spread of multimedia PCs and faster Internet connections
could make this commonplace. At the same time companies are turning
an increasing amount of their telephone traffic into digital data
and sending it through private data networks, saving up to half
their telecoms costs. Regulation permitting, this traffic could
eventually move to the Internet. For the telephone companies,
``the only decision is whether they participate in the cannibalisation
of their revenues or watch it happen,'' says William Schraeder,
president of <A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">PSI</A>.
<P>
At the moment, neither the Internet, nor any digital network,
could handle all the world's telephone calls. But MCI predicts
that by the turn of the century the Internet will be carrying
as much data as the voice networks. When that time comes, the
Internet may have to grow up in a hurry. It will be too important
to stay in the grey market of borrowed wires and back-of-the-envelope
economics.
<P>
Growing up could be painful. Mr Schraeder suggests one way things
could go wrong: at some point in not too many years the telephone
companies have enough customers within their own parts of the
Internet to launch an attack on the network. They want to go back
to the telephone model that has earned them so much for so long:
settlements, usage-based pricing, the works. They cut off independent
networks that refuse to go along. The Internet splits in two,
leaving a high-priced, orderly business network and a cheap, chaotic
consumer network, with minimal interconnection between them. Thus
balkanised, the Internet as we know it fades away, leaving the
field to commercial networks. The cable TV and telephone companies'
vision triumphs.
<P>
But there are more ways in which that vision might fail. If enough
consumers choose the more chaotic, but more open, independent
networks, the telecoms giants would be unable to cut them off.
Or the telephone companies could simply accept the new world and
the inevitable decline in voice revenues it foretells. They could,
as some are doing now, embrace it and look for new ways to make
money.
<P>
Ironically, in these rosier scenarios the Internet might also
fade, but in a different way: it just keeps on growing, absorbing
other networks of all sorts until it becomes so ubiquitous that
it is simply woven into everyday life, carrying not just data,
but telephone calls, television, everything. This is the information
superhighway writ large--and small. In this vision, we plug into
the data stream as casually as we plug into an electric socket
today. Content and transmission are disaggregated; the network
has turned into an open road.
<P>
This, indeed, may be the more likely future. Despite the racing
pace of the Internet today, it will not happen overnight. After
all, the PC, more than 15 years after its launch, is still nowhere
near being considered an appliance. But ubiquitous, open networking
seems as fundamental to civilisation's needs in the first half
of the 21st century as ubiquitous, open roads did in the first
half of the 20th. The lesson of the Internet is simple and lasting:
people want to connect, with as little control and interference
as possible. Call it a free market or just an efficient architecture:
the power of open networking has only just begun to be felt.

<h1 align=center>How to cut the cost of politics</h1>


"LET us commit ourselves tonight, before the eyes of America, to finally enacting campaign-finance reform." Thus Bill Clinton, in what he clearly saw as the bravest bit of his state-of-the-union message after balancing the budget. Virtuous stuff, indeed; but hardly credible. For a start, Mr Clinton was elected on a tidal wave of money. Second, most politicians in America--the men who must alter the rules, if they are ever to be altered--were elected likewise. Third, promises to introduce campaign-finance reform are as common in American politics as bugs in May, and every bit as likely to die in a day. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But no, this time is different, Americans cry; this time we really are fed up. More money than ever was spent on the last election campaign, and it was raised in more dubious ways. Heads of corporations sipped coffee in the White House, the Lincoln Bedroom was rented out to contributors, and Asian conglomerates poured money down a fire hose into the coffers of the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, congressmen and senators across the country have been spending the past two years in an endless round of glad-handing, canap&eacute;s and guest appearances in order to raise money. They are captive to a single mesmerising equation: he who has more money almost always wins the race.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans are right to resent this. Although in any democracy some parties and candidates will always have more money than others, money and the exercise of influence should not be inevitably connected. Yet the overwhelming evidence from America is that dollars now speak louder than ideas; that access is bought and sold; and that, unless they have funds of their own, challengers and third parties are often drowned out. As a result, ordinary citizens are disillusioned. Since, in their eyes, the political process is run by special-interest groups and powerful organisations, fewer and fewer bother to vote. 
<br></p><p><b><b>The free-speech conundrum</b>
</b><br>So, why not change things? Here Americans start to groan again, for a more surprising reason. They would love to see reform, but the constitution's first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, stands in the way. According to a Supreme Court ruling of 1976, political contributions may be limited (since they are open to corruption), but spending by a candidate or a party may not be, because this is free speech. This dotty rule--"limited" supply, unlimited demand--has done much to leave the campaign-finance system in ruins. Meanwhile, the fixation of candidates on television advertising, the single most costly element in their campaigns, gets more and more out of hand; but to restrict their demand to buy it, or the desire of broadcasters to sell it, is also seen as an unpardonable attack on the first amend ment. The result is paralysis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is ridiculous. Written constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten. They can, and should, accommodate reform. The first amendment, in general, is a great and good thing; there is much to be said for leaving it alone. In some ways, too, the spending of money must be implicitly protected along with speech. Politicians, like any advertisers, need to spend money to get their message out. Yet this does not mean that money spent on selling soap, and money spent to promote a candidate, should be considered the same. If the volume of messages from one soapseller squeezes out the message of all others, so that one soap prevails, this may be just the healthy interplay of market forces. But if quantity pushes out diversity in a political campaign, democracy is damaged. And the damage is all the greater when the price of that freedom is the brazen sale of influence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans might ask themselves why other democracies do not have the same problems with campaign finance. Certainly, many countries--Japan, Italy, France and Belgium, to name but four--have had far more severe episodes of political corruption (see <a href="sf0826.html">page</a>). But no developed country suffers a money chase, or voter disillusionment, on anything like the American scale. The reason is simple: most democracies put strict limits on candidates' spending and access to broadcasting. Indeed, in Britain, both candidates and parties are forbidden to buy television or radio time. Do Britons thereby feel gagged and deprived of their civil liberties? Not a bit of it. The past months have seen a perfect avalanche of debate, conducted by billboard and in the page of the press. 
<br></p><p><b><b>Living with limits</b>
</b><br>The choice is therefore clear. Americans can either wrap the first amendment in cotton wool, and retain their stinking campaign-finance system in its full glory; or they can dare to reopen the debate on what protection of free speech means, and try to improve matters. It is one or the other. There are people who argue--as this newspaper once did--that full disclosure in campaign spending is all that is needed to purify the system. This argument now looks inadequate. Virtually full disclosure in America has not yet discouraged determined givers, not least because of the inevitable lapse between the successful donation (the candidate elected, the bill passed) and the publication of the possibly shaming details. Certainly, disclosure should be speeded up, and penalties for overstepping the line should be made harsher. But, without curbing demand, where can such a line possibly be drawn? 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court's ruling that political spending is tantamount to speech is already being challenged in court; and limits on spending by candidates might indeed do something to puncture the endless spiral of fund-raising. But the lure of the small screen and the 30-second attack ads would remain as strong as ever. The problem of unbridled demand might therefore be better tackled by aiming directly at broadcasting. Here, it is clear that little bits of tinkering (such as requiring broadcasters to give slots of free time near the election) would have scarcely any effect. Once the first amendment is touched at all, reformers may as well think bolder. Why not, for example, impose strict limits--even a ban--on political advertising on television? American culture shudders, but logic cheers: the need for money would plummet. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, no system is perfect. Limits on advertising, for example, would still leave the partisan cable channels in place and ready to be exploited. Campaign-finance reform is a constantly moving target; any rules work only for a time, until lawyers and politicians discover how to break or ignore them. Relentless adjustment takes effort; human greed for power presses inexorably against it. Nonetheless, all large democracies try to curb spending, and some even succeed. They understand that fair democratic process and unbridled free speech cannot always live together. Will America come to understand that too?

<center><table width=65%><tr valign=top><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>The enemy within
</h2>In his state-of-the-union message to Congress, President Clinton said <b>America's greatest enemy </b>was "inaction", and accordingly called for action to balance the budget (spending will rise only slightly, to $1.69 trillion for fiscal 1998), reform campaign finance and welfare, and improve schools.
<p>More than a year after his acquittal in a criminal trial, a jury in a civil trial found <b>O.J. Simpson</b> responsible for the deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. He must pay $8.5m in compensatory damages; punitive damages, expected to be "gigantic", were yet to be assessed.
<p>In <b>Ecuador</b>, unions launched a general strike against President Abdala Bucaram's austerity policies, and demanded his resignation.
<p>Several days' fighting between <b>Colombian government troops </b>and <font size=-1>FARC</font> guerrillas only 50km from Bogota left at least 15 dead on each side.
<p>A new twist to <b>Mexico's</b> <b>soap opera</b>. The plot so far: (1) Raul Salinas, brother of ex-President Carlos, is accused of murdering a top politician in 1994. (2) A "psychic" helps police unearth the corpse on a ranch of Raul's; (3) it is the wrong man. (4) The main investigator is sacked, along with his boss, the (non-ruling-party) attorney-general.
<p>(5) The psychic is arrested and accused of planting the stiff. This week: the ex-investigator is accused of paying her to do so. Nonsense, he says; electoral flam, says his ex-boss.
<p>President Alberto Fujimori of <b>Peru</b> talked to Japan's prime minister in Toronto about the Lima hostages. He is trying to get talks moving with the Tupac Amaru guerrillas, but will not consider releasing their imprisoned comrades.
<p><h2>Israel in mourning
</h2>A day of national mourning was proclaimed in <b>Israel</b> after 73 soldiers and airmen were killed when two helicopters carrying troops into Lebanon collided. 
<p>Rebels in <b>Zaire</b> moved into the southern province of Shaba. A promised government counter-offensive failed to materialise.
<p>The<b> </b><font size=-1>UN</font> pulled out of the western region of Rwanda after four <b>human-rights monitors </b>were shot dead.
<p>At least 38 people were murdered in <b>Algeria</b>, bringing the number killed in political violence to over 300 since Ramadan began on January 10th.
<p><h2>Pressed rulers
</h2>Bulgaria's ruling Socialist Party caved in to demands for an <b>early election</b>, to be held in mid-April, after a month of protests and strikes.
<p>Serbia's president, <b>Slob</b><b>o</b><b>dan Milos</b><b>evic</b>, appeared to concede that the opposition had won elections to the councils of Serbia's biggest towns.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Rioting in <b>Albania</b> intensified in the unrest over collapsed pyramid schemes.
<p>Sweden's minority Social Democratic government said it would start shutting down <b>nuclear power plants</b>. 
<p>Switzerland's three biggest banks set up a SFr100m ($70m) fund to compensate <b>Holocaust victims</b> who deposited money in the country. America, Britain and France froze $68m-worth of gold stolen by the Nazis from European countries.
<p>France's president, Jacques Chirac, met his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, for a three-hour discussion about the <b>enlargement of NATO</b>. Mr Chirac then proposed a five-nation summit on European security in Paris.
<p><b>German unemployment </b> rose in January to 4.7m, the highest figure since Hitler took power in 1933. This represents about 12% of the workforce (11% in the west, 19% in the east).
<p>(See <a href="ww1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Luxembourgers </b>were richer than Americans in 1995. The <font size=-1>EU</font> members poorer than the Union average were Finns, Britons, Irish, Spaniards, Portuguese and Greeks.
<p>Marek Belka, an economist of liberal views and no party affiliation, replaced the irascible Grzegorz Kolodko as <b>Poland's finance minister</b>. He promised to overhaul the social-security system.
<p>Eurostat, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s statistical service, ruled in favour of accounting tricks adopted by Italy, France, Belgium, Spain and others, making it easier for them to qualify for <b>Europe's single currency </b>in 1999. Separate reports that Italy may be kept out of the first wave of entrants produced an angry response from Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, who insisted Italy would be in at the start.
<p><h2>Sharif's mandate
</h2>Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League had <b>an easy victory in Pakistan</b>'s general election, winning at least 134 seats in the 217-seat parliament, and crushing the party of Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister.
<p>Tensions between <b>Christians and Muslims </b>grew in the Philippines after a Roman Catholic bishop, Benjamin de Jesus, was shot dead in Jolo, a Muslim-dominated town in the south.
<p>The United States is considering reducing the number of its <b>troops in Asia</b>,<b> </b>at present 100,000, according to a report in Washington.
<p>Britain said it will grant citizenship to Indians, Pakistanis and other <b>minorities in Hong Kong</b> when the colony reverts to China in July. China has refused them Chinese citizenship.
<p><b>Australia </b>plans a "people's convention" to consider whether the country should become a republic, replacing Queen Elizabeth with an Australian head of state. Opinion polls suggest about half of voters want a republic.

<p><b>Alan Bond</b>, already in prison, was given a four-year sentence in Perth for his part in Australia's biggest corporate fraud. He pleaded guilty to charges related to a A$1 billion ($770m) unsecured loan from Bell Resources to prop up Bond Corp.
<p><b>Gold</b> prices, depressed by worries that European central banks will sell more gold to ensure governments meet criteria for economic and monetary union, recovered a little after Eurostat, a statistical agency, said that governments could not use proceeds from gold sales for that purpose--although they could be used to pay down public debt.

<p>America's <b>Goodyear Tire & Rubber</b>, the world's third-largest tyre maker, and Japan's <b>Sumitomo Rubber</b>, the fifth-largest, have agreed to make car tyres for each other in Asia and North America, beginning later this year. Up to 2m tyres per year will be produced up to the end of 2000.
<p><b>Sony</b> of Japan said group net profit nearly doubled in the third quarter and predicted record profits for the year ending March 31st. Sales of PlayStation, its video-game player, boosted operating income in its electronics unit. A weaker yen also helped.
<p>Japan and the European Union settled their long-standing row over discriminatory Japanese taxes on European spirits. <b>Taxes on whisky </b>and cognac will be 3% higher than Japan's home-grown <i>shochu</i> (the current gap is 500%); the 140% penalty on vodka and gin will disappear altogether.

<h1 align=left>A travesty of justice</h1>


<p><b>Why the second O.J.Simpson trial was not much better than the first</b><p>
AFTER the first triumphant volley of shouts from white onlookers, America has reacted in rather subdued fashion to the second Simpson verdict. Well it might. The second trial, which found the former football star "liable for the deaths" of his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman, was less about justice than about revenge. Because the first trial had produced a result that seemed to many ridiculous, the families of the victims tried it again another way. The result, from their point of view, was satisfactory; it has staunched their grief and made their lives more bearable. But was this second process any more just?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Simpson's first trial, on criminal charges, was a farce. The judge barely controlled his courtroom; examination and cross-examination rolled on interminably; witnesses played to the cameras; incriminating evidence, such as the car chase after the murder, was not admitted. Most notably, the judge allowed the defence to skew the case at issue from one of murder to one of racist conspiracy by the police; at which the jury, which was mostly black, decided to acquit Mr Simpson. Their decision was defensible; doubts had been introduced about the trustworthiness of the evidence, and criminal trials do not allow equivocation. Nonetheless, they delivered their verdict so quickly--after mere hours of deliberation--that it seemed to many that the verdict had nothing to do with justice, and everything to do with race.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On its face, the second trial was much more efficient (see <a href="am3224.html">page)</a>. As a civil process, its aims were more modest: to establish responsibility for the deaths and to set damages. It was conducted, by Hiroshi Fujisaki, with almost brutal dispatch. Cameras were banned. Mr Simpson was made to take the stand (where he did himself no good). The judge refused, from the start, to allow racist conspiracy theories to be aired in court, and so gave greater credence to bits of evidence--such as blood samples--that had been disputed in the previous trial. Yet since all this was so, and since the jury this time contained only one black, the verdict was not much in doubt at any point; this was the trial that would find Mr Simpson guilty. And the result is bizarre in the extreme: a man who is held to have killed two people is allowed to remain free.
<br></p><p><b><b>Keeping jeopardy single</b>
</b><br>America's constitution forbids double jeopardy: a man may not be tried twice for the same offence. Yet lawyers resist the notion of double jeopardy in the Simpson case. After all, they say, the first trial was criminal: the charge was murder, and Mr Simpson stood to lose his liberty and possibly his life. The second was civil: different charges, and only money, not freedom, at stake. Doubtless this makes a world of difference to lawyers, the main beneficiaries from any duplication of trials. But it is an unconvincing distinction. Mr Simpson was indeed on trial for the same offence, though dressed up in different words. The actions under discussion (knifing, near-decapitation) were the same; the evidence produced against him (clothing, blood) was largely the same. Indeed, where is the difference, except in the labelling and the penalties? 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is not the first such double-trial to have happened in America. The policemen who beat Rodney King, a black motorist, were also tried twice (the first time for beating, the second time for "depriving" Mr King of his civil rights), until the "right" verdict was reached, the one that found them guilty. It is becoming something of a habit, especially in trials that are hugely controversial and where race is a factor. The second trial may indeed seem an "improvement" on the first: more soberly conducted, in a less explosive atmosphere. But it is hard to believe that when trials are held again in a different place, with a differently balanced jury, the intent is to establish justice. Whatever the truth, such a process is inherently unjust. The intent, surely, is to correct the mess that was made the first time. Yet to avoid a mess the first time would be much the better--and more just--course.

<h1>Politicians for rent</h1>

<p><b>Campaigns and money are inextricably linked, nowhere more notoriously than in the United States. Is this pernicious? And has any country found a formula to keep campaign spending under control?</b></p>
<br>EVER since partisan appeals were chiselled into the walls of ancient Greece, election campaigns have cost money. And ever since the first political contribution changed hands, money has been used to influence the process of government. The lust for power and advantage is human nature. Democracy is supposed to restrain it. Elections demand fairness; when the tally is made, every vote counts equally. Yet before that, some people, using money, will always try to speak louder than others--and will often succeed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year in the United States, at least $660m was spent by candidates and parties in search of seats in the House or the Senate; estimates for spending in all elections exceed $3 billion (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). Michael Huffington spent $30m contesting a Senate seat in California in 1994. It has been calculated that, if the average Senate campaign now costs $4.5m, each senator must raise at least $14,000 every week of his or her six-year term to pay for it. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such costs are exceptional: the only other democracy in which candidates spend so much seeking office is Japan. True, not every American considers the sums outrageous. They are small compared with the advertising budgets of large companies (ten of which each spent over $1 billion on advertising last year). Nonetheless, most Americans are not flattered to have money of this order spent on getting their attention. On the contrary, they feel the present campaign-spending system is out of control. Politicians, many think, are spending most of their working hours raising funds for the next campaign; governing America is done in their spare time. The huge sums needed to run for office also raise the entry barrier into politics and confer unfair advantages on incumbents. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last set of reforms, passed in 1974 in the wake of Watergate (which itself began as a campaign-finance scandal), set limits on spending for congressional races and on individual donations; it made provision for public funding of presidential races, and set up the Federal Election Commission (<font size=-1>FEC</font>) to enforce the law. Since then, the system has been under steady attack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1976 the Supreme Court struck down spending limits, saying they infringed the constitutional right to free speech. In the 1988 campaign candidates discovered the delights of "soft money", funds that could be given without limit to parties for grass-roots "party building" and which, strange to say, found their way into general campaigning. The 1996 campaign marked the sudden multiplication of equally helpful "indepen dent" money from unions ($35m) or companies ($60m) which, be cause it did not advocate the election or defeat of individual candidates, could also be spent without limit to advance the cause. Not least, last year saw the funnelling of large amounts of foreign money, which is illegal, into the Democratic campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story is familiar. Campaign-finance reform is a constant game of catch-up. Matters get out of hand; some curb is introduced; candidates find a way round it, or break it; and a new curb is erected further down the street. In this, America is no exception: most countries set limits on the role money plays in elections and many political scandals have had some connection with campaign finance. These have ranged from the "money politics" that brought about the fall of the Liberal Democrats in Japan in 1993; to Belgium's extraordinary corruption-and-paedophilia scan dals; to the collapse of the old Italian political elite in 1992-94, in the wake of investigations by Milanese magistrates which showed corruption on a massive scale.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's problems are nothing like as bad as these; but all the same, in the new Congress, dozens of different clean-up bills are being introduced. Some are meant to tighten up laws that are being broken; others are meant to plug loopholes. And, on past experience, most are doomed. 
<br></p><p><b><b>How bad is it, really?</b>
</b><br>A basic question, which sometimes goes unasked, is why so much money is needed in American campaigns. The one-word answer is television. In Britain, parties may not buy television time and most political advertising goes on relatively cheap billboards. In America, with its television-hungry audience and huge electoral districts, candidates take to the airwaves to broadcast their message. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Television is not the only culprit. America is unusual in that its political parties play a relatively small role in financing candidates' campaigns. In European countries, party ma chines--often subsidised by the tax payer--bear much of the cost of an election. In America, candi dates have to raise most of the money themselves. Japan, the only other big democracy where campaign costs are comparable, is also the only other place where politicians have to run their own campaigns. Big national parties seem to offer economies of scale in campaigning which America (like Japan) does not capture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The explosion in costs also comes from the fees of political consultants, now considered essential to campaigns, and from fund-raising, a relentlessly rising spiral of lavishing money in order to raise more. What does the money go on? Broadcast time. Thirty-second attack ads must be answered by more thirty-second attack ads, whatever the cost. This suggests that candidates are not so much corrupt, as trapped: they dare not be outspent. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is this foolish? It is clear that even prodigious spending may not help a flawed candidate: Mr Huffington lost his race. The same thing can be seen abroad: in the 1993 general election in Canada, for example, the Conservatives were wiped out by the Liberals despite heavily outspending them. But more often than not, money helps. As a rule, incumbents in the United States enjoy a big money advantage over challengers (receiving four times as much in the 1996 elections as challengers) and, in almost every case, those who spend more win. Even in "revolutionary" 1994, over 90% of incumbents who sought re-election won and the overall Republican advantage lay mostly in higher spending. (The big change in Congress's composition that year came about because there was an unusually large number of open seats.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once candidates have won, moreover, money often goes on working; favour is repaid for favour. This is universal, and it could be argued that it is merely what "representation" means. Money some times buys votes. In Japan in 1991 (after the campaign-finance rules had been rewritten in the wake of the Recruit scandal), a steel-frame maker was found to have given &#165;80m ($600,000m) to a former cabinet minister in return for contracts. But even where money's influence falls short of this, it can still make politicians and voters disproportionately aware of the demands and interests of donors. In 1989 John Major, then Britain's chancellor, refused to consider a bill to require foreigners doing business in Britain to pay taxes on their earnings. There may have been no connection but the association was unfortunate: certain of these foreigners were big donors to the Tory party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans suspect a similar sort of quid pro quo in the case of the Asian contributions that flowed last year to the Democratic National Committee. They worry, too, when they read that Philip Morris, a tobacco company, makes large contributions to both Republicans and Democrats, who then (they think) show bipartisan softness towards the dangers of smoking. A study by Herbert Alexander of the University of Southern California showed that only 25% of congressmen's votes were directly influenced by donors to their campaigns: constituent interests and party ideology played a bigger part. But that 25% may well have included the most important issues the congressmen had to consider. 
<br></p><p><b><b>In search of clean money</b>
</b><br>Politics is not inevitably distorted by the money that washes around in campaigns. Yet too much emphasis on money can have a bad effect on ordinary citizens, convincing them that big interests rule the political process and that it is hardly worth voting. Those who cherish democracy should worry, and do worry, about that. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two main ways of regulating campaign finance: to limit supply (donations), or to limit demand (spending). If supply is limited but demand is mostly left alone, as in the United States, sheer pressure of demand will quickly find inventive (read questionable) means of supply. But if demand is limited, and not supply, as in Britain (where there is a limit of, on average, &#163;8,000, or $13,000, on what candidates may spend on their campaigns), voters may see no reason to get involved on any scale in helping political candidates. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contrast can be seen when people are asked their opinions about state financing. In the United States, although only 33% of taxpayers tick the box which asks 'do you want some of your tax dollars to help fund campaigns?', a narrow majority favours public financing for all races; they think the money would be "cleaner". (The same view prevails in most continental European countries, where the government finances political parties and often pays some of the costs of individual candidates' campaigns.) In Britain, however, 79% of the public are against state financing, not seeing why a pot of (their) money is needed at all. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where state financing exists, it is usually meant to level out financial disparities between parties. In Japan, Germany, France, Spain and Belgium, parties are given public money in proportion to the seats they hold in the legislature or the votes they have won. In Canada, parties and candidates are reimbursed for part of their election spending. The sums are not large, just a drop in the bucket of America's federal budget. But most American politicians feel that public money will never be enough to finance campaigns, especially when budgets are tight; and that the government should not be any deeper in the business of paying for elections anyway. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, state financing is no guarantee of democratic purity. Spain, Japan and Belgium have all come a cropper on campaign-finance scandals. Italy provides a poignant example. There, generous state financing of political parties contributed to the wholesale corruption that infected political and business life from the 1970s onwards. In 1993, after the collapse of the old elite in elections, Italians voted over whelmingly in a referendum to scrap state financing. Late last year, however, politicians of all stripes agreed to revert to it. If money had become an obsession even with state help, it was even more of an obsession without it. Against human greed, no system is immune.
<br>Tracking the big boys</b>
<br>What exists in all democracies, however, is the idea--however vaguely and cynically expressed--that donations to parties from ordinary citizens are preferable to those from the big, rich and powerful. Direct donations from companies are always treated with care. In Japan, individual candidates must receive nothing from them in cash or kind. In Belgium, donations from either companies or unions are forbidden; Germany bans union donations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the Germans reformed their campaign-finance system in 1982, they introduced a tax deduction for contributions in the hope of attracting small donors. When the Canadians reformed their system in 1974, they introduced a (more equitable) tax credit for the same purpose. Both countries reported huge increases in small donations to political parties. Could Americans see the same? There used to be a tax credit for small donations, but it disappeared in 1986. From time to time, someone will suggest increasing the donation box on the tax form. But the expansion of taxpayer financing seems to be a lost cause. However much the involvement of the little man is courted there, it is big groups, and big donations, which will always come out on top. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This much becomes clear from studying America's political action committees (<font size=-1>PAC</font>s). These developed after the 1974 reforms with the aim of replacing fat-cat donors with little people, who would bundle up their donations and have more influence than they could ever enjoy individually. There are now nearly 4,000 <font size=-1>PAC</font>s, and they contribute around one-third of all campaign receipts, twice as much as in 1978. Yet, far from being grass-roots groups, most have become the voice of special interests, representing business, labour, or trial lawyers (big donors to Democrats). For this reason, <font size=-1>PAC</font>s are much maligned. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, under present rules, <font size=-1>PAC</font>s at least disclose their spending, and may donate no more than a meagre $5,000 to each candidate (the limit on private donations in Spain is $80,000, while in Germany and Britain there is no limit at all). The real distortions in American campaign spending occur when companies and unions abandon <font size=-1>PAC</font>s and try a less accountable approach. They exert pressure on the fringes of campaigns, spending independently on, say, a last-minute television blitz, or donating money to parties for "issue-oriented advocacy", "good-faith efforts on matters of public policy", or any one of a number of fuzzy definitions. Almost all western democracies have such loopholes in their rules: through them, money cascades into election campaigns. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can anything be done about it? The most popular idea in America is that soft money and non-party spending should be banned, or treated in the same way as direct donations to candidates for cam paigns: in other words, they should be limited, and voters should be fully informed about the source and use of them. Voters dislike this sort of money not only because of its quantity, but because of the deception it implies; therefore, if limits are problematic on free-speech grounds (see <a href="sf2.gif">below</a>), at least remove the element of secrecy. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All western democracies have some sort of disclosure requirement for large donations, which must usually be listed and attributed in party accounts. The notable exception is Britain. British politicans (particularly Conservatives) contend that transparency puts donors off. There is something in this argument. In Canada, the Conservative Party noticed a decline in corporate donations after 1974, when disclosure was introduced.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is also true that disclosure, even of fairly small donations, has not avoided scandals in several Euro pean democracies. The problems there are the same as in America. First, although disclosure is quite comprehensive (even for donors of soft money), ways are always being devised to avoid it: independent spending by "non-parties" is merely the latest. Second, while the identities of donors may be disclosed, no-one knows either the use to which the donation was put, or whether the donor was seeking or had obtained a government contract. Third, the lists of donors (along with any mentions of infringements of the rules) are made public only after the cam paign is over, when the horse is safely past the post. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If disclosure is to inform voters about possibly unhealthy connec tions between business, unions and politicians, it needs to be both full and timely; and there should be penalties that hurt. In America, it usually takes several years before the poorly-financed <font size=-1>FEC</font> gets round to slapping the wrists (rarely more) of politicians who have broken the rules. An <font size=-1>FEC</font> with the power, say, to deprive candidates of their seats if these were obtained with illegal funds might be quite a deterrent. But it would hardly get government out of the business of regulating money in elections.
<br></p><p><b><b>Free spending, free speech</b>
</b><br>Enforcement of the rules is clearly a problem. Yet so too, sometimes, are the rules themselves. As explained above, tight caps on donations tend to encourage evasion. They also tend to favour incumbents. Some Americans now argue that the limits on individual and <font size=-1>PAC</font> donations should be raised: if candidates could get more cash that way, soft money would lose its lure, and everyone could spend less time on the arduous business of fund-raising. Yet any sort of cap on donations will work better if there is some concomitant limit on spending; and this is the most vexed area of all. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some western democracies restrict spending tightly; others put no limit on it. Britain, with some of the tightest rules on spending by candidates themselves, allows parties to spend what they like (television-time excepted) on national elections. Germany has toyed with voluntary spending limits (so did Bill Clinton in his state-of-the-union address), and the result is unsurprising: when it comes to the crunch, everyone breaks them. The difficulty is not just a desire to gain advantage; it is also the question (in America, a constitutional one) of whether political spending qualifies as free speech, which should not be restricted. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is clearly a lesser problem in countries where free speech is not enshrined in a bill of rights. Britons get more exercised about disclosure than about candidates' rights to express themselves. The Canadians did not worry until, in 1982, they adopted a charter of rights that included protection for free speech: at which Alberta promptly decided that it could not abide by federal limits on independent spending, and won its case.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the United States, the notion that campaign spending by both individuals and parties constitutes free speech has been upheld by the Supreme Court in <i>Buckley v Valeo</i> (1976). According to the ruling, spending may not be limited, except as a condition of receiving public financing; but curbs on contributions are acceptable to prevent corruption. In practice, a contribution expresses an opinion as clearly as spending does, which suggests that the logic of the ruling is strained. Nonetheless, the decision rules out mandatory limits on spending now or in future, unless it can be altered or reversed by a subsequent case or by constitutional amendment. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As usual, the Supreme Court was not unanimous. It can be argued that the decision, while ensuring unfettered free speech for those who can pay for it, limits the free speech of those who cannot. Yet, in a democracy, those voices (or at least those votes) are meant to be politically equal. Many legal scholars are now arguing that the spending of big money in elections violates the fifth and 14th amendments, which guarantee equal protection of the laws; some suspect that it may violate the first amendment, too. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Surveying the well-trampled field of campaign-finance reform in various democracies, Americans have certain questions to ask themselves. The first is whether they have too soon rejected the notion of public financing, and in particular the use of tax credits as incentives. The second is whether they are prepared to submit to, and pay for, the systems of full disclosure and enforcement that would be necessary if limits on giving, as well as spending, were largely swept aside.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the last is the most fundamental: whether, in the context of elections, free speech should be an unassailable priority, or whether questions of equity should also be considered. Elections, like any other contests, should not--indeed, can not--be made entirely fair. This may not mean, however, that govern ments should not try to make the process more open, more honest and, in the deepest sense of the word, more democratic.

<p><b>The Simpson verdict
<h1>If at first you don't succeed . . .</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>LOS ANGELES
</font><p>TWO and a half years after they were butchered, Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson may finally be allowed to rest. On the evening of February 4th, seconds after Bill Clinton finished his state-of-the-union message, the jury in O.J. Simpson's civil trial pronounced its verdict, ruling that Mr Simpson was liable for the deaths of both victims, and awarding the Goldman family $8.5m in compensation. The jury's verdicts were unanimous throughout; asked, during jury polling, if he agreed with his fellow jurors, one man almost yelled his response, giving a hint of the strength of the jury's feelings. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result gripped America to such an extent that the president's address was downgraded to second place by most news programmes. Some channels split their screens so that you could watch both events at once; others ignored Mr Clinton to focus on the closing act of the Simpson saga.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result of the world's most highly-publicised trial was made public by a kind of semaphore, thanks to the aversion to the media felt by the judge, Hiroshi Fujisaki. The court's proceedings were broadcast to a handful of journalists stationed in a prefabricated hut close to the courtroom. The journalists then held up pieces of paper inscribed with the jury's answers to a series of questions--a "Y" for yes in every case. The Goldmans emerged to loud cheers from the huge crowd around the courtroom, Mr Simpson to boos and cries of "killer". Mr Simpson, looking stoical despite it all, stopped off to buy ice cream on his way home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dominant feeling in Los Angeles seemed to be that the verdict was correct, although there were still divisions along racial lines. A <i>Los Angeles Times </i>poll conducted between January 29th and February 2nd found that 71% of whites thought that Mr Simpson was guilty of the killings, whereas only 10% of blacks thought so. The police chief, Willie Williams, reported a quieter night than usual after the verdict--everyone was glued to the television--but said that the police would be on full alert until at least the weekend. Daryl Gates, Mr Williams's predecessor, said what, for legal reasons, Mr Williams could not say: that the verdict was a vindication of the <font size=-1>LAPD</font>, which had come under suspicion of racism and planting evidence during the criminal trial.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The speed with which the verdict was produced was something of a surprise--though not as much of a surprise as the three-hour verdict in the first trial. The jury had had to go back to square one on January 31st when a juror was dismissed for failing to declare that her daughter worked for the city's prosecution department and a substitute had to be installed. The jury had asked for several pieces of lengthy testimony to be read back to them earlier on the 4th, suggesting that they were still deep in deliberation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why was Mr Simpson subjected to a second trial? And why did the second jury produce such a dramatically different verdict from the first? The "double jeopardy" clause of the American constitution protects people from being tried twice for the same crime; but the civil courts give plaintiffs another avenue of attack, provided they put a new gloss on the charges. The rules of civil courts are more plaintiff-friendly than the rules of criminal courts: the prosecution has to prove its case "on the balance of the evidence" rather than "beyond reasonable doubt", and a conviction requires a two-thirds majority rather than a unanimous verdict. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two other things may have tipped the balance against Mr Simpson. The first was that the trial took place in predominantly-white Santa Monica, the nearest court house to the scene of the crime, rather than in minority-dominated downtown. This meant that there was only one black on the original jury. The second was that Mr Simpson could not refuse to take the witness stand, as he had in the criminal trial; instead he made a botched attempt to pitch his personal charisma against solid evidence about his penchant for beating his wife and wearing Bruno Magli shoes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This verdict is not the end of the matter. The $8.5m is intended only to compensate the Goldman family for their loss. (The Browns refused to file for compensation because it would have involved the Simpson children testifying against their father.) The court reassembled on February 6th to consider the separate question of punitive damages, which could be even higher. Mr Simpson will try to protect as much of his wealth as possible, taking advantage of the fact that America's laws are notoriously generous to debtors and the courts have limited access to pension funds; and Fred Goldman, who is nothing if not tenacious, will have to harry him for his money in other courts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Simpson will be in court for other reasons, too. He faces a renewed battle for the custody of his two young children, which was restored to him late last year. He is also highly likely to appeal against the verdict, though he may find it difficult to come up with the $1m or so another case will cost. He can point out that the jury that delivered the verdict in this most race-charged of trials did not contain a single African-American. He can point out that the jury delivered its verdict with such passion that it seemed biased. Above all, he can point out that the judge refused to allow "far-fetched hypothesising" about the police and racist conspiracies, thereby ruling out of court the essence of the defence case in the criminal trial.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether or not Mr Simpson appeals, the sorry affair will continue to raise some troubling questions about race and justice in America. A black hero who was found not guilty by a mostly black jury has now been found "responsible" by a mostly white jury. On the other hand, a man who has been found responsible for butchering two people is being allowed to enjoy his freedom, if not his fortune. Justice this is not, either for Mr Simpson or the dead victims.

<b>LEXINGTON</B>
<h1>Al, Viktor and the Moscowrena</h1>

AL GORE'S Macarena joke, like the hair on the top of the vice-president's head, is wearing a bit thin. Audience after audience has seen him offer to do his Macarena demonstration and then, after a moment's motionless silence, ask if they want to see it again. It is the famously wooden Mr Gore's way of saying he is quite a fun fellow, really.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is not the only dance he has been working on. Since 1993 he has been practising a routine with an equally wooden partner, Russia's prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Officials call the half-yearly sessions (which alternate between America and Russia) the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, <font size=-1>GCC</font> for short, but we prefer to call them the Moscowrena. It is a delicate dance of small, often almost imperceptible steps, which are nevertheless designed to contribute to an impression of great move ment. Remarkably, this is turning into a hot number.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This week, Messrs Gore and Chernomyrdin began their eighth session, three days of talks in Washington to be followed by a joint trip to Chicago to hobnob with businessmen. What began at the behest of Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at their Vancouver summit four years ago as an effort to enhance co-operation in space and energy has mushroomed into a process with multiple committees, sub-committees and working groups. Much of its work is on what Mr Gore described last year as "highly complex, painstaking and technical questions"--in other words, the sort of things the vice-president really enjoys. It is often tedious stuff, but important for the development of Russia's democracy, its market economy and its relations with America. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the process works. It has been getting things done, with some 150 agreements hammered out so far. A few of these are eye-catching, such as the "megatons-to-megawatts" agreement to take weapons-grade plutonium out of Russian warheads, blend it down and send it to America to be made into reactor fuel. There is the agreement to use once-secret satellite data for environmental research, and the health-care co-operation that has contributed to a 60% drop in diphtheria cases in Russia. Collaboration on a space station (though threatened by delays on the Russian side) also occasionally makes headlines. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But much of the work involves nuts-and-bolts labour on things such as intellectual-property rights and bilateral investment rules. Subjects for co-operation range from timber stewardship in Russia's Far East to ways of promoting small businesses and providing Russian farmers with information on market conditions. A typical example of business is: "Transmittal memorandum for the final report of the <font size=-1>US</font>-Russia commercial tax dialogue"--not exactly thrilling, but essential for integrating the new Russia into the modern world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of late, the process has taken on added significance. Not only is this week's session a chance for the two recently re-elected governments to map out a shared agenda. With Mr Yeltsin often confined to bed, leaving greater day-to-day power to his prime minister, the Gore-Chernomyrdin dialogue also brings a "meta-benefit", as they babble in the White House. It becomes an important channel for discussing so-called "off-line issues", especially security matters. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, this week the vice-president and the prime minister were asked to prepare the agenda for the presidential summit planned, Mr Yeltsin's health permitting, for March (Mr Clinton's letter of invitation for Mr Yeltsin was delivered by Mr Gore to Mr Chernomyrdin at a security summit in Lisbon last December). The two men were also due to discuss strategic nuclear weapons reductions. Not least, they were to work on the delicate matter of <font size=-1>NATO</font> expansion into Central Europe, an idea Russia hates but which the western allies are committed to. Shortly before he ar rived in Washington Mr Chernomyrdin was busy huffing and puffing about <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s plans, telling the <i>Washington Post </i>that "developments in Russia could take an ominous turn" and calling hopefully for the conversion of <font size=-1>NATO</font> into a political rather than a military alliance. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complicates the Gore-Chernomyrdin footwork, and raises a question: is too much now expected of their dance? The strength of their effort has so far been in technical projects and in building trust. It would be a pity if this useful business were jeopardised by their involvement in contentious issues such as <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement. The Number Twos have shown that they can do valuable work, but perhaps for the sake of their worthy endeavours there are some subjects that ought to be left to their bosses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both Mr Gore and Mr Chernomyrdin, of course, aspire to being Number One eventually. They may therefore be tempted to exploit their networking as a rehearsal for greater diplomacy ahead, a preparation of their future special relationship. They might be flattered into thinking it a good idea to add a novel element--a dash of excitement--into their routine. They are in danger of forgetting the virtues (for the Gore-Chernomyrdin process) of dullness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is understandable. In Mr Chernomyrdin's case, dullness has already drastically dimmed his prospects of one day winning Russia's presidency. The former bureaucrat-boss of the Soviet gas industry may be superbly connected and (some believe) obscenely rich, but he utterly lacks the popular touch. His support has sunk to about 10% in the polls, where he is outclassed by the populist flair of Alexander Lebed (see <a href="eu6356.html">page</a>). The lively Mr Lebed mocks the prime minister for being "so inarticulate he needs a translator from Russian into Russian". 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gore, with his presence at a much-mocked fund-raising meeting at a Buddhist temple in California, has had a recent embarrassment of his own. He too is charismatically challenged, vulnerable to the emergence of a rival with star quality. The opportunity for some high-profile diplomacy through the Gore-Chernomyrdin process is oh-so tempting. But it is risky. The charm of the Moscowrena has been in its plodding pragmatism.

<h1>All change, or no change, in Pakistan?</h1>

<font size=1>ISLAMABAD
</font><p>MOST pundits had reckoned that the Pakistan Muslim League, led by Nawaz Sharif, would win the general election on February 3rd. But almost nobody had reckoned on the landslide that has left Mr Sharif's party controlling almost two-thirds of the seats in the 217-member National Assembly, while reducing the Pakistan People's Party, led by Benazir Bhutto, to just 19 seats--down from 86 at the previous election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last November, Miss Bhutto was sacked as prime minister, by order of the president. She had predicted that the subsequent election would be rigged against her and threatened not to accept the results. But, in the aftermath of defeat, Miss Bhutto took a more conciliatory line and said she would accept a role as leader of the parliamentary opposition. Miss Bhutto may have been chastened by the scale of her defeat, and will certainly be aware that international observers have not supported her charges of widespread electoral fraud. But the former prime minister also seems to be trying to be statesmanlike. She told a post-election press conference that opposition parties in Pakistan had fallen into the habit of using extra-parliamentary agitation to get their way. "Somebody has to take a decision to break this circle," she said. "I am breaking this circle." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will be the second time Mr Sharif has served as prime minister. His first term in office ended in 1993, when he was dismissed from power by the then president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Mr Sharif is sometimes called the "businessman prime minister", to distinguish him from Pakistan's traditional rulers, who have usually been large landowners. His family own the Ittefaq group, one of the country's largest industrial empires with stakes in steel, sugar and textiles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sharif's rise to power was at first nurtured by the powerful military establishment. His first political job was as finance minister in the province of Punjab, a job he took in 1981 during the dictatorship of General Zia ul Haq. Next he had two spells as chief minister of Punjab (in 1985 and 1988), also under the watchful eyes of the generals. After Miss Bhutto was sacked as prime minister for the first time in 1990, Mr Sharif took over. At the time, he was widely seen as the establishment's man. But in 1993 he too was sacked, amid accusations of corruption. This clash with the powers-that-be helped to change his image. He now has some populist, anti-establishment credentials. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will the second incarnation of Nawaz Sharif be any different from the first? The early signs are mildly encouraging. Mr Sharif has promised not to victimise the opposition--an unusually generous declaration for a Pakistani politician. He has also promised economic reforms. His victory has been widely welcomed by businessmen. Share prices rose by 7% in the two days before and after the election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Sharif will have difficulty satisfying the hopes of businessmen. Pakistan is in the midst of a demanding <font size=-1>IMF</font>-imposed fiscal diet. The new government will have to cut spending to keep its deficit down. So tax breaks for business (one of the hallmarks of Mr Sharif's previous tenure) will be out this year. He hopes in due course to reduce tax rates in order to lure more taxpayers into the net and raise revenues. Unfortunately, tax evasion is so rampant--in a population of 127m, only about 1m pay income tax--that simply lowering rates may not be enough to break the habit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The caretaker administration that is about to hand over power to Mr Sharif claims to have laid the basis for further privatisation. The hope is that once public-sector enterprises are privatised, the government will have enough money to pay off some of its debt, so that debt servicing, which is expected to eat up more than 36% of this year's budget spending, will become less of a burden. The idea makes sense, but foreign investors will be wary of a country where political uncertainty has been a perpetual problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That uncertainty will not go away. Mr Sharif faces a tricky situation in the economically powerful province of Sindh, where a restive ethnic party, the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, has gained enough seats to look for a role in government. He will also be working alongside President Farooq Leghari, who dismissed Miss Bhutto. The president's position has been strengthened by a Supreme Court verdict on January 29th, which upheld his decision to sack the Bhutto government. It is conceivable that future dis missal orders will be defended on the strength of that verdict.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A low turnout (below 38%) on election day has also weakened Mr Sharif's claim to a popular mandate. He has also, in earlier days, faced the sort of corruption accusations that haunted Miss Bhutto. Like many charges laid against the high and mighty in Pakistan, the accusations against Mr Sharif were never proven. But he will need to be wary of giving critics fresh ammunition for charges of wrongdoing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, Mr Sharif also has some things going for him. Miss Bhutto's apparent decision not to boycott the new parliament is helpful. If he is bold, and if he could win the support of enough independents to give him a two-thirds majority in parliament, Mr Sharif could repeal the dreaded eighth amendment to the constitution, which has allowed Pakistan's presidents to sack three prime ministers since 1990. That would remove a Sword of Damocles that hangs over--and sometimes chops off--the head of every elected government. The abolition of those presidential powers would also blunt the force of the recently created Council for Defence and National Security, headed by the president, which has given a formal political role to the country's most senior generals, for the first time since martial law was lifted. It is more likely, however, that Mr Sharif will want to conciliate the generals than to confront them.

<p><b>The Caribbean
<h1>A relic of empire</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD
</font><p>THE British Empire has taken its time dying. A generation or more after independence, 11 ex-British Caribbean coun tries still allow legal appeals to the "judicial committee" of Britain's Privy Council in London. They are not alone: among others, Mauritius and even New Zealand still do it. But now they have agreed to set up a Caribbean Court of Appeal, which will start work as soon as three of the 11 have passed the necessary constitutional amendments, maybe by the end of this year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Privy Council itself is an arcane bit of British flummery. But its judicial committee is for real, serving as a final court of appeal for remaining British colonies and some ex-colonies. The judges are usually British "law lords"--the top level--though a qualified judge from one of the countries concerned (there are three such judges in the Caribbean) may be asked to join them. Appeals are normally heard by five judges, who look not only at the laws of the relevant country but at precedents and opinion from other jurisdictions. In roughly one case in three, they overturn the decision of the local court. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Caribbean, the judicial committee rules on the interpretation of national constitutions as well as on civil and criminal cases. Why did Caribbean countries not set up their own supreme courts--or a joint one--years ago? One reason is that a link to a wider legal system is an asset. In a small island where everyone went to school with someone's cousin, it can be useful to refer decisions to outsiders. The Privy Council's services also come free (though not so the British lawyers who appear before it, or the cost of taking Caribbean ones to London).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why change? Plain national pride is one reason, but not the main one. The Privy Council has made itself unpopular by protecting convicted murderers. In 1993, it ruled that it would be "inhuman and degrading" to hang two Jamaicans who had spent 14 years on death row. At the time, it was thought to have fixed a five-year limit to the time from sentence to execution. Later decisions have lessened the permitted interval (to two years, as Caribbean lawyers read them; London ones are less sure just how far). 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jamaica, with only 2.5m people, had almost 1,000 murders last year. Murder is far less common elsewhere, but Caribbean politicians and voters are worried. There is a feeling that hanging would help--and that judges in Britain, which has far fewer murders and gave up hanging 30 years ago, are ill-placed to make rules on this issue for the Caribbean. The same goes for some other issues. Constitutional decisions, however based in law, are in practice political. Should they not be made on the spot? Granted, they then risk being politicised. The answer could be a joint supreme court. True, Caribbean societies are by no means all alike. Nor are they all united in brotherly love: local rivalries have been one reason that there is no joint court already, some countries preferring to have their controversial cases decided by far-off Britons than by their neighbours. Even "far off" is a vague term: from Belize, it can take longer to fly to Trinidad than to Britain. Even so, the feeling has grown that Caribbean judges will understand Caribbean issues better than ones in London.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet might the change bring worse law? It need not. Even those who prefer the current system accept that there are fine lawyers in the Caribbean, even if (as elsewhere) the best are not all judges. Solid guarantees of independence, and good pay, will be needed to attract the ablest to a new court. If, as some lawyers feel, an outside view would still be useful, the court--whose members will probably be picked by a regional body, not named by individual governments--could include a non-Caribbean judge. As for communications, the region's geography is what it is. But information technology makes it, in principle, almost as easy to refer to worldwide case law from St Lucia as from London. Fears of worse law look ill-founded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, though, do hopes of speedier law. Caribbean law is slow, even by lawyers' standards: Trinidad's chief justice, taking office in 1995, called it "not unusual" for criminal cases to take four years to pass through the magistrates' courts, or eight to the next level above. Then there may be a local appeal. Appeal to the Privy Council is merely the icing on a long-baked cake. Civil cases can take just as long. Trinidad's appeal court has got moving: last year it dealt with five times as many cases as in 1993. And a regional conference on legal delays was held in the Bahamas last month. But few expect any great acceleration of justice, Privy Council or no Privy Council.

<p><b>Russia
<h1>The emperor's new health</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>MOSCOW
</font><p>PEOPLE and politicians alike in Russia understand that a charade is being played out around President Boris Yeltsin. Statements about his health and his capacity to work bear no necessary relation to the truth. All one can be sure of is that he is an elderly man who has been desperately ill, who has had a big heart operation, and who is having trouble recovering. Probably, he can either work hard, or live longer, but not both.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The calculations are such, however, that few Russian politicians want to hasten Mr Yeltsin's exit. The main exception among them is Alexander Lebed, an ex-general who thinks he would win a snap election; and it is the fear that Mr Lebed is right that encourages others to cosset Mr Yeltsin nervously. If few privately expect the president to last the year, they will help him through as much of it as possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contingency plans being hatched for a post-Yeltsin era fall into two main groups. One group presumes that the current constitution would prevail: the president would step down, the country would be run for up to three months by the prime minister (currently Viktor Chernomyrdin) and a fresh election would be held. A second group of plans assumes the constitution could be changed or flouted. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lebed is the champion of the constitutional route. Sacked in October from his briefly held job as Mr Yeltsin's security adviser, he has been looking for friends and money, accepting invitations to travel abroad, and putting together a political party of sorts. He has stayed in the public eye. Opinion polls still rank him Russia's most trusted politician. His search for friends has yielded a mixed bunch. He remains thick with Alexander Korzhakov, Mr Yeltsin's sinister former bodyguard, whose expertise in bugs and slush-funds may still have its uses. He has also formed a mutual appreciation society with Alexander Lukashenka, Belarus's near-dictator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lebed's political party, the National Republican Party, is due for its first congress next month. Its main ingredient will be a movement of uncertain size called Honour and Motherland, made up of soldiers loyal from Mr Lebed's army days. It will have links with the Congress of Russian Communities, a party that backed Mr Lebed in the past; with Svyatoslav Fedorov, a businessman who took 1% of the vote in the first round of last year's presidential election (when Mr Lebed took 15%); and with the Democratic Party of Sergei Glaziev, a reformer-turned-nationalist who might run President Lebed's economic policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lebed has said he could foresee a tactical alliance with Grigory Yavlinsky, Russia's leading social democrat. But his biggest prize, which he is stalking with care, would be the Communist vote. To that end he has been matching criticism of the Communists' leader, Gennady Zyuganov, with expressions of sympathy and admiration for the party's rank and file. Current gossip does not credit Mr Lebed with much money. But if he looks like a winner when a presidential election approaches, he will doubtless raise quickly enough the $50m or so needed to run a national campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "stop Lebed" camp has only one plausible candidate for election: Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, a neo-Victorian mixture of reformer, paternalist and nationalist. He took 90% of the vote in Moscow in last year's mayoral election. He has forged alliances with the governors of a dozen of Russia's richer cities and regions, including Vladimir Yakovlev of St Petersburg and Boris Nemtsov of Nizhny Novgorod. He has started to speak out louder on national issues, taking up Russia's claim to the Ukrainian port of Sebastopol as his personal cause. He may well have his eye on the chair of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. By raising that job's profile, he would be able to project himself as a national figure while still hanging on to his Moscow fief.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is not much comfort in this for Mr Chernomyrdin. Once considered a natural successor to Mr Yeltsin, he has come to look like one of yesterday's men. He may have lost a few more votes last week with his smiling admission on television that he was fresh back from a hunting trip on which, with an entourage of helicopters, bulldozers and bodyguards, he had bagged a mother bear and two cubs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, he is a safe pair of hands. Were Mr Yeltsin to step down, and were Mr Chernomyrdin to step in, there might be moves in the Duma to extend his tenure beyond three months--perhaps to 18 months, or for the balance of the presidential term. 
<br></p><p><b><b>Odd ways out?</b>
</b><br>Any device expressly designed to deny Mr Lebed power would, however, make a lot of Russians angry. Some 11m voted for him in 1996. His ending of the Chechen war, and disenchantment with Mr Yeltsin, have probably brought him many more fans. The army adores him. If an election did not bring him to power, a putsch might do so instead. For that reason, another way of settling the succession to Mr Yeltsin might be to install a "state council", seats on which would be given to the half-dozen or so politicians too popular and powerful to be refused them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A final variant, floated seriously by one or two commentators, has been the re instatement of a tsar as "constitutional monarch". Plenty of Romanovs are available. But why turn to them? Though no one has said as much, the best man for the job would surely be Mr Yeltsin himself. After all, he is practically doing it already.

<p><b>The national lottery
<h1>Spend, spend</h1>

</b></p>GAMBLING mania got a new lease of life on February 5th, when the national lottery held its first mid-week draw. Camelot, which runs the business for the government, expects overall sales of lottery tickets to increase by up to 20% as a result of the new Wednesday ("Wins-day") event, lifting total revenues in 1997 above last year's &#163;5.2 billion, and raising more money for "good causes". Already, the lottery has far exceeded expectations at its launch in November 1994. As well as creating (so far) almost 600 millionaires, the lottery is having a perceptible effect on the economy and, increasingly, on the election campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The amount of money that the British spend on gambling has climbed. After rising to 1% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in the early 1970s, the proportion of national income gambled each year fell steadily to less than 0.6% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1993. Two years later, total spending on gambling had increased again to nearly 1% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Although it edged down in 1996, the sums gambled remained much higher than before the lottery. The lottery has hurt other gambling much less than had been thought, although the soccer pools, in particular, have lost some business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, an investment bank, the main losers from extra gambling were recreation and entertainment, which fell by 2.9% in 1995, confectionary (down 3.7%), and newspapers and books (down 3.2%); all this in a year when total consumption grew by 1.9%. The switch had a once-and-for-all effect on retail sales, depressing them by around 1% in 1995. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because lottery spending displaces other purchases, talk of the lottery spurring employment should be taken about as seriously as Mystic Meg's predictions of the winning numbers. A study for Camelot by the Henley Centre, an economic forecasting firm, found that by 1999 the lottery will have created, or preserved, some 109,000 jobs that otherwise would not have existed. But these are likely to be more or less cancelled out by job losses in firms that earn less than they would have done if there were no lottery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many expected the lottery to deal a severe blow to charities. It was feared that people would regard buying a lottery ticket as all the giving they need do, since 6% of the price of a ticket goes to charity. On February 2nd Barclays Bank reported that individual charitable donations have fallen since the launch of the lottery. However, the total income of charities--which includes government payments and business revenues--has continued to grow since 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the lottery is channelling money from the regions to London, which gets a disproportionately large slice of the 28% of each lottery ticket that goes to fund "good causes". And there is a similar shift from poor areas to richer ones, says Luke Fitzherbert, author of the forthcoming "1997 National Lottery Year Book". This is on top of another bias to the rich: although weekly spending on the lottery by poorer households tends to be less than by richer ones, it accounts for a larger slice of their income.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Any qualms politicians may have about such a regressive, albeit voluntary, method of raising money have been forgotten in the rush to spend the cash. Or, at least, to promise to spend it. Of the &#163;3 billion raised (and, mostly, allocated) for good causes, only &#163;595m has left the Treasury's bank account, where it earns interest for the government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Office for National Statistics insists that lottery spending is treated as public spending, but the government refuses to include it in its target for cutting public spending as a proportion of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Thus, promising to spend lottery cash offers a simple way for politicians to evade their self-imposed tax-and-spend strictures. The Tories have already pledged lottery cash to improve British sport and film-making, and Labour has promised to use the money for, among other things, the arts, information-technology training for teachers and an energy-efficiency programme. So much for the government's promise that lottery money would not be used as a substitute for public spending.

<h1>Political football</h1>

JOHN MAJOR and Tony Blair, along with much of the British public, this week showed themselves to be card-carrying Eurosceptics, at least when it comes to soccer. On February 1st came news that <font size=-1>UEFA</font>, the body which runs European soccer, had backed Germany's bid to host the World Cup in 2006. This seemed to kill a rival bid from England, and sent the tabloid press into a frenzy of Europe-bashing, with particular refer ence to Germany. Since a general election is imminent, the politicians lost no time. "We must halt this outrage," thundered Mr Major in an article in the <i>Sun</i>. Alongside was a piece by Mr Blair: a "cosy stitch-up", he fumed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Football Association (<font size=-1>FA</font>), which runs the game in England, decided to apply for the 2006 World Cup after it hosted last summer's Euro 96 tournament. That event went surprisingly well. England reached the semi-finals, losing on penalties to Germany. And the English fans, noted for their brutality, rioted just once.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>FA</font> said that it had not realised that <font size=-1>UEFA</font> was backing Germany (which had tabled its bid years ago) until a fax to that effect arrived on January 31st. <font size=-1>UEFA</font> claims that an <font size=-1>FA</font> representative at tended the meetings when the choice was made--although, oddly, the deci sion had not been re corded in the minutes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bids for the 2006 tournament do not have to be submitted to <font size=-1>FIFA</font>, soccer's worldwide governing body, until September 1999. So what was <font size=-1>UEFA</font> doing making its mind up this early? The official explanation is that, by backing one country early, <font size=-1>UEFA</font> would avoid a costly and embarrassing bid ding-war between regional neighbours, of the kind that took place between Japan and South Korea for the 2002 World Cup. Between them, those countries are said to have spent well over $100m on the bidding before <font size=-1>FIFA</font> decided that the two should co-host the event.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More cynical observers link Germany's good fortune to murky machinations designed to help Lennart Johansson, a Swede who runs <font size=-1>UEFA</font>, become boss of <font size=-1>FIFA</font>. Rumour has it that Mr Johansson persuaded his colleagues at <font size=-1>UEFA</font>, who had doubted the ability of English fans to behave themselves, to let England host Euro 96. But this was supposedly on the understanding that the <font size=-1>FA</font> would in turn agree to support Germany's bid for the World Cup in 2006.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>FA</font>, this rumour has it, broke the gentle men's agreement when it realised that <font size=-1>FIFA</font> may start to rotate the World Cup among four geo graphical areas. This could mean that, if Germany gets the tournament in 2006, football might not come home again to England, where modern soccer was invented, before 2022.

<p><b>London Underground
<h1>Down the tube</h1>

</b></p>WHEN John Major singled out London Underground as a candidate for privatisation at last year's Tory party conference, it was inevitable that the idea would become the subject of election knockabout. The fun and games began last week with the leak of confidential cabinet documents warning that a rushed sale might raise only &#163;600m compared with a capital asset value estimated at &#163;13 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour was quick to denounce the planned sell-off as political larceny. It claimed that privatisation would do nothing to improve the lot of the system's long-suffering customers, some 1.6m of them each day. A new Labour government, said Tony Blair on February 4th, would keep the Underground in public control. Two days later the government took fright, shelving plans to announce the sale.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Behind the shouting is a recognition by both parties that something has to change. Decades of under-investment have left the tube with much signalling, track and rolling stock dating back to the 1930s. The result has been a growing incidence of equipment failures. Two months ago, a faulty control valve in a 91-year-old power station trapped more than 20,000 people for up to two hours. It was the tube's third big power failure in the past three years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;London Transport, the state-owned company which manages the under ground, now says that at least &#163;1.2 billion is needed to modernise the tube and make up for past neglect. But how can this best be done? The record of public ownership hardly inspires confidence. Successive governments have constantly changed their minds about how much new investment to put into the system. The Tories have been especially erratic over the past few years (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>), making long-range planning impossible. Industrial relations have also been fraught, with drivers frequently threatening to strike. After a critical report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (<font size=-1>MMC</font>) in 1991, investment rose sharply, but it has now once again been cut. The position has been aggravated by a &#163;300m cost over-run on the new Jubilee line extension. This will mean even less money to maintain and upgrade the tube's existing network over the next two years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For all its problems, the tube is hardly a basket-case. Carrying 780m passengers a year, it has an annual turnover of &#163;770m. Its passenger numbers are projected to grow by 20% by 2010. Fares already cover the costs of operation and maintenance. But there is little leeway. Fares in London are 20% more expensive than in Paris and Berlin, 30% more than in Toronto and 36% more than in Sydney and Amsterdam. Since the 1991 <font size=-1>MMC</font> report, performance has improved and a workforce of 22,000 has been reduced by a quarter. A study of the five biggest underground systems in the world in 1995 found that the London tube compared well in operating costs with the other systems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Privatisation is certainly worth thinking about. Unfortunately, thinking is something the government has little time for at the moment. How would it be done? A rushed sale would almost certainly mean that the system would have to be sold at a substantial discount to its potential value. Three approaches are currently under consideration. A single complete sale to a private bidder; selling individual lines to different bidders; and splitting ownership of the track from its operation, which would then be franchised to different private companies. The last option, similar to the way British Rail was privatised, is the front runner, and probably makes the most sense. But such a privatisation will be complicated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A franchised tube would require strict regulation to ensure that the public interest was safeguarded. Prices and conditions would have to be negotiated for the franchisees. New ticketing systems would have to be installed. The government has barely begun to examine such issues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's alternative looks equally half-baked. The notion that large amounts of private capital can be attracted to publicly-owned, inherently loss-making urban transport systems is either naive or dishonest. The private finance initiative, as the current government has found with the much-delayed new rolling stock on the Northern Line, cannot be relied on to fill the gap left by a lack of public investment. A publicly-owned underground requires long-term, consistent government funding. If Labour is either unwilling or unable to meet that commitment, it too may have to consider some form of privatisation.

<h1>Shared misery</h1>

GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, turned down a likely pay rise this week. On February 4th he announced that the pay of ministers, <font size=-1>MP</font>s, senior civil servants, judges and military top brass would be frozen during the first year of a Labour government. Currently, the prime minister's salary is planned to rise next year by &#163;41,000, to &#163;143,000, and a cabinet minister's (ie, Mr Brown's if Labour wins) by &#163;16,000, to &#163;103,000. This pledge pre-empted the cabinet's response on February 6th to new recommendations by the Senior Salaries Review Body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Brown hopes that his pay freeze will embarrass the Tories now, and help him to control public pay later if Labour wins power. The Tories have frozen the public-sector pay bill in recent years, and pressure for big increases has been building. Public-sector unions deny that they expect generosity from a Labour government, but they may change their minds once victory is secured. Mr Brown hopes to lower expectations and to curb resentment over small pay settlements by showing that the whole public sector, from top to bottom, is in the same position.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An admirable sentiment, no doubt, but the fact is that the case for a sharp increase in pay at the top is much stronger than the case for an across-the-board rise. As our (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>) chart shows, pay in the public sector as a whole has increased since 1979 by about as much as pay in the private sector. And in four of the past six years it has grown faster, according to Chris Trinder, an economist at <font size=-1>CIPFA</font> (a body for public-sector financial professionals).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pay of a backbench <font size=-1>MP</font> has risen by slightly less than the public-or private-sector averages, and that of a high-court judge by a little more. The pay for top civil servants has mostly risen by less than the average, except in a few cases. Most striking of all, the salary of the prime minister has increased by much less than the average. You could argue that the supply of would-be prime ministers greatly exceeds the number of available posts, in which case the pay for that job could stand to fall a good deal further, relatively speaking. But this may be less true of top civil servants. The public sector needs to have able people in charge. If Mr Brown starts a new exodus to the private sector, he might come to regret it.

<p><b>Accountability
<h1>Covering up</h1>

</b></p>"THE adjudication officer has de cided you are not entitled to a payment. This is for the following reason. The adjudication officer has decided that we cannot pay you." This is what the government's benefits agency told an aggrieved claimant recently, according to "Short Changed", a report by the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux on how the agency is coping (or failing to cope) with cuts in its budget. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you encounter such boneheadedness, who are you supposed to complain to? Who is to be held accountable? If an <font size=-1>MP</font> wanted to find out, he would be expected to write to the chief executive of the agency, who would in turn reply. The chief executive could even be summoned to answer questions before a parliamentary select committee. However, and this is the point, he would not give evidence on his own account, but under the instructions of his minister. Suppose the chief executive thought the problem was lack of staff: his minister could forbid him to say so. The minister could even tell him to refuse to answer the committee's questions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Things will improve if a Commons debate on February 12th backs a parliamentary resolution designed to provide more accountability. It has been negotiated by Roger Freeman, the public services minister, and the Commons select committee on public service. The latest draft says that "ministers should require civil servants who give evidence before select committees on their behalf and under their directions to be as helpful as possible in providing full and accurate information."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The good news is that a minister who ordered civil servants to conceal embarrassing facts would be directly contravening a requirement of Parliament, a grave offence. The bad news is that the resolution still requires civil servants to give evidence under ministerial direction, rather than to tell the truth as they see it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liberal Democrat <font size=-1>MP</font>s have argued for going further. They want to make agency chiefs directly answerable to Parliament. Giles Radice, the Labour chairman of the committee, sympathises, but is willing to accept a fudge. And a fudge is the best the government will offer. Mr Freeman be lieves that if agency chiefs were to give evidence in their own name, ministers would come to appoint only political trustees--people who could be relied on to hide the inadequacies of their political masters without being explicitly told to. Privately, agency chiefs respond to this argument scathingly. In public, they toe the line.

<h1>Webbed flight</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font><p>AS THE skies across the Pacific grow thick with airlines vying to carry Japan's well-heeled travellers, the need to trim costs--without customers noticing--is becoming the hottest topic on the tarmac. Japan Airlines (<font size=-1>JAL</font>)--the <i>grande </i><i>dame</i> of Asian airlines--has had more to trim than most. Since early 1994, <font size=-1>JAL</font> has axed a surprising &#165;100 billion ($820m) a year off its fixed expenses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One result is that savings are becoming harder to find. But <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s procurement department has had a good idea. Since February 1st the airline has been using the Internet to track down cheaper suppliers abroad.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The initial target is the &#165;6 billion a year that the airline spends on in-flight consumables--such things as waste bags, plastic cups and head-rest covers that are used once during a flight and then discarded on landing. The airline buys 17m paper towels a year, 8m plastic cups, another 8m paper napkins and more than 2m airsick bags. Such items cannot be bought off-the-shelf at a local supermarket. All have to be made to the carrier's own specification and come complete with its corporate logo.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, <font size=-1>JAL</font> buys some 1,200 different items from a host of high-price suppliers located in Tokyo and Yokohama, close to <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s operational centre at Haneda airport. But there is no reason why many of these goods could not be bought from foreign suppliers at <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s destinations abroad. At present, all in-flight consumables for the airline's return flights from overseas have to be carted expensively on its outbound flights. <font size=-1>JAL</font> has 72 flights a day to Hawaii alone, each loaded with objects that could be made in Honolulu.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By adding a special procurement section to the company's web-site on the Internet (<a href="http://www.jal.co.jp">http://www.jal.co.jp</a>), the airline now hopes to attract the attention of more competitive suppliers elsewhere in the world. The procurement department's web-page list items--along with full specifications, photographs and engi neering drawings--that it wants foreign suppliers to bid on. The web-site even provides on-screen application forms so that would-be suppliers can submit their quotes electronically. Initially, 15 of the carrier's most urgently needed items are being put up for Internet tender. More will be added each month.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Japan, <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s home page is the second busiest web-site on the Internet, with more than 60,000 separate requests for information a day. (<i>Asahi Shimbun</i>, one of Japan's largest daily newspapers, gets 70,000 requests a day.) Through it, customers can reserve seats on domestic flights, check arrival times and even buy goods from the airline's mail-order catalogue. The next job is to put <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s ticketless travel service--which accounted for 10% of domestic sales last year--on the Internet as well. The cost of selling tickets could eventually fall by 70% or more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s domestic suppliers face a nasty shock. <font size=-1>JAL</font> will be delighted if foreign firms find they can undercut Japanese suppliers who provide the kit for the airline's outbound flights as well. The carrier is betting that fear of losing some of their domestic contracts will work wonders with local suppliers. Suddenly, a wholesale lowering of <font size=-1>JAL</font>'s in-flight costs is in the air.

<h1>Crosswired</h1>

TOGETHER, Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe represent the closest thing the young Internet publishing industry has to a Citizen Kane. Five years ago they launched <i>Wired</i>, which has evolved from the hip bible of the Internet generation to an advertisement-packed lifestyle magazine for the pretentious technophile. On-line, their HotWired network proffers everything from politics to cocktail recipes. Off-line, they run a book publisher and are dabbling in television. The couple even named their first son, born on January 28th, Orson. No wonder that the fortunes of their Wired Ventures are so keenly watched: as it goes, so may go the entire "new media" industry.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bad news, then, from this digital San Simeon. Wired Ventures an nounced on February 4th that it is closing its British edition after two money-losing years. Wired had hoped to raise up to $75m in a stockmarket offering last year, which would have supported the British version, and allowed it to launch four other regional editions and bankroll other ventures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the market rejected its offers (the first valuing the firm at $447m; the second at a more humble $293m) as too dear, especially for a company that is at least half a traditional paper-and-ink pub lisher with correspondingly modest growth prospects. A subsequent round of private investments raised a mere $21.5m, and Wired's atttempt to find a partner for the British <i>Wired </i>(approaching, among others, <i>The Economist</i>) ultimately failed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Disappointing as the setback is, it hardly points to the coming death of new media. Wired's big problem is not that many of its ventures are losing money. Most new magazines lose money for a few years, and the Internet publishing market is still in its infancy. Rather, it has found it impossible to raise money as quickly as the market opportunity and the strength of its competition require. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two other big on-line publishers are Microsoft (in the form of both the software firm's own <font size=-1>MSN</font> network and its <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> joint venture with <font size=-1>NBC</font>, the television network) and <font size=-1>C/NET</font>, a start-up much like Wired itself. Microsoft has $9 billion in cash, a sizeable fraction of which it is willing to blow on Internet media ventures in the hope of getting one right. <font size=-1>C/NET</font>, which is more of a pure on-line publisher than Wired, had the good fortune to catch the tail end of a bull market for Internet offerings in early 1996; the firm, whose revenues are about one-third of Wired's, is now valued at nearly $370m, despite losing more than $16m last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, Wired must live on the modest amount it has already raised and any earnings it can muster. Mr Rossetto says that he is not looking for more investors, and is instead counting on <i>Wired</i> to become profitable this year and start pumping out enough cash to support HotWired (which was losing more than $3m a quarter when Wired last disclosed its finances). This rules out more traditional magazines and regional editions: paper and ink are more expensive than electronic digits. But Mr Rossetto says that Wired's growth plans for HotWired are unchanged. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, Microsoft will probably spend up to ten times as much on-line as Wired over the next three years. Up to now, Wired's on-line efforts have been creative, if uneven. Who knows what it might have done if it had caught the market in better mood?

In the case of personal computers (<font size=-1>PC</font>s) that component was, until a few years ago, the part that does the number-crunching upon which a <font size=-1>PC</font> relies to perform its miracles--its microprocessor. Recently, though, the slowcoach microprocessor has not only caught up, it is threatening to steam out of sight. Chips such as Intel's Pentium Pro and Motorola's Power<font size=-1>PC</font> now run so fast that everything else has to struggle to stay abreast of them. And when the Pentium's successor, the <font size=-1>P7</font>, is introduced in a year's time, the situation will be even worse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new laggards are what were once among the swiftest parts of a <font size=-1>PC</font>--the <font size=-1>DRAM</font> (dynamic random-access memory) chips that store instructions and data temporarily while calculations are under way in the microprocessor. The problem is not the chips' capacity, which has grown enor mously, but the speed at which information can be stored and retrieved from them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>DRAM</font>s use a design that can trace its origins back to what is, by computing standards, the pre-Cambrian: the first such chips were turned out by Intel in 1971. Then, they had but a single kilobit of memory--being able to store a mere 1,024 of the binary digits ("bits") that are the currency in which computing is carried out. Now they can hold as much as 64 megabits--over 65,000 times as much.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Intel has its way, however, that will be the end of the line for the traditional <font size=-1>DRAM</font>. The company, which dropped out of the <font size=-1>DRAM</font> business in the mid-1980s to concentrate on its microprocessors, is planning to team up with Rambus, a small chip shop based in Mountain View, California. Together, they hope to shake up the computer-memory industry. For Rambus has redesigned a critical part of the <font size=-1>DRAM</font>--the way it talks to the outside world. And from 1999 onwards, Intel's microprocessors will be configured to work solely with a derivative of Rambus's radical makeover.
<br></p><p><b><b>Don't miss the bus</b>
</b><br>The trouble with the current <font size=-1>DRAM</font> is that a simple design has become too compli cated. Its great attraction is that, unlike other types of memory device, such as the lightning-fast but hugely expensive static-<font size=-1>RAM</font>, dynamic-<font size=-1>RAM</font> uses only one tiny transistor per memory cell. As each of those cells stores one bit, it requires a mere 65m or so of them for its latest incarnation. Non-<font size=-1>DRAM</font> memories of similar capacity would require hundreds of millions of transistors. That makes <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s cheap to produce.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But with more than 65m cells on a chip, the channels needed to store or retrieve a piece of data have become a rats' nest of connections--creating all manner of interference, timing and noise problems. This "signal skew" is now the bane of those <font size=-1>DRAM</font> designers who are seeking ever higher retrieval speeds, because it limits the volume of data that can be shuffled in and out of the chip.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The amount of data being moved around this way is usually measured in "bytes". Eight bits make a byte--a computing "word" that is big enough to store a single letter of the alphabet. To transmit more data in a given amount of time, a channel can be made bigger--so that more bytes of data are sent simultaneously ("wider words" in geek-speak). Or each word can be sent through it in quicker succession ("faster clocking").
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In trying to make their <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s slicker, chip designers have tended to favour the wider-word approach, increasing the traditional word size from one byte to as much as eight bytes. The Rambus chip takes a different approach. Its designers have changed the chip's layout in order to solve the signal-skew problem. They have re placed the tangled web of signalling lines by a simpler arrangement known as a "bus" in which all the leads are parallel, the same length and short. Then, having simplified the wiring, they have been able to go for faster clocking, rather than wider words.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, instead of sesquipedalian eight-byte words, terse, single-byte monosyllables are the order of the day. But they are squirted along at the rate of 600m a second. And Geoff Tate, Rambus's boss, reckons this number will grow by 200m a year for the foreseeable future as computers' internal clocks (which control it) are made to tick faster. Also, the rate at which data are moved in and out of a Rambus chip can be doubled by adding a second bus to the arrangement. This will allow the Rambus design to meet Intel's target of shifting 1,600 megabytes of data a second by 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel has opted for the Rambus architecture because it has been proved in practice. Early versions of Rambus <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s are already used in such advanced computers as the Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation and the Nintendo 64 video-game player, both of which need to process realistic <font size=-1>3-D</font> graphics at high speed. Indeed, some $400m-worth of these first-generation Rambus chips have already been shipped by licence-holding manufacturers such as <font size=-1>NEC</font> and Toshiba in Japan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The desire to bring such graphic capability to general-purpose <font size=-1>PC</font>s is the main reason for Intel's decision to abandon traditional <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s. The mere act of "refreshing" a <font size=-1>PC</font>'s screen when it is running software with lots of <font size=-1>3-D</font> graphics can require crunching up to 500 megabytes of data a second. This means that a third of Intel's performance target will be needed just to run the screen. And that is before <font size=-1>PC</font>s start being equipped to play digital-video-discs--the much-vaunted replacements for the <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>. Decompressing and presenting the two and a half hours of full-motion video that these new discs can carry will put an even greater strain on a <font size=-1>PC</font>'s short-term memory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By anointing the Rambus design, Intel has caused consternation among traditional memory-chip makers. They have been trying to hammer out a new <font size=-1>DRAM</font> standard known as SyncLink. This aims to hit Intel's target with a design that allows a microprocessor to talk to the memory cells by means of two specially tuned buses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, though, they have been out flanked. Intel has decided it prefers Rambus's real design to SyncLink's "paper chip". So, since Intel's microprocessors are used in over 90% of the <font size=-1>PC</font>s sold around the world, <font size=-1>DRAM</font> makers everywhere will have to take out Rambus licences if they want to stay in the business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which should please Rambus's founders. Even with a royalty of as little as 1.5% of the value of each chip made by its licence holders, the company is going to be coining it. Some 2.5 billion <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s were sold last year at an average price of $6 apiece. Within a few years, Rambus could be collecting $100m-150m a year in royalties just for coming up with the right <font size=-1>DRAM</font> architecture at the right time.<b> </b>In the computing industry even seven-stone weak lings can become superheroes overnight.

<h1>Richard Casement internship</h1>

<xpara>We invite applications for the 1997 <b>Richard Casement internship</b>. It is for a young (under 24) would-be journalist to spend three months of the summer on the newspaper, writing about science and technology. Our aim is more to discover writing talent in a science student than scientific aptitude in a budding journalist. Applicants should write a letter introducing themselves (and indicating how they can be reached by post and by telephone), along with an original article of about 600 words which they think could appear in the Science and Technology section. They should be prepared, if requested, to come for an interview in London or Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, this April, at their expense. Applications must reach us by March 7th and should be posted to: The business affairs editor, The Economist, 25 St James's Street, London <font size=-1>SW1A </font><font size=-1>1HG</font>, or e-mailed to <a href="mailto:casement@economist.com">casement@economist.com</a>

<p><b>The Internet
<h1>Postel disputes</h1>

</b></p>GOD, at least in the West, is often represented as a man with a flowing beard and sandals. Users of the Internet might be forgiven for feeling that nature is imitating art--for if the Net does have a god he is probably Jon Postel, a man who matches that description to a <font size=-1>T</font>. Mr Postel's claim to cyber-divinity, besides his appearance, is that he is the chairman--and in effect the sole member--of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the organisation that co-ordinates almost all Internet addresses. But unlike God's, Mr Postel's influence over the Internet, though considerable, does not stretch as far as omnipotence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment he and his colleagues at the Internet Ad Hoc Committee, or <font size=-1>IAHC</font>, have a dispute on their collective plate that goes to the heart of the Internet. The problem is to do with its domain-name system (<font size=-1>DNS</font>). This is the way that numerical addresses are translated into human-friendly "domain names" (199.173.162.110, for example, becomes www.economist.com).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the heart of the <font size=-1>DNS</font> are ten computers known as root domain-name-servers. These hold the translations between numerical addresses and domain names, about which they supply information to less important domain-name-servers. These, in turn, pass it on to the still less important name-servers that most Net surfers use. Handing out the domain names has been a monopoly--with good reason. By having a single authority, the duplication of names (and thus chaos) is avoided. But monopoly brings a risk of abuse, and the outfit which holds that monopoly--the Inter<font size=-1>NIC</font> division of Network Solutions, a company based in Herndon, Virginia--has suffered that accusation from many users. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since it started charging for domain names in 1995, Inter<font size=-1>NIC</font> has become an object of derision on the Net. In 1996, it sent out bills for $20m--far more than many think its services are worth. To get around this, Mr Postel proposed creating several dozen new top-level domains (such as .firm and .inc to accompany the familiar .com for businesses). These would be controlled by new domain registries that would compete with each other and with Inter<font size=-1>NIC</font>. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His plan has proved unpopular. The <font size=-1>IAHC</font> formally proposed a modified version of it towards the end of 1996. It has received 4,000 sets of comments on these proposals in less than three months, and many of them are negative. Several organisations felt they might be compelled to register themselves under new domain names as well as existing ones--if only to avoid the activities of charlatans who might otherwise masquerade as them. And .com addresses, which are steeped in Internet history, may remain more attractive and prestigious than .firm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possible remedy for this would be to treat domain names like aircraft seats. Just as more than one travel agent sells places on the same flight, many firms would be allowed to sell domain names that were stored on the same database. If a name were registered by one firm, it could not be used by another. This would bring the advantages of competition without complicating the <font size=-1>DNS</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>IAHC</font>, however, seems to have rejected this possibility. It delivered its report on February 5th. The committee has chosen a halfway-house solution: introducing seven new "shared" domains, including .firm, .arts and .store. However, the prestigious .com domain will, at least initially, be left under Inter<font size=-1>NIC</font>'s control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, some opportunists have already seen the dollar signs in Mr Postel's original suggestions and have set up their own top-level domains. Two such firms are Alternic, a company in Washington state, and New York-based Name.space. Both organisations have, for example, intro duced .xxx and .sex domains.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sort of action could be troublesome. Unlike the more decentralised parts of the Internet, the <font size=-1>DNS</font> needs to operate as a hierarchy. Corrupt domain informa tion--like two computers both claiming to be www.economist.com--would leave Net users unable to access many resources.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And there is a more subtle threat. Because neither Alternic nor Name.space control a root domain-name-server, most users will be denied access to these new top-level domains, thus losing one of the Net's main points--its ubiquity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But perhaps the main lesson for the Internet is that it is time to abandon amateurism. For all their expertise, neither Mr Postel nor most of the members of the <font size=-1>IAHC</font> have the resources (nor, indeed, the mandate) to dictate the Net's future course. Many are volunteers with full-time jobs. This was fine when the Net was largely an academic tool. Now, though, it is commercial. And commerce needs the service of professionals.

<p><b>Philosophy caf&eacute;s
<h1>Categorical ap&eacute;ritif</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>PARIS
</font><p>DESCARTES did it by a stove. Diderot did it in the garden of the Palais Royal. But there really is nowhere like a Paris caf&eacute; to think about the world. In the 1940s and 1950s Jean-Paul Sartre and other French intellectuals preached to small knots of disciples at the Lipp, the Flore and the Deux Magots. In the 1960s students argued about anarchism and the different brands of Marxism in smoke-filled caf&eacute;s around the Sorbonne. The hot topics after that--grand theories of culture known as structuralism and deconstruction--are now in turn as stale as yesterday's croissants. But speculative caf&eacute; talk has never died. The earnestness is still there, even if the mood has changed: "isms" are out, Socrates is in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Philosophy is respected in France. For many teenagers, the <i>baccalaur&eacute;at</i><i> </i>kicks off with the much-dreaded <i>&eacute;pr</i><i>euve de philo</i>, which receives wide coverage in the media each year. The best answers are even published in newspapers. About four years ago a teacher, Marc Sautet, decided to take Plato out of the classroom and back to the agora--a caf&eacute; on the Place de la Bastille. The (non-paying) Sunday-morning rendezvous has proved hugely popular, and, though Mr Sautet hotly denies being a guru, he has become a paid consultant to businessmen and politicians. En couraged by his success, philosophy buffs have set up shop in other caf&eacute;s. France currently has about 50 <i>caf&eacute;s-philos</i>, half of them in Paris. Geneva has two. Others are being launched in New York, Tokyo, Cambridge (England) and Athens. Caf&eacute; owners are delighted. It brings a regular, peaceful clientele and it gives their premises a touch of intellectual class. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The person in the chair may have a training in philosophy, like Mr Sautet, or be self-taught. Those taking part in the debate--non-paying, and open to all--vary from place to place, especially in Paris: earnest young students on the Place de la Sorbonne; trendy middle-class, middle-aged housewives and office workers on the Boulevard Saint Michel and at the Bastille; down-and-outs near the Halles. But the groups are not watertight, and there can be a mix of cultural and social backgrounds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To those who remember the heated atmosphere of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the tolerance of these debates is impressive. Speakers using abstruse language are invited to rephrase their thoughts more simply, and generally do so with good grace. There is no lecturing, and little talking down. Novices who stray from the subject or get tied up in knots are politely heard out and helped to unravel their thoughts. "The idea", says Mr Sautet, "is to encourage people to think for themselves and to question ready-made assumptions." The person in the chair intervenes discreetly to guide the discussion, to ensure that everyone gets a chance to talk, to utter a gentle reprimand if politics rears its ugly head.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For although discussion can be set off by news stories, the idea is to avoid getting bogged down in political bickering. Speakers grapple with subjects such as eternity, the use of paradox in philosophy, and light and darkness; try to peer beyond good and evil; and ask themselves whether to be free is to accept what happens to us, whether one should give up trying to search for answers, whether man should adapt to nature or the other way round.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Paris caf&eacute;s there is a strong interest in Seneca and the Stoics, linked to a recurrent feeling that the world is in a mess, that western civilisation may be on the verge of dramatic change, that one should reflect on man's place in the universe. Not exactly novel, but not the over-ambitious stuff of the 1960s, either. As one participant puts it, "Most of us would like to change the world, but unlike the 1968 generation we have no ready-made answers."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some attribute these caf&eacute;s' success to urban loneliness, to an urge to make one's voice heard in the modern void, to a need to reach out across apparently empty space. Each <i>caf&eacute;-philo</i> produces its own blend of camaraderie. Good meals regularly round off the debates. Socrates's new French disciples are all attached to the one categorical imperative Kant forgot: conviviality.

<h1 align=center>Don't be salesmen</h1>


THERE are a lot of things, these days, which ministers and bureaucrats should not be doing. Printing money to finance reckless borrowing. Raising taxes so high as to discourage work and enterprise. Impeding flows of trade and investment. Introducing or preserving regulations that impose high costs on business and distort economic decisions. Nationalising companies, or thwarting the privatisation of existing state-owned firms. Protecting monopolies and cartels. Intervening in the economy to "pick winners" in new industries or protect "lame ducks" in old ones. For those who accept such self-denying ordinances, politics and economic policy-making are much less fun than in the 1960s or 1970s. But at least one thing is still allowed: ministers and officials can fly off on trips promoting exports and tempting foreign companies to invest in their countries. Pushing for more trade, more jobs, more investment: what could be wrong with that?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sorry to be a party-pooper, but quite a lot--both in practice and in principle. In practice, the things that governments do to promote exports are becoming controversial. William Daley, the new head of America's Commerce Department (see <a href="am3212.html"> page</a>), has suspended his department's export-promotion effort while investigations take place into allegations that political donations have bought access to help and to trade missions. Separately, Britain's main political parties have been arguing about whether public money should be used to buy a new royal yacht, whose main use would be, or could be, export promotion. Meanwhile, questions of whether China should be criticised for civil-liberties infringements in Hong Kong have become entangled in European governments' desire to secure contracts for their firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such controversies are unlikely to end the fashion. Governments want to do something to help their economies grow, and many believe, with Bill Clinton, that "geo-economics" has replaced geo-politics as their main concern. Our article on <a href="sf0823.html">page</a> describes the various methods governments are using, and quotes these war-weary words of Jeffrey Garten, under-secretary of commerce during Mr Clinton's first term: "In the best of worlds, governments ought to get out of this business altogether. But the marketplace is corrupted by the presence of government. So do you sit on the side and pontificate about Adam Smith, or do you enter the fray?"
<br></p><p><b><b>What not to do</b>
</b><br>This sounds convincing. Like most arguments for government intervention, it contains an element of truth. The trouble is that on the basis of that element a mountain of self-serving or plain bad practice has been built.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason why government export promotion is wrong in principle begins with a simple observation: everything has a price. Whenever a minister jets off to Indonesia, or China, or Saudi Arabia to secure a contract for a private firm, the question that should be asked, but almost never is, is what price the minister is paying. It is in the minister's interest only to emphasise the benefit of his venture, usually in terms of jobs created or income earned. But buyers of exports are rarely fools, swayed merely by a minister's flattery. They extract a price. After all, as Mr Garten suggests, there are plenty of other minister-salesmen clamouring for the buyer's attention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The easiest case is where an export-promoting government offers a subsidy: cash to cover a discount, say, or a generous export-credit deal, or aid to the buyer linked formally or informally to the purchase. Most rich-country politicians now accept that domestic subsidies do not make sense. Yet they continue to claim that exports are different. So taxpayers are, in effect, subsidising exporters to produce goods, while paying foreigners to take them away. Only in truly remarkable instances could taxpayers be better off as a result. In most cases, regardless of whether other governments wish to waste cash in this way, they are worse off. So is the economy, for such subsidies divert resources towards industries that benefit from them and away from those, serving mainly the domestic market, that do not. There are two other beneficiaries: the bribed buyer; and the minister, pointing proudly at all those jobs and exports.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are not exports the modern holy grail, proof of a country's competitiveness? This is just a new form of the oldest mercantilist myth. There is nothing magic about exports; they are simply a necessary means to pay for imports. Look at France, which is running a $24 billion annual trade surplus and thus has exports galore. But it also has unemployment galore, and problems galore, none of which will be solved by more exports. It is safe to predict, however, that right now, somewhere in Paris, someone is planning the next trade-promotion trip for President Chirac or one of his ministers, and working out ways to bribe the lucky hosts to buy more Airbuses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more complicated case, but also now the most common and the most insidious, is where the price is non-financial. China is the best illustration, but is only one of many. Officials, ministers, chancellors, presidents are flocking to the Middle Kingdom to press the flesh, drink the rice-wine and sign the export contracts. From time to time, however, China's dictators do something outrageous: they massacre some people, lock others up, grab a reef, fire missiles near Taiwan, restrict Hong Kong's liberties. The export-salesmen insist that foreign-policy considerations such as these can be separated from the trade missions. The Chinese know better. This export zeal provides them with a perfect pressure point, as well as with a way to divide one western ally from another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, then, can governments do? One sort of export promotion does no particular harm and (depending on the cost) may even do some good. That is general marketing of a country, carefully insulated from particular contracts and particular companies, in a way analogous to the work done by an industry association for its members: drum-beating, information-gathering, information-disseminating. Beyond that, there are two other legitimate roles for governments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One is that for some longer-term export contracts, as for inward investments, reassurances about the stability of regulatory and macroeconomic policy can be important. This is no truer of a foreign buyer than a domestic one, but the foreigner may have less information or understanding of policy trends than the resident does. Even more important, of course, is actually maintaining that stability. The other legitimate role is that in the defence business governments do typically have to deal with governments. There, if you want to be in the business, you have to get into the fray.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most export-salesmanship, especially that by politicians, does not fall into these categories, however. Any benefits obtained from it come at a price. And that price, whether in economic or in diplomatic terms, is not worth paying.

<h2>Boss of Chechnya
</h2><b>Aslan Maskhadov</b>,<b> </b>Chechnya's guerrilla leader who made peace with Russia last year, easily won an election for the presidency of the rebel republic. 
<p><b>Boris Yeltsin </b>made a brief, but pre-recorded, appearance on television and subsequently tottered into the Kremlin. But doubts continued about his chances of a full recovery from his heart operation and pneumonia as more meetings with foreign leaders were put off.
<p>Discord grew in the German government over plans unveiled by Theo Waigel, the finance minister, to revamp the <b>tax system</b>. The top rate of income tax would fall from 53% to 39%, the bottom rate from 26% to 15%. The labour minister, Norbert Bl&uuml;m, complained that Mr Waigel's plan threatened his own proposed reform of pensions. 
<p>A former French minister, <b>Maur</b><b>ice Pap</b><b>on</b>,<b> </b>now 86, was sent for trial, accused of sending Jews to death camps under France's Vichy government in the second world war.
<p><b>Switzerland's ambassador </b> to the United States, Carlo Jagmetti, resigned. A leaked document revealed that he had urged his government to "wage war" against Jewish groups pressing Switzerland to make immediate amends for not returning assets confiscated by Nazis and held in Swiss banks.
<p><b>Bulgaria's new president</b>, Petar Stoyanov, appealed for western help, saying his country was in dire financial straits. He asked a Socialist, Nikolai Dobrev,<b> </b>to form a caretaker government--and then urged him to agree to hold new elections.
<p>Albania's president, Sali Berisha, said his government would compensate his compatriots--thought to number more than a third of the population--who have lost their savings in collapsing <b>"pyramid" schemes</b>. Western bankers said Albania could not afford to pay.
<p>Latvia's president, Guntis Ulmanis, asked a former prime minister, <b>And</b><b>ris Skele</b>,<b> </b>a non-party businessman, to form another government--a week after he had resigned.
<p><h2>Avoiding that issue
</h2>President Clinton, at a press conference, promised that next week's <b>budget </b>would spend more on education and on a programme to detect outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. His audience only wanted to know about campaign fund-raising scandals.
<p>New York health officials reported that <b>deaths from AIDS</b><b> </b>in the city dropped by 30% last year, the first fall since the disease was recognised as an epidemic in 1981. The rate of new <font size=-1>AIDS</font> cases in the city remained unchanged. 
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>A study by the University of Michigan found that Gary, Indiana, is the <b>most segregated city</b> in the United States. Detroit was second. The least segregated city was Jacksonville, North Carolina. 
<p>In <b>Brazil</b>, the lower house of Congress backed a constitutional change that would allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to seek re-election in 1998.
<p><b>Colombia's</b> <b>feminists </b>were up in arms, after the Constitutional Court rejected a challenge to the penal code's total ban on abortion. Even after rape, the court decided, by six votes to three, abortion violates the fundamental rights of the unborn child--and the mother. Penalty: up to three years in prison.
<p><h2>Cry guilty
</h2>In South Africa, five former policemen confessed that they killed <b>Steve Biko</b>, a black activist, in 1977 and applied for amnesty--a breakthrough for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In the first meeting of its kind, the <b>Commonwealth </b>is bringing together African rulers and leaders of opposition parties later this month in Botswana to discuss governance in Africa.
<p>The United Nations said that <b>Burundi's army </b>had killed more than 1,000 people since the start of December.
<p>Algeria's President Liamine Zeroual blamed the current wave of <b>terror bombings and massacres</b> on foreign conspirators. The Islamic Salvation Front's leaders<b> </b>in<b> </b>exile called for a government of national unity. A peace rally in Algiers was broken up by security forces. Abdelhaq Benhamouda, secretary-general of Algeria's largest union and a close ally of Mr Zerou<b></b> al's, was murdered.
<p>Three <b>Israeli soldiers </b>were killed by a Hizbollah mine inside south Lebanon.
<p><h2>Weighing the odds
</h2>As <b>Pakistan </b>prepared to go to the polls on February 3rd, an opinion poll gave the party of Benazir Bhutto 20% of the vote, and that of her main rival, Nawaz Sharif, 40%. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Miss Bhutto to restore her government, dismissed by the president in November for corruption and misrule.
<p>Assets of Tang Liang Hong, an opposition candidate in <b>Singapore</b>'s recent general election, were frozen after government officials raided his home and office. Mr Tang, a lawyer, is in dispute with ministers over remarks said to have been made during the election campaign.
<p>A fire in a <b>Hong Kong </b>nightclub which killed 17 people was blamed on a gang war.
<p>The Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, launched a new campaign against <b>corruption in China</b>,<b> </b>saying that members of the Communist Party were forgetting its socialist traditions of struggle and frugality. In 1996, 116,000 people were punished for graft, 14% more than the previous year.

<h2>Indomitable dollar
</h2>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>dollar</b> continued its rise against a weakened yen, pushing up towards &#165;125. Japanese retail sales slipped by 0.4% in 1996, to &#165;23 trillion ($211 billion), the fifth year of decline. December was a bad month for department stores and supermarkets; sales fell 2.1% from a year earlier.
<p><h2>Bad business
</h2>The founder of <b>Hanbo Steel</b> was hauled from hospital to answer questions following the collapse of the company and other parts of the Hanbo Group, a conglomorate with debts of 5 trillion won ($5.8 billion). Five of the South Korean firm's banks are under investigation; President Kim Young Sam ordered an inquiry into allegations that some of his aides organised loans to Hanbo. The government is pouring 6 trillion won into the money market to avert a credit crunch. 
<p><b>Hilton Hotels</b> launched a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid for <b>ITT</b>, its main rival in the hotels and casino businesses; with an assumption of debt, the offer was worth $10.5 billion. A successful bid would create the world's largest hotel and gambling giant.
<p>Shares in <b>IBM</b>, depressed by recent fourth-quarter results, jumped after the computer maker announced its first stock split for 17 years, halving the unwieldy $150-or-so share price.
<p>The proposed $20 billion merger between <b>BT and MCI </b>is under scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. Competing long-distance telephone companies have demanded that regulators in the United States and at the European Commission impose conditions. The commission said it is likely to investigate the deal.
<p>The European Commission proposed legislation to close a loophole whereby <b>"callback"</b> <b>services </b>in Europe run by foreign telecoms companies pay no value-added tax. European-run services are subject to 15-25% <font size=-1>VAT</font>.
<p>Eager to breathe life into the moribund privatisation of <b>Stet</b>, the Italian government announced the shake-up of top management at the telecoms giant and the merger of its main operating unit, Telecom Italia, with the holding company. Opposition politicians claimed the appointments were political.
<p>While the Italian government urged Stet to find an international partner, its Spanish counterpart, <b>Telefonica de Espa&ntilde;a</b>, prepares to name one. The choice, likely to be <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, <font size=-1>MCI</font> or <font size=-1>GTE</font>, will be made in the next few weeks to help the company expand in Latin America.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>America Online</b> offered to reimburse clients and limit membership after more class-action lawsuits by customers who are irritated by the online service's swamped networks. <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s switch to unlimited-use fees in December has backfired because its users refuse to log off.
<p>New drugs and strong domestic sales gave most <b>American drug companies </b>double-digit profit growth in 1996, galloping past the corporate average. The tighter rein on drug costs that the huge managed-care companies were expected to bring didn't happen. Drug prices rose 5% last year and sales volume also increased. In Britain, Zeneca said pre-tax profits this year would rise 14% to about &#163;1 billion ($1.6 billion).
<p>Shares in <b>J. Sainsbury</b> slumped after the supermarket chain, long Britain's biggest until Tesco tried harder, gave a warning that profits this year will be 10% lower than last year. 
<p><b>Michael Grade </b>resigned as chief executive of Britain's Channel 4 television station to become fully involved in the family firm, First Leisure, where he takes over as executive chairman. He plans to add film distribution to the company's interests in among other things, Blackpool Tower and bingo halls.
<p><b>Suez</b> completed a FFr3 billion ($540m) sale of property loans to Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, and announced it had returned to profit. The huge French holding company, after restructuring, made a FFr800m net profit in 1996 compared with a FFr3.9 billion loss in 1995.
<p><h2>Cash cars
</h2>The president of Toyota said his company might not make <b>new investments in Britain</b> if the country stays out of <font size=-1>EMU</font>. He said Toyota, one of Britain's largest foreign investors, might prefer continental Europe instead.
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Recent strikes that plagued General Motors, the biggest of <b>America's big three </b>car makers, caused net profits to plunge last year. But the cash-rich company approved a cautious $2.5 billion share buyback. Ford rallied domestically but suffered larger losses in Europe and Latin America. Earnings leapt at Chrysler, the smallest and fastest growing of the three (it reported last week).
<p>Soren Gyll quit suddenly as head of <b>Volvo</b>, Sweden's biggest car maker. He is replaced by Leif Johansson, chief executive of Electrolux, part of Sweden's Wallenberg empire. He said he would consider alliances with other car makers but ruled out another merger attempt such as the one with Renault which failed.
<p><b>Rover</b> sold more cars abroad than in Britain for the first time. Now owned by Germany's <font size=-1>BMW</font>, Rover produced 507,000 cars last year, over 500,000 for the first time since 1988; 54% of them were exported.

<h1 align=center>In praise of Davos Man</h1>


<p><b>How businessmen may accidentally be making the world safer</b></p>
<br>IT IS not every day that 1,000 of the people who run the world gather under a single roof. But every year 1,000 of the people who think they run the world congregate in Davos, a Swiss ski resort, for the annual meeting of a foundation known as the World Economic Forum. Although this event is often marred by an atmosphere of self-importance, the Davos crowd has a better excuse than usual for basking in the limelight this weekend. Samuel Huntington, an American academic, has put Davos at the centre of an argument about civilisation and its future. He has attacked Davos Man. And, self-important or not, Davos Man must be defended. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Huntington, remember, is the author of a strikingly uncomfortable idea, first propounded in 1992 and recently elaborated in a book ("The Clash of Civilisations and the Remaking of World Order", Simon & Schuster). He thinks the countries of the West assume too blithely that with the end of the cold war the whole world is modernising along western lines--law-based, plural, secular, attentive to individual rights. In fact, says he, many countries may not modernise in a western way at all. Prosperity may lead some to emulate the West, but give others the power and confidence to reassert their own values--some of which are not just different from the West's but hostile to it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Davos is an example. Mr Huntington notes that almost all of the businessmen, bankers, officials and intellectuals who flock there hold university degrees, work with words or numbers, speak some English and share beliefs in individualism, market economics and democracy. They control many of the world's governments, and the bulk of its economic and military capabilities. But they are singularly unrepresentative. Outside the West, he reckons, less than 1% of the world's population shares this culture. Could there be a better demonstration of the folly of expecting the whole world to converge on a single culture like the one on parade in Davos? 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may look like a fair cop. The Davos crowd are undeniably an unrepresentative elite. But in their defence it must be said--and Mr Huntington doesn't--that they are a different kind of elite. In particular, Davos Man is not Chatham House Man. And, arcane though it sounds, this difference makes the future of the world look a good deal brighter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chatham House is the elegant London home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, where for nearly 80 years diplomats have mulled the strange ways of "abroad". By training and disposition, Chatham House Man was a linguist and romantic. By profession he was a diplomat. In bed at night he worried about the world's division into two armed camps, not his next billion. He probably worked at a western embassy in an exotic Arab country. He may have sent home (duly encrypted) reports about "sentiment in the bazaar". 
<br></p><p><b><b>Markets and mandarins</b>
</b><br>This, naturally, is a parody. The serious point is that less than a decade ago Chatham House Man and his kind really thought they made the world go safely round. Now the end of the cold war and the spreading global economy have squashed such pretensions. The two armed camps have become umpteen interlinked economies; the bazaar, teeming with sleek young things from Wall Street, has lost its mystery. Diplomacy has not disappeared, nor the need for it: rather a lot of history has happened since 1989 (remember the Soviet Union?), when Francis Fukuyama announced history's end. But in most places, and for the present, business is pushing the old Chatham House world to the margin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this change that Davos symbolises, and which Mr Huntington overlooks. Although 40 or so heads of state will troop to Davos this weekend, the event is paid for by companies, and run in their interests. They do not go to butter up the politicians; it is the other way around (see <a href="ld4529.html">previous leader</a>). Davos Man, finding it boring to shake the hand of an obscure prime minister, prefers to meet Microsoft's Bill Gates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this should cheer up Mr Huntington, not cast him down. Some people find Davos Man hard to take: there is something uncultured about all the money-grubbing and managerialism. But it is part of the beauty of Davos Man that, by and large, he does not give a fig for culture as the Huntingtons of the world define it. He will attend a piano recital, but does not mind whether an idea, a technique or a market is (in Mr Huntington's complex scheme) Sinic, Hindu, Islamic or Orthodox. If an idea works or a market arises, he will grab it. Like it or loathe it, that is an approach more likely to bring peoples together than to force them apart.

<h1>Thoroughly modern mercantilists</h1>

<p><b>President Charles de Gaulle of France once refused to meet a Japanese prime minister, dismissing him as a "transistor salesman". Now, presidents of all stripes are making exports a central part of their foreign policies</b></p> 
<br>BILL CLINTON puts in a word with the Saudi princes, and snatches an order for Boeing from under the nose of Europe's Airbus. Helmut Kohl flies to Beijing, becomes the first western leader to inspect troops since the Tiananmen Square massacre and departs with a stack of Sino-German trade deals; other westerners fume--outwardly about human rights, inwardly about lost business. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How times have changed since de Gaulle's disdain. Now, the French prime minister goes to Tokyo to sell helicopters. No political leader thinks twice about doubling up as a commercial traveller. And nowhere has this transformation been so swift as in the United States.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's government used to be a lonely standard-bearer for free trade, trying to stick to the belief that governments should not intervene to boost exports. That is changing. Campaigning on the slogan that "it's the economy, stupid", Bill Clinton promised, in 1992, to focus America's foreign policy on its trading interests. In his first term he appointed as commerce secretary Ron Brown, an energetic and powerful friend who had helped organise Mr Clinton's winning campaign. Mr Brown raised the status of the Commerce Department within the administration, leading a series of high-profile trade missions abroad.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it is a backhanded testimony to trade's political significance that America and Britain are now both passing through political awkwardnesses connected with it. In Britain, the government has stirred up a parliamentary squall by promising to spend &#163;60m ($97m) on a new yacht for the royal family, arguing that a gracious chat with Her Majesty will so impress "foreign potentates" that business will flow to British companies wherever <i>HMS Buybritish </i> docks. In America, Mr Brown, who remained as commerce secretary until his death in an air crash in 1996, has been accused of allotting places on export-promotion trips to firms which had donated money to the Democratic Party. William Daley, his successor-designate, has suspended all such trips for 30 days while corruption-proof guidelines are drawn up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such scandals may smudge the image of the politician-salesman, but they do not alter the broader picture: in the past few years of free-market liberalism, politicians' enthusiasm for promoting national exports has been growing. As Clintonites put it, cold-war geopolitics has been replaced by "geo-economics", a theory which holds that trade security matters as much as military security.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leaving aside the question of whether this shift in policies is justified (for which, see <a href="ld4529.html">cover leader</a>), these three pages ask: how in fact do governments promote exports? And are their policies changing? 
<br></p><p><b><b>Ask what your country can do for you</b>
</b><br>In principle, governments have four main methods at their disposal. The simplest is to <b>subsidise exporters.</b> The crudest such measures--direct subsidies of exports--are outlawed under the rules of the World Trade Organisation (<font size=-1>WTO</font>), which nearly all trading nations have promised to abide by. <font size=-1>WTO</font> members whose industries are damaged by others' industrial subsidies (even if these are not related to exports) can also bring a case before the trade club's dispute-settlement system: the result may be an end to the subsidy or compensation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, governments can still find channels down which to pump money for exporters (see <a href="sf1.gif"> chart</a>). They can, for example, <b>subsidise research and development</b>. Under <font size=-1>WTO</font> rules, governments may pay up to 75% of a firm's industrial-research costs, or half the cost of product development. There is a respectable economic argument for this: a firm undertaking research may not secure all the benefits from it; these can accrue to everyone, in the form of better-educated scientists, say. Governments have an interest in encouraging this. The trouble is that in practice they are poor at picking good research projects; markets are rather better.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can also offer <b>"tied aid", </b> in which the recipient promises to buy goods from companies in the donor country. This is often given for foreign-policy as much for commercial reasons, and might be categorised as "aid" not "trade". One of the most spectacular recent examples of an export-promotion deal blowing up in the promoter's face occurred when the British government muddled trade and aid when dealing with Malaysia over a large arms contract (see <a href="sf0822.html"> page</a>). In December last year the <font size=-1>OECD</font> adopted new guidelines on tied aid, aimed at ensuring that it is given only to projects that cannot be commercially financed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or governments can finance exports through <b>"export credit guarantees", which insure exporters against the risk of default by their customers. In the past, governments have used these to subsidise exporters by guaranteeing loans at below-market interest rates.</b> As with tied aid, <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries have signed a self-denying ordinance, intended to eliminate such beggar-my-neighbour subsidies on credits of two years or more. Many European governments have also increased private-sector involvement in their short-term export-credit operations, bringing market discipline to bear on them. By and large, governments have been using these various ways of subsidising exporters rather less enthusiastically than in the past.
<br></p><p><b><b>America's</b> <b>commerce conversion</b>
</b><br>That is also true of the second broad way in which governments can boost exports: manipulating the <b>exchange rate</b>. By devaluing, a government makes exports cheaper in foreign-currency terms. This helps exporters in the short run, but not in the long. Devaluation raises import prices, and, if workers maintain the purchasing power of their wages, labour costs rise, too. Eventually much, if not all, of the initial gain is inflated away.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves the third and fourth means of help, where renewed government trade activism is concentrated. The third is simple <b>information-gathering</b>. Commerce departments and trade ministries spend lots of time and trouble gathering business information of every sort on foreign markets. Companies could do this for themselves singly (if big enough) or collectively--and many do. But firms, especially small ones, also get a sort of free ride from embassies set up for other reasons. Diplomats spend much of their time gathering information about local markets, showing the flag at trade fairs and arranging business meetings. These are skills at which the Americans and British are said to be conspicuously good--the Germans less so. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This overlaps with the last area, which might be called <b>trade boosterism</b> and is exemplified by the high-profile missions which were Mr Brown's trademark. European politicians and diplomats have long acted as export boosters. Asian tigers, too, are making big efforts. The (South) Korean Trade-Investment Promotion Agency has a network of offices round the world. The Hong Kong Trade and Development Council, which stages some 350 events a year around the world, is unusual in that it recoups 70% of its HK$1 billion ($130m) budget by charging participants fees. Assuming businesses pay only for services they find useful, the <font size=-1>HKTDC</font> probably does a better job than most of its counterparts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan is an exception to the rule. Having being bullied for decades by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (<font size=-1>MITI</font>) to "export or die", big Japanese manufacturers need no encouragement, financial or otherwise. Now, <font size=-1>MITI</font> has become a shadow of its former self and <font size=-1>JETRO</font>, the Japan External Trade Organisation, has reinvented itself as a sort of ministry of imports. Fear of trade friction with America has been the main reason for this change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's conversion to export activism has been as striking as Japan's retreat from it. With Jeffrey Garten, an undersecretary in his department until 1995, Mr Brown concentrated his efforts on the most populous emerging markets, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, where demand was strongest for big-ticket projects such as power stations, transport systems and telecommunications networks. Besides leading trade missions abroad, Mr Brown organised a "war room" in the Commerce Department, to track the 100-odd biggest contracts overseas and plan government support for American competitors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Brown also co-ordinated the export-boosting efforts of the 19 disparate government agencies with new vigour. In fact, as officials admit, this followed on from a law signed by George Bush in 1992, which beefed up a little-known entity called the Trade Promotion Co-operation Council (<font size=-1>TPCC</font>) and required it to liaise between the agencies seeking to help exporters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet America's export-promotion strategy remains confused. The Commerce Department offers exporters advice; the Export-Import Bank offers them finance. But so do, say, the Agriculture or Energy Departments to firms on their turf. Now, other bits of government are vying to boost exports, notably the Pentagon and the overseas aid agency (of all things).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The departments are sometimes at loggerheads. Ex-Im Bank, for example, has refused recently to help firms exporting to Haiti, arguing that the country is too risky. The Overseas Private Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>OPIC</font>), on the other hand, is more sensitive to the State Department's interest in Haiti's stability: it is open for business there. Over China, the two agencies reverse roles. Ex-Im Bank is bullish and happy to underwrite trade there. <font size=-1>OPIC</font>, influenced by touchy diplomatic relations with the Chinese, refuses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, the allocation of export-boosting cash makes no sense. Roughly two-thirds of it goes on promoting food exports, reflecting the food lobby's clout, rather than its needs. At one point, California's raisin growers secured $4m to advertise their raisins in Japan--a sum which exceeded the Commerce Department's entire Japan budget. Because the <font size=-1>TPCC</font><b> </b>has to produce an annual report on export promotion, such misallocation is at least clearer than before and is becoming less extreme. Even so, money is being shifted from the food lobby to other industries only slowly.
<br></p><p><b><b>So why do it?</b>
</b><br>It may seem odd that governments should be putting so much effort into promoting exports just when they are cutting back on other forms of interference in trade, such as tariffs, under the auspices of the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. One plausible explanation is that most of their energy goes into helping small firms, which cannot afford to set up their own offices overseas. America's Commerce Department, for instance, reckons that 90% of its work is on behalf of small companies. But how successful is it? Laura Tyson, until recently head of America's National Economic Council, admits there has been only a slight increase in small firms' share of American exports, though increasing that share was one of the administration's aims.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second explanation is that, especially when big infrastructure contracts are at stake in emerging markets, governments are afraid to abandon their national companies because other governments are committed to backing their own champions. At the same time, the purchaser itself is usually a government, or state-owned company. Winning a contract is harder without the personal endorsement of a minister.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other governments' support for their national firms was a prime reason why the United States joined battle so fiercely. "In the best of worlds," says Mr Garten, now the dean of Yale School of Management, "governments ought to get out of this business altogether. But the marketplace is corrupted by the presence of government. So do you sit on the side and pontificate about Adam Smith, or do you enter the fray?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will governments ever get out of the export-promotion business? When pigs fly, perhaps. Clearer government-procurement procedures, especially in developing countries, are achievable, though <font size=-1>WTO</font> talks on the matter (long an American priority) are still some way off. An <font size=-1>OECD</font> agreement to clamp down on bribe-paying (ditto) might make a difference--if anyone takes any notice. And even then such things might not be enough. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments love to think, usually mistakenly, that their economies will be better off if they help things along than if they leave well alone. Now that they are renouncing some forms of support for their industries against international competition, they have eagerly embraced another. The temptation to meddle seems always be too great to resist.

<h1>Arms and the dam</h1>

THE Pergau dam in Malaysia, which is being built with &#163;234m ($377m) of British aid, is perhaps the most notorious example of how not to encourage exports. Illegal and expensive, the deal has been an embarrassment to the British government ever since it was first exposed in 1990. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain promised to provide aid to Malaysia in March 1988, during negotiations over a &#163;1.3 billion deal to sell Hawk fighters there. The agreement directly linked aid to the arms deal, pledging that the more was spent on arms, the more aid there would be. Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher confirmed the arrangement in September 1988.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When details of the link between arms and aid first appeared in the British press, they were strenuously denied by the Foreign Office. Which was hardly surprising: this use of aid, the High Court declared later, was illegal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lord Justice Rose ruled that the project on which the aid was going, the Pergau dam, was economically unsound, as well as unlawful. It appeared that their enthusiasm for the arms contract drove British ministers to ignore the law, rising costs and their own officials. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1993, the National Audit Office, the government's accounting watchdog, reported that officials had warned ministers the hydro-electric scheme was not a "prudent and economic" use of aid. In February 1990, the Overseas Development Administration (whose money was being used), said the project was "a very bad buy". The then foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, gave the project his go-ahead anyway, in July 1991. (He later explained that he believed he had no option in view of the prior commitment given to the Malaysian government.) Sir Tim Lankester, the top civil servant in the <font size=-1>ODA</font>, formally dissented, telling ministers the spending was improper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government has since exacted its revenge on Sir Tim. He was obliged to leave the civil service after the Department of Education, where he was permanent secretary, was merged with the Department of Employment. He is now director of the School of African and Oriental Studies at the University of London. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, relations with Britain have been soured by the affair and the dam, which is still under construction, gets ever more expensive. The latest estimate of its cost is over $800m.

<h1>Uncommercial travellers</h1>

TRADE promoters yell "Buy our goods!" But if you are in the trade diplomats' bazaar, you are just as likely to hear another hawker's cry: "Buy our workers!" As governments compete to sell exports, so they fight to persuade foreign companies to set up factories back home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some make better salesmen than others. The French have an urbane roving ambassador who lives up to his country's best traditions by wining and dining foreign investors, and by extolling <i>la France</i>. The British, says one rival, are "very good, very organised". But beneath the patter the pitches are much the same. The locals are friendly and have just the skills you need; the country is beautiful--and the government is very, very generous.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments are keen to attract foreign direct investment for much the same reason that they strive to win juicy export contracts: they can point to jobs created at home (and, by implication, not "lost" to foreigners). Politicians usually expect foreign-owned factories to export their wares to neighbouring countries. And like export-promotion schemes, foreign-investment subsidies have the advantage of supporting industry without protection against imports--although, like export subsidies, <font size=-1>FDI</font> subsidies distort world trade away from the pattern that would have prevailed but for the sweeteners.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two differences, however. First, governments see foreign investment as a way of reviving economically deprived regions, hence can argue they are not providing unfair subsidies, just (say) bringing the roads and telephones of a poor region up to scratch. Second, they can offer fat bribes to foreign investors--in the form of tax breaks, grants and so forth--that would be illegal, or at least well hidden, in trade deals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what bribes. The cost to taxpayers of snaring foreign investment can be up to $250,000 per job, especially if there is a bidding war (see <a href="sf2.gif"> table</a>). There are two lots of winners from this: the lucky workers with subsidised employment; and the shareholders of foreign companies. The best outcome for shareholders (and the worst for taxpayers) is that they end up getting paid to pitch camp where they would have done anyway, so their hosts' largesse is pure gain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too bad for taxpayers, and for workers in countries whose pockets are not deep enough to compete in auctions for foreign investment. Some developing countries complain that, while rich-country governments are keen to see foreign investors given greater protection against interference from host governments (an <font size=-1>OECD</font> agreement on this is due to be completed by May), they are less eager to call a halt to <font size=-1>FDI</font> auctions.

<b>LEXINGTON</B>
<h1>The new Daley machine</h1>

THINK of the name Daley, and you think of machines. Richard J. Daley, the mayor of Chicago from 1955 to 1976, was a master of machine politics. His son, Richard M. Daley, Chicago's mayor since 1989, has covered the old machinery with the trappings of modern management. But now another member of the Daley family--William, son of the former mayor, brother of the current one--is to be in charge of a formidable chunk of Washington machinery known as the Commerce Department.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On January 30th the Senate looked set to confirm Mr Daley's nomination as the new commerce secretary. After a dramatic start (when, under the bright lights at the press conference where President Clinton announced his new appointments, the 48-year-old Mr Daley fainted and tumbled into the arms of <font size=-1>CNN</font>'s Wolf Blitzer), the confirmation process has gone smoothly. This is surprising, given the controversies engulfing the Commerce Department and in view of Mr Daley's own background, which would seem just the sort to inspire despair that anything much will change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Take the controversies first. The Commerce Department has been at the top of the list of government agencies that Republicans would like to eliminate. Its defenders argue that it is a vital champion of American business, helping firms compete on an equal footing in the global marketplace; $250m-worth of export promotion over the past four years resulted in over $40 billion in overseas sales, according to Mr Daley at his confirmation hearing on January 22nd. The department's critics are wary of such claims, seeing the place as a wasteful dispenser of corporate welfare (notably through its Advanced Technology Programme, which doles out aid to some of the country's largest companies) and a bureaucratic amalgam of functions--from the Census Bureau to the Patent and Trademark Office and the National Weather Service--that do not obviously belong together. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republican zeal for dismantling the department has diminished somewhat. The main campaigner in the House of Representatives, Dick Chrysler, lost his seat in the November elections. But reasons for wariness about its activities have grown. Not only has it continued to be a dumping ground for political operatives, but it has aroused suspicions of being abused as a machine for processing influence and business connections into political cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics have long suspected that many of the coveted places on trade missions under Mr Clinton's first commerce secretary, Ron Brown, went to donors to the Democratic Party. Fresh concerns over influence-peddling have come with the revelations of the dubious fund-raising activities of John Huang, a political appointee at the Commerce Department who moved to the Democratic National Committee (<font size=-1>DNC</font>) and is the man at the centre of the Democrats' Asian-money scandal. The relationship between the Commerce Department and the <font size=-1>DNC</font> has had a troublingly incestuous appearance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which is why Mr Daley's background should raise eyebrows: it is the identikit lawyer/business-lobbyist/party-fundraiser profile of his predecessors. Ron Brown was a super-lobbyist with the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow and a successful chairman of the <font size=-1>DNC</font>. Mickey Kantor, who took over after Brown's death, is another lawyer-apparatchik; he chaired Mr Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. And now there is Mr Daley, high-earning lobbyist with the Chicago law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt, member of Chicago's political dynasty, head of Mr Clinton's successful Illinois campaign in 1992, fundraiser for the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Passed over four years ago for the job of transport secretary, he is at last getting his reward with a cabinet post. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is of course entirely appropriate that a commerce secretary should be experienced in the world of business (Mr Daley's corporate clients have included some of the best-known American and foreign companies) and familiar with the ways of Washington (he was a frequent lobbyist with his Chicago friend, Dan Rostenkowski, the disgraced former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee). Mr Daley is also highly competent. Those who have worked with him describe him as focused, bright and personable. Brought into the White House in 1993 to run the flagging campaign for the North American Free-Trade Agreement, he added order and a sense of mission that helped win the day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His skills have been on display during his confirmation process. To pre-empt Republican objections, he pledged to cut the department's 256 slots for political appointees by 100. He also promised to suspend all trade missions abroad for a month while he reviews procedures. That came close to an admission of past abuses. "There is no place for politics at the Department of Commerce," he assured senators.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not everyone was impressed. Sam Brownback, a newly elected senator from Kansas, voted against Mr Daley's confirmation in committee on Wednesday. He was underwhelmed by the secretary-designate's promises (for example, some 50 political slots are currently vacant at the department, so the Daley cuts are only half as big as they sound) and unconvinced about his commitment to reform. Once confirmed, Mr Daley can expect intense scrutiny of his department--as well as a renewed push for its dismantling--from Mr Brownback and like-minded Republicans.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If he really wanted the Commerce Department to be above politics, Mr Clinton might have chosen it--rather than the Defence Department--as the place to have a Republican at the helm. Last December, in an interview with the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Mr Clinton said of Taiwanese-Americans such as Mr Huang, "The culture out of which they come doesn't draw the same bright lines between politics, government and business that we do." In appointing Mr Daley to Commerce, the president has hardly drawn a bright line himself.

<p><b>Australia
<h1>Big winners, big losers</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>SYDNEY
</font><p>THE prime minister has denounced them. So has the premier of New South Wales. Even Rupert Murdoch, bearer of breasts and bottoms in his newspapers, is agin them. They are breeding across Australia the way rabbits used to and, say their critics, are causing similar havoc. Adelaide's grand colonial railway station has been taken over by one. Melbourne has one of the biggest in the world. Even Alice Springs has one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past few years, the number of casinos in Australia has almost doubled. In 1992 there were eight; by 1995 there were 14. The mania for building them, from Perth to Queensland, has fed a gambling culture inherent in Australia from colonial times. For years, much gambling flourished illegally, particularly in New South Wales, the most populous state, where it was a source of police corruption.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The culture has changed dramatically since Australia's two biggest cities opened their first legal casinos, Melbourne in 1992 and Sydney two years later. Licensed under strict controls, these are no ordinary casinos, neither discreet like those in London nor glitzy like those in Las Vegas. They are mega-buildings, occupying prime sites of the sort once reserved for cathedrals and town halls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Sydney Harbour Casino is by one of the world's most magnificent harbours, where acres of old warehouses have been bulldozed to make way for a complex that will eventually include flats, a hotel and two theatres. The Crown Casino in Melbourne, nearing completion, is even more grandiose. Built across a freeway by the Yarra River, it comes with 25 restaurants, 40 bars and three nightclubs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Sydney casino's fortunes received a boost on January 13th when Kerry Packer, an Australian tycoon, announced an offer to take over its management, and a fifth of its ownership, from Showboat, an American casino operator. He had sought the casino licence, but was outbid by the American company. Mr Packer is not only Australia's richest man; he is also its most redoubtable gambler. Winning streaks apparently gained him $9m in Las Vegas in 1994 and another $20m a year later. After such successes, he happily dispenses tips of $25,000 to dealers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As part-owner--assuming the authorities give their approval--Mr Packer would be banned from playing in his own casino. That is unlikely to trouble him. Through his media company, Publishing and Broadcasting, he will be investing in one of Australia's biggest and fastest growing industries. Turnover from all forms of gambling in 1985 was A$61 billion ($47 billion), A$4,800 for every Australian. New South Wales, Mr Packer's home state, accounted for 43% of this. Mr Packer is also an investor in the Melbourne casino.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gambling breeds losers as well as winners. One of the first signs greeting visitors to the Sydney Harbour Casino offers a hotline telephone number for "problem gamblers". Addicts can register with security guards and have themselves excluded. In the casino's first 15 months of operation, nine customers received medical counselling after threatening to commit suicide. Bob Carr, the Labor premier of New South Wales, who took office after the Sydney licence had been awarded, has described casinos as "the scourge of our society".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No such inhibitions cramp Jeff Kennett, his Liberal counterpart in Victoria. Mr Kennett has dismissed a political storm over the awarding of the Crown Casino licence to companies with close links to the state's ruling Liberal Party. He maintains that all proprieties were respected.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politicians of all persuasions are mostly turning a blind eye to the social impact of gambling. In an era of smaller government and shrinking public revenue, the casinos and other forms of legalised gambling are a new source of money and jobs. Victoria now receives 14% of its state revenue from gambling taxes and licence fees, and hopes gambling will draw rich Asian tourists. New South Wales gets 12%. Jobs in the casino industry rose by 72% between 1992 and 1995, compared with only 5% in the Australian workforce as a whole. However, opponents of gambling take comfort from reports that casino profits are falling amid signs that the industry has reached saturation point. Its luck may be running out.

<p><b>Rwanda
<h1>Be fruitful</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>KIGALI
</font><p>THE maternity wards are packed. So are the churches, where dozens of young couples get married every Saturday amid soon-to-be grandparents shouting instructions from the pews to be fruitful and multiply. One popular <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt proclaims: "Let's Make Babies". 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though the slogan is not government policy, breeding has unofficially become a public duty, especially among the Tutsi minority, who lost maybe 750,000 of their kin in the genocide of 1994. "Too many people died. We want to repopulate," says 30-year-old Katherine Uwera, who lost most of her extended family in the killings. She has two toddlers at home, a baby strapped on her back, and plans for another soon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Demographically, Rwanda has undergone some erratic developments recently. After the massacres, over 2m Hutus fled into neighbouring countries and around 1m Tutsis--former refugees who fled in the past three decades, and their descendants--flooded in, herding 1m cows with them. The Tutsi rebels who fought their way to power are leading the baby boom by example: nearly every army officer you meet has another child on the way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, 1.2m of the Hutus who fled in 1994 to Zaire and Tanzania have come back, with large numbers of new-born children. For two years, the refugees enjoyed internationally provided health care. Though often described as squalid, the camps had birth rates far exceeding the death rates. No one knows for sure how many Hutu refugees are still in Zaire. Will they stay there, or make the trek home and, no doubt, multiply enthusiastically too?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One doctor has coined the term "revenge fertility" to describe what he believes is ethnic competition to procreate. Now that so many have returned, he says, "We're back at square one. Population pressure is worse than it was before."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is saying something. The former president, Juvenal Habyarimana, whose death when his plane was shot down in April 1994 gave the signal for the genocide, used to pour water into a full glass to demonstrate what would happen if Tutsi refugees came home. Rwanda, he said, was full. It is the most densely populated country in mainland Africa, with at least 7.2m people, most of them dependent on small farms, crammed into a space about the size of Sicily, or Maryland. In 1991, fertility ran at about seven children per woman, and the population, growing at 3.5% a year, was expected to reach 25m by the year 2030. Habyarimana set up a National Population Office. It was resented and ignored; the Catholic church had more influence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tutsis now in power long since dismissed Habyarimana's population arguments as politically inspired nonsense. "For most of the people it doesn't make sense to talk about family planning after genocide," says Maurice Bucago, the government's population expert. "They expect us to tell them to have babies. We have to be realistic." In fact, they need little telling. Contraception was never widespread; perhaps one couple in eight used it before the genocide. Now hardly anybody does.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is planning a "villagisation" programme to bring everyone in from their present scattered homes and plots and collect them in villages, where they can be given health and education services (and better controlled). Whether that will, in time, lead to wider use of birth control remains to be seen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The one force today against a population explosion is--not by coincidence--the worst: <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. Before 1994, it was reckoned that up to a quarter of adults in the capital, Kigali, were infected with <font size=-1>HIV</font>. In the countryside, where most Rwandans live, the rate was under 4%. Now researchers expect infection to jump. Many of the newly returned Hutu refugees are carrying the virus, which is thought to have spread wildly in the camps. And more and more people now live in towns--Kigali's pre-1994 population of 300,000 may have nearly doubled--where <font size=-1>AIDS</font> spreads more rapidly. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genocide was not a reaction to over-population; its roots were political. But over-exuberant procreation will only increase the fears and ethnic rivalry that the politicians were able to exploit.

<h1>Russia's surly answer to NATO</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW
</font><p><p><b>Russia was never expected to welcome NATO's eastward expansion (see <a href="eu1.gif">map</a>). But what it proposes to do about it is still uncertain</b></p>
<br>CONFRONTED with <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s arguments for edging eastward, Russia has decided to affect deafness--but not blindness. It sees that the expansion will probably occur. Parliament, government, the armed forces and the press are preoccupied with deciding how to respond. But so far they have sounded unreceptive, to say the least, to western suggestions for building new <font size=-1>NATO</font>-Russia relations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hostility towards a bigger, nearer <font size=-1>NATO</font> is almost universal. A group of admirals and generals published a letter in January calling on Boris Yeltsin to point nuclear missiles at the capital cities of <font size=-1>NATO</font> members. Anatoly Chubais, Mr Yeltsin's liberal-minded chief of staff, called the expansion of <font size=-1>NATO</font> "one of the worst ideas advanced by the West in recent years". Even Mikhail Gorbachev has found himself in tune for once with his country's mood. An expansion of <font size=-1>NATO</font>, he said, would mean that "the West's most hawkish, conservative and aggressive (and also most ignorant) circles have gained the upper hand".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until and unless Mr Yeltsin--who appeared on television on January 28th for the first time in three weeks--is fit for work, the man to listen to most closely amid the hubbub of Russian voices will be Yevgeny Primakov, the foreign minister. Characteristically, Mr Primakov has maintained a baleful calm. When <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s secretary-general, Javier Solana, came calling last week, Mr Primakov insisted on a formal, private meeting. He offered nothing that could have been construed as acquiescence, or as a threat. Russia's official position remained that <font size=-1>NATO</font> should offer a legally binding mechanism giving Russia a say equal to that of any <font size=-1>NATO</font> member (and thus, in effect, a veto) on anything affecting Russia's vital interests. That would include, above all, any expansion of <font size=-1>NATO</font> eastward.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>NATO</font> has proposed to Russia merely a declarative "charter". Possibly, therefore, no deal between Russia and <font size=-1>NATO</font> will be done before the <font size=-1>NATO</font> summit, set for July, at which invitations to one or more would-be entrants may be issued. Some Moscow commentators have foreseen humiliating consequences for Russia. A deal struck later, with an enlarged <font size=-1>NATO</font>, would need the blessing of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s new members, too. Former Soviet vassal-states would thus have a whip-hand over Russia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Primakov seems less worried. His main rule of diplomacy seems to be: better a long argument than a quick compromise. Better, in other words, for a weak Russia to keep alive all the disagreements and claims it can, until the time when it is a stronger country and better able to have its way. To withhold consent of any sort to <font size=-1>NATO</font> expansion, and so to have in place a bone of contention with the West for years to come, would be very much Mr Primakov's style.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, has taken a lead in linking <font size=-1>NATO</font> expansion with other East-West security deals. It was reluctant in any event to ratify <font size=-1>START-2</font>, a treaty with America to reduce arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons, seeing it as an imposition. Now it is withholding ratification explicitly as a hostage against <font size=-1>NATO</font> expansion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Duma's jingoists seem to care little that the obligations of <font size=-1>START-2</font> are finely balanced. Russia would have plenty to lose were the treaty to lapse. Possibly, America might think it worth trying to change the Duma's mind by offering to open negotiations on a <font size=-1>START-3</font> even without a ratification of its forerunner. But an offer of that sort would probably need a bilateral summit, and it is far from clear that Mr Yeltsin will be fit enough to keep a planned date with Bill Clinton in March.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After some early mutterings about abandoning the agreement on Conventional Forces in Europe (<font size=-1>CFE</font>), which was signed in 1990, Russia has settled for trying to revise the treaty through talks launched in January. It seems to view <font size=-1>CFE</font> as a possible way to obstruct both overall growth in <font size=-1>NATO</font> forces and any shift of resources towards new <font size=-1>NATO</font> members. At the same time, Russia wants more flexibility in the disposition of its own conventional armed forces near its borders. There is sympathy in the West for some of Russia's difficulties with <font size=-1>CFE</font>, since it was designed for confidence-building in a cold-war Europe. Yet Russia may still not get all it wants. Either way, it has set in motion a haggling match liable to run well into 1998. 
<br></p><p><b><b>A hug for old comrades?</b>
</b><br>Fresh tension with the West over <font size=-1>NATO</font> could, however, create some useful foreign-policy opportunities for Mr Primakov. One such would be to develop closer ties with "old friends" of Russia that are suspicious of, or hostile to, the United States. The list would include China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea (with which Russia is preparing a new friendship treaty, though it will not include the promise of military help enshrined in the old one) and perhaps Cuba. An alliance with China would offer the richest potential for mischief, though at some risk to Russia itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An expanding <font size=-1>NATO</font> would also give Russia, in its own eyes at least, more cause for interfering with the belt of countries immediately to its west--the aim being to "deny" these countries to <font size=-1>NATO</font> for the future. The Baltic states would face harassment designed both to worry away western investors and to remind <font size=-1>NATO</font> that the "Russia risk" here is a real one. Ukraine would face pressure to follow Belarus into much tighter relations with Russia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Russia's arms dealers and nuclear-power engineers, renewed tension with the West would be a definite blessing. They would have even less reason to feel inhibited about selling to all-comers. If that upset America, or other <font size=-1>NATO</font> countries (as with the recent proposed sale of a missile system to Cyprus), so much the better. Russia's generals, too, would exploit a new <font size=-1>NATO</font> "threat" in their struggle with the government for money to keep Russia's armed forces at their present hypertrophied size. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Security tensions might also affect foreign investment. Russia thinks of its natural resources as "strategic" assets, not just commercial ones. Foreign investors seeking stakes in oil and gas fields could find themselves suddenly less welcome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this need not change <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s mind about expansion. Most of the responses available to Russia carry a heavy price-tag for Russia itself. Given that Russia is weak and poor, as well as irritable, it might decide, wisely, that it could not afford to row too much with a West on which it still depended. But since there would also be strong Russian interests poised to profit from tension with the West, the possibility must remain of a tricky time ahead.

<h1>Steady as she sinks</h1>

<p><b>The Conservative campaign is barely out of port, and it's already in trouble</b></p>
<br>FOR the Tories to botch one relaunch might be regarded as misfortune. To botch them serially requires real carelessness, as events on January 27th demonstrated. Even as Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, was briefing the press in a pub near Chequers on the manifesto agreed by ministers earlier that day, his work was being undermined by a Labour ambush in the House of Commons which led to a headline-grabbing one-vote defeat for the government on its education bill.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The vote took place only because the government had lost a previous vote in a Commons committee when Tony Coombs, a Tory whip, missed it while hunting for an absent colleague. The government lost the vote on the floor of the Commons only because Mr Coombs had no one ready to keep speaking until Tory reinforcements could arrive. Indeed, it may really not have lost the vote at all, since Mr Coombs also appears to have miscounted the number of votes by one. The vote itself does not matter. But what does is the fact that, just as ministers wanted the public to contemplate five more sparkling years of Tory rule, the party itself was displaying, yet again, an almost comic incompetence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The truth is that the state of the Tory party is such that, whatever it tries, something goes wrong. Its problems include:
<br><font size=-1><li></font> <b>No majority</b>. The government and opposition parties are level-pegging in the Commons. Moreover, Labour has withdrawn co-operation after the government cheated in a pre-Christmas vote. The government is now permanently vulnerable to ambush.
<br><font size=-1><li></font> <b>Europe.</b> Every effort to pull the party together on the <font size=-1>EU</font> falls foul of its intrinsic divisions. Take the cabinet's decision on January 23rd to announce that it was "very unlikely" that Britain would join any European monetary union on January 1st 1999. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, agreed because he thinks that the rest of Europe will not go ahead then. Cabinet Eurosceptics emphasised that Britain would probably stay out even if it did. Result: yet more stories of Tory splits. 
<br><font size=-1><li></font> <b>Post-election leadership manoeuvring.</b> At first glance the decision of Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, to spend &#163;60m ($97m) on a new royal yacht to replace the clapped-out <i>Britannia </i>looked odd. This involved more public spending, just when the Tories are trying to pin the high-spending label on Labour. And it always threatened to provoke public ire. Sure enough, an <font size=-1>ICM</font> poll in the <i>Guardian </i>newspaper found a three-to-one majority against the idea. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However Mr Portillo was not trying to court the favour of the broader public, but of Tory activists and <font size=-1>MP</font>s. Saving the royal yacht was a plank of the platform on which John Redwood stood against John Major for the Tory leadership 18 months ago. Mr Portillo, who will compete with Mr Redwood for the right-wing vote in any post-election party-leadership contest, wanted to show that he does what Mr Redwood only talks about. His manoeuvre backfired badly. After he sought to make capital against Labour for questioning the project, the queen made known her concern at being dragged into politics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, the prospect of a post-election leadership contest hampered the government's response to the lost education vote. Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, was the obvious person to deal with it. But the government faced another embarrassing vote the next day on bringing back corporal punishment in schools. This is against government policy. Nevertheless Mrs Shephard recently courted right-wing support by backing it. So she had to make herself scarce while nearly 100 Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s defied the government in the caning vote. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beyond these tactical problems, the Tories are struggling with a debilitating strategic problem. Voters seem fed up with Tory radicalism. So Mr Major has announced that the big reforms are done. His draft manifesto, which abjures a full sell-off of the Post Office and of Channel 4 television, is broadly a consolidators' manifesto.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, voters also think that the Tories have run out of steam. So the party also needs to offer something new. After 18 years in office, the popular things have been done. Those things left to do, whatever their merits, are unpopular: privatising London Underground, putting more public services out to tender, more spending cuts. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories have chosen their slogans: "The Enterprise Centre of Europe"; "Opportunity for all"; "New Labour, New Danger". But these remain mere slogans. What the public actually sees is a divided party without a majority in the Commons and half of whose ministers are obsessed with a leadership contest which will come only if the Tories lose the election.

<h1>Election flutters</h1>

EVERY punter knows that two-horse races with a long odds-on favourite are a short cut to bankruptcy. Ladbrokes, one of Britain's biggest bookmakers, is now quoting Labour six to one on to win the 1997 general election. That means if you bet &#163;600 ($970) on Labour and the party wins, you gain &#163;100. Except you don't: there is a levy of 9% to pay on your return of &#163;700 (winnings plus bet), leaving you a meagre profit of &#163;37 on the &#163;600 you have risked. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why then does the betting industry still expect to take &#163;6m in bets on the 1997 election? To win customers, the bookies are offering more interesting bets--some of which are set out in the table. Already you can bet on Lib Dem seats (Ladbrokes is offering a mouthwatering 16 to 1 against "fewer than 13 seats" for third-party pessimists, or 14 to 1 against 32 or more seats for optimists). Hills, another bookmaker, offers 100 to 1 against a February election. For ultra-pessimists Ladbrokes offers 25 to 1 against two elections in 1997. (See <a href="br1.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the election approaches, the offerings will get weirder and more wonderful. Odds against individual cabinet ministers keeping their seats are promised, as well as on different results in Scotland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most knowing punters will avoid them in favour of "spread" betting. This works like spreads in financial markets. You could, for example, currently buy Labour seats with <font size=-1>IG</font> Index for &#163;10 a seat. For every seat Labour wins above 355 (which would give it an overall majority of 51), you win &#163;10; for every seat they fall short, you lose &#163;10. Or you could sell them at 349, winning &#163;10 for every one by which they fall short and losing &#163;10 for every one by which they exceed it. The margin between 349 and 355 provides the firm with its profit. The beauty of spread betting is that the stake is not fixed, and so, by a quirk of the law, tax is not paid on any winnings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>The Economist</i> hopes to make a few bob of its own with the bookies during the campaign. Our first bet: three to one against the Liberal Democrats taking Harrogate in competition with Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, offered by Ladbrokes. Mr Lamont may look home and hosed with a notional majority on the 1992 result of more than 9,000. But our correspondent on the Yorkshire gallops says that the Liberal Democrats have been making ground by branding Mr Lamont a southern carpetbagger, and there is a Labour vote of nearly 7,000 there to be squeezed. Remember: you read it here first.

<p><b>The Wirral South by-election
<h1>In the mire</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>WIRRAL SOUTH
</font><p>TONY BLAIR, the Labour Party leader, says he wants to make education a big issue at the general election, calculating that it is a vote-winner for Labour. The Tory campaign managers in the Wirral South by-election, due to be held by March 6th, are happy to oblige. In what promises to be a bitterly fought, perhaps even dirty, dry run for the general election, the Tories believe--against the polls and most expectations--that education can help them hold what was once a safe Tory seat. (See <a href="br2.gif">map</a>).
<br>On January 30th Eric Forth, an education minister, turned up at a local grammar school to confront David Blunkett, Labour's shadow education and employment secretary, who was visiting the school. Mr Blunkett would shut this school down, claimed Mr Forth, pressing home the government's claim that Labour intends to abolish grammar schools (ie, those that select pupils using an entrance exam) and grant-maintained schools (those that have opted-out of local-council control, often in order to keep their entrance exams). Council officials asked Mr Forth to leave because he had not been invited.
<br>Mr Blunkett insists that grammar schools will not be abolished unless local parents vote for it in a ballot, and proposes fairly small changes to the status of grant-maintained schools. Nevertheless, Tory big guns visiting Wirral South have been blasting away at Labour's education policy: Virginia Bottomley, the heritage secretary, lambasted Mr Blair and Harriet Harman, the shadow social-security secretary, for sending their children to grant-maintained and grammar schools while supposedly seeking to deny that opportunity to others.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With so much at stake, both parties are gearing up for a battle. Labour has filled a disused supermarket with computers and staff from London; the Tories have done likewise in a couple of small factory units. So far, though, all this effort and imported talent has not lifted the campaign above the level of mud slinging. Since Barry Porter, the local Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>, died in November, Labour's first-choice candidate, a union official, had to quit following allegations of domestic violence. The Liberal Democrats are on their third candidate after the second quit because of claims that his employers were investigating him. The Tories have managed to hold on to their first choice, but they were knocked sideways on January 27th when a Tory councillor in the constituency was jailed for five years for rape.
<br>Labour's misfortune allowed the party's National Executive Committee to impose a candidate more likely to please the wealthier locals: a former civil servant named Ben Chapman. Somewhat embarrassing, however, is the fact that Mr Chapman joined the Labour Party only last year. Les Byrom, the Tory candidate, promptly labelled him a "carpetbagger". Some disgruntled members of the local Labour Party agree, although they are loth to say so in public. Aides to Mr Chapman, who lives in the constituency, replied by claiming that Mr Byrom, a councillor on the other side of the Mersey, is the outsider.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories are staking their hopes on education because selective schools have proved popular and successful in Wirral South. In the industrial Merseyside towns of Wallasey and Birkenhead, the secondary schools are all mixed-ability "comprehensives". But in the greener commuter-beltlands to the west and south of the Wirral peninsula, primary pupils who pass tests go to local grammar schools and those who fail (or do not sit the tests) go to secondary moderns. About half of the area's primary-school children sat the tests on January 28th, although only about a third of these aspirants will get into the four local grammar schools, two of which are also grant-maintained.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Wirral South's middle-income voters do not want their grammar schools tampered with. They make up most of the constituency's electorate (81% of the 60,500 voters own their home, 74% have at least one car, 46% have professional or management jobs) and are exactly the kind of people Mr Blair has to persuade to vote Labour if he is to win power nationally. Labour's policy towards grammar schools has shifted a long way since the Labour government of Harold Wilson--Wirral Grammar School for Boys' most famous ex-pupil--abolished many of them. Now, says Mr Blunkett, abolition is not on the agenda. He claims it is more important to get on with improving standards in England's 4,000 comprehensive schools than to fight over the 161 grammar schools.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the Tories in Wirral South argue that recent claims by Graham Lane, chairman of the Council of Local Education Authorities, that councils will start phasing out selection soon after Labour is elected, reveal the true state of affairs. Rubbish, says Mr Chapman: "I can categorically state that is not the case." Nevertheless Labour remains sensitive about the issue, and the party's press officers are edgy whenever education is mentioned.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ironically, both parties may be over-estimating the importance of education to the constituency's voters. Even in Heswall, the poshest part of Wirral South, where the electorate has always chosen Tory councillors, disillusionment with the government seems to run as deep as it does in the rest of the country. "They say one thing one minute and do another the next," says Florence Johnson, a life-long Tory voter who is now undecided. Her view bears out one poll in the seat which found a 16% swing to Labour, twice what Labour needs to win.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be because people think it is time to give Labour a chance to tackle other more urgent problems. Despite the Tories' claim to be the party of law and order, crime levels in Wirral South, like the rest of Merseyside, remain stubbornly high. A review by Wirral Health Authority, aimed at cutting the number of hospital beds for old people, does not sound like an inducement to vote Tory either.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is difficult to believe that Tory attacks on Labour's education policy can, alone, turn this tide. The last time Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council tried to change the grammar schools into comprehensives was in February 1988. Labour councillors, supported by the then alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats, pushed a plan to abolish selection through the council.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This scheme, vigorously opposed by the local Tories, was eventually vetoed by the government. But that was after local people showed they were not all that upset by it. In the local elections in May 1988, Labour gained five seats, four from the Tories and one from the alliance parties. It seems that local issues do not necessarily win votes, even in local elections.

<p><b>British defence policy
<h1>Labour approaches a minefield</h1>

</b></p><p><b>If elected, the Labour Party has promised to carry out a fundamental review of Britain's defence priorities. The result would probably be a smaller defence budget--and perhaps the withdrawal of the British army from Germany</b></p>
<br>DEFENCE used to offer the Tories one of their strongest electoral cards. Even after the Labour Party scrapped its policy of unilaterally getting rid of nuclear weapons, in 1988, Conservatives claimed that Britain's security would not be safe in Labour hands. Over the past five years, however, while David Clark has been shadow defence secretary, Labour has by and large supported government policies, blunting Tory attacks. Defence is thus unlikely to be much of an issue in the coming election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Labour wins the election, however, defence could become one of the hottest political potatoes that Tony Blair has to handle. For Labour has promised to complete a strategic defence review within six months of taking office. "We want to assess the security risks facing Britain and its allies and ensure that we have the means to address those risks," says Mr Clark, who will probably be Labour's defence secretary. A modest but assiduous Cumbrian who gets on well with military men, Mr Clark resigned from Labour's front bench in 1981 to protest against the party's decision to support unilateral nuclear disarmament.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clark argues that the Conservatives' defence cuts have been driven by Treasury demands for cash, rather than a serious attempt to balance commitments and resources. "Our review should not be seen as a cost-cutting exercise," he says. "We want to keep, roughly, to current levels of spending." Mr Clark is doubtless sincere when he says that. But if the review concluded that some of Britain's military capabilities were superfluous, a smaller defence budget would surely follow. (See <a href="br3.gif">chart</a>)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although there has been no formal, strategic defence review since 1981, the armed forces have been subject to continual reappraisal since the end of the cold war. In real terms, defence spending is a fifth less than it was in 1990. The number of personnel in uniform has shrunk from 306,000 in 1990 to 216,000 today. Britain has scrapped two of its three armoured divisions and is pulling the <font size=-1>RAF</font> out of Germany. Last year, in an effort to make the three services work more closely together, the governent established a "Joint Rapid Deployment Force", suitable for dealing with sudden crises, and a "Permanent Joint Headquarters", to manage any expeditionary force.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since 1990, British defence has evolved from being "threat-based"--focused on how to stop a Russian invasion of Western Europe--to "capability-based". The annual defence white paper lists 50 military tasks which the armed forces may have to perform, together with the personnel and equipment the tasks would require.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each task supports one of three broad defence roles. The first is "the protection and security of the United Kingdom and its dependent territories". Tasks that fall under that heading include, for instance, ensuring the security of Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands. A second role is "promoting Britain's wider security interests through the maintenance of international peace and stability". That means contributing to multilateral peacekeeping missions, as well as tougher operations such as the liberation of Kuwait and some oddities like reinforcing the Sultanate of Brunei.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is not a lot of scope for cutting back on commitments to those two broad roles, given the likely need to maintain troops in Northern Ireland and to provide peacekeepers. So much of the review will focus on the third: "to insure against a major external threat to the United Kingdom or our allies". This covers the tasks fulfilled by British forces within <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s military structure--tasks that are ripe for scrutiny now that Russia is less menacing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite successive rounds of defence cuts, Britain has retained, in theory, virtually all the military capabilities it had ten years ago. Only the ability to deliver nuclear bombs by aircraft has been lost. But capabilities have been shaved and shaved again--sometimes to the bone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past few years, for example, the <font size=-1>RAF</font> has been so short of spare engines that many of its fighters have been grounded. And the army faces a real problem of "overstretch". Under Ministry of Defence rules, units are supposed to spend 24 months between spells of active duty, so that they can rest, train and prepare for future missions. But for many regiments this period is much shorter: engineers are down to 12 months. One tank regiment has spent the last five summers on missions away from its base, and marriages have suffered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ministry of Defence officials argue that Britain must retain a full range of military capabilities. Once a skill, such as the ability to run aircraft carriers, disappears, they claim, it may take 15 years to regain it--and no one can be sure that the world will be benign that far ahead. And then foreigners simply cannot be trusted to provide the things that Britain lacks, say officials: remember the perfidious Belgians, who would not sell Britain ammunition during the Gulf war?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus the defence establishment hopes for a modest defence review. But many defence academics hope for radical changes. They argue that, if Britain keeps trying to do everything in a period when resources are likely to diminish, the ability of the forces to fight effectively could be impaired. For instance there would be less time and money for training, while constant cash cuts could sap morale. They argue that Britain's forces are no longer large enough to fight a serious war alone, and that it would be better to drop some capabilities and share roles with allies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact there is already some role-sharing: the British have neither spy satellites nor aeroplanes large enough to carry armoured vehicles, but count on the Americans to provide them. And the Germans, who are keeping a conscript army geared mainly to territorial defence, will never want to do as much peacekeeping as the British and the French. Philip Sabin of King's College, London, argues that, since the Germans have a large army and lots of good tanks, they could look after armoured warfare on the continent but lean on the British for naval protection. Similarly, the British have excellent attack submarines and the French large aircraft carriers; could not each rely on the other's ships?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The services' complaint about all this is that the quality of other European forces--with the possible exception of the French--is not up to scratch. And one sceptical <font size=-1>RAF</font> officer invokes the following scenario: "Suppose the French are involved in a Central African war and call on us to provide equipment--but we disapprove of their actions. What do we do?" Europe's slow progress towards common foreign policies certainly makes role-sharing difficult. Despite this, some senior Labour Party figures like the idea.
<br></p><p><b><b>Attacking armour</b>
</b><br>The defence review's first question should be to ask: what role in the world does Britain want to play? The military and diplomatic establishment will argue that it should be capable, like France, of projecting force globally, and of playing a leading role in allied coalitions. Then Britain could maintain its claim to a permanent seat at the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council. Some would argue, however, that Britain should imitate Japan or Italy--countries which focus on commercial interests, spend little on defence and, when world crises blow up, follow the lead of others.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour will want Britain to remain a European power. But how strong a power? The answer would have a big influence on what are certain to be the defence review's most contentious arguments: should Britain retain a serious commitment to armoured warfare, and should the army remain in Germany?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British army has eight tank regiments (with a total of 500 tanks), three armoured reconnaissance regiments, 12 armoured and mechanised infantry regiments and 16 regiments of artillery. There are only 21 general infantry batallions. Recent equipment orders--such as the Challenger 2 tank, the Apache attack helicopter, a new tank-busting missile and the <font size=-1>AS90</font> self-propelled gun--have been geared to the heavy end of warfare.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus much of the army is still orientated towards a major armoured conflict in Europe--the one sort of war it is now less likely to fight. Some defence analysts believe that, because anti-armour weapons are increasingly potent, tanks may soon be as redundant as battleships. Royal Navy and <font size=-1>RAF</font> planners like to point out that Britain could not be defended without ships and aeroplanes, but that tanks are not essential to national defence. Mobility is now recognised as one of the greatest military virtues, yet tanks take weeks to move from one country to another. Should the army not focus on a smaller but more mobile armoured force--perhaps buying some large transport planes with the money saved from winding up a few armoured regiments?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Definitely not, reply the generals. They argue that soldiers trained in high-intensity conflict can still perform in "low-intensity" situations such as peacekeeping. But if they have trained only for the latter, they cannot do the former. And they argue that armour is increasingly relevant to peacekeeping: the lightly-armed <font size=-1>UN</font> mission to Bosnia proved ineffective, while the weightier <font size=-1>NATO</font> force which followed succeeded in intimidating all sides. In Bosnia the British army does have tanks--which, unlike attack helicopters, can hold ground.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The generals further claim that, if Britain did not have armoured forces of such quality and strength, its allies would not accept the leading role that it plays in <font size=-1>NATO</font> operations. If Britain could no longer mobilise a complete armoured division, as it did during the Gulf war, they say, it might have to give up command of the <font size=-1>ARRC</font>--the mobile <font size=-1>NATO</font> corps headquarters which ran Ifor, the "implementation force" in Bosnia last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But such fears are probably exaggerated. Every <font size=-1>NATO</font> country--bar Greece and Turkey--has been cutting the strength of its forces. These days the best way to impress one's <font size=-1>NATO</font> partners is to provide big contributions to multilateral forces like that in Bosnia. Keeping hundreds of tanks in Germany is no longer so important.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument over armour cannot be separated from the argument over Germany. Britain's armoured division in Germany, with its equipment and 26,000 soldiers, costs the British taxpayer &#163;1.35 billion a year but serves little military purpose. In any case, if the Russians suddenly invaded, British attack helicopters--which may be more effective than tanks at stopping tanks--could support <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s defence. The short-term costs of repatriating a division would be considerable, but in the long run it would be cheaper to keep soldiers in Britain than in Germany. Some senior Labour figures want the army out of Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason why the army is keen to stay is the paucity of barracks and training areas in Britain. If the division did return to Britain, many of its tanks would have to train overseas, creating extra costs. Thus many generals are convinced--probably rightly--that quitting Germany would in practice mean pruning the armoured regiments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the biggest reason for staying in Germany, according to the defence establishment, is political. Britain's presence is a symbol of its commitment to the collective defence of Europe. The Germans want the British to stay--and not only because of their spending power. They have a visceral belief that defence should be multinational, and were thus annoyed by France's recent decision to withdraw its army from Germany. Even more important, the Americans will want Britain to stay. If Britain quits Germany, America will be the only country with foreign troops on German soil, and Congress may be less willing to maintain that commitment.
<br></p><p><b><b>Countless questions</b>
</b><br>The answers to the questions about armoured power and Germany will depend, to some extent, on the government's view of Russia. While it poses little threat today, could it be a menace in 20 years? It is probably too early to be sure that its government would be peaceful. Russia's nuclear arsenal and its warplanes will remain formidable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Britain wants a fighter that can beat the likes of the Su-35, it will need something as capable as the Eurofighter. The present government plans to order 230, at a cost of &#163;10 billion (&#163;4 billion has already been spent on development). Labour would not cancel Eurofighter and buy a cheaper American alternative because that would destroy British jobs and damage Britain's ability to make advanced fighters in the future. But a Labour government might want fewer than 230. The Germans, after all, are buying only 180 Eurofighters. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On a range of other procurement decisions, Labour's policy is likely to be similar to the Tories': an uneasy compromise between attempts to save money through putting contracts out to international tender, and the desire to preserve manufacturing jobs and expertise in Britain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour would have to decide whether to replace the ageing Tornado bombers with a new aircraft. Options now under study include the purchase of America's planned Joint Strike Fighter and the conversion of Eurofighter into a bomber--although neither would give the <font size=-1>RAF</font> an aircraft with the range it wants. There will probably not be enough money to develop a new bomber from scratch. It is not self-evident that Britain needs a long-range bomber, now that the navy is installing Tomahawk cruise missiles in submarines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's three small aircraft carriers--and the Harrier planes they carry--will be at the end of their working lives before the next decade is out. Because of the long lead times needed for building carriers, the next government will probably have to decide what sort, if any, it requires. Some analysts believe carriers redundant, on account of their vulnerability to cruise missiles. However the navy sees them as ideal vehicles for military operations far from Britain's shores. It would like to buy larger carriers and hopes to fly a version of America's Joint Strike Fighter from them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The navy will have its work cut out to convince Labour that all of its 35 frigates and destroyers are required. It will argue that the projection of power to distant climes is an increasingly relevant capability, and that surface ships are therefore more necessary than ever. But a lot of them were built to chase Soviet submarines that are no longer threatening. Many analysts believe that 25 frigates and destroyers would be ample for Britain's needs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The navy has a dozen nuclear-powered attack submarines, and the government is due to award &#163;1.25 billion-worth of contracts to replace the three oldest. One of their prime roles, the protection of the four nuclear-missile Trident submarines, appears less urgent these days. Labour may well conclude that Britain could get by with fewer--and thus forego new ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the navy's arguments for maintaining the size of its fleet is that it needs to be present in East Asia. As a signatory of the Five Power Defence Arrangement (with Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand) Britain has moral but not legal obligations to help defend those countries. The navy often takes part in joint exercises with their fleets. Defence agreements with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as close military ties with Saudi Arabia, do--unlike the Five Power Defence Arrangement--bring the bonus of lucrative arms contracts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The navy hopes to find a new role for some frigates by fitting them with anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptors. The present government, having reviewed the danger of ballistic missiles to troops overseas and to the civilian population, has been promising to announce a policy on missile defence since last year. A Labour government would have to take awkward and perhaps costly decisions on this threat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's defence review would certainly scrutinise Britain's capacity to wage amphibious warfare--that is, to mount an opposed landing from the sea. Last year the government ordered two new amphibious landing platforms--designed to carry men, equipment and landing craft--for a cost of &#163;450m. But some senior figures within the Ministry of Defence argue that modern missiles make Normandy-style landings too risky to undertake. They would buy helicopter-carriers instead of the platforms.
<br>The army may try to make a case for increasing its current strength of 110,000. Given both the likelihood that peacekeepers will remain in great demand, and the Labour Party's strong commitment to the <font size=-1>UN</font>, the army should perhaps employ more infantrymen and engineers. Some of the army's senior officers would like to reduce the number of territorial regiments. These reserves have provided specialists such as doctors to serve in Bosnia. But most of the territorials serve no military purpose and they cost &#163;320m a year. Any attack on the territorials would prove controversial, for they have powerful defenders among backbenchers in the House of Commons.
<br></p><p><b><b>The way we were</b>
</b><br>The Labour leadership, busy with more pressing subjects than defence, appears not to have realised how many minefields surround the review. For a fundamental review might well conclude that Britain could remain a medium-sized, internationally active military power, and yet still spend substantially less on defence. In the opinion of Bradford University's Malcolm Chalmers, "Britain could reduce the defence budget by 15-20% &#91;&#163;3 billion-4 billion&#93; over six years, and yet still remain a military power comparable to France." Even a senior Ministry of Defence official admits that savings of &#163;1 billion should be feasible over three to four years. If Labour is prepared to embrace bold options, the service chiefs will be up in arms. The Tories would certainly back the generals--and defence could become a contentious political issue, just like in the old days.

<p><b>Demergers and acquisitions
<h1>Cut and paste</h1>

</b></p><p><b>For all their complexity, markets can be simple-minded. Companies soon</b></p> <p><b>learn to give themselves a clear label if they want to please investors</b></p>
<br>LONG ago, in the 1970s and 1980s, markets admired the company that could stretch its brand and managerial flair across everything from widget-making to catering. Those days are gone. Woe betide the company that now tries to straddle the fences with which the capital markets are partitioned. As January drew to a close, the fashion for focus swept through PepsiCo, a maker of fizzy drinks and crunchy snacks, and on to Hilton Hotels. Depth, rather than breadth--sticking to lasts rather than spreading wings--is what investors crave. 
<br>Surrendering to the logic that says that running restaurants is not like making food and drink, and that the two are best kept separate, PepsiCo announced on January 23rd that it would spin off its sizeable fast-food business. The business has three main chains, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and <font size=-1>KFC</font> (once called Kentucky Fried Chicken), and had revenues of $11.3 billion in 1995, more than a third of PepsiCo's $30.4 billion total revenues. Its share of operating profits, however, was closer to a quarter: $867m out of a total of $3.67 billion. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Wall Street, the demerger is a relief. It likes to assess restaurant businesses by their cash flows, whereas packaged goods such as drinks and snacks are gauged by their earnings. Analysts tend to be either restaurant specialists or food and drink experts. They found it more of a headache to work out how well PepsiCo was doing than to assess Coca-Cola, Pepsi's great rival for fizzy drinks, or McDonald's, both famously single-minded companies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same monomaniacal urge--driving firms to unite, this time, rather than divide--lies behind Hilton Hotels' offer on January 27th to spend $6.5 billion on buying <font size=-1>ITT</font>, which owns the rival Sheraton hotel chain, a takeover that would create the world's biggest hotel and gambling group. <font size=-1>ITT</font> is itself one of the fragments of a big bang in June 1995, when a much larger <font size=-1>ITT</font>, with an annual turnover of $25.2 billion, split itself three ways, into an insurance company, an industrial manufacturer, and the future target of today's Hilton bid. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That break-up had symbolic power, as the old <font size=-1>ITT</font> had been a darling of management theory in the 1960s and 1970s, amassing disparate businesses into a huge conglomerate. Coincidentally, this week also sees the beginning of the final chapter of the demerger of Hanson, the British conglomerate which succeeded <font size=-1>ITT</font> in the 1980s as a model of diversified business, but which has spent the 1990s taking itself apart again. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When conglomerates were in vogue, there were two main arguments for them. First, they allowed managers to draw off cash from well-established parts of their firm and feed them into riskier operations with greater potential. Second, they were insulated from the business cycle: one part of the company might be being battered, but another part in an unconnected business would be doing well enough to carry the group through the rough patch.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither argument holds much sway any more. The first has been demolished by the growth of global capital markets. Investors today want to decide for themselves which new businesses to speculate in, and what share of their money to invest in stable cash-generators, rather than leave this decision to some mogul. And, as business cycles have moderated since the roller-coaster 1970s, the second argument has come to seem less important. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For all that, it is not clear that PepsiCo's shareholders will gain much extra value through having a stake in a separate restaurant business. Restaurants face tough competition in the United States, where PepsiCo has most of its businesses, and where fast-food shops have sprouted on every block. Besides, part of PepsiCo's original reason for buying restaurants was to gain distribution channels for its drinks. Although the terms of the spin-off will probably ensure that Pepsi is still favoured over Coke, too many restrictions on the restaurants will make it harder for the new company to thrive. So PepsiCo will lose one valuable aspect of restaurant ownership. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, Andrew Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argues that Pepsi should have sold Frito-Lay, its snack-food division, rather than the restaurants. The snacks business is a booming operation that made profits of $1.4 billion on sales of $8.5 billion in 1995--so it is fully capable of thriving on its own, or of attracting buyers. By spinning it off and by selling the stodgy American bottling division of its drinks business, Pepsi could have released more value for shareholders and still reduced the number of businesses for its bosses to concentrate on, another goal urged by demerger enthusiasts. 
<br></p><p><b><b>Focus, please</b>
</b><br>Hilton's move is less controversial. The hotel industry is consolidating, as global brands start to capitalise on the advantages of international marketing and computerised reservation systems. Stephen Bollenbach, Hilton's boss, is a zealous deal-maker. In his first year in charge he has already spent $3 billion buying up Bally's casinos; struck a deal with Ladbroke, a British company which owns the Hilton International name outside America, to reunite the hotel chain worldwide; and spent a further $500m on other hotels.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it happens, Mr Bollenbach will still have to decide what to do with some extra <font size=-1>ITT</font> businesses that were tidied away into the hotel group in the 1995 split--some sports teams and a few publishing operations. They may need to be spun or sold or spliced into something else.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It undoubtedly makes sense for a company to grow in an area in which it has expertise. But arbitrarily restricting operations to one of the categories into which analysts like to sort firms can sometimes limit opportunities. The stockmarket's love of simplicity betrays its own imperfections. Its sheer size means that investors, advisers, and even whole institutions can know about only a small part of the global capital market: indeed, that is why they partition it. Pepsi will certainly look tidier after it clears away the fast food. But, by choosing the easy option, it may not in fact have hit on the healthiest diet.

<p><b>Japanese cars
<h1>Fads on wheels</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>TOKYO AND NAGOYA
</font><p>IT IS the typography of Honda's new <font size=-1>S-MX</font> that gives the game away. The <font size=-1>M</font>, turned on its side, resembles an <font size=-1>E</font>. But even without a name that looks remarkably like <font size=-1>SEX</font>, the car's dark windows show what Honda expects its customers to use it for. The seats fold down to make a double bed and, the marketing blurb helpfully points out, there is a handy place to store tissues. Unsurprisingly, Honda sold 15,000 of these motorised boudoirs in the first two weeks after their launch in mid November. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The success of the <font size=-1>S-MX</font> illustrates how rapidly the Japanese car market is changing. Standard saloon cars are losing their popularity as Japanese consumers turn to recreational vehicles (<font size=-1>RV</font>s) in ever greater numbers. But different sorts of <font size=-1>RV</font>s are proliferating. The winners in this segmenting market have been companies, such as Toyota and Honda, that have launched the most new models. The losers have been the other domestic manufacturers and foreign car makers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The popularity of <font size=-1>RV</font>s is growing in most big countries, but in Japan it has been phenomenal. The definition of what constitutes an <font size=-1>RV</font> is a bit vague (in Honda's case, it includes a procreational vehicle) but the term seems to include any car that is not a coup&eacute; or a saloon. So the numbers call for caution. Nevertheless, the growth in the <font size=-1>RV</font> market has been eye-catching (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Last year <font size=-1>RV</font>s accounted for 45% of Toyota's and more than half of Honda's car sales.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why are they so popular? Partly, perhaps, because they provide the cramped Japanese with an extra room--be it lounge or bedroom. In addition, says Susumu Uchikawa, Toyota's head of domestic sales, Japanese consumers are increasingly choosing their cars according to their lifestyles. Last year Honda launched, among others, cars targeted at women, the elderly and the rich in their late 30s or 40s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And, yes, <font size=-1>RV</font>s are popular because they are "cool". Mitsubishi's Pajero is rugged enough to cope with the great outdoors. Yet few of those being driven around the streets of Tokyo are likely to see a speck of mud. The brochure for the <font size=-1>CR-V</font>, a sort of jeep introduced by Honda last October, sports a cowboy leaning on his car against a backdrop of tower blocks--an urban cowboy if ever there was one. The car has become a fashion accessory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To keep up with fashion means, says Matthew Ruddick, an analyst at <font size=-1>HSBC</font> James Capel, a stockbroker, carving niches in a crowded market. Launching lots of models helps. Last year Toyota launched 11 models (many of them <font size=-1>RV</font>s), compared with eight models the year before and six in 1991. It expects to introduce at least as many models this year as last. This, and an aggressive marketing campaign, helped the firm to claw its way back to a one-third share of Japan's car market at the end of last year. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honda, too, has been bringing out new models by the trunkful. Last year it introduced seven new or completely remodelled cars, compared with three the year before. In October, the company overtook Mitsubishi as Japan's third-largest carmaker. Both Mitsubishi and Nissan, the second-largest, launched fewer models. Mazda managed just one--and its share of the market slipped to around 4.5%. Henry Wallace, Mazda's newish and <i>gaijin</i> (foreign) president, says that the company must come out with new products and do so more quickly than in the past.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fickle fashion has been unkind to foreign car makers. Their share of the Japanese market, after rising strongly for several years, slid from almost 10% in June to just over 7% in November, although it blipped up in December. A weak yen has not helped: since the beginning of 1996, the yen has declined 13% against the dollar, making imported cars more expensive. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is a more fundamental problem: foreign cars are not designed for the Japanese market. The Japanese buy <font size=-1>BMW</font>, Mercedes and Porsche for snob value, but American cars hold little cachet. Between them, the big three American manufacturers sell only a couple of <font size=-1>RV</font>s in Japan. Most of their offerings are saloon cars. Small wonder that in December the three American car makers between them sold 3,913 cars--barely 1% of the market. Still, it would be strange if another trade row erupted partly because American car firms had failed to design a love hotel on wheels.

<h1>Watch your step</h1>

<font size=1>CHICAGO
</font><p>COMMON wisdom has it that futures trading is best done by a lot of screaming people jammed together in a pit. Economists call it a "continuous double auction" and it is widely regarded as the most efficient way of matching buyers with sellers. But in practice, of course, the process might not work that smoothly. Witness the rancour at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (<font size=-1>CME</font>), where in elections on January 16th a quarrel over floor practices led to a heap of directors being dumped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble centres on floor brokers, whose job it is to buy and sell contracts for clients. Increasingly, they have been clubbing together to share profits. But the "broker associations" have been accused of collusion and market domination--not by their clients, but by other traders who complain about the "street gangs in the pits". It was those independent traders who staged the electoral uprising.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year regulators renewed investigations into whether the associations inhibit competition. Strictly speaking, any order to the floor should be yelled out in the "auction", so that any trader in the pit can offer a price. The <font size=-1>CME</font>, however, allows 25% of trades to be transacted within an association. That is odd enough in a market supposedly dedicated to obtaining the best price for investors. But competitors charge that association members regularly overstep the limit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are also complaints that the associations have too much control over the flow of customer orders into the pit. This gives them excessive economic power over independent brokers or people in the pits who are trading for themselves. Last year, in a much discussed case, a trader at the <font size=-1>CME </font>sold his prime spot on the top step of a pit for a whopping $1m. And how did he claim ownership of a spot to which every trader supposedly has an equal right? Tacit rules, influenced by the broker associations, determine who stands where. In this case, those rules turned a piece of common property into a valuable private asset--proving once again that a good trader can make money in any market.

<h1>Testing testing</h1>

<p><b>Clinical trials are an essential--and expensive--part of drug development. Moves to make them more efficient are welcome news for patients and pharmaceutical companies alike</b></p>
<br>IN DEVELOPING a new drug, there are few quick fixes. First, an original design has to be dreamed up. Then its potential needs to be demonstrated in test tubes and laboratory animals. After that it must go through three separate phases of clinical trial on human guinea pigs to show that it is safe, and that it does what it is supposed to do. Only then will patients start to get better, and the money begin to roll in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For drug developers, half of the waiting--and the paying--lies in those trials. In America it takes, on average, $86m and just over nine years to go from the first human tests of a substance to final regulatory approval. Figures from Europe are similar. And for every five compounds entering the initial stages of human testing, only one will cross the finishing line into the market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The consequences of failure can be stark, particularly for smaller companies. This January the share price of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology firm based in Tarrytown, New York, fell 43% in one day when clinical trials showed that its main product--brain-derived neurotrophic factor--did not work as a treatment for Lou Gehrig's disease (a degenerative neuromuscular disorder). Now the health of Regeneron, as well as that of the participants in the trials, is in doubt.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Speeding up the testing and approval process, thus enabling the duds to be dropped more quickly, would help both people and companies--as long as it could be done without compromising safety.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, America's Food and Drug Administration (<font size=-1>FDA</font>)--the federal organisation that gives new drugs the go-ahead--was famous both for its stringency and for its slowness. By the late 1980s it was taking over two and a half years, on average, to trawl through all the data from the clinical trials of a drug before approving it (see <a href="$link next.html chart"></a>). 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For some drugs it was worse. New cancer medicines would often reach British patients almost three years before they got to their American counterparts. Certain respiratory drugs were available in Britain more than half a decade before American doctors were allowed to use them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The justification for this was thoroughness. But there is little evidence that Britain was courting more risks by being swifter. Indeed, a study by Kenneth Kaitin of Tufts University in Boston, and his colleagues, found that the recall rates of drugs after they had been approved for sale were only slightly higher in Britain (4%) than in America (3%).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Things improved somewhat after 1989 as a result of special "fast-track" rules that had been introduced for <font size=-1>AIDS</font> drugs. Then, in 1992, Congress gave the <font size=-1>FDA</font> five years to speed up its act across the board, and the power to collect more than $300m from drug companies to help in this. The money has been used to computerise the system (until a pilot study in 1994, applications had to be sent in as bundles of papers) and to hire 600 new reviewers. This seems to have worked. Computerisation alone has cut 11 months from the approval process, and in 1996 the agency passed almost twice as many new compounds as it had done in 1995, with an average review time of only 20 months.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a good start. But no amount of bureaucratic reform will make the trials themselves any faster. If anything, recent pressure has been the other way. The diseases being tackled today are no longer simple infections whose course runs for a few days or weeks, but complex, long-term ailments such as Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis. According to Joseph DiMasi, a health-care economist who also works at Tufts, new drugs approved by the <font size=-1>FDA</font> in 1994-95 spent an average of 7.7 years in trials on people--more than twice as long as such tests took in the 1960s, and a year longer even than they took in the early 1990s.
<br></p><p><b><b>Fast-track, false trail?</b>
</b><br>There may, however, be a faster way. Traditional trials have relied on clinical end-points--clear signs of medical efficacy or a lack of it. You get better, you get worse, you live longer, or you die sooner than people on existing treatments or on no treatment at all. Now, more reliance is being placed on "surrogate" end-points--biological markers that may be able to predict how a patient will fare. In the past four years, surrogate end-points have been used by the <font size=-1>FDA</font> to approve 25 new drugs for life-threatening diseases such as <font size=-1>AIDS</font> and cancer. The new rules have led to rapid trials for drugs such as the new anti-<font size=-1>AIDS</font> protease inhibitors. Saquinavir, the first of these, took less than three years to test and under 100 days to approve.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surrogate end-points tend to be bodily changes that can be measured easily in a test tube or a clinic. Some anti-cancer drugs, for example, have been approved in the past ten months because they are able to slow down the growth of tumours, not because they have a proven ability to prolong patients' lives. Better understanding of how cancers develop has allowed the response of the tumour to speak, as it were, for the whole patient, and thus to persuade the <font size=-1>FDA</font> to approve drugs before their clinical usefulness is established beyond doubt. The agency does, however, require a manufacturer to come up with this proof eventually if its drug is to stay on the market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using surrogate end-points has certainly speeded up trials. It has also allowed trials to be more flexible: since survival is no longer the bottom line, it is possible to include those who are a little further from death's door when a trial starts. Though simple to measure, however, surrogate end-points are not always easy to accept. This is particularly true in the controversial world of <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. Some drugs designed to slow down the disease, such as dd<font size=-1>C</font>, were approved in the early 1990s because they were able to maintain levels of <font size=-1>CD</font>4 immune cells in people's bloodstreams. Since these cells are prime targets for <font size=-1>HIV</font> (the virus that causes <font size=-1>AIDS</font>) it was thought that such cell counts could reliably predict the clinical outcome of the disease. The more <font size=-1>CD</font>4 cells a patient had, the longer, it was presumed, he would live. But this is not always so, as later research has shown. So now there is another surrogate--viral load. How much a drug lowers the number of virus particles in the blood ought, on the face of much laboratory research, to be a good indicator of future health. But it is not yet formally proved, a fact that troubles many <font size=-1>AIDS</font> activists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such surrogate short-cuts are useful for dangerous diseases, where the desperation of patients and a lack of alternative treatments outweigh the risk of a new compound being approved before its time. But they are not so easily applied to most new drugs--those destined for the thousands of less serious woes that flesh is heir to. Here the balance between safety and speed is different, and disagreement stronger. <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>RMA</font>, the American pharmaceutical industry's trade association, thinks that far more potions should be given rapid nods: treatments for heart disease, arthritis and strokes, at least, should join the list. But no regulatory agency or drug firm wants the blame for another thalidomide tragedy.
<br></p><p><b><b>Less haste, more speed</b>
</b><br>Still, subtle changes in clinical trials can smooth the way for less spectacular remedies. Much time and money is wasted in unnecessary and uninformative tests. According to a continuing study by the Centre for Drug Development Science at Georgetown University in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, the average new drug submitted for <font size=-1>FDA</font> approval in 1994-95 ran the gauntlet of almost 70 tests. Up to a third of these tests, however, were rejected by the agency on scientific grounds. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a curious lapse on the part of drug companies. Being sent back to the drawing board is a costly journey to make. Much of a firm's revenue will come from being the first or second on to the market with a new compound. Finishing even third hardly warrants having run the race. Some of this lost time is being made up by better communication between drug makers and the <font size=-1>FDA</font> in the early stages of clinical development, so that companies know exactly what will be expected of their drug on the day of judgment. And better ways of collecting and processing the data also help. According to Hugh McDade, head of European antiviral clinical research at Glaxo Wellcome--Britain's biggest drug company--his firm's new computer system has made research more efficient simply by cutting the proportion of data that needs "cleaning" from 30% to 1%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But tests can also be made more effective by asking the right questions from the beginning. Carl Peck, director of the Georgetown Centre, believes that even early trials (the first and second phases, when a drug is tested on small numbers of volunteers to see if a big trial is justified) could be milked for a lot of extra information if they were designed better. He says that they should be looking for more than just a rough connection between the highest dose of a drug that can be taken on board and its beneficial or harmful effects. Studying how different doses spread out into tissues, how long they linger in the blood, and the sort of encounters they have while travelling through the body yields information that can be used to build computer simulations of clinical trials.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early attempts at simulation borrowed software from the engineering and aerospace industries. Now three companies--<font size=-1>MGA</font> in Boston, Pharsight in Palo Alto, California and <font size=-1>SCI</font> in Apex, North Carolina--are offering simulation programs specially designed for clinical trials. Depending on the class of compound they are testing, drug developers can begin to understand how changing a range of variables--such as the doses tested, the number of patients enrolled, or the number of drop-outs--will affect the outcome of a trial. All these inter-related factors would be far too expensive and time-consuming to test in a real clinic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such simulations are not intended to replace human testing, any more than the computer models used to test aircraft are a substitute for real flight. Rather, they allow a drug developer to design the best trial to give its product the most effective run for its money. This is particularly important in the third phase of the clinical-trial process--the costly point where a drug is tested on hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands of subjects. Companies cannot afford to make mistakes at this stage, especially since two such trials, carried out independently of each other, are usually demanded by the <font size=-1>FDA</font> as proof of a compound's real worth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tools like trial simulations are still in their infancy. But their potential to streamline things is considerable. And they have a bonus. In virtual reality, unlike the real reality found in clinics, nobody gets hurt when things go wrong.

<h1>Knowledge or certainty?</h1>

WHAT'S in a name? A great deal, apparently, if the subject in question is experimenting on people. When America's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (<font size=-1>ACHRE</font>) asked 1,800 patients recently what they thought of human medical experiments, the answer was clear: they were against them. Such experiments were thought of as highly risky and potentially harmful. If the term "clinical trials" was used instead of "experiments", however, the same group voted in favour of them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clinical trials, it seems, are now seen by potential subjects, particularly in America, not as the risky medical experiments that they are, but as a short-cut to the latest treatment. This enthusiasm certainly makes the job of testing new drugs easier. But it also brings questions. For, though more stringent tests on cell cultures and animals mean that the chance of a really dangerous drug slipping through the net into human trials is minimal, a test drug is guaranteed neither to be better than existing treatment, nor to have no harmful long-term side effects.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Levine, a clinical-trials specialist at Yale University, says that people stopped seeing trials as a source of risk and started seeing them as a potential benefit when the anti-<font size=-1>AIDS</font> drug <font size=-1>AZT</font> started tests in the early 1980s. <font size=-1>AIDS</font> patients--often supported by their doctors--queued, clamoured and sometimes cheated their way into trials, desperate to try out this experimental compound.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given that <font size=-1>AIDS</font> is fatal, and no other treatment existed, this was understandable.<b> </b>But basing a general principle on the peculiar circumstances surrounding <font size=-1>AIDS</font> is dangerous. Today, such is the flood of new drugs to be tested and the rising tide of confidence in their powers, that enthusiasm for clinical trials is spilling over into other patient groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ruth Faden, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is the chairman of <font size=-1>ACHRE</font>. She is one of many researchers who fear that doctors are overselling the benefits of trials to their patients. Although people do not join such trials until they have given their "informed consent", the consent forms have become so complex that few read them through to the end. And both doctors and the institutions they work for have a stake in a trial being large and successful. The doctor wants his name on the research paper and the institution wants the glory (and money) that running trials brings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, shopping for a chance to join a trial has become as easy as dialling a telephone number or visiting a few handy websites on the Internet. In America alone, over 2,500 clinical trials are clamouring for subjects. They offer potential remedies for almost every affliction, complete with user-friendly descriptions, eligibility criteria and contact details.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several countries are attempting to tidy up this state of affairs. In November 1996 the Council of Europe adopted a Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine designed to ensure ethical medical practice (including tight controls on trials) in member states. In Canada, a new "Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans" is raising hackles among the country's academics; subjects who withdraw in mid-trial can also "withdraw" their data if they feel they were tricked into joining the trial in the first place. And America's National Bioethics Advisory Committee has just begun the task of revamping institutional review boards, consent procedures and other safeguards for the "well-being, autonomy and privacy" of patient-subjects. A reaction, it seems, has set in.

<b>JOHNSON</b>
<h1>Burchfield's modern English usage</h1>

THE winners of our Christmas crossword have recently opened their prizes: not least, copies of Oxford University Press's new version of "Fowler's Modern English Usage"*, edited by R.W. Burchfield. And if, like Johnson, they are addicts--if not always adherents--of the original Fowler they may have had a shock. Is this the Fowler they have known and loved since 1926? It is not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not that they should complain. If anyone, Mr Burchfield, for years chief editor of the Oxford English dictionaries, might do that. For though the name Fowler may sell books, this, in reality, is Burchfield's modern English usage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of its quirks are pure Fowler, such as the citation of three entire <i>sonnets</i> to illustrate that word. But most are Mr Burchfield's own: an entry, for instance, on <i>epistemic modality</i> (come again) or a remark on Britain's shrinking number of Christian sabbath-keepers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result--like its original--is a curate's egg. Strangely, Mr Burchfield calls Fowler's discussion of <i>literary words</i> outdated, observing that nowadays few words are barred from fine writing--which is true, but in no way whatever invalidates Fowler's discussion of those words that are confined to it. His entry on supposedly ambiguous uses of <i>too</i> is almost pure Fowler, and it is tosh; that on <i>irrelevant allusion</i> owes not a word to Fowler's ponderous page on that topic, and is the better for it. His entry on phrases like <I>women's having the vote </I> (as against <I>women</I>...) shines with both common sense and nicety of judgment, where Fowler mainly froths. And his discussion of what he calls <i>sentence adverbs</i> such as the much derided <i>hopefully</i> (whose use this way is too recent even to figure in Fowler) deserves to become a classic mind-broadener for those, like Johnson, who do the deriding.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with the original Fowler, at times you could wish for more: it is odd to cite past use of <i>they </i>and <i>their</i> as singular pronoun/adjective without a hint (in that entry) that its recent wildfire spread owes so much to feminist correctness. In contrast, Mr Burchfield makes neatly the subtle distinction between <i>politics</i> as a singular noun and a plural; a pity he did not do the same for <i>economics</i> (which <i>is </i>a dismal science, albeit <i>the economics</i> of writing textbooks on it <i>are </i>attractive). 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Justly, Mr Burchfield hopes the 1926 Fowler will long remain in print. But his own book has a far stronger claim to be called a "dictionary of usage" than Fowler had. Henry Fowler--68 when his work was first published--used that phrase, but in fact he was consciously steering his readers, and his guiding star was the English of a classically educated public-school Briton of his day. Mr Burchfield is less prescriptive, readier (though not over-ready) merely to describe, with all the resources, not least the electronics, of Oxford and of modern lexicography to aid him. Notably, he also takes American English into account, as Fowler did not purport to. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In sum, there is good reason for both books. The 1926 Fowler is already a period piece, though no one has ever gone wrong by taking its advice. The same, no doubt, will in time be true of "Burchfield"--as, perhaps, by 2097 the publisher of its latest revision will dare to call it. Johnson will stick shamelessly to his old friend: it is less useful, more fun, and, in both senses, less weighty.

<h1 align=center>NATO goes a-wooing</h1>


FROM Tallinn to Tirana, from Vancouver to Vladivostok, the hope everywhere as the cold war ended was for a Europe "whole and free"--its people, all its people, freedfrom conflict and division and, in Eastern Europe and Russia, free to choose their destiny and to rebuild their economies from the ruins of communism. Some have done better than others. Nowhere has it been easy. But dismantling the iron curtain gave easterners the chance to share in the greater wealth and stability of Western Europe. Now there is a worry that what is in store is not peace and opportunity all round, but a "new Yalta". That is shorthand for a new division of Europe between Russia and the West--if not into armed camps, then into rival spheres of influence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Irked by <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s plans to start taking in new members, Russian officials have for months been growling about"counter-measures". In an effort to reduce the growing tension, talks opened this week in Moscow to try to establish a new and special <font size=-1>NATO</font>-Russia relationship. The talks will be tough. But even if a deal can be struck--and that is by no means certain--those easterners not among the first <font size=-1>NATO</font>-joiners fear they will be left with the breath of a grouchy and unpredictable Russia on their neck.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since there can be no going back--to abandon long-standing promises because of a Russian tantrum would bust the alliance--<font size=-1>NATO</font>'s enlargement will start, as planned, after a special summit in July. The new members, all being well, could be in by 1999. But, if enlarging <font size=-1>NATO</font> to admit the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians (to name the front-runners) is to add to Europe's security, rather than diminish it, Russia's legitimate concerns need to be addressed. And just as important in avoiding a division of Europe into a western "us" and a Russia-centred "them" will be finding ways to reassure the countries in between.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Russia is ready to strike a deal, there is plenty on offer. <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s glue remains the commitment of its members to treat an attack on one as an attack on all. That is why countries such as Poland, in the past shoved about all over the map, have clamoured to join. But <font size=-1>NATO</font> has already cut down its clanking cold-war armies into much smaller, get-up-and-go forces that, as in Bosnia, can form the nucleus of broader European efforts to promote peacekeeping rather than war-making. Indeed, the Bosnian operation has already brought Russian officers right into the heart of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s military planning.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, recognising that a larger <font size=-1>NATO</font>, albeit one with smaller forces, was bound to make Russia feel crowded, the alliance announced last year that it had no plans to put either bases or nuclear weapons on the territory of new members. Work is starting to rejig the treaty on conventional forces in Europe more to Russia's liking. Deeper cuts in nuclear weapons may also be in prospect. But so far Russia has pocketed all this poker-faced. What it really wants is a right of co-decision--diplomat-speak for a veto.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would be going too far. <font size=-1>NATO</font> is a defence alliance of like-minded countries that needs to be able to act in the interests of its members, whether those interests are threatened in Europe or beyond. Russia is a continent-sized power with interests of its own. Even with the best will in the world, the two are unlikely always to see eye to eye. What <font size=-1>NATO</font> is ready to offer, however, is an unprecedented special relationship that will include Russia in <font size=-1>NATO</font> discussions on a wide range of common concerns, from peacekeeping to nuclear proliferation. Not a veto, certainly, but exploited co-operatively this new <font size=-1>NATO</font>-Russia council could help underpin the stability that Europe's fledgling democracies--including Russia's--sorely need.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If there is a danger in <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s offer to Russia, it lies in the neglect not of Russia's interests, but of those of the smaller fry. That danger is all the greater since <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s first enlargement may well be its last for a long time. Taking in the first newcomers will be time-consuming and costly. Each one needs agreement from all 16 (soon perhaps 19 or 20) parliaments. And defence guarantees, if they are to stick, should not be given lightly. Indeed, if <font size=-1>NATO</font> is to operate effectively, then it is probably unrealistic to expect it to expand much more at all. In which case, what about other countries with security worries, including the Baltic states and Ukraine?
<br></p><p><b><b>Partners or rivals?</b>
</b><br><font size=-1>NATO</font> is not Europe's cavalry. It cannot right every wrong, protect every minority or guarantee every border, nor should it. But it can help avoid creating the sort of security vacuums that in Europe have always spelled trouble. Its "partnerships for peace", at first ridiculed as an empty gesture, have already become a valuable vacuum-filler for countries that choose to make good use of them, for instance, by honing peacekeeping skills and learning how to keep generals under civilian control. But if they are to thrive and expand, these partnerships will need more cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stretching the edges of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s security blanket, however, can do only so much. Other organisations--Europe hasplenty of them--need to take more of the strain. And since the greatest threat to Europe's struggling democracies comesfrom the sheer difficulty of pushing on with reform, for many countries it is the prospect of eventual membership in the European Union, not <font size=-1>NATO</font>, that could do most good. Unfortunately, however, the <font size=-1>EU</font> is moving at a snail's pace. It is unlikely to take in its first batch of easterners until perhaps 2005, well after <font size=-1>NATO</font>. Sadly, negotiations are not even due to begin for another year. When they do, they should start with as many countries as possible, even if some proceed faster than others. Meanwhile, the <font size=-1>EU</font> could be more imaginative in helping out its "partner" countries--by, for example, opening its markets more generously to their goods.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, though, whether or not Europe slips back into old rivalries depends on how Russia now reacts. The offer from <font size=-1>NATO</font> to co-operate in building a more secure and stable Europe is a genuine one. But is Russia ready to leave its lair?

<h2>Term-server
</h2>Bill Clinton, sworn in for a second term as president of the United States, began his new term by challenging Republicans to agree to a bipartisan ban on <b>large political donations</b>, or "soft money". Both parties fought the election with the help of unprecedented amounts of it.
<p>The appointment of <b>Madeleine Albright</b> as secretary of state was approved unanimously by the Senate.
<p>The House of Representatives voted to reprimand <b>Newt Gingrich</b> and fined him $300,000 for misusing tax-exempt funds for partisan purposes. It was the most severe sanction ever imposed on a speaker by the House.
<p>A <b>Colombian</b> court--on legal grounds--halved, to nine and ten years, its sentences on two drug barons. The United States was furious and said so. So was the Colombian government; it is taking steps to get the reductions overturned and the law that permitted them revised. 
<p>Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, spent three hours with Fidel Castro in <b>Cuba</b>. They agreed on closer co-operation.
<p>In <b>Venezuela</b>, where prices rose 103% last year, striking public-sector doctors accepted a 165% pay rise--but said they would stay out until pension demands were settled. Many other workers want huge rises. Official target for 1997 inflation: 25%.
<p><h2>War and peace
</h2>Killing in <b>Algeria</b> intensified, with car-bombs and throat-slashing, as the fasting month of Ramadan neared mid-point. Terrorists in the Armed Islamic Group are blamed, but counter-terrorists are also suspected.
<p>Yasser Arafat celebrated Israel's redeployment in<b> Hebron</b> with a conciliatory speech, assuring the 450 Jews in the city that he wanted no confrontation, and reaffirming that "we have made a peace agreement with all the Israeli people". Israel's foreign minister announced that he was ready to meet his <b>Syrian </b>counterpart to revive peace talks.
<p>Rebels in south-eastern<b> Sudan</b> continued to advance towards the energy-producing Roseires dam, claiming they had killed over 300 soldiers.
<p>More than 60 people, including three Spanish aid workers, were murdered in <b>Rwanda</b>. Many of the dead were returned refugees who were potential witnesses in genocide trials. 
<p>Zaire's prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo, announced a government offensive to drive rebels out of <b>eastern Zaire</b>.
<p>Sixteen members of the <b>Ethiopian football team</b> sought political asylum in Italy.
<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><h2>The eroding begins
</h2>Some of <b>Hong Kong's civil liberties </b>should be scrapped, together with its electoral system, after the British colony reverts to China on July 1st, according to a committee appointed by the Chinese government. 
<p>In an effort to calm the worst <b>industrial unrest </b>in South Korean history, President Kim Young Sam asked parliament to reconsider the unpopular new labour laws.
<p>Four of President Suharto's children are on a government-approved list of candidates for <b>Indonesia's parliamentary election </b>in May. 
<p><h2>Changing heads
</h2>Austria's chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, unexpectedly resigned after more than a decade in office. The new chancellor will be the finance minister, <b>Viktor Klima</b>.
<p>Bulgaria's new president, <b>Petar Stoyanov</b>, took office as demonstrations against the Socialist-led government continued. Mr Stoyanov, a member of the opposition, must decide whether to give the interior minister, Nikolai Dobrev, a mandate to form a new government. The prime minister quit last month.
<p>Rulings by various judges and officials brought opposition parties in <b>Serbia</b> no closer to taking office in towns in which they won elections in November.
<p><b>Latvia</b>'s reformist prime minister, Andris Skele, resigned because the president had opposed his nominee as finance minister, Vasily Melniks, who then himself withdrew.
<p><b>Boris Yeltsin</b> showed up at the Kremlin briefly after 12 days in hospital with pneumonia, seemingly rattled by attempts in the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, to declare him too sick to rule.
<p><font size=-1>NATO</font>'s secretary-general, Javier Solana, met Russia's foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov, to discuss <b>new relations</b> between Russia and the alliance. Turkey said it would block <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s expansion into Eastern Europe unless it was allowed to join the European Union.
<p>Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and Vaclav Klaus, prime minister of the Czech Republic, signed an accord expressing remorse for wrongs committed during <b>the second world war</b>.
<p>Germany ordered the immediate slaughter of 5,200 cattle imported from Britain and Switzerland after a cow died from <b>mad-cow disease</b>.
<p>France's president, Jacques Chirac, announced plans to <b>reform the judicial system</b> after allegations that politicians impeded corruption investigations.
<p>(See <a href="ww1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Applications for <b>political asylum</b> in the European Union fell 12% in the first half of 1996 from a year earlier. Germany, the biggest magnet by far, saw only a slight drop. The countries of former Yugoslavia were the largest source of asylum-seekers in 1994 and 1995; Turkey was second.

<h2>Closing time
</h2>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>A chain of sushi restaurants collapsed on cue just as <b>Japan's bankruptcies </b>were forecast to rise again toward 1995's record level. The total fell in 1996, but there was the single biggest bankruptcy since the war: the collapse of Sueno Kosan construction. 
<p>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted that <b>American interest rates </b> may rise. Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary, reaffirmed America's wish for a strong dollar. The dollar put in its best performance for years against the yen and <font size=-1>D</font>-mark.
<p><h2>In credit
</h2>America's tenth-biggest bank, Banc One, is set to become America's third-largest issuer of <b>credit cards </b>with the purchase for $7.3 billion of First <font size=-1>USA</font>. But bad debt on credit cards is rising. In declaring otherwise good profits, Citicorp, the country's largest credit-card issuer, and Chase Manhattan reported increased write-offs in that area.
<p><b>Salomon Brothers</b> and <b>Fidelity Investments</b> formed an alliance that will allow equities underwritten by Salomon to be distributed through Fidelity's brokerage operations. Salomon gains access to 1.5m customers and Fidelity, a mutual-funds giant, gets its customers access to Salomon equity research. 
<p>The Italian government gave control of <b>Banco di Napoli</b> to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and <font size=-1>INA</font>, an Italian insurance group, after the two largely state-owned institutions bid 61.6 billion lire ($38.6m) for 60% of the stricken bank.
<p>The Jewish Anti-Defamation League opened a SFr50,000 ($35,000) Swiss bank account for a guard suspended by his security firm for removing soon-to-be shredded historical documents from the Union Bank of Switzerland. <font size=-1>UBS</font>, which along with other Swiss banks is under pressure to reveal its <b>war-time dealings </b>with the Nazis, admitted it had made a serious error but said other documents had already been shredded.
<p><h2>The sky's the limit
</h2>Boeing dropped plans to build a 550-seater aircraft, citing lack of demand. But Europe's Airbus carried on with its plans for a <b>superjumbo</b> by bringing Belairbus of Belgium and Fokker Aviation of the Netherlands into the initial study.
<p>As expected, Raytheon bought <b>Hughes Electronics</b> from General Motors for $9.5 billion. The deal will put Raytheon behind only Lockheed Martin and Boeing in America's restructured defence industry.
<p>Britain still excels at attracting inward investment. Days after Ford said it was cutting 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant, <b>Nissan</b>, Japan's second-largest car maker, said it would invest a further &#163;215m ($356m) in Britain to allow production of a third car model for the European market. The expansion will create 800 jobs in Sunderland and another 4,000 jobs for Nissan's European components suppliers.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Three of America's eastern <b>railways </b>are battling for dominance. Conrail shareholders scuppered plans for a $9.4 billion merger with <font size=-1>CSX</font>, leaving the way open for Norfolk Southern to pursue its $10.5 billion hostile bid for Conrail.
<p><h2>Daimler reverts
</h2><b>Daimler-Benz</b>, Germany's biggest industrial company, put the finishing touches to a reorganisation restoring its focus on cars. Helmut Werner had already resigned as chairman of Mercedes-Benz after a power struggle with J&uuml;rgen Schrempp (above), the chief executive responsible for the plan to merge Daimler-Benz with Mercedes-Benz, its biggest subsidiary.
<p>In one of Asia's biggest privatisations, two concessions worth a total of $7 billion were awarded to upgrade and run <b>water and sewerage</b> in Manila, the Philippines' capital. The local Ayala group, teamed with America's Bechtel and Britain's Northwest Water, won both. But under the terms of the bid it had to cede one to the next best offer: that of Benpres, a local firm teamed with France's Lyonnaise des Eaux.
<p><b>Olivetti</b>, a troubled Italian telecoms group, agreed the sale of its loss-making <font size=-1>PC</font> unit to Piedmont, a company set up by Centenary, a British industrial-holdings company, and other investors, for 250 billion-300 billion lire ($157m-188m).
<p>Pieter van der Wal resigned as head of <b>Grundig</b> under pressure from unions outraged at his plans to cut a quarter of the electronics firm's jobs and move some production out of Germany.
<p><b>Pharmacia & Upjohn</b>, the world's tenth-biggest drug group, also lost its chief executive. John Zabriskie quit suddenly, a mere 18 months after America's Upjohn and Sweden's Pharmacia came together in a merger, which has produced weak third-quarter results and two profit warnings in the fourth. 
<p>George Simpson, its new managing director, is splitting Britain's <b>General Electric Company</b> into five divisions, sweeping away the structure built by his predecessor, the long-serving Lord Weinstock.
<p>The first shots in a war likely to lead to a big shakeout in Japan's <b>video-game</b> companies have been fired. Sega, the largest arcade-game maker (but behind Nintendo in <font size=-1>TV</font> games), is to absorb Bandai, Japan's top toy maker. The combined firm will have global sales of &#165;600 billion ($5 billion) a year.
<p>Some ideas just catch on. Japan has run out of <b>lovable eggs</b>, an electronic bird which should sell for &#165;1,980 ($16) in the shops but which now fetches 20 times that on the street. The creature grows up if nurtured, and jumps up and down when its droppings are cleared up. But neglect the virtual beast and it wastes away and dies.

<h1 align=center>Buddy can you spare a lung?</h1>


<p><b>Governments could save lives by being clearer, and less squeamish, about organ transplants</b></p>
<br>IN A typical day, thanks to a shortage of organs available for transplants, ten Americans will die waiting--waiting for a kidney, heart, liver, pancreas or lung. In most other countries the demand for organs also far outstrips the supply. That is one reason why doctors have been tempted into the dangerous business of using animal parts for transplant--and why even modest proposals such as those in America this week to change the rules governing organ allocation tend to becontroversial (see <a href="am3198.html">page</a>). 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet there are several promising ways to make more organs available, the simplest of which is merely to promote more vigorously the carrying of donor cards. Most people say they are happy to bequeath their organs after death, but far fewer make these wishes known in a formal way. In many countries a start has recently been made by asking people to state on their driving licences whether they would be willing donors. But more could be done. There is no reason (apart from terrifying their patients) why doctors should not ask people what their wishes are during routine medical checks. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, law-makers need to make it clear that people have an absolute right to decide how their organs are used after death. At present, families are allowed to stop doctors from transplanting the organs of people who, when alive, had expressly indicated their wish to be donors. This is as absurd as it would be for relations to reverse a dead person's will. Only in the case of people who die without making their wishes clear should the decision devolve to the next of kin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third change is more technical. Some countries are squeamish about keeping organs "alive", even when their owners are brain-dead. In Britain, for example, the introduction of "elective ventilation" (attaching brain-dead people to respirators) doubled organ-harvest rates. In 1994 this was banned on the grounds that English common law prohibited treatment that did not benefit the patient. But elective ventilation is not "treatment" at all. It is a way to implement an individual's wish to make their corpse available in a useful way. Cadavers have been used as a teaching aid since the days of ancient Greece. Why not use them in this way too?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for some sort of financial incentive, as mooted recently by Gary Becker, a prominent American economist, is less straightforward. This could well save money, as well as lives; a kidney transplant, which accounts for the great majority of transplants, costs $85,000 less over six years than dialysis. But everything depends on the detail of any scheme. People are justifiably queasy about any policy that might create a market in body organs. And even a scheme under which only governments were allowed, say, to pay families of potential donors to allow organs' use could weaken the principle that the likely wishes of the organs' owner are paramount.
<br></p><p><b><b>Anyone who had a heart . . .</b>
</b><br>None of this is to encourage compulsion. Rather, the point is to establish the right of people to decide for themselves what is to become of their corporeal selves after death. In this respect the Austrian and Belgian practice of "presumed consent"--hospitals may recover organs unless the deceased has explicitly forbidden them to--is a step too far. The state has limited authority to tell its citizens how to treat their bodies before death and should not be allowed to extend that role after it. Organ donation gives individuals a wonderful opportunity to feel that the end of their own life may help to prolong somebody else's. The role of governments is merely to help people to make that choice in a free and timely fashion.

<p><b>Organ transplants
<h1>Liver spats</h1>

</b></p>ORGANS for transplant are scarce, so how should they be allocated? Back in November, boffins at the United Network for Organ Sharing (<font size=-1>UNOS</font>), the non-profit agency that looks after America's organs under a contract with the federalgovernment, jiggered their computer models to see if they could make the allocation of livers more efficient. They concluded that by moving people who suddenly lost liver function up the waiting list, America could manage 65-70 more liver transplants a year (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>). And the number of patients dying as they waited for a transplant--954 lastyear--would fall. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for this is that acute liver failure tends to happen to otherwisehealthy people who may, for example, have eaten a bad mushroom. Chronic liver failure, on the other hand, tends to be part of a process of general physical deterioration. Patients in this condition may be less likely to weather the trauma of a liver transplant. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The boffins had two other bright ideas. First, local hospitals would no longer have first claim to organs landing directly on their patches; instead, these livers would be made available to the neediest within a much larger region, usually across a couple of states. This move would go some way towards evening out the big geographical disparities in liver allocation. <font size=-1>UNOS </font>considered but rejected the idea of allocatinglivers according to a centralised national list. Livers have a short shelf-life, and flying them around America is no way to keep them at their best. Second, <font size=-1>UNOS</font> planned to standardise the rules that determinewhen a patient should be added to the waiting list. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The unexpected result of these technical fixes was uproar. Several transplant centres, including the University of Pittsburgh, New York's Mount Sinai Hospital and Baylor University in Houston, argued in favour of a single national list. The larger centres tend to get sicker patients, they argued, and thus should have higher priority in allocation. (Sceptics note that transplants areboth profitable and good for medical reputations, and wonder if the big centres are not guilty of simply wanting to increase their market share.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Others objected that moving acute patients up the priority list was a moral judgment that had no place in medicine. This is because much, though not all, chronic liver failure can be traced to drug and/or alcohol abuse. Patients on the waiting list withchronic liver failure feared that the regulatory tweaking meant they would never see a liver. In fact, the new policy, like the old one, will see 95% of liver transplants going to the chronically ill.
<br>As the argument heated up, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (<font size=-1>DHHS</font>) held hearings on the proposed changes in December. They were inconclusive, so on January 20th the new rules went into effect for all future entrants to the waiting list. But a panel named by the <font size=-1>DHHS</font> may well devise its own regulations; in that case, these federal rules will supersede current practice. This would be somethingnew for the department, which approves changes in transplant policy but leaves<font size=-1>UNOS</font> to make them. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea that the <font size=-1>DHHS</font> may decide to take over allocation is not popular in transplant circles. Despite controversies like the one over livers, the system generally works as intended. Transplant experts worry that the government will not do as well and that the process might be politicised. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fundamental problem, of course, is simply that there are not enough organs to go round. This is a worldwide problem (see <a href="ld4522.html">page</a>). On January 15th, 7,511 Americans were waiting for a liver, but last year only 3,925 got one; without a functioning liver, which is the body's chemical processor,death is swift and certain. Bureaucraticfixes cannot do much to change that.

<p><b>Sudan
<h1>Rebel alliance</h1>

</b></p>THE recent advances of rebel forces in eastern and southern Sudan signal an alliance that could threaten the government. The new offensive started on December 28th with an attack on a mechanised brigade near the Eritrean border. Rebels from the south and north are fighting together--and are backed by outside powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guerrillas from the Sudan People's Liberation Army (<font size=-1>SPLA</font>), the mainly southern movement that has been fighting for 13 years, have joined up with the Beja Congress Armed Forces, one part of a new alliance of northern Sudanese rebels known as the National Democratic Alliance (<font size=-1>NDA</font>). Sudan's eastern neighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, helped to bring the two together, and now keep them supplied. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eritrea gives the <font size=-1>NDA</font> a home and provides it with weapons. The United States, which holds Sudan guilty of sponsoring terrorism, has announced that it is supplying "defensive" weapons to Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda to help them protect themselves from Sudan. One way or another, these arms have been reaching the rebels. And rebel spirits have been raised by the arrival in Eritrea of Sadiq el Mahdi, the Sudanese prime minister who was overthrown by the Islamists in 1989.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Sudanese government, facing astrong enemy, finds itself short of both fuel and weapons. Morale in the army is said to be low. In early January, <font size=-1>SPLA</font> fighterscrossed from Ethiopia, taking several small towns. More important, they have begun to threaten the Roseires hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile which supplies 80% of Khartoum's electricity (see <a href="ir1.gif">map</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regime, in near-panic, has called on fellow Arab governments to support it,playing on their fear that the <font size=-1>SPLA</font> is a pawn of western powers trying to break up Sudan. Its call has split the Arab world. A few, including Syria and Jordan, have supported Sudan with strong statements. Eritrea, with close links to Israel, is seen as an aggressive interloper in the region. Egypt, Sudan's big neighbour, is far more ambivalent. The Egyptians, deeply suspicious of Sudan's Islamists (though also horrified at the thought of fighting on the Nile), prefer to see the conflict as an internal one, denying Eritrean or Ethiopian involvement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the rebels were to cut off Khartoum's electricity supply, or to cut the road from Port Sudan to Khartoum, the days of the Islamist regime in Khartoum could be numbered. What, then, would replace it? The current north-south alliance would be unlikely to survive victory. Sudan, huge, disparate and surrounded by interfering neighbours, would find it hard to stay together, democractic or peaceful.

<p><b>Statistics
<h1>Save our survey</h1>

</b></p>ON JANUARY 30th, the governmentwill publish the 1997 edition of its "Social Trends", a compilation of key social statistics admired and imitated around the world. At the foot of many an illuminating chart, the quoted source will be the government's own General Household Survey(<font size=-1>GHS</font>). Perhaps for the last time: the government has just announced its intention to suspend fieldwork for the next <font size=-1>GHS</font> pending a review, as the Office for National Statistics (<font size=-1>ONS</font>) struggles to meet tough budgetary targets. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A belated consultation of outside users has fomented a campaign to save the survey led by Denise Lievesley, director of "the definitive data archive" at Essex University. Outraged academics argue that the survey is irreplaceable--and that to scrap it would fly in the face of the government's policy of providing good statistics for outsiders, and not just for its own use.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>GHS</font> is the only survey that produces compatible figures over a span of years going back to 1972. It provides the most detailed information on social developments essential to policy planning--for example on cohabitation, which affectshousing provision, leisure activities and contraception. The survey is irreplaceable in getting at what Sue Richards, a professor of public management at BirminghamUniversity, describes as the "wicked problems"--those which cannot be solved by one government department alone. This is because the <font size=-1>GHS</font> enables researchers to put together a rounded statistical picture ofBritons, bringing together details of their housing, income and jobs. The government now proposes to dispense with this valuable tool to save a mere &#163;500,000 this year, which is what it spends on social security every three minutes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, <font size=-1>ONS</font> officials deserve some sympathy. Their budget problems are severe. They must save &#163;2m this year on top of &#163;10m last year out of a budget of around &#163;120m. Admittedly, some of these cuts could be found from administrative savings, following last year's merger between the Central Statistical Office and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to form <font size=-1>ONS</font>. But better statistics do not rank highly among ministerial spending priorities. If there must be cost cuts, they prefer to achieve them by ditching whole surveys than by cuttingquality corners across-the-board.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, some outsiders think that the compilers of the <font size=-1>GHS</font> are their own worst enemy: slow to produce its results, and resistant to changing its scope. Outsiders recognise that the government is trying tomake the myriad of social surveys carried out by individual departments and by the <font size=-1>ONS</font> compatible. The more this effort succeeds, the less essential will be the <font size=-1>GHS</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be a great loss if the survey were never repeated. Equally, there is no compelling reason why it should be carried out every year. A decision to conduct the <font size=-1>GHS</font> every couple of years from now on would be the most sensible outcome.

<h1>Top gear</h1>

SOMEWHERE in the middle of the Channel, ships heading for the continent, laden with British-madeLand Rovers and NissanMicras, are passing others, bound for Britain, with cargoes ofFrench-made Renault Clios and Belgian-built Ford Mondeos. Both exports and imports of cars have grown sharply in recent years. British factories have been taking advantage of their improved efficiency and the European single market to boost their sales to the continent. But at home, buyers are less concerned than they used to be about buying British.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On balance, this growing trade has been good news for Britain: while 62% of the 2m cars sold in Britain last year were foreign-made (up from 59% in 1995), exports grew twice as fast as imports. Figures published on January 20th show that British car factories' booming exports more than made up for their cuts in production for the home market. Almost 1.7m cars were made in Britain, 10%more than in 1995 and the highest number since 1973 (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). While the 15% rise in sterling's trade-weighted index last year hurt other exporters, it has not so far dented car makers: their production for export in the last quarter of 1996 was a third higher than in the same period of 1995.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two significant moves this month mean that the two-way traffic in cars should continue growing. On January 21st, it was announced that the Nissan plant in Sunderland is to build a third model--the Almera--mainly for export, alongside the existing Micra andPrimera models. Five days earlier, Ford said that it would stop making the Escort at its Halewood assembly plant, which mainly serves the home market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Britain's trade deficit in cars and motor parts, which has been around &#163;5 billion in each of the past two years, is expected to fall sharply in coming years. Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff University Business School says that Japanese car makers are steadily expanding their distribution networks on the continent, to receive the growing output of their British plants. He predicts that the deficit will be one-tenth of its current size in around five years.

<p><b>Election timing
<h1>Poll axed?</h1>

</b></p>FOR a few hours in February, Phil Manson, the borough solicitor of the Metropolitan Borough of the Wirrall, could find himself the most important political actor in the country. For Mr Manson is also the returning officer for the area, which includes the Wirral South constituency,where the government has promised to call a by-election not later than March 6th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What happens however if, after it is called but before it is held, John Major calls a general election? By a quirk of Britain's electoral law, that may be down to Mr Manson. If parliament was not yet dissolved, he could let the by-election go ahead. The Liverpool Edge Hill by-election was held on March 29th 1979 despite the fall of the Callaghan government the night before. Or he could call it off. Why should Wirralites have to vote twice--once for an <font size=-1>MP</font> who might never take his seat? An election court could review whether his decision was "reasonable", but not until much later. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Manson will of course take his decision without regard to politics. But it could have profound political consequences. Labour needs an 8% swing to win the seat. If the Tories lost it early in a general election campaign--as a <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll on January 14th-16th suggests they would--their moralewould be shattered. If they won, they could claim to be making ground. Their fate may lie in Mr Manson's hands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That seems odd. But so is much in Britain's patchwork quilt of electoral law. It pales into insignificance beside another oddity: the prime minister's power to decide on election timing. Believe it or not, and in strict legal theory, Mr Major could even guarantee himself three more years. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Blackburn, an academic lawyer, describes how in a recent book ("The Electoral System in Britain", Macmillan &#163;15.99). As every schoolboy knows, the monarch (advised by the prime minister) must by law dissolve Parliament after five years.However there is no such legal compulsion to then immediately call a general election. The 1694 Triennial Act (now re-titled the Meeting of Parliament Act), lays down that the monarch need not call an election for a new Parliament for three years after the expiry of the old one. Mr Major could dissolve Parliament and then legally carry on governing without one for three moreyears, says Mr Blackburn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, if Mr Major were to try this, the people might rise up and throw him out of Downing Street--or the queen would refuse his advice. Yet short of that, the law gives a British prime minister extraordinary control overelection timing. He can go to the country at any time he chooses before the end of a Parliament's five years. When he does go, he alone decides the length of a campaign. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The law requires that 17 days mustelapse between the end of a Parliament and the holding of an election, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, bank holidays anywhere in Britain and Maundy Thursday. But if it suits him, the prime minister can let the campaign roll on. In 1945, for example, the election was announced on May 23rd, but not actually held until July 5th. By contrast, in February 1974, Edward Heath gave only a day's notice of his intention to dissolve, and the election was over three weeks after it was announced. He lost. Official election campaigns have tended to become shorter rather than longer, although Britain is currently in the middle of one of its longest ever unofficial campaign periods. If MrMajor remains far behind, he may want to drag out the official campaign as well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>The Economist</i> has argued for fixed-term Parliaments, such as exist in most democracies. That argument is reinforced by experience this time with Mr Major's lame-duck administration, and by the constant speculation as to when he will finally face the electorate. But this is not the only reform that is needed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One priority stands out: to remove control over electoral law from the Home Office. It is in principle wrong that it should remain there, notionally under the control of the home secretary, who is an elected politician. Mr Blackburn proposes instead that responsibility should pass to an independent electoral commission, whose remit might include campaign financing, the drawing of constituency boundaries and finding ways of increasing voter turnout. Something similar was recommended in a report on campaigning by the all-partyHansard Society in 1991, which waschaired by Sir Christopher Chataway, a former Tory minister. Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, has also indicated support for the idea--which may mean that Mr Major's startling prerogative will soon be a thing of the past.

<h1>A star is born</h1>

A SELF-CONFESSED nerd, klutzy,double-bridged glasses restingfirmly on his face, is not the usual image for a pop star. And yet his geeky appearance has not stopped Indian-born Jyoti Mishra and his first single, "Your Woman", from a record called "Abort, Retry, Fail?", from going straight into the British music charts at number one (only the fourth debut single ever to do so).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Mishra's story is one of persistence. Even the government can take a smidgen of the credit for his success. Unlike the well-established artists he deposed, he earned his chart hit the hard way after toiling for years in obscurity. Performing under the name of White Town, he launched his hit song without the help of a big record label. "Abort, Retry, Fail?", named after the error message given by computers, was recorded in his home on second-hand equipment.Chrysalis, his current record company, signed him only after a British radio station had begun playing "Your Woman".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now 30, Mr Mishra has barelyworked since leaving school in 1982. A brief stint on the government's Enterprise Allowance Scheme, a programme to help the unemployed which has since been phased out, helped him to set up his own record label, Satya Records, and to keep recording. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A music addict with an encyclopedic knowledge of musical trends since the 1920s, Mr Mishra does not plan to succumb to the glitter of the pop industry. He is already boycotting <font size=-1>BBC TV</font>'s "Top of the Pops" because, among other things, its minions were unpleasant to a friend of his. "If success means that I have to turn into an insensitive megalomaniac, then I'd rather never be in the charts at all." Geek idealism.

<p><b>Road protests
<h1>Victory</h1>

</b></p><font size=1>FAIRMILE CAMP, DEVON
</font><p>WHEN the police helicopter appears overhead, the road protesters atFairmile in Devon snap into action: one disappears, dreadlocks bobbing, down a mineshaft marked "This one's for the badgers"; another pulls up the drawbridge over the dry moat; and a third prepares to padlock himself to the trunk of an old oak. Half a dozen tarpaulin tree-houses rustle with activity, while underground the alarmwhistles through five separate tunnel networks. On this occasion, the camp wins a brief reprieve. But even if the police, bailiffs, security firms, professional climbers, potholers and sonar operators do manage to dismantle Britain's last camp of road protesters in the next few days, the campaigners will still be celebrating the success of their tactics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since capturing the country's attention during their campaign against theNewbury bypass in 1995, anti-roads activists seem to have lost their momentum. Apart from Fairmile, there are now active camps at only a few obscure sites, such as the A320 near Woking and the Bingley bypass in Yorkshire. Whereas the Newbury protests resulted in nearly 1,000 arrests, there have been only a handful since. The much-publicised recent scuffle on the first anniversary of the start of construction at Newbury only highlighted how little has happened in the interim.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the protesters claim that this slowdown is a sign not of waning enthusiasm, but victory. Certainly they are right to point out that few controversial road-building schemes are currently under way. Public expenditure on roads has fallen from over &#163;8 billion in the three years to 1996 to just &#163;6 billion budgeted for the three years to 1999. The number of major new roads started has fallen from 55 in the 1990-91 financial year to just one in 1995-96. The government has in effect deferred the decision on the proposed Salisbury bypass, the next potential flashpoint, until after the general election. Even John Watts, the roads minister, has conceded that "our intention is to make better use of the existing roads network."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government nevertheless deniesthat the protesters have had any effect,putting its new policy down to tighter budgets. This is implausible. Despite all their antics, the protesters have often attracted support from otherwise law-abiding citizens. And the direct action campaigns have undoubtedly added to the expense and difficulty of building roads. The costs to the taxpayer of security and policing on the &#163;95m bypass at Newbury have reached&#163;19m and are still rising. The price-tag for clearing the camps in Devon is also climbing into the millions, diverting moneyfrom other Highways Agency schemes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the construction firms, too, the difficulties of building in the face of protests are increasing. Both Costain, the company behind the Newbury bypass, and Tarmac, another big road-builder, have had shareholders' meetings disrupted by activists.Workers have been threatened, equipment has been vandalised and the bad publicity has seemed endless. When the government was considering bids for the Newbury bypass, Sir John Banham, Tarmac's chairman, tried to pre-empt the activists by demanding stronger environmental standards.Other industry executives privately admit that protests have pushed up their costs and caused them to hesitate over projects likely to cause trouble.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the protesters? "I think you'll see the direct action movement beginning to diversify more and more," says Rob, one of the Fairmile residents. Some speak of shifting their focus to open-cast mining, or large quarries such as that at Whatley in Somerset. But most are even more ambitious: one campaigner, Kit, declares, "Fairmile is the university of direct action. We are teaching our methods to people from all over the world." Good grief.

<h1>Bar-coding the poor</h1>

AS FINLAND goes, so goes Namibia--at least when it comes to pensions. The two countries are among the pioneers of electronic pension provision, in which recipients draw their retirement cash by inserting a government-issued card into a cash dispenser, otherwise known as an automated teller machine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This method of transferring cash from governments to people, known in thetrade as "electronic benefit transfer"(<font size=-1>EBT</font>), looks likely to make order books and welfare cheques obsolete. More efficient and fraud-proof than paper, <font size=-1>EBT</font> systems are part of the welfare state of the future. Bits of northern Italy and three provinces inSouth Africa have already put <font size=-1>EBT</font> schemes in place for paying pensions; Mexico is experimenting with one that monitors the supply of subsidised milk and tortillas to some 2m poor families.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain is planning,ambitiously, to disburseelectronically almost allits &#163;90 billion ($150 billion) in social spending by 2000, a system the government estimates will cutfraud by &#163;150m-200m ayear. A pilot project administering child benefit is under way. People eligible for benefits will get a card, designed by <font size=-1>ICL</font> Pathway, that stores information on their entitlement. The card is swiped through a Post Office computer, which verifies the user's identity and notes how much the claimant is owed; a cashier dispenses the cash. There are no order books to filch, and no possibility of a third party cashing a stolen cheque. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare-reform law passed in the United States last year demands that all 50 states must have <font size=-1>EBT</font> in place for food stamps by 2002. Most are taking theopportunity to includewelfare payments to poor families in the card aswell. Transactive, a subsidiary of <font size=-1>GTECH</font>, a company based in Rhode Island, has the biggest system in operation so far, in Texas. Under a seven-year contract, Transactive is paid $2 amonth for each food-stamp recipient, and 97cents for each income-support recipient. In return, it does all the training and sets up the infrastructure, such as installing terminals. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To receive their food stamps, Texas's 3m claimants swipe their "Lone StarCard" through a terminal at the checkout counter of a shop, and enter their <font size=-1>PIN</font> number. The cost of their food purchases is then automatically deducted from their entitlement, and added to the retailer's account. The system recognises the bar-codes of forbidden items such as alcohol and cigarettes, thus ensuring that food subsidies are actually spent on food.Texas officials noticed that, when towns introduced <font size=-1>EBT</font>, sales of alcohol tended to drop and of food to rise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such cards are not truly "smart". They use magnetic strips, not a microchip, to hold information, so they cannot process the data. Spain, however, has decided to be smart. In a programme known as <font size=-1>TASS</font>, Spanish authorities have begun to embed a vast range of information in new social-security cards. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the scheme, welfare benefits are still deposited directly into bank accounts. But Spaniards can use the card at designated kiosks to talk to any number of government agencies. They can check the status of their pensions and unemployment benefits, ask about job training, check their health insurance or book an appointment at a clinic. <i>Smart Card </i> <i>News</i>, a British industry newsletter, describes <font size=-1>TASS</font> as the biggest and broadest such initiative in the world. By 2002, every citizen will have a card; already, 2m Spaniards do. Ole!

<h1>Suited, surfing and shopping</h1>

FOR all the blather about shopping on-line, the number of success stories is remarkably small. Name Amazon.com(books), <font size=-1>CD</font>now (music) and Virtual Vineyards (wine) and you are almost at the end of the list. As for Internet publishers, they are loth to charge for access to their web-sites. On January 11th, <i>Slate</i>, an on-line magazine owned by Microsoft, announced that it was postponing subscription charges indefinitely. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, plenty of goods are being sold on-line. But companies are mostly selling not to consumers, but to each other. In three years' time, reckons Forrester Research, a consultancy based in Massachusetts, business-to-business Internet commerce will be worth $67 billion a year, whereas consumer retailing will bring in less than a tenth as much. Last year, Forrester estimated that each sector was worth just over $500m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These numbers underline the on-line triumph of Cisco, a Californian computer firm that makes specialist hardware for the Internet and other computer networks. In the second half of 1996, Cisco's sales through its web-site were worth $100m--or 11% of its total sales. Forrester's figures suggest that Cisco alone was responsible for 10% of all the business done on the Internet in 1996. This year Cisco expects to make 30% of its sales (probably around $2 billion-worth) through its web-site, even though only its largest customers and its resellers can buy products that way. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another success of Internet commerce has been General Electric, America's largest firm by market capitalisation. Last summer, <font size=-1>GE</font> launched its web-based Trading Process Network to allow around 1,400 suppliers to compete for <font size=-1>GE</font> contracts. Admittedly <font size=-1>GE</font> already used old-fashioned electronic trading (so-called electronic document interchange, or <font size=-1>EDI</font>), so moving to the Internet was more an evolutionary step than a revolutionary one. But most of the deals made through the Trading Process Network are worth several million dollars. By June this year, <font size=-1>GE</font> expects to have done $1 billion-worth of business using its web-site.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why have companies flocked to do business when consumers have stayed at home? One reason is that on-line shopping for individuals sometimes has to compete with the social pleasures of the real thing. Business buyers simply want the right product at the right price. Another problem is that more people have access to the Internet at work than at home. According to <font size=-1>IDC</font>, a market-research firm in Massachusetts, 20% of Internet users who have access at work have bought goods on-line compared with 14% of home users. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, selling to ordinary people has been plagued by payment problems. Even though credit-card transactions over the Net are probably safer than real-world ones, many users are still reluctant to use plastic to pay for goods on-line. Companies have no such problems: their bills tend to be settled by monthly accounts. An ordinary shopper may fret that his $50 credit-card transaction will be intercepted; meanwhile, Cisco has made some 4,000 sales worth an average of $25,000 each to corporate buyers. It is always easier to spend the company's money than your own.

<html><head><title>Think big, Mr President</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p>

<h1 align=center>Think big, Mr President</h1>


<CleverDrop>AFTER his second inauguration, in 1973, Richard Nixon confided to his diary that he felt melancholy. He could not think why. Even Ronald Reagan felt uncharacteristically grim after his second swearing-in: it was "back to work", he wrote later, to try to salvage something from his first four years. The beginnings of second terms are like that. Rather than the excitement and possibilities of power, presidents see drudgery and obstacles. Where once they might have clambered confidently up the cliff-face to hammer out their monument in history, they now creep out nervously over their own half-finished creation, daring a nick there and a polish there, before that jerk on the rope signals that their time is up. <br> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bill Clinton too is more cautious now, with more sober people round him. If he has carried away any lesson from his first four years, it is that grandiose ideas are dangerous, and that little things (sick leave, emergency numbers) are vote-winners. In fact, it goes deeper than that in the Clintonian psychology: little things that mean a lot to ordinary people are really big things, for which history will give him credit. This comforts him. The shock of November 1994, when the Republican avant-garde seized control of Congress, taught him the value of staying in the centre and embracing incremental change. A bold, unbridled second term? Forget it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, his past is haunting him. Although some of the scandals may subside and others may never become inflamed (see <a href="sf0814.html"> page</a>), their range is both impressive and depressing. Something will cause damage. And before long Mr Clinton will be hobbled in any case, unable to get his political way even with sterling effort. Listeners to next week's inauguration speech should not be deceived: under the portentous phrases will lie a commitment to nothing very much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the new Congress, the mood is much the same. The Republicans held both houses in November, but took a battering. Newt Gingrich, the speaker and the source of much of their radicalism, is in trouble and has lost authority. Far from pushing their revolution, with its useful (though sometimes hair-raising) questioning of the status quo, the Republicans are waiting for the president to take the lead on policy. But Mr Clinton, whose boldest recent initiatives have been filchings of Republican ideas, has nothing particular to offer them.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>Big problems, bold solutions</b></b><br>
This diffidence and pragmatism on both sides might be touching, if America's problems were as small as the horizons of its politicians. But they are not. At home, budget priorities are in a mess. Taxes are in urgent need of simplification. The two giant entitlement programmes, Medicare (health care for the elderly) and Social Security (state pensions) must be put on a solvent footing before the baby-boomers start to retire. America's schools are feeble by international standards, and many of its cities are intolerably violent. Abroad, America faces a world in which a period of unnatural tranquillity seems bound to end; in which China is newly aggressive, Russia unsettled, and the old alliances are weakened by lack of confidence. In short, there is a lot to do.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And so far, in almost every case, Mr Clinton and the Republican Congress are favouring the fiddle-and-tinker approach. On the budget, the laudable aim of balance by 2002 is to be achieved by squeezing discretionary spending as hard as it can bear, in order to bring in new tax cuts and tax breaks promised during the campaign. This spending (for such things as roads, parks and schools) could be spared, in part, if at least a start was made on entitlement reform. But on Medicare, Mr Clinton prefers the "quick fix" (his term) of transferring some of its costs into the general budget; while on Social Security, on which a commission has just reported, the president looks likely to demand yet another commission that will reach one conclusion, rather than several, and will thus give both him and Congress a political shield to cower behind.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What would a bold man do? The options on Medicare include means-testing, raising premiums and capping rising costs. On Social Security, they include raising the retirement age, raising the income limit on the payroll tax that funds the system, privatisation, investment in the stockmarket, and adjusting the consumer-price index to ensure that inflation is not overstated in benefits payments. Few politicians in either party will touch these notions. Yet Mr Clinton should be the man to try; not least because, as a Democrat, he can be trusted to support the principle of adequate social provision. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He should also be encouraged into bolder thinking towards the world outside. This does not suggest unilateral interventions, although the new secretary of state shows some enthusiasm for them. It means a greater effort by both Mr Clinton and his team to put his actions in a global context, and to acquire a true feel for America's power and potential on the world stage. Case by case and piece by piece, Mr Clinton's foreign policy has come together over the past four years into something that is broadly respectable. What it still lacks is an understanding of America's role as the world's pre-eminent enabler and enforcer, and an appreciation of how alliances and multilateral institutions can enhance and legitimise that power, rather than hamper it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton may well still feel that the time is not right for boldness. But for him, it will never be better. He has been re-elected, an event that is rare for presidents these days. This gives him capital, however short-lived. He is presiding over a smoothly growing economy with consistently low unemployment; Americans feel better about their prospects, and even crime figures are down. It is probably vain to tell this president that he need not pander to the voters any more; the urge to ingratiate lies too deep in his character. And it is vain to think that, even with the most acquiescent Congress, large reforms will be accomplished. But Bill Clinton, president, leader, commander of the bully-pulpit, long-odds candidate for Mount Rushmore, can at least set necessary changes in motion; and what is equally clear is that no one else can.<br>

<h2>A deal is done</h2>
The Israelis and Palestinians, with a lot of help from America and, at the last minute, a little from Jordan, signed a deal on Israel's withdrawal from a large part of <b>Hebron</b>. They also agreed on three (still to be defined) stages of further redeployment in rural areas of the West Bank. World leaders praised them. One Israeli minister resigned.<p>

<h2>Alliance under fire</h2>
The European Commission said it would take Britain to the European Court of Justice if it allowed <b>British Airways </b> and <b>American Airlines</b> to form an alliance. That, said Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, would hurt competition in Europe and eliminate competition on 13 transatlantic routes. He dismissed as "completely inadequate" a plan for the two airlines to shed 5% of their "slots" at London's Heathrow airport. <p>
Federal safety officials in America announced modifications, suggested by Boeing, to the rudders of all 2,700 <b>Boeing 737s </b>in operation worldwide. The craft has had two unexplained fatal crashes in America. <p>
<b>Lufthansa</b> is set for full privatisation this year after the German government gave the go-ahead to a draft bill that will ensure that the airline will remain majority-owned by Germans. The 36% stake still held by the state is worth about DM3 billion ($1.9 billion). The news limiting foreign ownership shook the price of Lufthansa's shares. <p>
<b>General Motors </b>and <b>Volkswagen </b>settled their long-running feud over alleged industrial espionage out of court. <font size=-1>VW</font> agreed to pay $100m in damages to <font size=-1>GM</font> and to buy $1 billion-worth of <font size=-1>GM</font> components over seven years; and both companies will drop all civil actions against each other. Jose Ignacio Lopez, who defected from <font size=-1>GM</font> to <font size=-1>VW</font>, is barred from working for <font size=-1>VW</font> for three years. <h2>Still bullish<p></h2>
 
Underlying inflation in America of only 2.6% last year and higher-than-expected retail sales in December boosted the Dow Jones industrial average to a new record. European <b>bourses </b>followed, with a dozen also setting record highs. Italy did not, though it has gained 14% already this year. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reached a record, but Tokyo's Nikkei failed to stabilise. <p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The battle for control of the vast<b> Busang gold field </b>in Indonesia raged undiminished. Placer Dome, a Canadian gold producer, made an offer for Bre-<font size=-1>X</font> Minerals, the tiny Canadian firm that discovered Busang (and which is now worth around C$5.5 billion, or $4.1 billion). Last year Bre-<font size=-1>X</font> had Barrick Gold, yet another Canadian producer, imposed on it as a partner by the Indonesian government. <p>
The <b>price of gold </b>was rattled, again, by the Dutch central bank's admitting that it had sold 300 tonnes of gold last year, more than recent estimates had suggested for European central banks as a whole. The central bank said it had reduced its holdings by about a fifth to bring it in line with other big European central banks. Jumpy investors fear copy-cat selling, and the price of the metal sank towards $350 an ounce. <p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Mexico has repaid, three years early, the $12.5 billion it borrowed from the United States after the <b>collapse of the peso</b> in 1994, and will shortly repay the last part of the $17.8 billion it borrowed from the <font size=-1>IMF</font>. Meanwhile, Mexican authorities arrested the leader of a powerful debtors' group formed when the currency crisis sent interest rates soaring. <h2>Trying again<p></h2>
 
The French government said <b>Thomson Multimedia</b>, the bit of Thomson <font size=-1>SA</font> that France refused to allow to be sold to Daewoo of South Korea, would soon be recapitalised. It also promised a decision on the sale of Thomson-<font size=-1>CSF</font>, the defence-electronics unit, by the end of the month. A French envoy, sent to grovel to Daewoo, said he had urged it to bid again for the multimedia unit. <p>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Last year <font size=-1>IBM</font>, for the fourth year running, received more <b>American patents</b> than any other company, the highest number ever. <p>
Germany's <b>Gehe</b>, a drug wholesaler, beat Unichem in a year-long struggle to win control of <b>Lloyds Chemists</b> with a &#163;684m ($1.15 billion) offer. It now surpasses Boots as Britain's biggest chain of chemist shops. <p>
<b>Rupert Murdoch</b>, a media tycoon, and <b>Kerry Packer</b>, his arch-rival in the Australian media industry, settled a legal dispute over the screening of rugby league matches. <h2>Staffing problems<p></h2>
 
Deutsche Bank is reeling again only months after several directors at its <b>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</b> unit in London were dismissed following a unit-trusts scandal. <font size=-1>DMG</font> suspended Nicola Horlick, top-performing head of its &#163;18 billion ($30 billion) British pension-fund operations, after allegations that she tried to persuade 20 colleagues to follow her to another bank. <p>
The seven-year saga of the privatisation of <b>Creditanstalt</b>, Austria's second-largest bank, juddered to a farcical close when the government announced the ASch17.2 billion ($1.54 billion) sale of its 49% stake to another state-owned bank. The sale to Bank Austria, its bigger rival, was the only option, said the government. Bank Austria must maintain Creditanstalt as a separate unit for five years. The European Commission is investigating the deal for illegal state aid after complaints from foreign suitors. <p>
<b>British Telecom</b> is cutting the cost of international calls to 33 countries, including America and Australia, by up to 37% to meet regulatory requirements. <p><p>

<h1 align=left>Courting abuse</h1>


<p><b>Memories "recovered" in therapy should not be allowed in court</b></p><br>
SCIENTIFIC techniques for gathering evidence are usually treated cautiously by criminal courts until their efficacy has been proved beyond doubt. The use of fingerprints, for example, took a long time to be accepted. The <font size=-1>DNA</font> version of "fingerprinting" is still controversial in some jurisdictions. This is proper. Because forensic science appears to be both powerful and disinterested it can sometimes weigh disproportionately on jurors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One allegedly scientific technique, known as "recovered-memory therapy", is a case in point. Its practitioners believe that there exists a special mental mechanism that sequesters and represses the memory of repeated traumatic events, and that, by the use of special techniques, it is possible to recover these memories accurately, years or even decades later. Memories of such long-ago traumas (most often childhood sexual abuse) that have apparently been "recovered" by psychotherapists using these techniques have been employed in many countries to convict alleged paedophiles. Sometimes, no corroboration has been offered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, recovered-memory therapy has not been proved beyond doubt to be reliable (see <a href="st4119.html"> page</a>). In the minds of many scientific researchers it has not even been proved at all--rather the opposite. Yet not only is its use accepted without question in many places, but the rules of evidence have often been bent to accommodate testimony gathered by it. In some places, indeed, statutes of limitation have been suspended for this sort of evidence alone.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Two wrongs</b></b><br>
This bending of normal judicial procedures arises, to be sure, from a commendable desire to prosecute people who sexually abuse children, and to deter others who might be contemplating it. In recent years it has become clear that such appalling crimes are far more common than was previously thought, and that the shame and fear of the victims have protected many perpetrators. But that is no argument for endowing an unproven procedure such as recovered-memory therapy with the halo of science and then going on to use it to bring unsafe convictions. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast with recovered-memory therapy, hypnosis is a reasonably well understood phenomenon. It is used by some police forces to help gather evidence. It can help to point the finger in circumstances that are otherwise mysterious. And yet such evidence is not admissible in court. This is because of a consistent finding that people are more confident of their memories under hypnosis, but that the memories themselves are more likely to be inaccurate. Only if the finger pointed under hypnosis leads to more substantial proof, of a sort that is admissible, can a case proceed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The proper caution that governs the forensic use of hypnosis makes it all the more disturbing that some jurisdictions have come to treat the much more dubious methods used by psychotherapists to "recover" memory with special respect. There is, indeed, a consensus among mainstream medical institutions such as the American Psychiatric Association that, at its most charitable, there is no way in which scientists can tell if memories "recovered" in this way are reliable renderings of actual events.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rules of evidence are there for good reasons. They have been established over the centuries to protect innocent people from imprisonment. The same is true of statutes of limitation. Natural though it is for legislators to wish to hunt down sex offenders, there is no justification for doing so in a way such as this, which is liable to result in unsafe and unjust convictions. The recovered-memory bandwagon needs to be trundled sharply out of the courts that have been unwise enough to let it in.<br>

<h1>Monkey business?</h1>

<p><b>Bill Clinton's second term begins on January 20th. It is already being overshadowed by scandal</b></p><br>
A PRESIDENT'S second term should be more predictable than his first. Voters and politicians have had four years to study him. Policy surprises should already have been sprung. Upsets should presumably be confined to external events.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With Bill Clinton's hard-won second term, however, things look different. A cloud of unpredictability hangs over it, deriving mainly from an assortment of scandals which complicate the outlook for the next four years. At worst, these scandals could turn Clinton <font size=-1>II</font> into a miserable replay of Nixon <font size=-1>II</font>, though few people expect the president to be driven from office under threat of impeachment or prosecution. But even at their mildest, the allegations promise to be an unwelcome distraction from the business of government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And an unnecessary and damaging one, say Mr Clinton's supporters. On all fronts, both they and the president insist he has done nothing wrong, let alone anything unlawful. To them, the scandals industry is little more than a media concoction gleefully exploited--even masterminded--by the president's political foes. "Possibly the most politically charged case of journalistic malpractice in recent American history" is how one group of writers, Gene Lyons and the editors of <i>Harper's </i> magazine, have dubbed the accusations. Whatever the origins, though, the outlook is for more media probing, more court challenges, more congressional hearings and more special investigations. (See <a href="sf1.gif">table</a>)<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scandals fall into three categories. One is the sexual-harassment case brought by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee. Another is "Whitewater", shorthand for the range of matters being examined by an independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Then there is the relatively recent controversy over the Asian money which poured into Democratic campaign coffers for the 1996 elections and into the Clintons' legal-defence fund. Awkwardly for the president, all three are coming to a crunch in 1997, which is the very worst time for his second-term presidency.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Keeping up with the Jones case</b></b><br>
Paula Jones now lives in Long Beach, California, with her husband, an airline-reservations clerk, and their two sons. On May 8th 1991, she was unmarried Paula Corbin, an eye-catching 24-year-old with a clerical job at the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. That afternoon, she says, she caught the eye of Governor Clinton (as he then was) while she was working at the registration desk of the "Governor's Quality Management Conference" at the Excelsior Hotel in downtown Little Rock. By her account, one of Mr Clinton's state troopers came to tell her that "The governor said you make his knees knock"; the trooper later returned with the number of a suite in the hotel where Mr Clinton wanted to meet her. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Jones version of what followed, she naively allowed herself to be accompanied to the room, where she found herself alone with Mr Clinton. After some small talk--including a remark by the governor that her boss was his "good friend"--he put his hand on her leg and tried to kiss her, saying "I love your curves." Despite her rejections, she claims, Mr Clinton exposed himself and asked for oral sex. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Horrified, she jumped up, saying she was not that kind of girl and had to go. According to her lurid complaint--complete with a reference to "distinguishing characteristics" in Mr Clinton's genital area--the governor "looked sternly" at her as she left the room and said: "You are smart. Let's keep this between ourselves."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly three years passed. Mrs Jones said nothing in public. What then made her tell her story? She claims it was an article in the January 1994 issue of a conservative magazine, the <i>American Spectator, </i>in which a state trooper recounted how he had arranged a rendezvous at the Excelsior hotel between Mr Clinton and a woman called Paula, and that on her way out she had told the trooper "she was available to be Clinton's regular girlfriend if he so desired." Mrs Jones claims to have been outraged, and determined to clear her name. She went to a Little Rock lawyer who, unhappily for her subsequent credibility, helped her present her allegations at a press conference organised by a right-wing political group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For his defence, the president hired Robert Bennett, a $475-an-hour Washington superlawyer. Mrs Jones graduated to a couple of Virginia litigators, Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata. They failed to settle. (Under a deal proposed by Mr Bennett, Mr Clinton would issue a statement that he had "no recollection" of meeting Mrs Jones but did not challenge her claim that they had met. He would also confirm that she "did not engage in any improper or sexual conduct.") Mrs Jones filed suit, claiming damages of $700,000, in May 1994.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bennett adopted a twin strategy of attacking Mrs Jones's character and delaying her case. He derided her lawsuit as "tabloid trash". With her permed hair and painted lips, she seemed to fit the Clinton-defenders' depiction of her as a gold-digger: "Drag $100 through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find," said James Carville, a consultant to Mr Clinton. Even one of her own sisters questioned Mrs Jones's motives. Meanwhile, Mr Bennett sought to delay the lawsuit until after Mr Clinton's second term by invoking presidential immunity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strategy seemed to work. Most television networks and newspapers tiptoed around Mrs Jones's story. Mr Bennett's manoeuvres kept action on the substance of the allegations in check until after the 1996 elections.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But things are now changing, for two reasons. One is that the media are giving Mrs Jones's tale more credence, starting with a powerful article in the November issue of the <i>American Lawyer </i>by Stuart Taylor. Mr Taylor, a former sceptic about Mrs Jones's veracity, argued that her case gained credibility from corroborative interviews with two of her girlfriends in whom she says she had confided on the day of her encounter with Mr Clinton. Mr Taylor pointed to the absence of specific personal denials from Mr Clinton about what, if anything, happened between him and Mrs Jones. Mr Taylor also chided political commentators for hypocrisy; many, he said, had supported Anita Hill's "far less serious" allegations against Clarence Thomas, yet--apparently out of political or class bias--had failed to back Mrs Jones's "far stronger" case. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Journalists have been taking another look at Mrs Jones for a second reason: the march of the legal process. On January 13th, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of <i>William Jefferson Clinton v. Paula Corbin Jones</i>, a dispute with weighty constitutional implications. The court is not concerned about the substance of Mrs Jones's allegations, but about whether a sitting president should have temporary immunity from civil lawsuits relating to his unofficial acts. The Clinton side argues that Americans elect a full-time president, not a part-time litigant. Mrs Jones's lawyers argue against what they see as a dangerous extension of presidential privilege. A district judge ruled in December 1994 that Mr Clinton should not have to go to court while in office, but that lawyers could start interviewing witnesses, lest their memories fade. A year ago an appeals court, stressing the importance of equality under the law, said the case should proceed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court is expected to reach its decision by July. An outright victory for either side may be less likely than a compromise: delaying the trial, but allowing some pre-trial testimony to go ahead. If so, then Mr Clinton need not fear a verdict in the Paula Jones case, at least while president (even if Mrs Jones is telling the truth, it is not clear that she has a strong legal case for redress). But the case could still undermine his presidency through excruciating public humiliation and trial by television of "the character issue". That danger could prompt renewed efforts to reach a settlement. Then again, Mrs Jones seems keener than ever on having her day in court.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Starr-gazing</b></b><br>
James Carville, the soundbite-smearer of Paula Jones, recently set his sights on Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. Soon after last November's election Mr Carville said he would form a group to spread information on the background and hidden agenda of Mr Starr, a Republican. The plan has since stalled, but the "ragin' Cajun" had achieved his aim of splashing publicity about. Whitewater-watchers interpreted the move as a warning to Mr Starr--and a sign of Clintonite worry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton did nothing to discourage this bit of public intimidation. The president himself, in an interview before the election, had spoken of the "obvious" political aim of the probe. Whether they judged the matter too partisan, or just impenetrable, voters did not seem to worry much about Whitewater on polling day.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is Whitewater really so complicated? Certainly it stretches far and wide. In Arkansas, the institutions and people involved include the Whitewater Development Corporation, the Clintons' failed land venture in the Ozarks; James and Susan McDougal, their former business partners; and Madison Guaranty, a McDougal-owned savings & loan institution which went expensively bust. In Washington, the net of accusation stretches from the firing of White House Travel Office staff to the events surrounding the 1993 suicide of Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel. It also embraces the improper gathering of more than 900 <font size=-1>FBI </font>files by the Clinton administration. Other than at moments of high drama, such as Hillary Clinton's appearance before a grand jury, the eyes glaze over in boredom and bafflement.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet at heart, Mr Starr told an audience in Detroit last November, Whitewater is not so difficult. It is about lies and fraud. These contributed to the demise of Madison Guaranty and helped lawyers, judges, politicians and business people in Arkansas borrow money for one purpose and use it for another. It is also about the integrity of government in Washington, including whether officials deceived Whitewater investigators. In short, said Mr Starr, it is about public trust.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, Mr Starr's efforts have led to guilty pleas by nine people, to the conviction in an Arkansas court of the McDougals, and to the conviction and resignation of Jim Guy Tucker, Mr Clinton's successor as governor. While friends and associates of the Clintons have tumbled, the first couple has yet to be accused of any wrongdoing. Is that about to change?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After 14 months of inquiry, Republicans on the Senate Whitewater Committee last June issued their conclusions, which told a tawdry tale with the First Lady as the central character. It spins a story of dubious legal work in 1985 when she was a partner in the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock; of apparent attempts to cover her tracks by ordering the destruction of records; of her pivotal role (concealed by loyal allies) in the handling of documents from Vince Foster's office after his death; and of her presumed involvement in the handling of long-sought billing records, which mysteriously resurfaced in the White House and which detail her work on a matter she had once denied under oath knowing anything much about. Yet looking at the same evidence, Democrats on the committee concluded, in their minority report: "No credible evidence has been put forward to show that Mrs Clinton engaged in any improper, much less illegal, conduct." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which side will Mr Starr come down on? The question is likely to be answered in 1997. For the Clintons, the possibilities range from the benign (vindication) to the embarrassing (a blistering report) all the way to the horrific (indictment of the First Lady for obstruction of justice).<br>
</p><p><b><b>The Asian money trail</b></b><br>
If neither the Paula Jones case nor Whitewater made much impact on last November's election, the more recent revelations about improper Asian contributions to the Democratic National Committee (<font size=-1>DNC</font>) did catch voters' imagination (see <a href="sf2.gif">table</a>).  But the stories came too late to make a decisive difference and the Democrats were adept at minimising the damage before polling day. Afterwards, under press scrutiny, the trickle of revelations became a torrent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton and the Democrats needed lots of money for the election, and businessmen of Asian origin wanted lots of access to the president. It seemed like the perfect match, but for one tedious problem: the law. Political contributions from permanent residents using their own money are fine. So are donations out of money earned in the country by American-based subsidiaries of foreign firms. Other types of foreign contributions are not fine. In their push to raise a target of $7m last year from Asian-Americans, the Democrats accepted money from improper sources, including such bizarre conduits as the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. Yet to be determined is whether these contributions were accepted as a result of lax vetting (the official claim) or as part of a deliberate strategy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>DNC</font> has returned some $1.5m that it belatedly recognised to be against the rules. For example, it returned $325,000 to Yogesh Gandhi, an Indian-born Californian (who last May presented Mr Clinton with the 1996 "Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Award"). It returned $253,500 to Pauline Kanchanalak, a Washington-based consultant who brought her Thai-conglomerate clients to coffee with the president in the White House; $250,000 (since returned) bought a photo-opportunity with Mr Clinton for a South Korean entrepreneur with thoughts of building a factory in California.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The man who helped bring in much of the Asian money is John Huang, a Taiwanese-American and former employee in the Lippo empire of the Riady family, Indonesian businessmen with contacts to the president going back to his Arkansas days. Mr Huang, with a $900,000 pay-off from Lippo, joined the Commerce Department in 1994. In September 1995 he suggested to Mr Clinton that he be moved to a fund-raising post. In December he joined the <font size=-1>DNC</font> and energetically set about soliciting Asian-American donations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also energetic was another Taiwanese-American, Charlie Trie, whose Chinese restaurant in Little Rock Mr Clinton used to frequent. Last March, a few months after he learnt that the president would be appointing him to the Commission on United States-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy, Mr Trie dropped off two manila envelopes containing $450,000 in contributions from supposedly varied sources for the Clintons' legal-defence fund. The money has since been returned. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this and more gives congressional investigators (not to mention the Justice Department) plenty to get their teeth into. In the Senate, hearings will probably begin in March under the formidable chairmanship of Fred Thompson of Tennessee, a former Watergate counsel and possible Republican presidential contender in 2000. Dan Burton of Indiana, a confrontational conservative, will chair hearings in the House of Representatives.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How damaging could this be for Mr Clinton? Very, if he is shown to have knowingly played a part in illicit fund-raising, or to have helped provide a specific <i>quid pro quo--</i>such as favourable policy decisions-- in return for Asian money. But any such knowledge or linkage, even if they existed, would be hard to prove. Meanwhile, Mr Clinton can seek to rise above the row by calling for campaign-finance reform.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, it smells bad. Americans do not take kindly to the idea of foreign money polluting their politics. Like the other scandals, this one promises to be both embarrassing and distracting for the president.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The politics of scandalitis</b></b><br>
Although the outcome of all three categories of scandal remains unclear, the political peril for Mr Clinton is all too obvious. Scandals threaten to devalue that precious but volatile commodity called political capital. A run of scandals can have much the same effect on a presidency as a run on a currency: it can send it into freefall.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A president in his second term really has only his first year--his fifth year in office--to be creative," says Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution. His plans are ready, his staff is up to speed, he has the legislative initiative. By his sixth year, Congress is preoccupied with its mid-term election. Thereafter, the president is a lame duck. Alas for Mr Clinton, all the scandals are crowding together in his fifth year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a president elected with less than half the popular vote, who is owed little debt of loyalty among Democrats in Congress, and who scores poorly with the public on matters of "trust", this looks especially worrying. Mr Clinton is vulnerable. But he is also resilient. And he knows that this year could well be the one that defines his entire presidency.<br>

<h1>The mistaken temptation of tax cuts</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE inaugural podium outside the White House will barely be dismantled before Bill Clinton begins the first big battle of his second term. On February 6th the president presents his budget to Congress, beginning the months of horse-trading and hubris that mark America's fiscal process. It will, he promises, be a "credible" budget, and one that reaches fiscal balance by 2002. What he does not add is that on many counts it will be a bad budget, with a smorgasbord of tax breaks that make budget balance harder to achieve, complicate the tax code yet further, and yield scant economic benefits.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a disappointment. A year ago, the debate in Washington was all about tax reform. Inspired by the Republicans, the idea was to simplify the tax code in ways that would promote economic growth. The proposals were radical; the goals laudable. No longer. Mr Clinton's tax-cutting ideas stem from his budget proposals of last year and from assorted campaign promises. Unlike the irresponsible Bob Dole, who proposed enormous across-the-board tax cuts (though also tax reform), candidate Clinton had more modest suggestions. They included a $500 child tax credit, deductions and tax credits for post-secondary education, an expansion of tax-based saving incentives and the removal of capital-gains taxes on $500,000 of gain from the sale of a home. Tax cuts, the administration pledged, would be safe, would be paid for and would target sensible goals such as education and saving.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given these promises, Mr Clinton's budget is unlikely to yield many surprises, at least on the tax side. The total tax-cut bill is likely to be around $100 billion over the next five years. (Much of this, supposedly, will be offset by the extension of expired excise taxes and the closing of corporate loopholes). Although the exact price-tag of each initiative is still unclear, they will all be included. The administration takes the need for tax relief as a given. Politically, it is easy to see why. Mr Clinton would find it difficult to break campaign promises to cut taxes a second time. He did, after all, run on a promise to cut middle-class taxes in 1992, only to raise them--on the richest--in 1993. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, many of this year's potential tax goodies are policy mistakes. Take the child tax credit first. The idea, at least in last year's version, was to give middle-and lower-income taxpayers a $500 tax credit for every child under 13. It would benefit around 19m families with 37m children. No one pretends that this tax break will have any growth-enhancing effects. It will erode the tax base, without any guarantee that families will even spend the extra money on children. Worse, it will not even help the neediest families, since they already pay no income tax. For all its pro-family posturing, this credit is no more than a middle-class tax break.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence of the economic logic behind Mr Clinton's proposed tuition tax breaks is just as elusive. Two ideas are on the table: a $10,000 tax deduction per family for college tuition fees, and a $1,500-per-child tax credit for the first two years of college. To be eligible for the tuition tax credit, a student must earn at least a "B" average in college and stay away from drugs. The suggestion sounds good. American colleges are expensive, and investing in education is surely a valid fiscal priority. But that does not mean that these proposals are the best way to spend scarce federal dollars.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a start, it is not clear that college education, rather than, say, pre-school or primary education, is where extra money is most required. Nor is it clear that either tax credits or deductions will spur more people to study. They are just as likely to provide an extra tax subsidy for those people who would have gone to college anyway. Some experts worry that the tuition tax credit will simply pass through into higher college fees or smaller financial-aid packages. And, besides all that, the education tax-relief proposals are bedevilled with practical difficulties, as a detailed analysis in a recent edition of <i>Tax Notes</i>, a specialist tax-policy magazine, points out. Take the need for a "B" average to qualify for tuition credit, for instance. Will this be defined by tax year or by academic year? Will summer school be included? And what will stop a general inflation of college grades so that every student earns a "B" average? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's next idea is to help home-owners. By removing up to $500,000 of gain on house sales from capital-gains tax, he would make life simpler for those who worry about moving to a smaller property (capital-gains taxes are currently deferred if you buy a house of greater or equal value). But again the economic benefits are doubtful. Since mortgage interest is tax-deductible in America, residential housing already receives a huge tax subsidy. The case for expanding it is far from obvious.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Superficially, the idea of expanding Individual Retirement Accounts (<font size=-1>IRA</font>s) looks more sensible. These are special savings accounts to which individuals can contribute a certain amount each year tax-free. Taxes are due only when the savings are withdrawn at retirement. The idea is to make more people eligible for <font size=-1>IRA</font>s, to loosen the rules for withdrawal of savings (so that people could use their <font size=-1>IRA</font> savings for, say, the purchase of a first home, without incurring financial penalties), and, perhaps, to introduce a new type of "backloaded" <font size=-1>IRA</font>, on which taxes are paid up front, but which are tax-free upon withdrawal. If these incentives spur people to save more than they otherwise would, then <font size=-1>IRA</font>s could, in theory, help to raise America's paltry personal savings rate. Though economists are divided on this, there is not much evidence that they have a big impact. Rather, expanded <font size=-1>IRA</font>s will probably give yet more tax breaks to people who do not need them and will further complicate the tax code.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the best that can be said of the administration's tax proposals is that they will be more modest than the Republicans'. Congressional Republicans have lost much of their tax-cutting extremism, but still look likely to go for bigger tax and spending cuts than Mr Clinton. They, too, want to extend <font size=-1>IRA</font>s and like the child tax credit. Education tax relief they are less keen on, largely because it is so closely identified with Mr Clinton. But many Republicans would like to see a much broader reduction in capital-gains taxes than Mr Clinton proposes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as expanding <font size=-1>IRA</font>s might increase saving, so reducing capital-gains taxes could spur investment. But even here the potential economic impact is often overrated. One estimate of the effect of halving the capital-gains tax to 14% (as Bob Dole proposed) was that investment might rise by 0.2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Cutting capital-gains taxes also raises asset prices: not an obviously sensible thing to encourage with the stockmarket at dizzying heights. Moreover, its benefits accrue overwhelmingly to the top 5% of taxpayers. Aside from its expense, the most powerful argument against a big capital-gains tax cut is that it reopens the attraction of tax shelters, through which high-income taxpayers exploit a large difference between their marginal rate of income tax and the rate of capital-gains tax.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Washington's budget pundits reckon, however, that the final budget package will include some capital-gains tax cuts, probably in return for some of the president's education tax relief proposals. In fact the only constraint on a bipartisan bonanza of tax cuts is the commitment to a balanced budget by 2002 and disagreements on the depth of potential spending cuts. The goal of simplifying America's tax code, let alone truly reforming it, has receded fast. <br>

<h1>Teddy Roosevelt rides again</h1>

FOUR years ago, as he prepared for his inaugural address, Bill Clinton was inspired by Woodrow Wilson. The inspiration served mainly to keep Mr Clinton's speech short and to the point: Wilson's opening line was, "There has been a change of government." This time, Mr Clinton has a different predecessor in mind. On January 20th, when he gives his second inaugural speech, the ghost at his elbow will be Theodore Roosevelt. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is easy to see Roosevelt's attraction. When he became president in 1901 he was a dashing 42-year-old, younger even than first-term Clinton. He was passionate and sharp; of one opponent he said, "Every time he opens his mouth, he subtracts from the sum total of human wisdom." And he exuded superhuman energy. Before becoming president, he commanded a cavalry unit called the Rough Riders; like Shakespeare's Henry V, he would spend the night before a battle circulating among his men and brooding on life's great questions. Roosevelt even appeals to Mr Clinton's sentimental side. The president, when in family-values mode, likes to boast of how he read stories to his daughter when she was young. Roosevelt recited the Song of Roland in French to his children.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just Roosevelt's personality that appeals to Mr Clinton. The president has recently seized upon the idea, peddled by E.J. Dionne of the <i>Washington Post</i> a year ago, that America's current challenges resemble those faced by Roosevelt. Then, a farm economy was giving way to a new factory age. Now, a shift of similar size is under way, as factories cede dominance to information industries. Then, Roosevelt worried that new means of communication--the telegraph, the telephone, the high-speed press--were flooding small-town America with disruptive ideas. Now, Mr Clinton fears Hollywood's corrupting influence on family life, and fights porn on the Internet. Then, as now, Americans worried that the vast wealth spawned by technological advance would be unevenly distributed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a perverse way, Mr Clinton delights in this mix of technological shift, moral upheaval and growing class resentments. In both eras, to be sure, fast change undermined conventional politicians. Republicans and Democrats alike were riven by internal disputes; third parties (the Populists then, the Perotistas now) sprang up to challenge their duopoly. But Roosevelt took advantage of all this flux. He embraced a new vision of government for a new age, and so secured his place in history.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton fancies he can do the same. The dawn of the information age presents a challenge of respectable size, and so a chance to be remembered. It also makes a virtue of many unpopular Clinton traits. Mr Clinton has stolen his opponents' ideas, betrayed his own party's ideals, talked big and acted modestly. But Teddy Roosevelt, facing similar economic flux, did these things too. Indeed (and here you can almost see the Clinton visage glow), the refashioning of established party views is the essence of flux-surfing greatness.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Teddy Roosevelt (unlike his cousin, Franklin) was a Republican, and the Republicans of his time had little taste for economic regulation. But Roosevelt stole the Populists' anti-business ideas, arguing that the new concentrations of industrial power needed to be checked by a newly powerful government. He created the Commerce Department; he imposed the first federal rules on railways, drugs and meat; he founded the National Parks Service and quadrupled the federal government's land holdings. He promised Americans a "square deal", spawning a long line of slogans ("new deal", "fair deal", "great society") that sold successive expansions in government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton, for his part, sits atop a Democratic Party long fond of big government and indifferent to big deficits. But, like Roosevelt, Mr Clinton has stolen his opponents' views, arguing that the information revolution makes old Democratic ideas obsolete. Just as computers have compelled big companies to shed staff, so the era of big government is over. Just as conglomerates are giving way to networking firms, so government should form partnerships with private groups to improve schools and slum housing. Just as business can be done by Internet or telephone, so the Clinton administration takes pride in its web sites and 1-800 numbers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Mr Clinton's most hopeful supporters, this has the makings of a history-sized idea. Since the 1980s, they maintain, Republicans have wisely tried to slow government's growth, but have lacked a balancing vision of government's potential. Mr Clinton, they say, has a chance to make government leaner and more helpful at once. Computers allow smaller government to do more. Public-private partnerships allow Mr Clinton to cut welfare payments to poor mothers, while at the same time badgering business to find jobs for them. And Mr Clinton can also slim government spending by demanding more from those whom government assists. "A man can occasionally be helped when he stumbles, &#91;but not&#93; when he will not or cannot walk," Roosevelt declared. The words could almost have been Mr Clinton's. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These ideas may make for a grand inaugural address. Yet there is a darker side to the Roosevelt analogy. As he founded America's regulatory state, Roosevelt said, "I am for men and not for property," and "I rank dividends below human character." Mr Clinton can be equally guilty of seeing false conflicts between human well-being and capitalism. As he promised a new kind of government, Roosevelt side-stepped pressing but less glamorous issues such as the tariff. Mr Clinton is a side-stepper as well. He may want to refocus government on helping those who help themselves. But he shows little sign, in the coming budget fight, of cutting the other things that government now does. Mr Clinton's surest route to history lies not in techno-talk. It lies in tackling middle-class entitlements with the courage of Roosevelt's Rough Riders. <br>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<h1>Political plaything</h1>

IT WAS a packed press conference, with reporters from almost every national newspaper and broadcasting network. The minister sat down in front of the bank of microphones and announced, "I am here to outline the government's policy on homework." The fact that Robin Squire, an education minister, felt compelled, on January 14th, to make such a high-profile pronouncement on such a matter of fine detail shows how big an issue education has become in the run-up to the general election. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ministers had hoped to wrest the initiative on education policy from Labour by unveiling at the press conference a study showing that the most successful schools are the ones that set the most homework. But two days earlier, Tony Blair, Labour's leader, upstaged them by announcing that a Labour government's first piece of legislation would be an education bill, including national guidelines on homework.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, education has become a hot political topic just as the differences between the two main parties have narrowed. This is mostly due to Labour's big policy shift since Mr Blair became its leader. Having opposed most of the government's education reforms, Labour now accepts the need for a national curriculum, and for the regular testing of pupils and inspection of schools. It no longer argues that inadequate public spending is the main cause of educational under-achievement. Only the Liberal Democrats still say this.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the biggest remaining difference between Labour and the Tories--over selective schools--is overstated. Labour opposes the government's plans for more grammar schools, which select their pupils by overall academic ability. But it would let schools specialising in, say, music or languages give preference to pupils with a flair for those subjects. And existing grammar schools would not be abolished unless parents demanded it. For their part, many Tories oppose academic selection because it means that they cannot ensure their children a place at a good state school merely by buying a house nearby.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this convergence on policy, education is at the top of the political agenda because it is one of the few areas in which both parties can promise change without pledging much extra money. Moreover in recent years the government has given itself unprecedented powers over what schools teach. These reforms have also resulted in far more data being published on the performance of schools, colleges and universities, providing a steady stream of new information to fuel people's concerns. There has also been an increasing number of international studies highlighting the weaknesses of British schools compared with those in other countries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there is the current atmosphere of concern about morality and the need to build a more cohesive society. The most obvious institution for affecting this is the family, but politicians have learnt to their cost how difficult and dangerous it is to dabble in "family values", so the education system is the next best means to this end.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a drawback to the parties' sudden enthusiasm for education. Micromanagement of schools by central government is a recipe for disaster. And the scramble to appear to have distinctive policies in spite of the broad consensus is already leading to bad decisions. For instance, the government rushed through the introduction of its nursery-vouchers scheme, so that parents will get their &#163;1,100 voucher by polling day. Labour prematurely dismissed vouchers just because the Tories favour them. Both should have waited for the results of the current pilot schemes for nursery vouchers before making their minds up. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But overall, it is welcome that after years of neglect politicians now take an interest in the state of Britain's schools. The bi-partisan agreement means that, after the election, there is likely to be a great deal of continuity in the way schools are run. And the next government, whichever party wins, will be under great pressure to live up to its promises, and to get to grips with Britain's poor educational record.<br>

<p><b>Liberal Democrats</b></p>
<h1>Bliss and bother</h1>

BLISS is it to be a politician when self-interest and conviction coincide. Bliss is it therefore to be Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. Mr Ashdown believes in spending on public services, and in levying the taxes to pay for them. But, with Labour and the Conservatives both insisting they will keep taxes and spending down, he has also spotted a niche market among consumers and producers of public services for a party that articulates that belief--as he did in a thoughtful speech on January 15th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The next election is being turned into an auction of fantasy promises in which the Labour and Conservative parties try to outbid each other with bigger and better promises of tax cuts which no one believes," he said. "What people want is better services--and the knowledge that the taxes they pay are being wisely spent." He repeated a promise to give education &#163;2 billion extra a year, financed, "if necessary, with an extra penny on income tax". He also promised free eye and dental checks, paid for by 5p a packet on cigarettes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Ashdown deserves some credit for standing apart from the auction of "fantasy promises" by the other two parties. And he has tried to offer some genuinely new ideas. For example, in his speech he proposed that the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission work together to "monitor rigorously every extra pound spent to see that it raises standards, improves services and gives the taxpayer real value for money." The aim is to stop the money leaking out into more bureaucracy, or unjustified pay rises for public-service workers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This proposal, however, bristles with difficulties. The National Audit Office is at present concerned with financial propriety rather than with efficiency, although the Audit Commission, which looks at local authorities' spending, is more efficiency-oriented. It would be difficult for either body to focus on what the extra pounds of spending will buy without also looking at what existing budgets are buying. How could anyone tell whether a school that is building a new classroom was using Mr Ashdown's new money for it, or simply using money from its existing budget?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Mr Ashdown seems to envisage "ring-fencing" the new money, so that local councils are forced to spend it on education rather than on, say, roads. But councils, and Liberal Democrat-controlled councils in particular, value their right to set their own priorities. It is called local democracy, and it used to have no more passionate supporter than Paddy Ashdown. <br>

<p><b>Politics</b></p>
<h1>Bye Bye?</h1>

AFTER much havering, the Tories have decided to risk a by-election before the general election in the vacant seat of Wirral South. It will take place by March 6th. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To duck the contest would have been risky. Barry Porter, the local <font size=-1>MP</font>, died on November 3rd. Delaying the by-election for months until the general election would have defied parliamentary convention. At best, the Tories would have seemed cowardly. At worst, the Commons might have defied them by voting to hold the by-election anyway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even if the Tories were prepared to run that risk, standing and fighting makes better sense. If they hold on, they will be able to claim momentum. If they lose, the general election is almost certainly beyond them anyway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The seat is no pushover for Labour. There are 98 other Conservative seats that are more vulnerable. In last May's local elections, Labour polled more votes in Wirral South than the Tories but only just: an extra 0.8% of the vote, with the Liberal Democrats a further 12.3% adrift.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour requires a swing of 8.1% to win. Although this is far lower than the swing of 22.1% in the last Labour-versus-Tory contest in Staffordshire South East last April, close to the election things are tougher. If Labour achieved an 8.1% swing at the general election, it would have an overall majority in the Commons of 65 or more. Labour could easily fail to take Wirral South and still win the general election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Tories lose, however, their general-election chances will be remote. A detailed analysis of the last by-elections before a general election since 1951 by John Curtice of the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends, which conducts academic research on voting, shows that no government has won after suffering an adverse swing of more than 5% in the last by-election. Indeed, unless the result at Wirral South suggests that the government is no more than two percentage points behind Labour nationally, precedent suggests that the Tories will lose.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sounds right. In mid-term by-elections, voters register protest votes against the government. Towards the end, they focus on choosing who rules. Moreover, governments generally recover support nationally as general elections approach. This should be reflected in by-election results.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By-election failures late in a Parliament have been omens of disaster for big parties in the past. In 1983, Labour went down to general-election defeat months after losing Bermondsey, where the party chose a controversial candidate. It then managed to repeat the trick in Greenwich in 1987. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But success in by-elections does not guarantee success in general elections. Labour lost in 1992, despite winning the Langbaurgh by-election in 1991. And, should John Major feel tempted to go to the country at once if he wins in Wirral, he should remember what happened to his distinguished predecessor, Benjamin Disraeli. He rushed to the country in 1880 following a Tory win in a by-election in Southwark. At the general election, he lost.<br>

<p><b>Road traffic</b></p>
<h1>Jam tomorrow</h1>

EVERY political party in Britain acknowledges that traffic congestion is already intolerable. None dares propose even the smallest measure of restraint. A mass rally of Parliament by environmental groups on January 22nd will seek to persuade politicians that it could be even worse to do nothing. <br>
<PARA>The rally coincides with a private member's bill, introduced by Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat <font size=-1>MP</font> for Bath, requiring the government to achieve a 10% reduction in traffic miles by 2010. A parliamentary motion backing the bill has attracted the support of nearly a third of all <font size=-1>MP</font>s. The target is an extremely tough one. Current official forecasts predict that road mileage will increase by at least 27-44% over the next 15 years. <br> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Achieving Mr Foster's target is probably impossible without widespread road pricing. But that is still a long way off. In the meantime, traffic growth could be restrained by higher petrol duties. Two years ago, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution was widely criticised when it suggested that fuel duties should be raised so as to double the price at the pump within a decade. The commission is reconsidering this recommendation for its second report which is due to be published this summer--after the general election. Whichever party is in government by then, the commission should stick to its guns. Increasing the cost of petrol and diesel is an important element of any sensible approach to curbing traffic growth. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government's promise to increase fuel duties by 5% in real terms each year in part recognises this. But the actual increase in pump prices has averaged less than 1% over the past three years because of weak oil prices and intense retail competition. Raising duties by 9% a year, as the commission recommended, would send a much clearer signal to the market (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). It would also help curb pollution, although the government can meet its pollution target--reducing the level of greenhouse gases to the 1990 level by 2000--without higher duties because of the decline in coal usage. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scope for raising fuel duties is considerable. Pump prices are currently at their lowest post-tax level since the early 1960s. British prices are also low compared with the rest of Europe. The average price of unleaded petrol in Britain is 62p a litre compared with Italy (72p), Holland (71p), France (71p), and Belgium (69p). A study published last month by the Automobile Association found that the proportion of an average household's gross income required to own and operate a car has fallen by 40% since 1964. At the same time the fixed costs of owning a car such as insurance and vehicle duty have increased relative to the running costs--precisely the wrong signal to encourage restraint. The widely touted view that raising fuel duties would have no effect on traffic growth is not borne out by research. Studies suggest that a 10% increase in fuel prices would result in a 7% fall in petrol use. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using higher fuel prices to restrain traffic is a cruder instrument than road pricing. But road pricing is years away, at best. Even with road pricing, the level of fuel duties would have a big impact on traffic growth. Without road pricing--or direct measures such as restricting the number of parking places--higher duties are just about the only tool left to restrain traffic growth. Higher duties might be more easily sold to the public if the Treasury would waive its traditional objections to hypothecation and allow the proceeds--roughly &#163;1 billion a year for each 5% increase--to be spent on improving public transport. <br><br>

<p><b>Airports</b></p>
<h1>The Heathrow of the north</h1>

<font size=1>MANCHESTER</font><p>
NOT many decisions by the government raise a cheer in the north of England, but the announcement on January 15th that Manchester airport could build a second runway did. Graham Stringer, a Manchester councillor and chairman of the airport company, proclaimed that the &#163;172m construction project was the most significant boost to the region's economy since the Manchester ship canal was built in the 19th century. The airport--owned by ten Labour-controlled councils which stand to make a handsome profit if the airport is privatised--says that it will be able to double the number of passengers it handles to 30m by 2005. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Less delighted, however, are people who live near the airport, and environmental protesters, who argued at a nine-month public inquiry that the noise and damage to Manchester's green belt was too high a price to pay. John Gummer, the environment secretary, decided that jobs were a more pressing concern.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The economy of the north-west, which stretches from Cheshire to the Scottish border, badly needs a shot in the arm. A study by Cambridge Econometrics in 1995 forecast that in the next decade it would have the lowest rates of economic growth and job creation of any region in Britain apart from Northern Ireland. The north-west also lags well behind Scotland, Wales, the north-east and the Midlands in the amount of foreign investment it attracts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A report prepared for Manchester airport by York Consulting in 1991 reckoned that building a second runway would be the biggest single thing that could be done to improve the region's economy. It reckoned that adding 15m passengers would create 15,000 jobs at the airport and another 30,000 in firms servicing it. The indirect effects would be bigger still.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The airport confidently expects a big increase in direct flights to European and other international destinations, which should also reduce the number of its passengers who have to make connections at London's airports. This, says Samantha Grief, assistant director of <font size=-1>CBI</font> in the north-west, is why local businessmen have been enthusiastic about the second runway. Many of them, she claims, have delayed expanding their businesses until a decision had been made.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However Mr Gummer's decision is a blow to other regional airports, which will find it difficult to expand if Manchester becomes a northern Heathrow. Manchester's nearest rival, Liverpool airport, had put forward a plan, supported by those opposed to expansion at Manchester, to rebuild its runway and expand passenger numbers from 625,000 in 1996 to 12m by 2030.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rod Hill, director of Liverpool airport, says he has now ditched this plan. Together with the announcement by Ford on January 16th that it is to cut 1,300 of the 4,500 car assembly jobs at Halewood on the outskirts of Liverpool--raising fears that the factory might be closed altogether in a few years-- Manchester's good news caused nothing but gloom on Merseyside. More than a century ago Manchester mill owners dealt Liverpool a crushing economic blow when they built the Manchester ship canal to avoid high cargo-handling charges at Liverpool's docks. Manchester looks set to do it once again.<br>

<h1>Weighing the case for the network computer</h1>

<p><b>A noisy lobby in the computer industry claims that firms can save a fortune by trading their PCs for "network computers". Really?</b></p><br>
LAST year a rebel band of some of the world's biggest computer firms began to argue that "network computers"-- stripped-down computers connected to a network that holds most of their software and data--would shortly overtake the ubiquitous personal computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>). This year they will try to prove it. They are basing their case largely on an economic argument: that network computers are not only less expensive than a <font size=-1>PC</font> to buy, but also cost even less to run (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). That would be a powerful advantage, given that most companies find that maintenance, support and training are by far the greatest expenses of owning <font size=-1>PC</font>s. A closer look at the numbers, however, suggests the truth is less clear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The network computer's fan club is led by Larry Ellison of Oracle, Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy, and <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s Lou Gerstner. As it happens, these are the bosses of three of the strongest computer companies outside the oligopoly of Microsoft and Intel, which dominates the <font size=-1>PC</font> market. They see network computers primarily as a way to break the grip of the <font size=-1>PC</font>, just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> once broke that of the mainframe, and hope to make fortunes selling software (Oracle's), servers (Sun's) and mainframes (<font size=-1>IBM</font>'s) to go with this novelty. Predictably, some of the noisiest scepticism has come from Microsoft, the company that would lose most if the <font size=-1>PC</font> went out of fashion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Initially, the trio trumpeted the low price of a network computer, saying that it would cost less than $500--a quarter the price of a typical <font size=-1>PC</font>. Now that network computers are on the market (some made by Sun and <font size=-1>IBM</font>), the tune has changed: the cheapest ones for office use cost about $1,000, much the same as the cheapest <font size=-1>PC</font>s. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, the argument has shifted to the lifetime "cost of ownership" of computers. Oracle, Sun and <font size=-1>IBM</font> quote calculations by respected consultancies such as the Gartner Group that a <font size=-1>PC</font> costs an average company more than $13,000 a year when maintenance, training and time lost by users is included. The cost of buying a <font size=-1>PC</font>, amortised over five years, is a mere 5% of that.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In contrast, the lifetime costs of network computers are said to be low. Oracle claims that switching from a <font size=-1>PC</font> to a network computer can cut costs by 80%, and also boost employee productivity. This message appeals to managers, who are starting to ask what has happened to the increased productivity they expected to arise from the billions they have collectively spent on <font size=-1>PC</font>s in the past 15 years. Could network computers be what they really need: just enough technology to improve the way employees do their jobs, but not enough to go wrong? <br>
</p><p><b><b>Dearer than it looks</b></b><br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, a closer examination of the costs of ownership reveals that, far from saving lots of money, network computers may often cost a company almost as much as modern, well-configured <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Add the cost of switching, and they may cost even more in the short term. Network computers may indeed have valuable uses (see <a href="wb8547.html"> page</a>), but the main savings they offer will not come from replacing the <font size=-1>PC</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To see why, break down Gartner's estimate that a <font size=-1>PC</font> connected to an office network costs $13,200 a year. The figure has three components:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> 21% is the cost of buying the <font size=-1>PC</font> and its share of the network equipment that connects it to the rest of the office's <font size=-1>PC</font>s.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> 36% is administrative cost: anything from the cost of the systems department's help-desk to the bill for managers who have to decide what sort of computers and software to acquire in the first place. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> 43%--easily the largest chunk--comes from what Gartner calls "end-user operations": mainly productivity lost as users fiddle with their machines, rearrange the icons on their screen, play games and waste time in other ways. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Take those three components in order. Part of the reason network computers cost less to buy than an average <font size=-1>PC</font> is that the job of storing software and information is done by a central computer, or server. While the servers for a <font size=-1>PC</font> network usually just store data and connect <font size=-1>PC</font>s to a printer, servers for network computers must be faster and have more storage capacity. Similarly, the network equipment that connects the servers with the desktop machines has to be more powerful, and therefore more expensive. Virtually all the capital savings that come from installing network computers are lost in the extra cost of the network and the server.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second claim--that network computers offer savings in administrative costs--is more plausible. Because their software is stored on central servers, systems managers can keep an eye on it. Input, a consultancy based in Mountain View, California, guesses that a single systems administrator might therefore be able to look after 100 network computers, compared with only 25 <font size=-1>PC</font>s, which, it calculates, could save an eye-popping $3,400 a year per machine. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Input's calculations take no account of another administrative cost, which is likely to increase with the introduction of network computers. At least a quarter of a systems manager's time is typically spent, not on the machine on the desktop, but on the network itself and the central server. Switching to network computers is likely to double those costs, adding more than $1,000 per desktop and cutting the total savings by at least a third. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, an easier way for a company to cut these costs would be to update its existing <font size=-1>PC</font>s, by switching to Microsoft's newer operating system, Windows <font size=-1>95</font>. That, Gartner calculates, would save a company $500 a year per user in administration and support costs. And adopting the best of today's cost-cutting software and management techniques, such as those embodied in Microsoft's forthcoming Net<font size=-1>PC</font> standard, could save a further $1,000-1,200 a year in administration. Gartner reckons that the total cost difference between a pure network computer and a Net<font size=-1>PC</font> is only about 12%--about $1,600 annually.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is something, of course. But it is not much reward for a decision that puts most of the world's software programs (which run only on <font size=-1>PC</font>s) out of reach and that requires a company to revamp its entire computing operation. In the end, the cost difference between a well managed <font size=-1>PC</font> system and one with network computers will probably be slight.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the benefits to employees' productivity? Because network computers are simpler--the first generation can run only an electronic-mail program, a Web browser and special Internet software-- there should be less for users to fiddle with, either for fun or in frustration. Learning to use a network computer should be easier. And, because network computers do not have <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> or floppy drives, there is less danger that their users are secretly playing the usual time-wasting games. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But productivity is a difficult concept to measure. Gartner ascribes about $5,000 a year of lost productivity to a <font size=-1>PC</font>'s tendency to distract workers from their proper jobs. But, by the same token, a water cooler's cost might be in tens of thousands of dollars. Put a network computer in front of a worker who has been playing the occasional game of Minesweeper on his <font size=-1>PC</font>, and there is no guarantee that he will now diligently crunch numbers all day. Indeed, if the network computer is connected to the Internet at large, as opposed to just an internal office network, the opportunities for losing productivity to distraction become legion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the original benefits of <font size=-1>PC</font>s over mainframes was "empowerment": giving users control over the screen on their desktop and thus making them more creative, and no less efficient. Although it may still be unclear whether those gains have been as great as was once predicted, users, once empowered, may be reluctant to be disempowered. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PC</font> revolution marked a transfer of control from systems managers, who often understood little of users' needs, to the users themselves. Network computers will reverse this transfer. As the economic differences between the network computer and the <font size=-1>PC</font> dwindle, this power struggle will decide the future of the office computer.<br>

<h1>So why buy a network computer?</h1>

EVEN though network computers offer fewer savings compared with <font size=-1>PC</font>s than their backers claim, most analysts expect them to be selling in the millions of units within the next three years. Why? Mostly by going where <font size=-1>PC</font>s have not gone before: replacing mainframe terminals and telephones in the office, providing combination mobile telephones and "personal digital assistants" on the street, and offering cheap, easy-to-use devices attached to televisions at home.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a replacement for mainframe terminals, the arguments for network computers are rarely economic. International Data Corp, a market-research firm in Massachusetts, estimates that network computers will cost about 25% more than mainframe terminals to run. But they offer more flexibility, and an opportunity to link data entry, an activity that has traditionally been mainframe-based, to more modern Internet technology. There are still at least 30m mainframe terminals in use, and perhaps 20% of the world's 200m <font size=-1>PC</font>s are doing nothing more than acting as terminals, often for data entry. Replacing these could give network computers a corporate foothold; this is likely to be their first big market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the home, network computers are sold as a different product: $300 boxes designed to use a television as a screen and a telephone line as its connection to the Internet. A device that can simultaneously monopolise both the <font size=-1>TV</font> and the telephone seems a recipe for monstrous family rows. Happily, the rows may be muted in America by the fact that the typical home has at least three televisions, and many have at least two phone lines. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Do customers want these boxes? Web<font size=-1>TV</font>, the first home network computer widely available, sold fewer than 50,000 units this Christmas, despite glowing tributes to its speed and ease of use. A clutch of similar machines due for release this year may do better: some are expected to add the features of a network computer to popular games machines from Sony and Nintendo.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the biggest market will be for hand-held machines that combine the best of personal digital assistants and mobile telephones. Nokia, a Finnish firm, already sells such a device: an expensive digital handset that opens to reveal a simple computer that can do e-mail, Web surfing, and the usual organiser jobs. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that it does none of these especially well--the transmission limits of cellular networks slow Web surfing to less than a third of the typical modem speed-- is perhaps less important than the fact that it can do it at all. Such machines are a new product, that will reach more of the world and more types of consumers than computers have ever done before. As, of course, the <font size=-1>PC</font> has also done in its time.<br>

<h1>Remind me one more time . . .</h1>

<p><b>The weight of evidence is turning strongly against the theory that traumatic memories of sexual abuse are repressed in childhood and can be "recovered" in later life with the help of a therapist</b></p><br>
FROM the age of seven to the age of 14, as Beth Rutherford remembered it, her father regularly raped her. Sometimes her mother helped him by holding her down. After impregnating her twice, her father, a clergyman, forced her to abort the fetus herself--both times with a coat hanger. Her therapist, a church counsellor named Donna Strand, in whose care Miss Rutherford retrieved these awful events from her memory, told the church elders of the accusations. Mr Rutherford was dismissed and both parents were sent for psychiatric help. But upon examination it was found that Miss Rutherford had never had an abortion. She had never even been pregnant. In fact, she was one of the few 22-year-old virgins in Texas. In 1995, she retracted her allegations and in November 1996 she won a $1m settlement from her therapist.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Psychoanalysts have a bad reputation with other scientists for making up untestable propositions, dressing them up with fancy names, and diagnosing people as suffering from them. This is not always justified, of course--and even when it is, the guilty parties are often fringe practitioners like Donna Strand. But "recovered-memory therapy"--the sort Ms Strand was practising--looks like a particularly black mark against the profession's name.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The theory behind the therapy suggests that memories of repeated traumatic experiences--particularly sexual abuse during childhood--can be totally repressed, even as they occur. In the worst cases, alternative personalities will be created to guard such memories from the outside world. Only in the hands of a therapist can the events be recalled, the <i>alter ego</i> revealed, and the trauma truly purged.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scarcely a shred of real evidence supports this proposition. Nevertheless, proponents of recovered-memory therapy have managed to get courts of law in several countries to accept such "memories" as evidence. There are people in prison who have been convicted solely on the basis of alleged (but previously unrecalled) memories of events that took place decades in the past. Indeed, 28 American states have extended their statutes of limitation to allow such cases to be brought. In extreme cases the process has come to resemble the witch trials of 17th-century Europe and America: mere accusation has become proof of guilt.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Do, do, do, do, do you remember?</b></b><br>
The central proposition of recovered-memory therapy is fairly simple. According to Lenore Terr, a pyschiatrist and author of "Unchained Memories", one of the most influential books on the subject, there are two types of trauma. Type-<font size=-1>I</font> traumas are one-off. A terrible single event--a car crash, say--leads to sharp and accurate memories. Type-<font size=-1>II</font> traumas are serial--such as sex abuse that goes on regularly for years. The brain's response to such continuous assault is to push the memory away. In effect, the more frequently some awful thing happens, the less likely someone is to remember it. And the forgetting happens quickly. In one case a woman was said to have been raped in the cellar and to have forgotten the whole thing by the time she had reached the top of the steps. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This kind of repression is different from traumatic amnesia, a widely acknowledged phenomenon in which, say, a soldier in combat or a rape victim may never form a memory of a particularly horrifying portion of their experience. Since no memory is formed in the first place, nothing can ever be recalled in future.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a speculation, recovered-memory theory is intriguing. Unfortunately it is not backed up by the sort of evidence that science demands. The woolliness of the subject is illustrated by the diverse and contradictory symptoms (depending on whom you consult) that are said to indicate a repressed memory. Sexual promiscuity is one. Not being interested in sex is another. Liking bananas is indicative. So is not liking them. Eczema, nightmares, daydreaming, low self-esteem, aversion to gynaecological examinations, anorexia, over-eating and (perhaps inevitably) denying the possibility of abuse are all seen as symptomatic of unrecovered memories.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This list speaks of confusion. But there is a more damning case against the idea that traumatic memories can be suppressed, and then reliably recovered. A large number of experiments by academic psychologists have attacked the theory's basic assumptions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the most important of these assumptions is that recovered memories are not influenced by the process of recovery. Experimental psychologists have, however, shown how easy it is to alter recollection of real events, and to implant memories of false ones.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elizabeth Loftus, of the University of Washington, in Seattle, demonstrated this in a series of experiments whose results have been published over the past two years. Her first experiments involved showing a group of people a simulated, fairly dramatic event, such as a crime or a car crash. After the simulation, half the group was offered new (and misleading) information in conversation about the event; the other half was not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When asked to recall the incident, those who had been given the additional, wrong information--for example by having a blue car referred to as white--were many times more likely to get it wrong. The conclusion is that it is possible to use misleading information to create false memories after the fact. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another of Dr Loftus's experiments involved giving 24 people a booklet containing four stories supposed to be about events from their childhood. Three of the stories were true (they had been obtained from other family members). One, however, was a false account of getting lost at a specific place and time. The subjects were asked to read all the accounts; then they were given a week to write what they remembered. Seven of them "remembered" the fictional account of getting lost as true. Indeed, the more they talked about it, the greater the level of detail they thought that they recalled: which shop it happened in; what they were wearing; who found them and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such suggestibility is not found only in the laboratory. In 1988, Paul Ingram, a police officer in Olympia, Washington, was accused of a series of horrifying misdeeds. He was said to have raped his children, forced them to have sex with animals, and even to have indulged in cannibalism. After appearing to go into a trance, Mr Ingram could hardly confess fast enough. Eventually he recalled his vocation as a high priest of Satan. When Richard Ofshe, of the University of California, Berkeley, (who is an expert on cults, and a critic of repressed-memory theory) was brought into the case, he was struck by Mr Ingram's readiness to spill the beans. As a test, he proposed a false memory--that Mr Ingram made his children have sex with each other while he watched. Mr Ingram promptly confessed to that, too, even adding descriptive details and bits of dialogue. Despite Dr Ofshe's intervention, though, Mr Ingram pleaded guilty. He is still in prison.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another assumption of repressed-memory theorists is that recollection is always accurate (even, as psychologists might add, in the absence of suggestion). This has been challenged experimentally by Ulric Neisser, a psychologist at Emory University, in Georgia. A day after the explosion of the space-shuttle <i>Challenger</i> in 1986, Dr Neisser asked his first-year students to write down where they were when they heard the news, what they were doing, and who told them about the accident. Three years later, he tracked down 44 of them and asked them again. None got all three questions right; 11 got all of them wrong.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third assumption is that a child's memories are as reliable as an adult's. This is not true. Stephen Ceci, of Cornell University, has documented how easy it is to make children spin an elaborate tale (a trait to which most parents can readily attest). And very young children do not have the capability to carry memories of specific experiences into adulthood. The reason seems to be that the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is important for the formation of long-term explicit memories (as opposed to implicit ones, such as how to walk) takes time to develop. Until it matures (normally after the age of two), experiences do not get stored in a way that makes it possible for them to be recalled in adulthood. But many repressed-memory allegations, such as the accusation by Roseanne Arnold, an American actress, that both of her parents started sexually abusing her when she was six months old, are based on this claim.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Advocates of recovered-memory therapy dismiss such studies on the grounds that they do not deal with truly traumatic memories. But they offer little evidence of their own to prove the possibility of total, instant repression of repeated trauma. And the little that scientists do think they know about traumatic memory contradicts them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The current thinking is that in a traumatic situation, the brain's "flight-or-fight reaction" is triggered. This releases two hormones, adrenaline and noradrenaline, which act on (among other things) nerve cells in the brain in a way that "burns" the incident into the memory. What may be happening is that these hormones stimulate a structure called the amygdala. This is believed to be the brain's emotional processor. Thus soldiers who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (or shell-shock, as it was first described) may have their memories triggered via the amygdala when they see something they associate with their experiences. The problem is not that they cannot remember, but that they cannot forget.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is other, more circumstantial, evidence of the dubiousness of repressed memories. One is the curious fact that while in proven cases of abuse, a sibling is the perpetrator in 13 instances out of 14, in the 900 cases of repressed memories brought to court in America, fewer than 1% alleged sibling abuse. Another is the sheer unbelievability of many of the allegations. Dozens of people have "recovered" memories of being abducted by aliens, and roughly one in five accusers included Satanic ritual abuse such as baby-breeding, cannibalism, blood drinking and infanticide among their charges--another curious echo of the 17th century.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The windmills of your mind</b></b><br>
Against the weight of this evidence, there is but one credible study that repressed-memory advocates frequently put in the balance. Linda Williams, of the University of New Hampshire, tracked down 129 women who had been brought to a city hospital to be treated for sexual abuse. Asked 17 years later about the reason that they had ended up in hospital, 38% of these women failed to report that it was a result of abuse. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This striking result is often taken as proof of repressed memory. But it is hardly that. First, the study did not say how young the women were at the time of the abuse. All those under two, and many of those under five, would not remember it for perfectly ordinary reasons. Second, it does not address the core belief of recovered-memory theory, which is that it is sustained abuse which triggers loss of memory. Almost three-quarters of the sample were brought in as the consequence of a one-off assault. Third, and perhaps most telling, most of those who did not report the particular incident that hospitalised them could nevertheless recall other abusive incidents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This suggests, reasonably enough, that if victims are subjected to a lot of abuse, they may not remember every instance. It does not suggest that they are responding in a type-<font size=-1>II</font> way by repressing everything immediately. Mostly, then, Dr Williams's study confirms something that is already widely known: people forget things. They sometimes even forget very unpleasant things.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But they do not do so systematically. There is no empirical evidence for massive repression of memories of child abuse of the type hypothesised. Indeed, when James Hudson and Harrison Pope, two psychiatrists at Harvard University, did a computer search of the scientific literature in 1995 to find cases in which patients had survived a known traumatic event, repressed it for years, and then remembered it, they could not authenticate a single case.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strong claims require strong evidence-- particularly when those claims are destroying families and putting people in prison. Alas, the evidence for recovered-memory theory can barely even be described as weak. Child abuse is certainly an evil whose existence was ignored for too long. That is no excuse for ignoring science to pretend to find more of it than actually exists.<br>

<p><b>Electronic conflicts of interest</b></p> <h1>Can you trust it?</h1>

and the worst of the Internet.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In it, Suck exposed an attempt by the Time Warner media
empire to copy it. The latter's Pathfinder site, it discovered, was constructing a feeble look-alike--but had cluelessly left its prototype
open to the world, as Suck demonstrated by publishing the address. This was guerrilla journalism at its best, evidence that the Internet
had spawned a new class of journalistic outsiders and armed them to outdo the greatest media operations with no more than a computer
and an Internet connection.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Except that it was not so simple. While the world now knew
quite a lot about Time Warner's nascent effort, it knew very little about Suck. Most readers did not know, for example, that Suck was
an after-hours effort by two production editors at <i>HotWired</i>, the on-line sibling of <i>Wired</i> magazine and perhaps
Pathfinder's main competitor. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is not a case of true journalistic conflict of interest; it
is an example of the appearance of conflict, exactly the sort of thing editors in the world of traditional journalism are so quick to
condemn and (usually) to avoid. And other examples of this sort of conflict are all over the Internet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Slate (<a href="http://www.slate.com">www.slate.com</a>) rubbished an on-line bookstore
called Amazon.com, it did not remind its readers that it is owned by Microsoft, which is pushing competing on-line shopping services. To
be sure, Slate usually makes no secret of its ownership and even has a tiny Microsoft copyright notice at the bottom of each page. But in
an article like this it might have been expected to go a bit further: Microsoft's interests in the market are considerable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Upside</i>, a Silicon Valley business magazine, recently ran an entertaining column in its
online edition (<a href="http://www.upside.com">www.upside.com</a>) revealing the bare shelves of <i>Wired</i>'s financial cupboard. The author was David Kline, who had
written a regular column for <i>HotWired</i> until a few months earlier. Was there a connection between Mr Kline's departure from
<i>HotWired</i> and his tough assessment of <i>Wired</i>'s financial health? Hard to say: Mr Kline did not discuss his relationship with
<i>Wired</i> in his column; it came out only when <i>Wired</i>'s owner brought it up in a protest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the very best defenders of journalistic ethics get tangled up on-line. When the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i> writes about Microsoft, it does not mention that the software giant has paid it to give free access to the
<i>Journal</i>'s Web site to users of Microsoft's Web browser; nor does the <i>New York Times</i> disclose that it has arranged a
similar, albeit smaller, deal with Microsoft's competitor, Netscape. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most publications
have financial and business interests they do not disclose in every story touching on the subject. No one bats an eyelid when the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i> runs advertisements from Microsoft, even though they probably bring in far more money than its browser deal. This
is because publications also have long-established internal divisions between editorial operations and advertising; sometimes they blur,
but more often they hold firm.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the Internet's upstarts are new to all this. Do they have
such Chinese walls? Doubtful: most are lucky to have office partitions. This might not be very worrying by itself--most of them are
less than two years old, and <i>caveat emptor</i> is still the reading rule on-line--did not on-line journalism and business interests so
often clash.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two main reasons for this conflict. The first is mere inexperience:
getting into print in the old media usually requires some sort of journalistic apprenticeship or education, where keen young writers are
indoctrinated in the rules of journalism's ethics. Publishing on-line requires nothing more than a modem, literacy, and something to say.
Ethical niceties rank in priority somewhere below hard-disk crashes.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, the Internet
has sprung up so quickly that the main viable business on it is, in one form or another, the media themselves. This leads to a sort of
journalistic incestuousness: the on-line upstarts distinguish themselves most from the old media by covering the Internet itself, which
often means writing about each other. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that quite a lot of on-line stories could
be imagined to have ulterior business motives behind them if one were conspiracy-minded enough. What should one think of the
computer-industry coverage of <font size=-1>C/NET</font>, one of the Internet's largest news operations, now that it is setting up an
entertainment site with Intel, the world's largest chip-maker? Dig into the finances and alliances of most Internet media outfits, and the
resulting web of potential conflicts could keep journalism-ethics professors going for years. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simple solution--disclose all conflicts or appearances of conflict in the article--asks a
great deal; among other things, it would drown most on-line publications' lively prose in a sea of parentheses. But ignoring the issue is
no answer either. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the Web's beauties is that any publication can be of almost any
length, and information can be hidden from view unless the reader asks for it. Many publications list the computers, software and even
music <font size=-1>CD</font>s they use while producing their issues. Why not include a page of financial
connections and business alliances, too? On-line readers are a savvy bunch, able to make up their own minds about the extent to which a
business deal might flavour a publication's reporting. But only if they know whom that publication is in bed with. Considering the
business promiscuity of much of the new media world, these pages might make interesting reading.<br> <br>

<br>
<p><img src="sofar.gif"> <p><i>University-of-life Detective-Inspector Greg and his highly- educated
intellectual side-kick, Detective-Constable As quith, are struggling to discover why the corpse of the
gifted, arrogant, dangerously iconoclastic journalist, Thomas St Loe Rathbone, has been found on The
Economist plaza under a sculpture called "Market Forces". Another sculpture, "Fiscal Rectitude", has
recently come a cropper, and "The Pursuit of Reason" is the only survivor. Suspects include Edward
Strachey, the intellectually insecure editor; his dim-witted, sexpot secretary, Julia Barrington; her
husband, Donald, the newspaper's technological supremo; Geoffrey Hodgskin, a disturbed senior
journalist reverting to the economic orthodoxies of the 1840s; Sophie Hamilton, the bluestocking
Britain editor; Henry Lathbury, smart-alec South American editor; and Zoe, The Economist's
receptionist. Questions raised included how Rathbone could afford cashmere, why Hamilton tolerated him
when other section editors had sacked him, why the editor employed Julia and why such intelligent
people like such idiotic modern art.</i>
<P>
<img src="edwin.gif">
<p>
In the conference room, Strachey was nervously looking over an article on the instability of the
European Union, wondering whether publication would in retrospect appear prescient or alarmist. Around
the room sat all of the upper-level staff whom Inspector Greg, after disappearing for two hours, had
summoned to hear his conclusions.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How very Agatha Christie," remarked Henry Lathbury, studying
the paperclip he was sculpting into what looked, to Asquith, like a stainless steel giraffe. Perhaps
this was where the journalists got their strange ideas about art.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Maybe, sir, but I felt that you would all want to hear the good news. Mr Rathbone's death was completely accidental."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Silence.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely, Inspector", said Hodgskin, vocalising most of his colleagues'
expressions, "you don't expect us to believe that a ton of
iron . . . "  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Copper, actually."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hodgskin briefly wondered whether the editor ever stopped tinkering with other people's work. "That a ton
of . . . metal . . . just lost its balance and fell over as Rathbone was walking past?"  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Please, sir. If I might explain. The sculpture fell on Mr Rathbone because, having pushed it over, he was trying to lift it up
again."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What, he just knocked over a ton
of . . . copper?"  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No, madam. Carefully
took a crowbar and levered it up. When he'd accomplished his purpose he went to raise it back into
position, but tragically his energy failed him."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Europe editor broke the incredulous silence
first. "I'm sorry, Inspector--and why was Tom fiddling around with 'Market Forces' at that time of
night?"  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Because he was planting a bomb in the base."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He might as well have
suggested Tom had been trying to dig a tunnel to Ghana--the statement was so ludicrous that no one
would even dignify it with a challenge.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I have reason to believe that Mr Rathbone was in the
employ of an Ecuadorian Marxist terrorist organisation, the Brotherhood of the Red Iguana. They had
targeted the offices of <i>The Economist</i>, and retained Mr Rathbone for the task."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No! But! Tom! Bombs? Terrorists? Henry," said Strachey, grasping for a verb,
turning to his South American editor for help. "Do you know anything about these people?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed he does, sir," came Greg's cool voice. "He was the one who recruited Rathbone."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But how, how do you know--guess--all this, Inspector?"  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The mail room, Mr Strachey. Over the last few months, several packages, postmarked Quito"--Asquith was sure he had
looked that up in the atlas--"and marked 'flammable', arrived for Mr Lathbury. Later more letters
arrived, many for Mr Rathbone as well, which my source assures me contained a considerable volume of
bank notes. "Money", he continued over the buzz that was spreading across the room, "is in my
experience surprisingly quick to make its presence known, even through a brown envelope."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg paused to take a breath; everyone else jumped into the vacuum. The usually sedate conference room
erupted in a cacophony of protestations, accusations, denials, and a few rather personal insults. It
was Lathbury who eventually silenced them, by rising to his feet.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all true," he said, with
what many felt was a slight condescension. "Congratulations, Inspector. It looks as if you've caught
me. Well done."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Henry!" spluttered Strachey. Again verbs failed him.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Except that you haven't got it quite right, Mr Greg." He chuckled, in a tone which suggested to Asquith that he had
seen one too many James Bond films. "In fact, you're rather dishonouring the dead. Tom Rathbone may
have sold his newspaper--God knows he didn't have any principles--for bundles of cash and romps in his
office with Mrs Barrington, but in the end he was crushed by the burden of his conscience. And 'Market
Forces'. He was actually trying to remove the explosives when, ironically, he came to such a
depressing end."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspector Greg did not miss a beat. "Thank you for clearing that up, sir."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But Henry, why <i>The Economist</i>?" wondered Hodgskin. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As a symbol of western capitalist oppression. It's the only English language newspaper that the leaders of the
movement get in their village."  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What an extraordinarily cultured village it must be," mused
Strachey.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's as maybe, sir. Now Mr Lathbury, if you'll let Mr Asquith take you outside."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hodgskin suddenly had a rather unsettling thought. "Just a minute," he stammered. "What about
the bomb?"  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The bomb squad will have taken care of that, sir," the inspector reassured
him. "Now, Mr Lathbury . . . "  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not so fast,Inspector," said Lathbury, whose composure made Asquith wonder if he was not about to press some
hidden button and drop Greg into a pool of piranhas. "Although you've discovered the invisible hand in
'Market Forces', I'm afraid that your pursuit of reason is still one step short. You see after all
this fuss about 'Market Forces', last night I took the precaution of moving the explosives to the
other sculpture, just to make sure." He smiled a chilling smile. "Set to go off just in time for the
evening news. Right about . . . now." 
<p><p align=center><img src="bomb.gif"></p>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was
fortunate, Inspector Greg remarked at the trial, that the bomb squad had had no more appreciation for
modern art than Toby, the Alsatian sniffer dog who had led them straight to the 'Pursuit of Reason'.
Although, he added, it might be just as well for <i>The Economist </i>to ban all such
potential bomb receptacles from its premises just in case, a suggestion which Zoe lost no time in
implementing. On another of Greg's recommendations, Asquith was promoted to the Counter-Terrorism
Office--"Wouldn't want to waste that educated head of yours, would we now?" he had said. Only
the terrorists, who had hoped that even failure would bring them some media attention, were left
disappointed: on Friday night they were pushed out of the Six O'Clock News five minutes before
broadcast, on reports that France had just announced her withdrawal from the
<font size=-1>EU</font>.
<br>
<p>
<img src="andacc.gif">
<br>
THAT Julia was sexual dynamite had been obvious to Greg from the outset. The editor was so besotted with her that he put up with her slovenliness and illiteracy. She had cost him dearly in other ways, for Rathbone had been blackmailing him from the evening that he had spied them <i>in flagrante </i>on the editor's desk: both their spouses were notoriously vindictive. Taking advantage of the paper's secretive approach to salary negotiations, he had secured a doubling of his salary and a weekly wad of notes from the editor's own wallet.
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Rathbone found Julia was also having an affair with Hodgskin, he moved in and acquired her for himself. Even Julia couldn't manage three affairs in the same building in which her husband worked; she had chosen the dashing and dangerous Rathbone over her other two lovers.
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rathbone, cruel by nature, had rubbed salt in Hodgskin's wound by telling him why she had left him. The unstable Hodgskin had become more and more overwrought and convinced that Rathbone was out to destroy <i>The Economist</i>.
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rathbone had also broken the heart of Sophie Hamilton, with whom he'd been having a torrid affair, by telling her he was leaving her for the younger and sexier Julia. He warned her that if she tried to get rid of him from the Britain department he would tell her husband of her infidelity.
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Donald Barrington intercepted a sexually highly-explicit message telling Julia to meet Rathbone at midnight by "Market Forces", he sent her a cancellation message. At 11.30, entering Sophie Hamilton's office to deal with a technical problem, he found her in tears, after a row with Rathbone. They were both exchanging overwrought confidences when the editor entered and got the story out of them.
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let's do for the bastard," he said in his most authoritative voice. "It will just take one heave."
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And so it was that at midnight the three of them overturned "Market Forces" on top of Thomas St Loe Rathbone. Stealing the crowbar later to confuse the issue was a clever move, typical of the practical Barrington.
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg was never to find out the answer to his question about modern art.<br>

<h1 align=center>How safe is your airline?</h1>


<CleverDrop>WITH the possible exception of the nuclear bomb, no modern invention has inspired such a perverse mixture of gratitude and terror as the jet airliner. From one perspective, the modern passenger aircraft has made the world smaller: Sydney is now only a day's journey from London, Los Angeles an afternoon away from New York. And it has made long-distance travel far more secure, in terms of accidents for distance covered, than any other form of transport--15 times safer than cars in Britain. Yet there are few passengers who do not silently make a prayer every time that they enter an aeroplane, or do not glance up nervously at least once from behind their newspaper during the safety demonstration.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Airlines, aircraft manufacturers and air-safety authorities all like to blame this "irrational" fear on misinformation. Because air crashes are both big and infrequent, they always make the news headlines, whilst the steady, far greater carnage on the world's roads and railways is largely unreported. Besides, add the airlines, customers know that they are being irrational: if they were really frightened of crashes, they would give up flying. Instead, the number of passengers taking to the skies is growing rapidly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet rationality is not always on the airlines' side. If you measure the riskiness by comparing deaths with the number of trips made rather than the miles covered, aircraft score worse than cars. And, thanks to those rising passenger numbers, large air crashes could soon become weekly occurrences (see <a href="wb8532.html">page</a>). In the next decade, worries about safety could become the airline industry's biggest headache--and one of the key battlegrounds between carriers. So it should: this is a matter far better dealt with by the airlines themselves than by bureaucrats or politicians.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>You take the high road</b></b><br>
Air travel seems to have stopped becoming safer. From 1960 to the early 1980s the introduction of jet engines helped bring down the rate of fatal accidents per 1m landings from around 50 to two (excluding the Soviet Union). For the past ten years, however, the figure for scheduled flights (again excluding the former Soviet Union) has remained stuck at around 1.5 fatal accidents per 1m departures. Indeed, thanks to disasters like the ValuJet crash in Florida and the <font size=-1>TWA</font> crash off Long Island, 1996's figure will probably be considerably higher than 1995's figure of 1.3 fatal accidents per 1m departures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can this be improved upon, at an acceptable cost? Most crashes, including the many that go under the frightening acronym <font size=-1>CFIT</font> (or "controlled flight into terrain"), are the result of "pilot error". In a few cases--such as when a pilot handed over the controls to his son or when a pilot's English was too poor to communicate properly with the control tower--the error appears to be blatant. But in most cases, the term "pilot error" is more complicated: it means only that if the crew had reacted differently, then the crash would not have occurred.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, aircraft are driven by an uneven mix of computers and people. So-called "fly by wire" technology means that pilots have less to do; but the new gizmos still need some human help. There is evidence that older pilots in particular have found it difficult to adapt to the new technology: rules should be changed so that seniority counts for less than competence. Pilot training, too, needs to be tweaked. At present, training focuses on how to avoid errors in the first place: fair enough, but greater emphasis should also be placed on how to deal with errors when they are made, as they inevitably will be.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If training needs to become a little more reactive, then exactly the opposite seems to be required in terms of air-safety standards. The cause of air safety currently advances from crash to crash: each disaster ushers in a new range of checks. Rather than waiting for accidents to happen, air-safety organisations should take up the initiative themselves. One good example is promoting new global-positioning satellite technology that should give pilots much more accurate information about their exact position.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Rising on the wings of reason</b></b><br>
These changes would probably make air travel a little safer, but never perfectly safe. Indeed, in the foreseeable future, thanks to the increase in the number of flights, the number of crashes is bound to increase. This is a problem of success-- more demand, more flights--rather than failure. The solution to it must lie in information and openness. What consumers will want is not information about whether air travel is safe but about which airlines are safest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ideally, that information would be provided voluntarily by airlines; but in practice if it is to be trusted it will have to be required by and certified by regulators. This means forcing carriers not only to reveal their number of crashes but also their number of safety-fault violations, average age of planes, near misses and so on. Virtually all these statistics are already collected by air-safety authorities; they are just kept secret.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Airline league tables will be greeted with just as much horror by people in the industry as they have been by doctors. This is both naive and arrogant. The naivety comes in imagining that league tables will not evolve anyway. Consumers already have their own informal ideas of how safe airlines are (remember the character in "Rain Man" who will fly from Cincinnati to Los Angeles only via Australia because Qantas, Australia's main airline, has never had a crash).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The arrogance comes from assuming that consumers are not sensible enough to weigh statistics properly, balancing long-term safety records against particular recent crashes. Yet, from hospitals to stockmarkets, consumers have usually reacted perfectly intelligently to information. Indeed, once they were better informed, they might well feel more rational about air travel. Once again, this will not bring certainty. "How safe is your airline?" is a question that will always have an incomplete answer. But it is worth asking.<br>

<h2>Scraping in</h2>
 <p>
Despite his transgressions, <b>Newt Gingrich</b>, speaker of the House of Representatives, was re-elected by 216 votes to 205. Four Republicans voted against him, and five abstained. Mr Gingrich thus became the first Republican speaker to be re-elected in 68 years. The House must still decide later this month how to punish him for his misuse of tax-exempt funds for political purposes. <p>
The president's advisory council on <b>Social Security </b> (state pensions) reported that the system would probably go bankrupt by 2029, and recommended that a large part of the Social Security trust fund should be invested in the stockmarket rather than in government securities. <p>
The Supreme Court began to hear arguments for and against <b>euthanasia</b>. Two states are appealing against rulings by lower courts that have overturned state bans on assisted suicide.<p>
The Canadian government apologised to a former prime minister, <b>Brian Mulroney</b>, who had sued it over suggestions that he had received kickbacks from the sale of Airbus aircraft to Air Canada in 1988. <p>
<b>Nicaragua</b>'s newly elected president Arnoldo Aleman took office. The defeated Sandinists complained bitterly that the Supreme Court had annulled self-serving laws passed by their side of the outgoing legislature while the right wing boycotted it.<p>
<h2>Middle East</h2>
Tension mounted between <b>Syria, Lebanon and Israel</b>. Syria blamed Israeli agents for recent bomb attacks in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli troops and Hizbullah guerrillas clashed in south Lebanon; one Israeli soldier was killed. Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel. Israeli aircraft attacked guerrilla positions.<p>
Despite American mediation, and a meeting between Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, a deal on Israeli redeployment in <b>Hebron</b> continued to be held up. <p>
Iraq blamed Iran for three mortar shells fired from a truck at the Baghdad headquarters of the Iranian opposition<b> mujahiddin</b>. A hospital laboratory and an Iraqi writers' building were wrecked and a dozen people injured. <p>
A <b>Rwandan</b> court swiftly sentenced two men to death for their part in the 1994 genocide. The international genocide tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, trying the bigger criminals, proceeded at a more formal pace. <p>
A member of a right-wing group called the <b>Boer Attack Troops</b> was rearrested on suspicion of planting bombs in South Africa that have killed several people.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
After the killing of two French officers who were trying to mediate between rebels and the <b>Central African Republic</b> government, French soldiers attacked a rebel-held part of the capital, Bangui, killing at least ten people.<p>
<h2>Mounting strife</h2>
 <p>
Union leaders in <b>South Korea </b>threatened to extend industrial action to the public services unless new labour laws were repealed. <p>
The People's Action Party won 81 of the 83 seats in <b>Singapore's Parliament</b>, gaining 65% of the vote, up from 61% in 1991.<p>
<b>India's Congress party</b>, defeated in last year's general election, was expected to make an early bid for power under its new leader, Sitaram Kesri.<p>
<b>Pakistan </b>created a "security council", giving the army a "non-binding" say in government affairs.<p>
<h2>Partial climbdown</h2>
Serbia's government recognised opposition parties' electoral victory in Nis, the second-biggest city. The opposition staged the <b>biggest demonstration</b> yet in Belgrade on the eve of the Orthodox Christmas. The head of the army told students that his troops would not crush the protests. A bomb was thrown at the headquarters of a party allied to the government.<p>
Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, was admitted to hospital with signs of pneumonia. <p>
Russia said it has withdrawn its last 18,000 troops from <b>Chechnya</b>, paving the way for elections in the separatist region this month.<p>
The <b>Irish Republican Army</b> carried out bomb and rocket attacks in Northern Ireland, raising fears that loyalist groups will end their ceasefire in retaliation. In Spain, an army officer was killed, apparently by <font size=-1>ETA</font>, a <b>Basque separatist</b> group. A French paramilitary policeman was shot, apparently by a separatist, in <b>Corsica</b>.<p>
Bulgaria's ruling Socialist Party nominated <b>Nikolai Dobrev</b>, the tough-on-crime interior minister, as the new prime minister.<p>
The <b>Greek-Cypriot government </b>ordered a ground-to-air missile system from Russia, raising tensions with the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.<p>
The Swiss government said it might set up a fund to compensate <b>Holocaust victims</b> who may have lost money in Swiss banks. The outgoing president had earlier described demands for such a fund as "blackmail", prompting Jewish groups to threaten a boycott of Swiss banks.<p>
Europe's <b>unusually cold weather </b>has killed over 200 people and may depress economic growth.<p>
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in <b>Germany </b>rose to 10.9% of the workforce in December, a post-war record.<p>

<h2>Defence tactics</h2>
 <p>
Another huge round of consolidation is under way in <b>America's defence industry</b>. Raytheon made an agreed $2.95 billion offer for the missile and defence-electronics operations of Texas Instruments, beating a rival offer from Northrop Grumman. Bidding also closed for the defence unit of Hughes Electronics (whose parent is General Motors), which could be worth up to $9 billion. Again, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are thought to be the main contenders.<p>
With the impending merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas concentrating their minds, the four European partners of <b>Airbus Industrie</b>, whose lumbering structure at present means each controls its own manufacturing facilities, agreed to pool most of those assets when the consortium goes corporate in 1999.<p>
After a rush of deals at the end of last month, <b>Boeing </b> announced orders in 1996 (net of cancellations) for 559 aircraft, worth $42.8 billion. <b>Airbus</b>, on a comparable basis, had 473 net orders, worth $36.4 billion<i>.</i><p>
<b>Philips Electronics</b> is withdrawing its support from Grundig, a troubled German consumer-electronics firm in which the Dutch giant has a controlling 31.6% stake. Philips, which has taken charges of $955m because of Grundig, will now become a "passive minority shareholder".<p>
A venture by India's Tata group and Singapore Airlines to set up <b>a domestic airline in India </b>cleared one big regulatory hurdle: the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. But the civil-aviation minister was uncivil about the prospect: foreign airlines would be barred from investing-- and that includes any existing holdings, he said.<p>
Two car makers, Germany's <b>BMW</b>, in its first foray into South America, and America's <b>Chrysler</b>, formed a $500m joint venture to build 400,000 engines a year in Brazil from 1999. <font size=-1>BMW</font> will also build a factory to make 5,000 Land Rovers annually.<p>
<h2>Building a bank</h2>
<b>Woolwich Building Society</b>, Britain's third-largest, said it will have a market capitalisation of up to &#163;3.4 billion ($5.8 billion), a bit higher than expected, when it floats on the London Stock Exchange in July, and hopes to be one of Britain's top ten banks in terms of assets.<p>
Gil Amelio, head of <b>Apple</b>, said the computer maker would still make a comeback despite a warning that the first quarter would show an operating loss of $100m-150m. Apple's takeover of <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> Software, he said, would result in a new operating system for its troubled Macintosh within 18 months. Nevertheless, Apple's share price fell by nearly 20%.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Two American investment banks hit record profits in 1996. Net income at <b>Morgan Stanley</b>, though weaker than expected, rose to $1.03 billion in the year to November, up from $720m in 1995. Strong results from <b>Lehman Brothers</b> produced income of $416m, after an after-tax charge of $50m, well up from $242m in 1995.<p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Central banks, particularly European ones, sold off huge quantities of <b>gold</b> in the second half of last year. At $335 per ounce, the price of gold now stands at its lowest level in more than three years.<p>
<h2>Chinese puzzle</h2>
Li Ka-shing announced sweeping changes to his Hong Kong business empire. His main company, <b>Cheung Kong Holdings</b>, will raise its stake in Hutchison Whampoa, whose interests run from ports to telecoms. Hutchison Whampoa is also making a general offer for Hongkong Electric. Mr Li then intends to hive off part of the utility into Cheung Kong Infrastructure, whose interests lie on the mainland.<p>
German prosecutors charged <b>J&uuml;rgen Schneider</b>, whose property empire crashed three years ago in one of Germany's biggest corporate scandals, with credit fraud, fraudulent bankruptcy and forgery. They found no criminal evidence against the creditor banks he had tried to implicate in his downfall.<p>
Shares in Italy's <b>Olivetti</b> jumped on talk that the beleaguered information-technology group may at last shed its loss-making personal-computer operations for upward of 200 billion lire ($130m). The buyer may well be Centenary Group, a private investment company backed by a number of industrialists.<p>
An arrest warrant was issued for <b>Giancarlo Parretti</b>, who left America a few days before he was due to be sentenced for perjury and tampering with evidence in a 1991 case that cost him control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Mr Parretti claims he has returned to Italy because of an unrelated tax investigation.<p>
France began charging 20.6% valued-added tax on <b>telephone services </b>offered from outside the European Union to customers within it, anticipating a change in <font size=-1>EU</font> legislation that will end the tax advantage gained by companies outside the <font size=-1>EU</font> that offer call-back and other services.<p>
As part of its internal investigation into racial discrimination, <b>Texaco </b>dismissed one manager, suspended another and withdrew benefits from two retirees.<p>
<h2>Nippon blues</h2>
 <p>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Japanese investors </b>returned from the new-year break nervous about their government's tax plans. The Nikkei average fell and fell, to a 13-month low.<p>

<h1 align=left>Arguing about the monarchy</h1>


<p><b>It makes little sense to discuss monarchs and republics in isolation from other constitutional issues</b></p><br>
BRITAIN has had what would once have been unthinkable: a full-scale debate about whether its monarchy should stay or go, conducted on prime-time television, followed by a phone-in poll, supposedly of 2.5m viewers. That, at least, is the grandiose way to describe it. In truth, it was little more than a shouting match with theatrical trappings. And the poll should not be taken seriously by anyone, either by republicans crowing that Scotland voted against the monarchy and that "record numbers" of English and Welsh did too, or by monarchists crowing that two-thirds of Britons voted to keep the crown. Such self-selecting polls have been known to be appallingly misleading ever since 1936 when an American magazine's postal ballot of 2.2m votes predicted that Alf Landon would beat Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency (Roosevelt won by a landslide).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All that said, the television debate may have had two uses, apart from mere entertainment. The first is that ventilating the arguments, albeit messily, does serve some purpose; even from the monarchy's point of view it is better to encourage people to think about the institution and its function than to leave them chatting merely about the latest piece of royal tittle-tattle in the tabloids. The second is that the debate ought to have left thoughtful republicans with the following conclusion: that if there is ever to be any change in Britain's method of choosing its head of state, the burden of proof in justifying such a change lies with them, not with the monarchists.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too many republicans think it is enough to cry "anachronism!" or "indefensible hereditary privilege!", and that the argument will then be won. That might be the case if the monarchy were being set up today from scratch. But it is not. The emotional case for keeping such a long-established institution is a strong one: it is a link to tradition and to history, and is a powerful trademark for Britain. Some love it deeply, whatever the foibles of the present royal family. Others, perhaps the largest group of all, feel less strongly, but think of it rather as they might an old building: it may not be very practical, but they like the look of it just the same. And in the end, even if people resent royal behaviour and the cost of the monarchy, their contempt for those with royal blood is mild compared with their view of ordinary, elected politicians.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The real villains</b></b><br>
As if to prove that point, a <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll conducted in December offered a choice between 13 candidates for an elected president. The clear winner, ahead of politicians and businessmen, was the queen's own daughter, Princess Anne. And therein lies a lesson for any budding constitutional reformer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is that the basic problem in Britain's constitution lies with the politicians, not the royals. The government, formed by the majority party in Parliament and elected by a minority vote of the country, is simply too powerful. Most of the time, it can whip its party into voting through any measure that it cares to. Since 1911 the House of Lords has been able to offer only the scantest of checks on the government and the Commons. Local government has been emasculated. The judiciary has no written constitution against which to hold the government accountable. In most democratic systems there would still be an ultimate check: the head of state. And that is where the monarchy comes in. Its shortcoming is not that it is too powerful, or too privileged. It is that it is too weak to serve its purpose: that of acting as a check on the politicians.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On principle, <i>The Economist</i> is republican: it prefers promotion through merit and achievement to a system of deference based on inheritance. In practice, however, the priority should lie elsewhere, in reforming Britain's constitution in order to restore the checks on governmental action that were originally supposed to be there. That can be done in a number of ways: through the second chamber, a bill of rights, or indeed through the head of state. Over-mighty politicians are the real problem. Reforming the monarchy should be thought of, and argued over, as part of the solution.<br>

<p><b>Telemedicine </b></p> <h1>Big Sister is watching you</h1>

<font size=1>HAYS, KANSAS </font><p> <p>

<p>WEARING a telephonist's
headset, Kathy Rupp sits in a small office at Hays Medical Centre, a computer keyboard at her
fingertips, a television screen in front of her. Mrs Rupp is not a telephonist but a nurse, and
appearing on her screen is one of her patients, Idonna, an elderly lady sitting at home. Mrs Rupp asks
Idonna how she's been feeling, and taps the answers to a series of questions into Idonna's computer
records. Using simple electronic gadgets, Idonna takes her own blood pressure, measures her pulse rate
and holds up a thermometer to the camera so that the nurse can read her temperature. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It takes a
bit of getting used to because you're not there and you don't have the hands-on contact," says Mrs
Rupp. "But you learn to use your other senses." Administrators at Hays Medical Centre reckon that
these televisits are as good as the traditional, hands-on version, and much more efficient. Patients,
reassured by the link-up, may make fewer visits to the hospital. Mrs Rupp can see some 15 patients in
four hours, whereas a nurse physically travelling from house to house may see only five or six
patients in a day. Each televisit costs $36, compared with $135 for a home visit by a registered nurse
such as Mrs Rupp or $60 for a visit by a certified nursing assistant. Under a managed-care system,
with a fixed fee paid per person insured, telemedicine offers huge potential savings. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is such
calculations that make many people in rural America see telemedicine as a miracle cure. At the click
of a button, distances disappear and the most advanced health care can be delivered, promptly and
affordably, to the most remote areas. Hays Medical Centre, which serves a vast area of the western
Kansas plains, has become a telemedicine pioneer. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At Hays, teleconferencing is used for
teaching, for administration, for observing the behaviour of patients, and even--with the help of
close-up cameras that can focus sharply on an area the size of a dime--for detailed clinical
diagnosis. The doctors at Hays teleconsult with colleagues at distant primary-care hospitals, as well
as with specialists at Kansas University. A team of radiologists examine <font size=1>X</font>-rays
transmitted to them, either at home or at the medical centre, from 12 sites in Kansas and neighbouring
Colorado; they are thus instantly available to communities that could not afford a radiologist of
their own. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Standing in the way of these new-fangled possibilities is an old-fashioned problem:
money. The trouble is the rules governing payment for services performed under Medicare, the
health-care system for the elderly. With the notable exceptions of teleradiology and telepathology,
only services performed the traditional way--that is, in person, face-to-face--currently qualify for
Medicare reimbursement. State governments, which provide health services to the poor through Medicaid,
and private insurers could in theory be bolder. But for the most part they are cautiously waiting to
take the lead from the federal government and Medicare. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It could be a long wait. The Health Care
Financing Administration (<font size=1>HCFA</font>) has only just begun a three-year trial of Medicare
reimbursement for teleconsultations involving "hub" hospitals and distant "spokes". The project is
confined to four states (Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina and West Virginia). It will take five years or
so before the recommendations are assessed and turned into law. The <font size=1>HCFA</font> has no
plans--and no money--for similar trials in telenursing such as Mrs Rupp is practising, under a
Department of Commerce grant, in Hays. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials in Washington want to have an idea of how much
telemedicine, once sanctioned under Medicare, is likely to cost. They have not forgotten their mistake
in drastically underestimating the bill for reimbursing dialysis for end-stage renal disease. If
getting an expert consultation becomes as easy as picking up a telephone, the volume of services seems
bound to rise. There are also worries about the scope for fraud and abuse. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the potential
benefits in rural areas are so great that pressure for faster action in Washington is bound to grow.
In the final days of the previous Congress, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota introduced a bill that
would provide reimbursement for telemedical services by January 1998. Mr Conrad says telehealth holds
"incredible promise" for rural America. So it does--provided someone will pay for it.

<p><b>Hong Kong</b></p>
<h1>Facing facts</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font><p>
<p><b>There is plenty of unfinished business to settle before Hong Kong is handed back to China on July 1st. We look at the dispute over China's plans for the territory's government and the problem of the Vietnamese boat people</b></p><br>
QIAN QICHEN, China's foreign minister, recently said that Britain should have the courage to face facts in Hong Kong. Despite opposition from Britain and Hong Kong's liberals, China has approved a "provisional legislature" for Hong Kong, to replace the body elected last year under the political reforms sponsored by Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor. Since the provisional legislature is now in place, Mr Qian reasoned, further opposition has become pointless.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British, Hong Kong's Democratic Party and other liberals do not agree. They continue to challenge the body's legality. Is such opposition futile, as Mr Qian suggests? Not necessarily. Hong Kong's liberals think they may get somewhere with their legal challenges. In any event, their determination to press ahead with their protests, combined with Britain's refusal to accept the provisional body, guarantees that the run-up to the handover to China on July 1st will be difficult.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain argues that there is no legal basis for the provisional legislature either in the Chinese-British Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, or in China's post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong, the Basic Law. It has challenged China to seek an opinion from the International Court of Justice. However, Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first chief executive in the new era, has stated that the new body is both essential and legal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Tung, who was selected by the same group of Beijing appointees who "voted" in the provisional legislature three weeks ago, went to Beijing recently to seek ways to bolster the legitimacy of the body. His flying visit was hailed by China's critics as an admission of the provisional legislature's legal defects. Mr Tung rejects the idea that his journey cast doubts on the assertion that the interim body is already legal. But both he and sympathetic lawyers in Hong Kong admit something should be done to "consolidate" its legal basis. Elsie Leung, a lawyer, says China's National People's Congress, to which she is a local delegate, should take action by issuing a statement clarifying the legality of the body.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The shadow legislature is to hold its meetings across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen until it takes over from the present Legislative Council on July 1st. But, even then, Mr Tung's legal headaches may not go away. Hong Kong's liberals are preparing to launch a host of legal challenges against any legislation passed before or after the transfer of sovereignty. A senior official in the Hong Kong government warns of a "legal crisis" caused by the expected avalanche of lawsuits. In effect, Hong Kong courts will be asked to pass judgment on the legality of the provisional legislature. Martin Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, understands that the initial feedback from expert opinion in London has given him grounds for believing that the legal challenges will be successful.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The legality of the interim body is not the only problem facing Mr Tung; there is also the question of paying for the government-in-waiting. China has promised to finance it until the handover--and then to get the money back from Hong Kong's taxpayers. In theory, budgetary demands are meant to require the legislature's approval. But Mr Tung obviously expects few difficulties on that score.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both Mr Tung and Mr Patten have pledged to co-operate for the final six months of the transition but, with the governor's refusal to have anything to do with the interim legislature, such co-operation may not extend very far. The pre-and post-handover leaders have met only once since Mr Tung's position was confirmed last month, when the pair agreed to disagree.<br>

<h1>Staying on?</h1>

<font size=1>HANOI</font><p>
IF THERE is one thing that China does not want to see when it takes over Hong Kong on July 1st, it is former Vietnamese boat-people roaming the streets of its gleaming new possession. This week Shen Guofang, the spokesman for China's foreign ministry, once again said that the asylum-seekers left in the territory's camps should be sent home by the time Hong Kong is handed back to the motherland.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British, keen to tidy up before making a dignified exit from their last major colony, are doing all they can to rush the repatriation of all the Vietnamese left in Hong Kong. Efforts to send them back have gone fairly smoothly in the past eight months. Numbers in the camps have dwindled to about 5,500 from 18,000 a year ago. They have gone home either voluntarily or under a forced programme. This month Hong Kong closed one of its last big detention camps, Whitehead. Only last year, it was the scene of ugly riots as Vietnamese protested at their return to the communist country they had fled.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, even as the numbers fall, the realisation grows that the hard part is yet to come. Mr Shen's comments were prompted by a legal action being taken on behalf of the Vietnamese in the camps. The case brought against the Hong Kong government alleges that many of the remaining refugees are held illegally. At issue is a particular group of about 2,600 refugees, who are still in Hong Kong because they have not yet been "cleared" for return: the Vietnamese authorities are finding it hard to check their last known addresses in Vietnam. Nor are their identities clear, because many refugees disguised who they were in the hope of avoiding repatriation. If the case is successful--it is being heard at the moment--hundreds of Vietnamese will be allowed to walk free and melt into Hong Kong society, a prospect that appals China.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another issue is even thornier. About 250 of the refugees are ethnic Chinese with Taiwanese identity papers issued in the early 1970s, when Taiwan had a mission in what was then South Vietnam. Vietnam refuses to take them on the ground that they are "non-nationals". The reason goes back to China's war with Vietnam in 1979.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the nastier side-effects of that war was that Vietnam booted out thousands of ethnic Chinese from (mostly) northern Vietnam. About 280,000 of them still live in south-western China. Although the majority have found jobs and settled into Chinese society, none have Chinese identity papers. China still regards them as "Indochinese refugees" and would prefer them to go home. About 6,000 have said they would like to, because they still have families in Vietnam. But Vietnam says they are Chinese and must stay in China.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Vietnamese say they cannot take back the 250 non-nationals in Hong Kong, as this would hand the Chinese the precedent they may be looking for to force the 6,000 "Indochinese refugees" back home too. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has tried to mediate but has been fended off.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the clock ticks, the British may be hoping that the Vietnamese will blink first. Insisting that leaving the 250 "non-nationals" in Hong Kong is not an option, Britain argues that Vietnam should take them back at once. Aid workers mutter that a deal may still be possible, but no one can say what form it might take. It looks more and more likely that, come July, China will have to accept some Vietnamese on the streets of its repossessed territory.<br>

<p><b>Prisons</b></p>
<h1>Cell-shocked</h1>

IN LATE February or early March, the Prison Service will reach--and exceed-- its current maximum capacity of nearly 60,000 prisoners. In its desperation to come up with extra accommodation the agency is trying everything from inserting prefabricated cell-blocks into existing prisons to converting a former Pontins holiday camp into a new jail. It has even applied for planning permission to moor an American prison ship off Portland in Dorset. With the prison population continuing to rise rapidly and no new jails scheduled to open before the end of this year, no emergency measure seems too far-fetched.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not that the Prison Service will ever turn people away. If the worst comes to the worst, it can always cram more inmates into the existing cells. Cells in police stations could also be pressed into service, although this practice attracted endless criticism before its abolition in the early 1990s. Working from optimistically low projections of the prison population over the next few months, planning officials expect to get by somehow. But the government's policy of tougher sentences and tighter budgets will ensure a continuous struggle to squeeze in new prisoners.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crush for places dates from 1993 when Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on crime under the slogan "Prison Works". Soon afterwards, the Home Office predicted that the prison population would rise from 49,000 in 1994 to 58,000 in 2002. But the zeal with which judges enforced the new policy had raised it to 58,000 by the end of 1996. The Prison Service, which had been concentrating on reducing overcrowding after the Strangeways riot in 1990, suddenly found itself with neither time nor money for anything except housing more inmates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But creating extra capacity is difficult. It takes at least three years from the planning stage to opening a new prison. Moreover, local authorities are reluctant to grant planning permission: Doncaster council blocked one application last year; another in Shropshire had to be withdrawn, and more were delayed by local protests. In existing prisons the installation of flushing toilets in all cells has made it impossible to squeeze in extra beds. The need to house prisoners as close to their homes as possible and at varying levels of security creates further problems: Category B prisons in the north-west, for example, are already full.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the prisons' current straits, politicians plan to increase the pressure. The government has introduced mandatory-sentencing proposals which by its own account will eventually raise the prison population by 11,000. That assumes, with extraordinary optimism, a 20% fall in crime due to the deterrent effect of stiffer sentences. Even if the government's figures prove correct, it has budgeted for a mere 4% increase in spending by the Prison Service over the next two years, even though the growth of almost 15% in the prison population over the past two years shows no signs of slowing. Nor has Labour promised any relief, since it wants to look tough on crime in the run-up to the general election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liberal-minded pressure groups, such as the Howard League and the Prison Reform Trust, claim that overcrowding combined with likely staff reductions and sharp cutbacks in education will inevitably make prison life increasingly difficult. Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, warned against such pressures in his most recent report. As it is, 1996 saw 64 suicides in prisons in England and Wales-- the highest number ever recorded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reformers point out that the number of inmates could be cut by eliminating custodial sentences for non-threatening offenders. People who do not pay their fines account for over 20% of all prison sentences each year. 800 illegal immigrants are now in detention while their status is being decided. About 60% of the 12,000 people in jail awaiting trial or sentencing will not ultimately receive custodial sentences. And thousands more prisoners are serving short sentences for non-violent crimes. To house the big criminals, the government could do worse than set the small fry free.<br>

<h1>Big spenders</h1>

THE Treasury's decision to consider privatising its economic forecasts, announced on January 7th, officially stems from a desire to cut
costs rather than concerns about quality. But the Treasury's forecasts are always controversial. Its most recent forecast, for
example, in last November's budget, was upbeat about consumer spending in 1997, which it expected to rise by 4.25% (see <a
href="br1.gif">chart</a>). This prompted some commentators to accuse the Treasury of talking up the feel-good factor in the run-up to
the general election. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, recent data suggest that consumer spending may well be even
higher than the Treasury then thought. Eyebrows are now being raised at its prediction that this rapidly growing demand will not mean
higher inflation.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final estimate of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in the third quarter of
1996 showed that consumer spending was 1% higher than in the second quarter. Consumer credit rose by &#163;1.1 billion in
November, compared with an expected &#163;900m. Average new borrowing for September to November was 46% higher than during
the same three months in 1995. Data published on January 6th showed an unexpectedly large increase in the volume of cash circulating
in the economy in December. And the Confederation of British Industry's survey of retailers, published on January 10th, reported that
retail sales, although below some of the most bullish forecasts, were extremely strong in December.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such upbeat numbers are making the financial markets nervous about inflation. They want
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to raise interest rates to restrain demand, perhaps as soon as January 15th, the date
of his next monetary-policy meeting with Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons that the sort of
increase that Mr Clarke might be willing to contemplate--a quarter of one percentage point, say--may be too little, too late. Real
after-tax income, employment and house prices are all rising. The ratio of total personal wealth (including property, pension rights and
insurance policies) to annual disposable income is likely to reach 5.2 this year. This is up from 4.7 in 1992, and near the all-time peak
of 5.4 in 1989. Consumers are likely to spend some of this wealth as well as their higher incomes. Indeed, the ratio of savings to
personal disposable income has already started to fall.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In particular, the spending power of
those consumers who borrowed most heavily during the 1980s--and so were most hurt by the 1990s recession--has increased
dramatically. Between 1988 and 1994, someone with earnings of &#163;15,000 and a mortgage of &#163;50,000 would have seen
his disposable income after tax and mortgage payments fall by 30% in real terms. In 1997, such disposable income will be double its
level in 1994. Either interest rates will go up sharply, or inflation will--hardly a comfortable prospect for a chancellor with a general
election ahead.<br>

<p><b>Food safety</b></p>
<h1>Don't panic</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font><p>
MAD-COW disease was bad. But the food poisoning epidemic which struck in Lanarkshire last November and has so far killed 16 of its 270 victims has arguably been even more damaging for the government in Scotland. And more deaths are possible; six people are still seriously ill in hospital. On January 7th, government ministers considered the report of an inquiry they set up soon after the outbreak began, by Hugh Pennington, a professor of microbiology at Aberdeen University. They did not like what it had to say.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish deaths have certainly challenged old assumptions about food safety. The bug which caused the Lanarkshire outbreak, the 0157 variant of<i> Escherichia coli</i> (<font size=-1>E</font> coli), is much nastier than other bugs which existing rules were designed to control. In people, it produces a poison which can kill old people and damage the kidneys of children. Other side-effects, some scientists think, may appear years later. It is also extremely virulent--just ten organisms are enough to cause infection, whereas around 100,000 salmonella bugs are needed to cause illness. It can appear to be dead, and then, under certain conditions, it can recover. Unlike most bugs, it seems to like stomach acid. Normal precautions against infection are not necessarily enough: barrier nursing of the Lanarkshire victims did not prevent a nurse from falling victim.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Raw meat which is not properly cooked is the usual source of infection. The Lanarkshire epidemic was traced to a butcher's shop. But the virulence of <font size=-1>E</font> coli 0157 means that minor hygiene slip-ups can contaminate other foods. In 1995, an outbreak affecting 62 people (one of whom died) in America was traced to apple juice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Pennington's report argued that tough new regulations are needed to prevent further mass poisonings. Licensing food retailers, so that environmental-health officers can close firms not following strict hygiene rules, should boost existing powers to close suspect premises, which are subject to so many legal complexities that officials are reluctant to use them. New rules requiring food to be labelled with its origins would also allow health officials to act; a big problem in Lanarkshire was discovering whom the butcher had supplied.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But ministers reckon that this would be too Draconian. Britain's food industry is already heavily regulated, and is not necessarily to blame for the upsurge in <font size=-1>E</font> coli 0157 cases. The worst epidemic so far was in Japan last year, where 8,000 people were infected and 11 died. Ministers also think that the government over-reacted when it introduced the tough Food Safety Act in 1990 after scares about salmonella in eggs. They are not keen to add a lot of new rules now. And there may be better ways to tackle the problem. Most British food-poisoning cases are not mass affairs, but isolated incidents caused by poor hygiene, often at home. To bring down significantly the thousand or so <font size=-1>E</font>-coli 0157 poisonings which occurred in Britain in 1995, and the 80,000 other food poisoning cases, the British need only to be persuaded to cook food properly, and to wash their hands.<br>

<h1>Local calls</h1>

THE Tories continue their recovery in local by-elections which began a year ago--but are still doing much worse than they did in the
run-up to the past three general elections. They gained 16 local-authority seats in October-December 1996, according to <i>The
Economist</i>'s regular survey, and 31% of the 121,756 votes cast in three-cornered contests. However, they remain six percentage
points behind Labour. In the corresponding quarter before their general-election victories in 1983, 1987 and 1992, they were an
average of seven points ahead of Labour (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The worst
losers in the quarter were the Liberal Democrats, who lost 17 seats and held only 12. This may be bad news for Labour, too, which in
the past has relied on the Lib Dems to attract disaffected Tory voters who do not want to back Labour. These results suggest that some
of those voters are returning to the Tories, which may make it harder for Labour to win its target seats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Scotland, there are too few by-elections to yield quarterly trends. But in 1996 as a whole
there was a 6.6% swing from Labour to the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>) compared with May 1995, when the
seats were last fought. This is less than the 10.3% swing which occurred in by-elections before the 1992 general election. That swing
hit Labour hard in seats they hoped to win from the Tories. The Tories saw off their challenge in two marginal seats, Ayr and Stirling
(which is held by Michael Forsyth, a possible post-election Tory leadership candidate). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, Mr Forsyth is already in deep trouble because the Tories are doing particularly
badly in Scotland. Although their vote was 1% higher in 1996 than in 1995, the Tory share of the vote in Scottish local by-elections is
still 6% below what it was in the year running up to the 1992 general election. If the swing from <font size=-1>SNP</font> to Labour at
the general election is lower this time, too, Mr Forsyth can bid farewell to his seat and, with it, to his leadership ambitions.<br>

<p><b>Mortality</b></p> <h1>Years of living dangerously</h1>

DEAD men do tell tales--or at least the statistics about them do. And the news that British men aged between 25 and 40 are more likely
to die than they were a decade ago is a particularly sorry tale.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Male mortality as a whole
has continued to decline, thanks mostly to the better health of infants and of the over-40s. Indeed, life expectancy for men, currently
74 years, is now increasing faster than it is for women--although the allegedly weaker sex can still expect to last five years
longer.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is getting to 40 that is the problem for men. According to new figures from the
Office for National Statistics, in 1992 there were over two more deaths per 100,000 men aged 25-29 than a decade earlier, one more
death amongst those aged 29-34, and a chilling six more deaths per 100,000 in the 34-39-year-old group (see <a
href="br3.gif">chart</a>). This is not cause for panic, but it is a rude surprise: other than during war, says Michaela Benzeval, an
analyst at the King's Fund, a health-policy research body, age-group mortality has fallen across the board for a century. This kind of
reversal is unprecedented. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why has it happened? A bit less than half of the increase in the
death-rate is due to <font size=-1>AIDS</font>, which disproportionately affects young men: since the first British <font
size=-1>AIDS</font> death was recorded in 1982, 9,447 Britons have died of it, about 90% of them men. Being murdered is a young
man's game, too; the increase in total British homicides, from less than 400 in 1972 to around 700 in 1992, took its toll. The rest of
the increase in mortality is due to suicide. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which brings us to wealth. The least-skilled
men (whose death rates have been rising since the early 1970s) are more than three times as likely to commit suicide as professional
men. The incidence of suicide among the least skilled has doubled since 1972; indeed, among the four lowest occupational categories
ranked by skill, which account for two-thirds of British men, suicide rates have increased markedly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possible reason is that male suicide is closely linked to unemployment (curiously, this is
much less true of women); as joblessness has increased since the late 1970s, so has the number of men taking their own lives. And
because a disproportionate number of the less skilled are unemployed, suicide rates are higher at the lower end of the occupational
ladder. A second factor could be marriage--or lack of it. Divorced and single men are known to be less mentally healthy than married
ones; rising divorce rates could be contributing to the increase in male suicide. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The good
news is that the proportion of men categorised as low skilled is falling steadily (from 22.9% in 1971 to 18.9% in 1991), and the
number in the highest grades is increasing (from 22.9% to 32.9%). The moral of the story, then, is to stay in school, find a good job and
get married (or at least be sexually responsible). Otherwise the consequences may be deadly.<br> <br>

<h1>Fasten your safety belts</h1>

<p><b>Last year saw a big rise in the number of jet-airliner crashes. Worse lies ahead. That is spurring a new approach to air safety
</b></p><br> WHEN the company that makes two out of every three jet airliners says baldly that there could be a big air crash once a
week by 2010, it is time to start worrying: Boeing has no commercial interest in exaggerating the threat that hangs over aviation. But
Boeing's bleak forecast has been echoed by others, including the head of America's Federal Aviation Administration. The steady
improvement in airline safety is about to come to an end. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year was a particularly bad
one for air disasters (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart 1</a>). It saw the ValuJet crash in a Florida swamp (killing 110), the
explosion that blew flight <font size=-1>TWA 800</font> out of the sky off Long Island (killing 230) and a disastrous mid-air collision
near New Delhi in India (killing 349). On average, a jet was written off every 9.8 days. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to statistics collated by Airclaims, an aviation-insurance consultancy, there were
75 accidents that totally wrecked commercial aircraft (jets and small turboprops) in 1996, compared with an average of 66.2 during
the 1980s. These figures include the former Soviet Union. Crashes of big jet airliners--the kind nervous flyers have nightmares
about--have risen from an average of 20.6 a year in the 1980s to 25 last year in the West, and from six a year in the 1980s to 12 in
1996 in the former Soviet Union.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That pushes up the fatality figures. The total number of
deaths rose by 73% to 1,597 last year, compared with 924 in 1995 and an average of 1,136 through the 1980s. Airclaims suggests
that "we may now be seeing the early stages of a gradual increase in the annual number of total losses, with the average for the 1990s
being generally some 10% up on the late 1970s and the 1980s." <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before cancelling their
next trip, nervous passengers ought to bear in mind that a rise in the absolute number of fatal crashes is not surprising, given that air
travel has risen eightfold since the 1960s. Moreover, last year's big crashes have to be seen in the context of 12,000 jet airliners in
the sky, making over 15m flights and carrying about 1.3 billion passengers every year. The overall accident rate per trip has fallen,
from 50 in a million in the 1960s to just over one in a million today; the accident rate per kilometre flown is also lower than it was 20
years ago (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart 2</a> and <a href="wb3.gif">chart 3</a>). <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there
is still a worry. These accident rates, which fell dramatically in the 1960s and early 1970s, have barely budged in the past ten years.
Since air travel is growing by around 6% a year, simple arithmetic suggests that the absolute number of crashes is bound to rise. That
will certainly frighten travellers, and may check the growth in air travel. "There is no point in telling the people how remarkably safe
air transport is if they see television film or read of a major crash somewhere in the world at the rate of one a week," says Pierre
Jeanniot, director of the International Air Transport Association (<font size=-1>IATA</font>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Travellers already react to what little information they are given on air safety: witness the
way that American passengers deserted cheap no-frills airlines in the wake of the ValuJet disaster. They have gradually returned
(thanks partly to reassuring changes in procedures by the airlines). But ValuJet's planes are barely half full--against an industry
average of around 70%. As the number of crashes increases, travellers may look harder at the statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Airlines and aircraft companies like to claim that commercial aviation is one of the safest ways
to travel. That is absolutely right, if safety is measured in terms of deaths per distance travelled (see <a href="wb4.gif"> table 4</a>). By this measure, one British study shows that flying is 176 times safer than walking, almost 15 times
safer than travelling by car and about 300 times safer than riding a motorbike. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However,
the figures are skewed by the huge distances covered safely by air travel. Thanks to the reliability of airframes and of modern jet
engines (which have fewer moving parts to go wrong than did the old piston engines), accidents rarely happen during cruising. But 68%
of accidents happen on take-off or landing, even though these operations occupy only about 6% of flight time. Recalculate the figures per
number of trips, and cars look 12 times safer than aeroplanes, and only motorbikes look more dangerous (see <a href="wb4.gif"> table 4</a> again). Even the more neutral measure of the fatality rate per man-hour of exposure puts cars and aircraft
on a par.<br> </p><p><b><b>How not to crash</b></b><br> Different aircraft have different safety records (see <a href="wb5.gif"> chart 5</a>). All the same, the awful prospect of one big crash a week is galvanising air-safety regulators and
the aviation industry into action. There are three main ways to make the numbers look better: find new and safer technologies; raise
safety standards in the airlines of developing countries and the former Soviet Union; and improve the training of pilots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The steep fall in the airline accident rate since the 1960s has been due mainly to the
development of the jet engine. No such dramatic technical fixes are now on the horizon, although there are a few advances that will help.
For instance, satellite mapping of the earth's surface (mostly for military purposes) means that all new aircraft may soon be fitted with
software that will tell a pilot if he is heading for a high mountain, and perhaps even be programmed to make the plane climb over the
obstacle automatically. Satellite positioning systems will also improve air-traffic control.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Improving the safety of the world's most unsafe airlines is harder. American and European
regulators moan about the low standards that tend to prevail in South America, Africa, the former Soviet Union and China. Indeed, the
British Foreign Office recently advised Her Majesty's subjects not to take internal flights in Russia. Germany has been considering
banning some foreign airlines from picking up passengers in Germany since a Turkish airliner, leased to a Dominican company, crashed
last year in the Dominican Republic, killing 189 mainly German holidaymakers.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble
is that the standards agreed under the international air safety regime established by the 1944 Chicago Convention are too vague and
feeble for today's crowded skies. For instance, they stipulate that airlines should limit the number of hours pilots can fly--but not
whether the limit should be ten or 23 hours out of every 24. Most western countries have local standards much higher than those set by
the Chicago rules. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those rules allow countries to interfere in another country's
airline-safety standards only when they have evident reasons to be anxious. That allows intervention when dangerous airlines fly into
relatively safe countries. America's Federal Aviation Administration robustly bans foreign airlines from flying into the United States
unless they let the <font size=-1>FAA</font> supervise them.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third route to safety is
to improve pilot training. Airlines now realise that they must give more intensive training to pilots who switch to automated cockpits.
Indeed, for a time in the late 1980s it looked as though technology was causing more accidents than it prevented because of muddles
over whether the pilot or the computerised flight-management system ("fly-by-wire") was in control. An international study, led by
the <font size=-1>FAA</font>, concluded last autumn that there had been 24 accidents or serious incidents caused by such
problems.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since pilot error is reckoned to play a part in about 70% of accidents, more
attention is being paid to training. "The best pilots are no longer the traditional macho guys with the best bodily motor skills," says
Michael Willett, safety director at the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain. "They are now those with the best information-management
skills to work with digital cockpits." At present, pilot training and testing rightly concentrates on reducing errors: pilots are tested on
their ability to fly with no mistakes, following correct procedures. But to achieve a further reduction in accidents pilots also need to be
tested on their ability to overcome the consequences of the inevitable human errors. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until
now, the emphasis of air safety has been reactive. If an aircraft crashes, a painstaking investigation attempts to pinpoint the cause and
the regulators then order changes to the design of an aircraft or to the way it is flown or maintained. Now there is an attempt to apply
"quality management" techniques, as used in other industries, in air safety. International data on safety problems, near-misses and
accidents are being pooled. <font size=-1>IATA</font>'s Mr Jeanniot wants his member airlines to aim to halve the accident rate over
the next ten years by, for instance, bringing in outsiders to audit their safety-management procedures. Perhaps when such steps are
taken, aviation will get closer to its goal of zero accidents. <br> <br>

<h1>After TWA 800</h1>

AT PRESENT the cause of air safety lurches from crash to crash. Each disaster in turn produces a minor panic throughout the whole air industry. One recent example was the angst caused by <font size=-1>TWA 800</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the 24-year-old Boeing <font size=-1>747</font> exploded in mid-air off Long Island, most people at first suspected a terrorist bomb of causing the explosion; others thought it could be a missile test gone wrong. But the air industry was haunted by another (to it, more frightening) explanation: that the investigators would find some horrible technical fault associated with the aircraft's age. That might have grounded at least the older half of the world's fleet of about 1,000 jumbos, which are on average 18.8 years old. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event this did not happen. In late December the American investigators of the National Transportation Safety Board (<font size=-1>NTSB</font>) gave a much more muted verdict. They concluded that the explosion which wrecked the aircraft was probably caused by the ignition of fuel vapour in a nearly empty fuel tank attached to the centre of a wing. The source of the ignition could have been a small bomb or a missile, but was more probably the result of some malfunction such as a spark caused by faulty wiring.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Normally the only electric current to come near such a tank is for instrumentation and is too feeble to produce sparks. But flight <font size=-1>TWA 800</font> had been standing on the tarmac at Kennedy airport for several hours in hot weather, with the aircraft's cabin air-conditioning unit running at full blast. The central wing fuel tank, situated next to the air-conditioning machinery, was empty because the flight to Paris would use only the main wing tanks. But the tanks did contain fuel vapour. The exhaust heat generated by the air-conditioning unit would have raised the temperature of the vapours to the point of maximum volatility, so the slightest spark could cause an explosion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NTSB</font> has proposed a series of measures which it wants the Federal Aviation Administration, the regulator, to introduce. The <font size=-1>FAA</font>, which normally follows such recommendations, has until the middle of March to announce what it will do. But the changes are relatively minor and unlikely to ground many of these workhorses of the world's airways. The recommendations range from compelling airlines to keep the tanks full of fuel, or put in nitrogen gas, to fitting gauges to tell the pilots on the flight deck if a tank is overheating. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has brought great relief to Boeing and to the world's airlines. But an industry that ships people around in machines half of which are on average almost two decades old may not be so lucky next time.<br>

<p><b>Apple Computer</b></p>
<h1>Keep polishing</h1>

<font size=1>SAN FRANCISCO</font><p>
THE world loves an underdog, which is what Apple Computer is in the computer industry. Whether facing <font size=-1>IBM</font> in bygone days or Microsoft of late, Apple has always been far more visible than its small share of the crowded computer market would justify. But affection goes only so far--and not, these days, all the way to the average consumer's buying decisions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On January 3rd Apple announced that it will declare a quarterly loss of as much as $150m at the end of the month, which will bring its cumulative losses since the end of 1995 to about $1 billion. That alone is something of a distinction: no other American company has lost so much in the same period. Consumers are fleeing the troubled Macintosh in favour of <font size=-1>PC</font>s, and Apple's share of the world market has shrunk to about 5%--two-thirds of what it was just a year ago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of Apple's problem is that the Betamax/<font size=-1>VHS</font>-style battle for the computer industry is over, and the <font size=-1>PC</font>, rather than the Mac, has won. But Apple is even having trouble retaining its customers in normally loyal niches such as media and education. Its one claim to superiority--advanced technology and ease of use--is wearing thin. After pulling off the fiendishly difficult trick of switching to an entirely different microprocessor in 1994, Apple now finds itself stuck with the equally difficult problem of replacing an aged operating system. Its new software chief, Ellen Hancock, has ditched the company's efforts to develop a new operating system internally. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather than start again from scratch, Apple in December agreed to buy <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>, a software company founded by Steve Jobs, Apple's charismatic co-founder, for $400m. Mr Jobs himself comes back just as a part-time consultant, but his reappearance, a reminder of former glories, has at least cheered the troops. The technical object of the deal is less obviously cheering, but far more important. Apple wants to use <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>'s software technology, called OpenStep, to regain a technological lead for the Mac operating system. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On January 7th Gil Amelio, Apple's boss, explained to a packed house of the remaining faithful at the annual Macworld conference how he wants this to work. In mid-1998, Apple plans to release a mass-market version of its next operating system, code-named Rhapsody. It will be based on OpenStep and, Apple promises, will be able to run today's Macintosh software on today's Macintosh computers. That will allow current owners--not to mention prospective buyers--to keep using their hardware and software.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such "backward compatibility" is essential: without it, Apple would be launching a completely new kind of computer, and trying to build from scratch a network of independent companies writing and selling compatible software. That would be unimaginably difficult in a market already settled on the <font size=-1>PC</font> standard.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But ensuring that the new operating system is compatibile only avoids making a ruinous mistake. To regain ground that Apple has already lost, the new operating system will have to do more--in particular, more than its competition, Microsoft's Windows <font size=-1>NT</font>. OpenStep, despite being based on a design more than a decade old, seems to be modern enough. And with the Mac's beloved desktop interface, rubbish bin and all, grafted on to it, current Apple owners will feel at home.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pairing with <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> will also have some appeal for independent software developers--a group that Apple cannot afford to continue losing. It needs these people to produce enough good--and preferably unique--software for the Mac. The new operating system is based on a building-block technology that makes writing software easier than for Windows, and that will also be useful to corporate buyers, a market where Apple has not found much support in the past. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apple's demise in the near future is unlikely. Although its recent quarterly projections drove its shares down by nearly 20%, the company will still have more than $1 billion in the bank after buying <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>. But, although the new operating system may keep Apple in business, it is not enough to win back some of its lost glory.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What should Mr Amelio do? To revive Apple's reputation, the company will have to consider more radical steps. At the moment its products are a weird mix: at one end it still produces innovative gizmos, such as its much-improved Newton personal digital assistants, that recall Apple's inspired launch of the Mac in 1984; at the other it churns out run-of-the-mill stuff such as laser printers and scanners. Some make money; some do not. Like other companies in a mess, Apple needs to focus on what it does best.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least three parts of Apple might be better on their own or in another company's hands. Apple's low-end computer division (the main source of the latest losses) is a natural candidate: this is in head-to-head competition with nimble upstarts such as Power Computing, which have none of Apple's massive research-and-development overheads. Spun off, it might concentrate on improving its manufacturing efficiencies and market forecasting.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The firm is loth to lose its profitable printer, scanner and digital-camera division. But if the company must shrink to survive, now--when such a rich division can still command a generous selling price--is not a bad time to shed it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Third, Apple's consumer-electronics products, such as the Newton and Pippin, might well fare better on their own. The company's greatest talent has arguably been the ability of its designers to come up with beautiful gadgets that stir the souls of nerds and artists alike. But the result is that Apple cannot decide whether its core business is computers, operating systems, research or consumer electronics. Its elegant toys would do better in the hands of companies such as Sony, which know these markets better. In a similar position, Netscape, the leading Internet software firm, spun off a subsidiary to work with a consumer-electronics firm rather than try to serve two quite different markets simultaneously.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Keeping its research and development, software, and high-end Mac hardware in-house would allow Apple to be a well-rounded company without overextending itself. Apple's new management has shown a willingness to make hard decisions. The question is whether it will go far enough to keep both the company and its flagship, the Macintosh, alive into the next century.<br>

<h1>Lost toys</h1>

APPLE'S purchase of <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> will give Steve Jobs, founder of both firms, work probably for no more than a day a week. That will leave him more time to spend with his third--and now main-- company, Pixar, creator of "Toy Story", a computer-animated film. This is no bad thing: much as Apple needs him, Pixar needs him more. Despite the film's massive success, the firm is barely profitable, with several lean years ahead. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is strange: "Toy Story" brought in $350m--including $100m in profit-- at the box office alone. Yet Pixar made only $16m in the nine months after the film's release. Add in video and merchandise sales, including the Christmas rush to buy the film's star, Buzz Lightyear, and total profits may reach $400m. Of that, Pixar may get around $40m. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where does the rest go? To Disney, which marketed the film and the products. Pixar, which wrote, animated and produced the film, gets only about 10% of the profits; Disney gets the other 90%. Worse, this deal is for three films, the next of which, "Bugs", will not be out until late 1998 at best. No wonder Pixar's share price has fallen by two-thirds since the firm went public a year ago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lawrence Levy, the firm's chief financial officer, acknowledges that Pixar has what looks like a raw deal. But when the firm started, he says, the animated-film business was essentially a Disney monopoly; upstart Pixar had little negotiating clout. Now it has proved itself, it hopes for something more like 30-40% in its next deal, although that may not be for years. Meanwhile, Pixar has the comfort of knowing that Disney is better at wringing money out of a character than any other firm on earth: Buzz is already hugging kids at Disneyland.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The agreement between Pixar and Disney looks curiously like a throwback to the 1940s, where actors were contractually bonded to a single studio. For, although Pixar created the characters in "Toy Story", Disney owns them. Today, actors are usually free agents, yet cartoon characters remain indentured servants. Computer animation brings one bit of relief, however; Pixar still owns the data files and computer-rendering technology. If Disney wants to create another Buzz cartoon without Pixar, it will have to draw the helmeted one by hand.<br>

<p><b>Virgin</b></p>
<h1>What's in a name?</h1>

<p><b>Is Virgin, Britain's best-known company, anything more than a conglomerate? If so, thank its daredevil boss</b></p><br>
NO OTHER company chairman has quite the taste for adventure or the genius for publicity of Richard Branson, boss of the sprawling Virgin group. His latest escapade, a brush with death on January 8th in an attempt to float around the world suspended from a helium balloon, exemplified both qualities. Since 1984, when a goggled and helmeted Mr Branson announced the first Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York, his exuberant personality has defined Virgin far better than a bare description of what it sells. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From a boisterous infancy fuelled by Virgin Cola to retirement on a Virgin pension--via trips to Virgin cinemas and Virgin Megastores to buy records heard on Virgin Radio, Virgin Holidays reached on Virgin Atlantic flights, and perhaps even a wedding planned by Virgin Brides--a consumer today can look forward to a life of perpetual Virginity. Indeed, the ubiquitous Virgin name often appears to be the only glue, apart from Mr Branson, that holds the group together. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does that matter? After all, other companies have ranged widely before now. Hanson, a British-American conglomerate, made bricks, cigarettes, industrial chemicals and food. Procter & Gamble covers fewer industries, but still makes products as diverse as toothpaste, peanut butter and paper towels. But these are different from Virgin: most consumers neither know nor care about the name of the parent company. Investors may know that Procter & Gamble makes shampoo; customers buy Head & Shoulders or Pantene.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The name Virgin, by contrast, appears on a huge range of disparate products. So is Virgin simply a conglomerate unafraid to speak its name? No, because most "Virgin" businesses are less than 100% Virginal. Contrary to appearances, no single umbrella group owns them. Virgin Retail <font size=-1>UK</font>, for instance, which runs a chain of vast urban music shops known as Virgin Megastores, is only 25% owned by Virgin. The other 75% is owned by WH Smith, a British newsagent and bookshop chain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only one widely known Virgin business is in fact wholly owned by the group. That is Virgin Atlantic Airways, the largest subsidiary of the Virgin Travel Group. Virgin also owns 100% of <font size=-1>V2</font>, a record company started in November 1996 that has just released its first record. But Virgin Records, which is well known, is no longer a Virgin business at all; it was sold to Thorn <font size=-1>EMI</font>, a (recently demerged) British record and electrical-goods company, for &#163;560m in 1992. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, not every business in which Virgin has a stake carries the magic name. Rodney Fitch and Company, 50% owned by Virgin and 50% by Mr Fitch, its founder, is a design consultancy which advises companies on developing brand image. Although Virgin has excelled in building its own brand, clients might not want to feel they were getting a Virgin makeover. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The structure of the Virgin empire is complex. Eager to cut costs, Mr Branson has established a network of holding companies and offshore trusts which help the group to minimise its tax liability. More than 20 companies operate the main businesses, which can be broadly grouped into eight divisions (see <a href="wb5.gif">box</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So what is Virgin if not a conglomerate or a single company? In terms of turnover, multiplied by Virgin's share of the business, the airline is dominant. Its turnover is considerably bigger than the Virgin share of all the other businesses combined. But Virgin is not an airline with sidelines in cola and music either. Mr Branson's answer is that Virgin's structure is more like an Asian business empire, in which divisions making different products operate as separately traded companies, owning stakes in each other and sharing a name and an ethos. In "The World in 1997", an <i>Economist</i> publication, he cites the example of Mitsubishi, a family of companies making cars, textiles, electrical goods and including a bank. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jeff Rayport of Harvard Business School suggests another analogy. The only brands that can match Virgin for scope are entertainment and celebrity brands. Disney can tap hamburger boxes and toys with its wand and help them to sell, or construct an entire village in Florida--besides making films and running theme parks. Michael Jordan plays lucrative basketball but also exudes endorsements for shoes, sports equipment, cosmetics and a host of other products. Brands of this sort are tied not to the characteristics of a set of products, but to emotional associations. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the importance of Mr Branson to Virgin's fortunes. Apart from owning much of the company, he embodies several appealing and, in Britain, rare qualities: the upstart who takes on big bullies and wins; the daredevil whose risks sometimes land him in trouble; and the innovator who finds a better way to do something than stodgy established businesses. Whenever the British are asked by opinion pollsters to suggest ideal prime ministers, replacements for the queen, or even authors for a modern ten commandments, Mr Branson's name is often first on their lips. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This gives Virgin tremendous suppleness as a company, but there are risks. The most serious is of starting a business that fails to embody Virgin values. A Virgin operation that served customers badly would poison the magic potion. The group's recent rapid growth enlarges this risk, since Virgin has started to buy existing businesses rather than to build them from scratch. Virgin Express, for example, was operating as Euro Belgian Airlines when Virgin bought it in April 1996, and the staff have not been steeped in Virgin culture. Maintaining Virgin's commitment to quality and friendliness in an operation whose mission was to provide bargain-basement travel will be particularly tricky. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other sort of risk that Virgin faces is that something will happen to its celebrity chairman. The dangerous descent into the North African desert of the <i>Virgin Global Challenger</i> balloon is not the first time Mr Branson's life has been in jeopardy. During an early skydiving lesson Mr Branson had to be rescued by his instructor, James Bond-style, in mid-air after he accidentally unhooked his parachute. Hair's-breadth escapes enrich the Branson image, but a less happy ending would leave Virgin hollow. Hence recent talk by Mr Branson and his colleagues of Virgin's "brand values"-- quality, innovation, value for money, and fun--in an attempt to distinguish the company's strength from the vigour of its boss. For Virgin's sake, and that of its well entertained customers, the hope must be that they are being overcautious. <br>

<h1>Eight little Virgins</h1>

VIRGIN, with an overall turnover of about &#163;1.8 billion ($3 billion), has eight main divisions, which operate autonomously:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Travel Group, which owns Virgin Atlantic Airways, flying 2m passengers a year to America, Japan, Hong Kong, South Africa and Athens; Virgin Holidays, a tour operator; Virgin Aviation Services, a cargo service; and Virgin Express, a budget airline connecting Brussels and other European cities. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Retail, which is joint owner of the Our Price record-shop chain in Britain and operates Megastores, large music and entertainment media shops, in several parts of the world. Other subsidiaries include Virgin Trading Company, which owns Virgin Cola.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Communications has a book business, and several television and software production companies in America, Britain and Mexico. Virgin Net, an Internet service, was started in Britain at the end of 1996.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Hotels Group owns, manages or markets more than 30 hotels and clubs in Britain, most of them, such as Heaven, a London night club, or Le Manoir Aux Quat' Saisons, a smart restaurant in Oxfordshire of which Virgin owns 50%, operating under names other than Virgin. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Radio owns 75% of a British pop music radio station.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Cinema is a joint venture with several investment companies, 45% owned by Virgin, which includes the remains of <font size=-1>MGM</font> Cinemas, bought in 1995. It runs multiplex cinemas in Britain with an estimated 1996 turnover of &#163;66.9m. It is gradually restyling the cinemas and labelling them Virgin.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Direct is a 50:50 joint venture with <font size=-1>AMP</font>, a financial-services firm, set up in March 1995 to sell personal financial services, including pension schemes and tax-exempt savings plans known as Personal Equity Plans. Its turnover to the end of 1995 was &#163;28.9m.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Voyager Investments is the development arm of the group. It has a stake in the Eurostar London-Paris train service. It also houses smaller oddities, such as Virgin Airship and Balloon (of which it owns 75%), a &#163;2.2m-turnover business (1996 estimate) that gives hot-air balloon rides.<br>

<h1>Darkness at noon</h1>

<p><b>The Gulf war against Iraq in 1991 was swift, and allied casualties were few. But since then, some veterans of the war have suffered from a mysterious illness known as "Gulf-war syndrome". Although theories--and conspiracy theories--abound, it may be impossible ever to know for sure what caused it</b></p><br>
ON MARCH 1st 1991, the day after fighting ended in the Gulf war against Iraq, the noon skies in parts of the theatre of war were black with the smoke from burning oil wells. Three days later, American soldiers destroyed an Iraqi munitions depot at Khamisiyah in the south of the country. This site is now thought to have contained chemical weapons--in particular, sarin nerve gas. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the conflict, and in the months before it began, fear of chemical weapons had led large numbers of allied troops to take a drug called pyridostigmine bromide (<font size=-1>PB</font>). Fear of biological weapons and infectious diseases had led to the large-scale vaccination of troops against many different organisms and biological toxins. In order to control insects--both for sanitation and for the prevention of insect-borne diseases--pesticides were used frequently and heavily in some army camps. And blazing sun, blowing sand and biting sandflies further increased the discomfort and stress of military life in the desert.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So although the fighting on the ground lasted for only 100 hours and inflicted fewer casualties on the victors' side than any other modern war, the living and fighting conditions were harsh and unpleasant. But did they make people sick?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Answering this question is a little like an enormous game of Cluedo (or Clue as Americans know it) with half the cards missing. There are too many suspects, not enough alibis, and much of the necessary information has vanished. Even the simplest problems--how, for instance, did the French mysteriously avoid illnesses that British and American troops complain of?--are hard to answer. The fundamental ones--Who? Where? And with what?--will probably never be solved--even assuming there was a crime in the first place.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Malingering doubts</b></b><br>
The maladies claimed by veterans of the conflict are many and various. They include skin rashes, nausea, digestive problems, muscle spasms, fatigue, joint pain, lethargy, headaches, memory loss, concentration problems, sleep disorders, mood changes and birth defects--an unpleasant but amorphous group. Each of the environmental hazards described above has been suspected as a cause. And, both in America and in Britain, the way in which the military establishments have tried to explain what happened has been sufficiently incompetent that they are now suspected by many of hiding something.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This means that the latest (though by no means the last) word on the matter--the lengthy final report by the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf-war veterans' illnesses, presented to President Clinton on January 7th--is likely to be controversial. The report, by far the most extensive to date, has been assembled from a review of all the available epidemiological and medical data--and testimony from the defence department, the Veterans' Administration, American Gulf-war veterans and scientists.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The report concludes that although many Gulf-war veterans are indeed unwell, there is no single, clinically recognisable disease that can be called "Gulf-war syndrome". It goes on to argue that none of the symptoms can be attributed to any of the putative risk factors (although it emphasises that more information on troops' exposure to chemical weapons does need to be collected), and that the most likely cause of health problems is stress.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, the pet theory of many groups of servicemen and women (and the general public) has been that those troops who are suffering are sick because of exposure to chemical weapons. On the face of it, the argument looks pretty good. Nerve gas was noticed by Czech military teams (which are among the best in the world at detecting biological and chemical weapons) on January 19th 1991--two days after the beginning of the war on the ground. Five days later, the same teams detected mustard gas. Moreover, chemical-weapons alarms went off frequently during combat--and were as frequently ignored (the detectors often reacted to such things as petrol fumes).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But since the war, <font size=-1>UNSCOM</font>, the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, which is charged with the unenviable job of eliciting information from the Iraqis on their weapons programmes, has found that while Iraq did possess chemical weapons, there is no evidence that they were used during the Gulf war. The most likely explanation for any low-level exposure to mustard gas or nerve gas is that these poisons were accidentally released by allied destruction of Iraqi weapons stores.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the defence department has been slow to admit that this could have been the case. It was not until last summer that it was conceded that American troops could have been exposed to sarin during and after the demolition of the Khamisiyah munitions depot. And, at first, the Pentagon's estimates of exposure were low-- around 400 troops. It was then forced to revise them upwards to around 20,000. All this has led to allegations of a conspiracy and cover-up. Members of the Presidential Advisory Committee did not find any evidence that there has been such a cover-up, although they have strongly condemned the Pentagon's behaviour. However, there are a number of scientific arguments against the chemical-weapons hypothesis for Gulf-war illnesses.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Nasty stuff</b></b><br>
At the start of the Gulf war, the Iraqis were suspected of having at least four different chemical weapons. Besides mustard gas and sarin, they were believed to have stockpiled soman and tabun, two other nerve gases. The risk that these weapons might have been used was real: Saddam Hussein had already dropped mustard gas, at least, on Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war, and on Iraqi Kurds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mustard gas made its debut during the first world war. It burns tissues it comes into contact with, and in large doses, it can reach the bone marrow--where many cells of the immune system are made--and may cause severe depression of the immune system one to two weeks after exposure.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nerve gases belong to a class of compounds called organophosphates. They work by blocking the action of an enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is crucial for the proper action of nerves and the muscles they control. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter--one of the chemical messengers that carry signals from one nerve to another. The job of the enzyme is to mop up surplus acetylcholine. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the mopping up is prevented, the nerve does not know when to stop firing-- and muscles go into spasms. At low concentrations, symptoms of nerve-gas poisoning include loss of vision, salivation, breathlessness and headaches. At high concentrations, people may stop breathing altogether. It was to combat this that many American and British troops were issued with <font size=-1>PB</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The drug works against nerve gases in a counter-intuitive way: it also blocks the action of acetylcholinesterase. The difference between <font size=-1>PB</font> and a nerve gas is that <font size=-1>PB</font> is reversible. Whereas a nerve gas takes acetylcholinesterase out of commission forever, <font size=-1>PB</font> slowly lets it loose again. So the idea was that if <font size=-1>PB</font> was already interrupting the action of say 20-40% of the enzyme, then that 20-40% would not be available to be blocked by nerve gases. Instead, as troops came into contact with nerve gases, they would not suffer as much because <font size=-1>PB</font> would slowly render more of the crucial enzyme available again.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem with this idea is that <font size=-1>PB</font> does have the potential to make people feel sick at the time, and an overdose could be quite severe. This has led to suggestions that even if troops were not exposed to nerve gases, some of their current problems could be due to <font size=-1>PB</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there was another class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor present in the Gulf: pesticides. The pesticides used by many troops involved in the conflict were also organophosphates--in effect, they were nerve gases for bugs. In order to be fatal in people, such substances need to be taken in much higher doses than an anti-human nerve gas. Nonetheless, they are nasty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the autumn of 1996, Nicholas Soames, Britain's armed forces minister, was forced to admit that the House of Commons had been misled about the use of pesticides in the Gulf, and that such use had been far more extensive than anyone had said. Whether this concealment was deliberate or just a result of bungling is not clear--but again, it did not look good, and it damaged public confidence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each of these possibilities--low level exposures to nerve gases, the use of <font size=-1>PB</font> and the deployment of pesticides--has fallen under suspicion as a possible cause of Gulf-war illnesses. But so far, the data (which are still incomplete) are inconsistent with what is known about these substances.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For one thing, the symptoms should have been apparent from the start. However, according to members of the Presidential Advisory Committee, there are no records of health complaints during the war that are consistent with mild nerve-gas exposure. And although some sheep farmers who have used organophosphates in sheep dips have complained of ill health that is similar to that experienced by veterans of the Gulf war, sheep farmers, according to Alastair Hay, a chemical pathologist at the University of Leeds, usually report feeling bad at the time, as well as going on to have subtle neurological problems later.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After reviewing the available data--including what little there is on neurological damage among Gulf-war veterans--the Presidential Advisory Committee failed to find credible evidence that any of these substances could have caused the problems seen among American forces in the Gulf. This result is likely to be hotly disputed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Goran Jamal, a neurologist at the University of Glasgow, for instance, argues that his results show clear neurological damage among Gulf-war veterans. In a report to be published in the January 15th issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medi cal Association</i>, Robert Haley, of the University of Texas South Western Medical Centre, in Dallas, reports similar data--and claims that he has found evidence for three distinct Gulf-war illnesses. However, the sample sizes for all the neurological work done so far are tiny, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Moreover, it is possible that in combination, the effects of organophosphates could be more dangerous-- something on which the committee recommends further study. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What of the other alleged risk factors? Despite claims of a number of unusual diseases--for example, Garth Nicolson, a doctor at the University of California, Irvine, says he has found a strange organism called <i>Mycoplamsa fermentans</i> in the bodies of some veterans of the Gulf war--infection, whether naturally occurring or deliberately triggered as an act of war, does not seem to be implicated in the unexplained illnesses of veterans.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Iraqis have now confessed to <font size=-1>UNSCOM</font> that they had indeed developed a frightening array of biological weapons (although the claims have proved extremely difficult to verify). But there is no evidence that biological weapons were used in the war; nor is there evidence that biological agents were accidentally released as a result of allied bombing. Indeed, as one British general has observed, the war in the Gulf led to fewer deaths from disease than any previous conflict involving the British army. During the Crimean war, for instance, far more British troops died of cholera than died in battle.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actual disease is not the only suspect, however. Many British servicemen reckon that their ill health was caused by preventative measures against disease: vaccinations. Both British and American troops were vaccinated against an enormous array of diseases--including possible biological weapons. But again, although some people did report feeling unwell after vaccination, there is no evidence other than anecdote that suggests that the vaccines were at fault.<br>
</p><p><b><b>What about the data?</b></b><br>
Out of any large group of people, as time goes by, some will get sick. So in order to establish whether or not service in the Gulf has caused an illness, or a number of illnesses, it is important to compare different groups of people, to see what the differences are. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, the rate of birth defects in the population at large is quite high. According to the Presidential Advisory Committee's final report, from any sample of 200,000 American children, you would expect to see about 6,000 born with defects. So in order to address the emotive question of whether service in the Gulf causes birth defects, it is important to determine that there are more birth defects than expected. So far, the data suggest that this is not the case (although the British are just about to start a large study to investigate it in their forces).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is there any evidence so far that service in the Gulf was more likely to kill mysteriously than service elsewhere at the same time--or than life as an American civilian. A study published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in November 1996 compared the death rates of 695,516 American troops who had served in the Gulf with 746,291 troops on active duty elsewhere. It found that although Gulf-war veterans were significantly more likely to have died between the end of the war and September 30th 1993 (the date the study ended), the extra deaths were caused by accidents, not disease. In addition, members of both groups of servicemen were less likely to have died than the average American--reflecting the fact that in order to be in the armed forces at all, physical fitness must be high. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, although it is clear that some people are sick with diseases that cannot easily be explained, except by service in the Gulf, it is not certain how many of them there are. Among American troops, estimates have ranged from 1,000 to 80,000.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best guesses come from the numbers of people who have presented themselves for physical examinations, either on their own initiative, or at the behest of veterans' groups. In America, according to the advisory committee, roughly 62,000 individuals have had physical examinations in the Veterans' Administration Persian Gulf Health Registry, and more than 34,000 people have requested examination by the defence department's Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Programme. However, of these, roughly 10% have no detectable health problems, and the complaints of many others are just run-of-the-mill. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, where alleged cases of Gulf-war illness have generally been reported more slowly, roughly 1,100 (out of around 51,000) troops have come forward with complaints. According to a spokesman at Britain's Ministry of Defence, of the roughly 900 who have been examined so far, 20% have health problems that are hard to explain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But meanwhile, in France, which also sent troops to the Gulf, no one has complained of Gulf-war illnesses, despite extensive publicity about the syndrome as described in Britain and America, and despite apparent efforts by the French armed forces to conduct random studies and health tests of their troops. This is curious--and is so far unexplained.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To account for it, three hypotheses can be imagined. First, members of the French forces might be less likely to complain of feeling sick--perhaps because of cultural differences within the army. Second, British and American troops might be more likely to over-report illnesses--perhaps because of differences in benefits that could be claimed in compensation. Third--and most tantalising--there may have been real differences between what happened to different groups of soldiers in the Gulf.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The French contingent was smaller than the British one--in all, 13,500 French troops served in the Gulf. Moreover, as the French were not part of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s joint military command at the time, they could not be integrated into British or American units. This meant that the French were not in the same places as the other allied forces. However, French units did serve in the front line--and according to French military sources, were sometimes far in advance of other troops at the front. Also, French liaison officers worked alongside Anglo-American liaison officers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there are some potentially interesting differences. According to Fran&ccedil;oise Rota, who served in the Gulf as a medical officer and is now a senior doctor in the French army, her fellow citizens did two things differently.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Firstly, they did not use many of the vaccines that the British and the Americans used. In particular, they did not vaccinate against anthrax, a common component of biological weapons, and a disease endemic to the Gulf anyway. Nor did they take preventative measures against botulinum toxin--another component of biological weapons, and one of the most poisonous substances known. Indeed, according to Colonel Rota, they did not even administer <font size=-1>PB</font> to their troops.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Secondly, the French camps were not sprayed with insecticides as a preventative measure--rather, spraying was done only when it was needed to control pest populations. And, according to some reports, when they did spray, the French did not use organophosphates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also, in addition to these differences, the French troops were nowhere near the munitions depot at Khamisiyah when the destruction took place.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, no studies have compared the experiences of different groups of servicemen who were in the Gulf. Doing so will be difficult. In order to tell whether people with headaches, say, had one set of vaccinations while people with joint pain had another, it is necessary to have extensive information on who took what and was exposed to what when. This information does not exist. Both the Americans and the British have lost vaccination records. In any case, though records were kept as to which units were where in the Gulf, more often than not individuals did not stay with their units, rendering accurate assessment of risks impossible.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is unfortunate, and unsatisfactory (especially to those who are seriously sick). But perhaps it is not unexpected. The primary job of an army is to fight battles, not to collect medical data. But after every major war this century, ex-soldiers have complained of mysterious diseases. And as the nature of war changes, so that death and disease at the time become less likely, it is right that greater attention should be paid to the future health of troops.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Devising ways to collect data reliably without interfering with military operations, and pursuing research into the effects of the toxic and debilitating compounds used in modern war, and into the effects of prolonged stress on the body, should have a higher priority. That way, problems after the next conflict may be resolved more quickly. For despite the latest report, the arguments over Gulf-war illnesses will not go away for many years to come.<br>

For 50 years mankind has lived uncomfortably with the knowledge that Armageddon is no longer just a piece of biblical symbolism: the end of the world has been an achievable, man-made possibility. Moral outrage at this prospect lay at the heart of the old abolitionist cause, even if others exploited it for less noble ends. But the idea of the West giving up its nuclear arms never found majority support in the democracies as long as communists elsewhere were determined to hang on to theirs. Now the cold war is over, Soviet communism presents no threat, and the disarmers have been joined by some prominent ex-generals, statesmen and thinkers. No misty-eyed idealists or stooges they. They make serious arguments that deserve serious thought.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the new abolitionists see it, the risk that a nuclear weapon might go bang unexpectedly or fall into the wrong hands now outweighs whatever deterrent value these weapons may still possess. Moreover, as long as some countries have nuclear arms, others will want to acquire them. The solution is for the haves to join the have-nots: dump the bomb.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, the world has changed faster than government thinking about nuclear weapons. Attention is at last turning to getting rid of old weapons, rather than building new ones (see <a href="sf0805.html">page</a>), but the big powers still have enough bombs and missiles to make the post-Armageddon rubble bounce. America, Russia, Britain, France and China are frank about their nuclear arsenals. Israel, India and Pakistan are more coy. Plenty of other countries could go nuclear if they wanted to, and some would if they could.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of the ideas recently put forward by the Canberra Commission (an international body set up by the Australian government), and by a group of about 40 mostly American and Russian ex-military men, make sense: take all nuclear weapons off alert; store their warheads separately; make much deeper cuts than planned in nuclear arsenals; and include those of Britain, France and China in arms-cutting treaties. Along with an ever tighter clamp on nuclear skills and materials, such measures would reduce the dangers of accident, miscalculation and proliferation.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that would still be only a partial means to a different end: a less nuclear world, not a non-nuclear one. Though they recognise it would not be easy, both the Canberra group and the old soldiers want nuclear weapons abolished completely. But could it be done? And would a nuclear-free world be a safer place? If the answer to both questions is a pretty confident yes, then, with courage and foresight on the part of the nuclear powers, a non-nuclear era could indeed be in prospect. Unfortunately, the answer to neither question is as straightforward as the disarmers would like.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nuclear technology is old technology; it cannot be unlearned. The blueprint for a bomb could probably be discovered in any decent university library, or retrieved from the Internet. The engineering techniques can be tricky, though many countries could master them. The hardest part is producing enough of the right sort of uranium or plutonium to make the thing go bang. That is what prevented Saddam Hussein from adding nuclear weapons to his arsenal of nasties before he attacked Kuwait in 1990. North Korea's dabbling with plutonium alerted the world to its nuclear moonlighting. And Iran's attempts to get hold of uranium from Russia and others confirmed its nuclear ambitions.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if the world cannot unlearn the alchemy of the bomb, might it be persuaded to do without it? Such is the reasoning behind the Canberra Commission's case: that big-power disarmament could set off a beneficial chain reaction.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nuclear fission can be reversed by political will. Some countries that secretly had the bomb or were making one-- South Africa, Argentina, Brazil and others--have renounced nuclear weapons. Others that could have gone nuclear chose, or were persuaded, to forgo the pleasure (though usually in return for nuclear protection from America or Russia). The Canberra Commission argues that, in today's rather different world, if the big powers agreed to give up their nuclear status symbols, even Israel and others might agree to follow.<br><b><br></p><p><b>Man remains vile</b></b><br>Maybe. But probably not. Few countries have sought the bomb just because America and Russia had it. India, more status-conscious than most, exploded a nuclear device in 1974 mostly out of fear of a large, hostile, albeit by now also nuclear-armed, China right next door. Threatened already by India's superior strength in conventional weapons, Pakistan built the bomb because India did. Israel, its neighbours vowing to drive it into the sea, saw nuclear weapons as the great equaliser, should Doomsday dawn. To the governments concerned, nuclear bombs were simply the most ferocious weapon their technology could build. They still are.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, big-power disarmament would scarcely make the world a safer place. As North Korea and Iraq have shown, catching nuclear cheats is an uncertain business. Lining up enough international support to punish them is harder still, even when the would-be chastiser--usually America, for want of much help from China or Russia--is dealing from overwhelming nuclear strength. Had the big powers renounced nuclear weapons, would a Saddam with a bomb or two have been prepared to listen? America has plenty of other weapons with which to bomb Baghdad. But there is every reason to believe that it was America's nuclear arms that stopped Saddam using his chemical and biological ones (renounced, as it happens, by almost everyone else) in the Gulf war. America's nuclear support for South Korea would surely be an element in the calculations of North Korea should it ever in desperation turn on South Korea.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an imperfect world, nuclear weapons do still deter. Even without any more Saddams (a futile wish), there is still enough rivalry among the bigger powers--think of China's muscle-flexing in East Asia, or Russia's pushiness with its neighbours--to want some sort of mind-concentrating force, even if only a small one that is kept well in the background.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, however, the new abolitionists do raise an issue that should not be overlooked. Someday, possibly quite soon, the world will wake up to face a rogue regime or a bunch of terrorists with a nuclear bomb and the will to use it. Urgently needed are missile defences (ones that avoid setting off still greater nuclear rivalries--see <a href="sf0796.html">page</a>) to protect troops sent in to do the necessary dirty work. But needed most of all are the tightest possible controls over nuclear materials, earlier warning of cheating and then the will to do something about it. In a nuclear-knowing world, eternal vigilance, not a disarming gesture, is the best hope for keeping the peace.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0805.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>America feels good</h2>
<h5><a href="bw1.gif">(See chart)</a></h5>
<b>American consumer confidence</b> jumped in December, and for the year, paving the way for "a healthy economy during the first half of 1997", according to the Conference Board. That boost follows a spurt of 14.2% in sales of new homes in November, the fastest growth for four years. Consumers spent more, too, but not enough to raise worries about inflation.<p>
The <b>Dow Jones </b>industrial average fell back at the end of the year, leaving it 26% higher at the end of 1996 than at the start. But some European bourses made bigger gains: Frankfurt rose by 28%, Paris by 27% and London by 12%. For dollar investors, Hungary was the most profitable emerging market, rising by more than 130%.<p>
<h2>Sparking</h2>
The latest merger linked to the deregulation of America's electricity industry may end the woes of <b>Long Island Lighting Company. Brooklyn Union Gas</b> agreed to a $3 billion share swap with the larger utility. Lilco charges the country's highest electricity rates, largely because of a disastrous $5.3 billion investment in a nuclear-power plant that was never used. The combined firm will have revenues of $4.5 billion and 2.2m customers.<p>
The top managers at <b>CITIC Pacific</b>, China's investment conglomerate in Hong Kong, bought a 15.5% stake in their company from its state-owned parent for HK$10.9 billion ($1.4 billion), a handsome 24% discount. The chief beneficiary was Larry Yung, <font size=-1>CITIC</font> Pacific's chairman and the son of Rong Yiren, China's vice-president.<p>
<b>Apple Computer</b> won back its founder of 20 years ago, Steve Jobs, after announcing it was buying <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> Software for $400m. Mr Jobs, who owns half of <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>, says he will devote a smidgen of his time to his one-time baby. Apple's shares, though, continued to sag alarmingly as investors waited for word of what the computer firm proposed to do with <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>.<p>
Both in value and in number, management <b>buy-outs and buy-ins </b>in Britain reached record levels in 1996, according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. There were 619 deals, up a modest 7% from 1995, but the value of them, &#163;7.5 billion ($11.7 billion), was up a robust 39%, swollen by three big British Rail privatisations.<b>Mergers and acquisitions</b> in America rose to a record $658.8 billion in transactions announced in 1996, said Securities Data Co, up from $519 billion in 1995, itself a record. The most feverish activity was in telecoms, followed by utilities.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<b>Marvel Entertainment Group</b>, a comic-book publisher, filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors. This is part of an elaborate battle for control of the company between two financiers: Ronald Perelman, who owns 80% of Marvel, and Carl Icahn, who heads a group of investors that owns some $900m of junk bonds issued by Mr Perelman that are secured against his Marvel shares. <p>
<b>Telmex</b> lost its half-century monopoly in Mexico as the government threw open the country's $7 billion telecoms market to competition. More than half a dozen competitors, including <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> and their local partners, are now poised to improve services, cut bills and increase long-distance traffic. <p>
Helped by "Twister", <b>Hollywood</b> had a record year. Box Office receipts in America increased by 8% to $5.86 billion as more people went to the cinema, reversing a recent decline. The biggest hit was Twentieth Century Fox's "Independence Day". It brought in gross box-office receipts of $733m at home and abroad, making it the third-biggest film ever (behind "Jurassic Park" and "The Lion King").<p>
<b>Circus Circus</b> is to build a 4,000-room resort casino in Las Vegas, its most ambitious, and most upmarket, endeavour so far. "Project Paradise" will have a tropical theme and will cost up to $1 billion to build.<p>
Shares in a big Dutch insurance group, <b>Aegon</b>, soared-- defying a fall in the rest of the Amsterdam market--after it announced plans to buy the insurance operations of America's <b>Providian</b> for $3.5 billion. The deal will allow Providian to concentrate on banking; Aegon will become a leading life assurer worldwide.<p>
<h2>(Not) in the air</h2>
 <p>
<b>Fokker</b>, a bankrupt Dutch aircraft maker, may have lost its last hope of rescue. The South Korean government confirmed that a consortium led by Samsung Aerospace would not be making a takeover bid.<p>
Some 1.35 billion people flew on domestic and international scheduled <b>flights </b>in 1996, a 4% rise on the previous year. The gain in 1995 had been 5%. The number of people flying internationally was particularly buoyant in 1996; up 8% for the second year running, to 404m. With 645 orders, Boeing had its best year since 1989. Airbus had 309 firm orders, its highest since 1990.<p>
China revealed proudly that some of its <b>prison labourers</b> are paid $31 a month--$6 more than the country's minimum wage. Separately, <b>Michael Ovitz</b> finally agreed his severance package from Disney: for 14 months work the former talent agent will receive $76m.<p>

The first of two special articles looks at the continuing burden of nuclear weapons--both of keeping and destroying them. The second turns to the growing threat of missile proliferation</b></p><br>WHAT price peace? That is not a trick question. The cold war is over and nuclear arsenals are shrinking. The biggest nuclear powers, with the partial exception of China, co-operate where once they competed; they have struck agreements to cut the numbers of nuclear weapons, to stop pointing those that remain at each other and, by ending nuclear testing, to stop the race to design ever fancier warheads. Yet winding the nuclear-arms race safely down will be enormously costly, just as the race itself was. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As stockpiles of nuclear weapons shrink, surplus warheads and bombs must be dismantled. That is expensive enough. In addition, there are the costs of cleaning up the environmental mess weapons leave behind. According to America's Department of Energy, the United States will have to spend over (possibly well over) $230 billion during the coming decade or two to clean up contaminated sites, from old test ranges and storage sites to disused weapons-assembly plants.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are no comparable figures for the former Soviet Union. No one knows--or is ever likely to know-- just how much was spent building its nuclear arsenal. In the end, the general burden of military spending on the civilian economy proved crippling--and in many ways remains so for today's Russia. What is certain is that the nuclear-weapons industry did its bit to make the territory of the former Soviet Union among the most polluted on earth. The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl power station in Ukraine in 1986 focused international attention on the poor safety standards of the Soviet civilian nuclear industry. Standards at military plants were no better. Vast tracts of land and water around weapons plants, research establishments and test sites are badly contaminated with radioactive residue. Russians and their neighbours will be paying this clean-up bill, in cash and in damage to health, for generations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is necessary to keep such costs in perspective. The burden of building and maintaining nuclear weapons during the cold war was itself heavy, though finding reliable figures is hard since nuclear-weapons costs, from development and production to deployment and control, were scattered across the defence budget and beyond. A preliminary, unofficial guess by the United States Nuclear Weapons Costs Study Project, based at the Brookings Institution in Washington <font size=-1>DC</font>, is that, over the more than five decades from its inception in 1940 to 1995, the United States nuclear-weapons programme cost American tax-payers a minimum of $4 trillion (calculated in 1996 dollars). The study's final estimate, due out later in 1997, is likely to be "significantly higher", according to Stephen Schwartz, its editor. And the cold war was relatively cheap compared with the cost of real world war: one estimate made back in 1948 of the military, economic and commercial costs of this century's two world wars translates into about $22 trillion in today's money.<br></p><p><b><b>A long, expensive half life</b></b><br>All the same, by ordinary standards, the cost of disarmament is high. According to another recent study, over the years the United States built some 70,000 nuclear warheads and bombs, more than 6,000 strategic missiles and getting on for 5,000 strategic bombers. Its stockpile of usable weapons rose to about 30,000 at its peak in the early 1960s, dropping to some 20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). The Russians have not disclosed exactly how many nuclear weapons they built in total, but their usable stockpile is thought to have peaked at around 45,000 weapons by the mid-1980s, dropping to about 33,000 in the early 1990s.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the <font size=-1>START-1</font> agreement the United States and Russia are obliged to reduce their arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons to some 6,500 apiece by 2001 (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>); under <font size=-1>START-2</font>, which has yet to be ratified by the Russian parliament, these totals would drop to around 3,500 apiece by 2003. Although both treaties require the destruction of missiles and bombers only, not their warheads, and although both sides are likely to keep plenty of extra warheads in reserve, both America and Russia are busy dismantling thousands of surplus warheads.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia, with the larger stockpile, says it has the capacity to take apart up to 3,000 warheads a year, though it refuses to give an exact tally of the number disposed of so far. America has the capacity to pick apart up to 2,000. A typical American-built warhead has up to 6,000 parts, each of which needs to be properly catalogued and safely disposed of. America's current operational stockpile is now less than 9,000 warheads, its lowest since the 1950s. According to the Department of Energy, America has dismantled close to 4,000 warheads over the past three years and plans to dispose of another 1,700 or so by the end of the decade. However, the rate will then drop off sharply, unless Russia ratifies <font size=-1>START-2</font>.<br></p><p><b><b>Bombs away</b></b><br>But taking apart old nuclear weapons and cleaning up the places where they were made is not the only costly hangover from the nuclear past. To military strategists, the great attraction of nuclear weapons was that they were megatonnes more than the sum of their parts. Finding safe ways to store and then dispose of their plutonium or uranium cores is proving the biggest headache of all.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hardest part of making a nuclear bomb is getting hold of the right sort of plutonium and highly-enriched uranium to make it explode. Thus, keeping the superpowers' surplus stocks out of the hands of nuclear wannabees, such as Iraq, Iran or North Korea, is becoming something of a costly industry in itself.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It takes about 15 kilogrammes of highly-enriched uranium, or up to about half that amount of plutonium, to make a standard-issue nuclear bomb. Until it stopped making the stuff in the late 1980s and early 1990s, America over the years had accumulated about 98 tonnes of bomb-usable plutonium and 994 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium. Russia has even larger stocks: an estimated 130-200 tonnes of plutonium and about 1,200 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium. Assuming the Russians are dismantling at full capacity, each year some 15 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium and 45 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium shift from the relatively secure custody of the Ministry of Defence to the less certain control of Minatom, the civilian ministry that controls Russia's sprawling nuclear industry. If the process is to continue safely, there is a pressing need to find new, more secure methods of storage and disposal.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As part of a wider consolidation of its nuclear industry, the United States recently announced a $2 billion plan over 20 years to dispose of 52 tonnes of surplus weapons plutonium, more than half its stockpile. It will do this partly by immobilising the stuff--mixing it with other radioactive wastes and vitrifying it in glass or ceramic blocks for permanent storage underground--and partly by burning it in commercial reactors to generate electricity. America has long campaigned against using plutonium to fuel civilian reactors, since keeping the cycle going requires separating out the plutonium from spent fuel for re-use, creating a proliferation hazard. The new plan would burn the plutonium once as mixed oxide fuel and then dispose of the radioactive wastes without reprocessing, making it difficult and dangerous for any would-be black-market proliferator to retrieve the plutonium for bomb-making.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia (like Japan, Britain and France) is inclined to see plutonium as a commodity to be exploited for commercial purposes as part of the civilian fuel cycle. However, it did agree in 1994 to end its production of new plutonium by 2000 (like America, it has already halted production of weapons-usable uranium; both countries support the negotiation of a global agreement to end production of such fissile material). The deal still hinges, however, on finding other sources of heat and energy for the regions that depend on the three plutonium-producing reactors concerned. But the recently announced American plan for plutonium disposal should make it easier to co-operate with Russia in getting rid of surplus weapons stocks.<br></p><p><b><b>Getting a grip</b></b><br>Indeed, America's help--commercial, financial and technical--is crucial to Russia's efforts to prevent skills, technology and materials from its nuclear (and chemical and biological) weapons programmes being spirited away by middlemen for the various unrepentant members of Bomb-Builders Anonymous.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1992, the American government organised an imaginative $12 billion commercial deal under which Russia will release some 500 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium from its weapons stockpile over 20 years for blending down to lower levels of enrichment suitable for making into fuel rods of the sort commercial reactors can use. In 1994, America's Departments of Defence and Energy (the military and civilian controllers respectively of America's nuclear-weapons programme) secretly joined forces with the government of Kazakhstan in an operation, codenamed Project Sapphire, to transport to America some 600 kilogrammes of highly-enriched uranium, found lying around, virtually unsecured, at a nuclear-fuel fabrication factory in eastern Kazakhstan. According to American officials, the Iranian government had been showing an unhealthy interest in the stuff.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past five years the American Congress has authorised some $1.6 billion to be spent helping secure Russia's "loose nukes", with more to come. This Co-operative Threat Reduction programme (known as the Nunn-Lugar programme, after its two sponsors) has been plagued by bureaucratic delays on the American side and Minatom's suspicion on the Russian side. Yet it has helped speed the transportation of thousands of nuclear weapons from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine back to Russia; consolidate the number of sites within Russia where weapons are stored; improve basic security, from locks to computer-based radiation-detection systems, at some of the storage sites; and, among other projects, is helping to build a new plutonium storage facility at Chelyabinsk, in the Urals. Meanwhile, collaboration between American and Russian scientists is helping to stem Russia's skills drain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nunn-Lugar money is only a bucketful in the ocean of Russia's nuclear problems. So far, it is true, there have been few serious cases of nuclear smuggling from Russia, and then only in quantities too small for bomb-building. Yet the danger will persist, indeed will grow, if morale in the armed forces continues to plummet. A special summit of the <font size=-1>G7</font> industrial countries and Russia held in Moscow in 1996 came up with a list of resolutions to co-operate more effectively to prevent proliferation. This activity is also a priority for the big powers' intelligence services, and is claiming a growing share of their budgets. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Add all this up, the money and the effort, and cleaning up after the nuclear era will be a long and costly business. Paradoxically, to the costs of disarmament may soon have to be added a little rearmament. If Russia goes on refusing to ratify <font size=-1>START-2</font>, America and Russia both may end up maintaining in working order thousands more nuclear warheads than they know they need. The nuclear era may have a longer half-life than anyone expected.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0796.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

The West also faces a threat from the proliferation of cruise and ballistic missiles. How should it respond?</b></p><br>IN 1944 and 1945 the Nazis used both cruise and ballistic missiles. German <font size=-1>V1</font>s flew low towards London, rather like aeroplanes. These, the first cruise missiles, killed over 5,000 civilians even though fighter aircraft shot down some. Then came the <font size=-1>V2</font>s, rockets which flew high out of the atmosphere and dropped onto their targets with such speed that no defence was possible. These "ballistic" missiles--called that after their curved trajectories--killed 2,500 Londoners.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The technology the Germans pioneered in the early 1940s is no longer difficult to acquire. The Falklands war revealed the military value of cruise missiles: Argentina sank two British ships with (French-made) air-launched Exocets. The Iran-Iraq war showed the power of ballistic missiles to intimidate and terrify civilians. During one six-month phase of that war, in 1987-88, Iraq rained down missiles on Tehran, killing 2,000 Iranians and driving half of the population from the city. During the 1991 Gulf war, Saddam Hussein's strongest card was his stock of Al Hussein ballistic missiles. His attacks on Israeli towns nearly provoked the Israeli retaliation which could have ruptured the allied coalition. Those attacks killed just two people, but a missile which hit an American base in Saudi Arabia killed 28. These weapons can also be used to try to frighten governments: last March China fired four <font size=-1>DF-15</font> ballistic missiles into the sea near Taiwan.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is perhaps hardly surprising that growing numbers of third-world governments are finding the case for developing or buying missiles irresistible. If your neighbour's military prowess is a worry, or if you wish to stop the West from pushing you around, missiles appear to offer a solution. They are easier to make and cheaper to acquire than squadrons of fighter aircraft. According to the defence studies centre at Britain's Lancaster University, 35 non-<font size=-1>NATO</font> countries have ballistic missiles, including Algeria, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. And it reckons that 18 non-<font size=-1>NATO</font> countries are capable of installing either nuclear, biological or chemical warheads.<br></p><p><b><b>The infamous five</b></b><br>The greatest potential menace are the five "rogue" regimes, some of which have helped each other's missile programmes: Iran, Iraq (see <a href="sf5.gif">chart</a>), Libya (see <a href="sf3.gif">chart</a>), Syria and North Korea (see <a href="sf4.gif">chart</a>). The last is the most dangerous of all, for it has tested a ballistic missile with a 700-mile (1,120-kilometre) range, called the Nodong, and is probably developing a two-stage missile (the Taepo Dong 2) with a range of 2,500-4,000 miles. Iran has helped to finance North Korea's missile programme and is reported to be, like Libya, keen to buy the results. Fired from North Korea, Nodongs could reach Japan; from Iran, Israel would be in range; and from Libya, parts of Southern Europe would be threatened. From Pyongyang, the Taepo Dong 2 might reach parts of Hawaii or Alaska; from Libya, it could reach London.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cruise missiles may pose as great a threat. Compared with ballistic missiles, they are often more accurate (some can use satellites to navigate), sometimes harder to shoot down (they can be stealthy and swerve) and about a quarter of the price. The Lancaster team estimates that 67 non-<font size=-1>NATO</font> countries possess cruise missiles (even though most of them are short-range anti-ship weapons). India is producing the Lakshya, a missile with a range of 350 miles, while China, Iran and North Korea have cruise missiles of similar ranges.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slowly, politicians in the West are waking up to the dangers. Even if the missiles cannot hit western countries directly, they can have an impact on western foreign policies. Imagine the West were to send another expeditionary force to the Middle East. It could be attacked by more sophisticated missiles than Iraqi Al Husseins.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Should governments seek to defend not only troops on such missions, but also cities at home? Should they be prepared to counter Russian and Chinese missiles, as well as those of rogue dictators? Can they make missile defences compatible with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (<font size=-1>ABM</font>) treaty, by which the Soviet Union and the United States agreed to limit their defences against inter-continental ballistic missiles (<font size=-1>ICBM</font>s)? And which of the anti-missile technologies actually work?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America and parts of East Asia these questions are matters of serious debate. In Europe, few people are concerned. Yet it is Europe, not America, which faces the more immediate threat from missiles.<br></p><p><b><b>Four defences</b></b><br>Western governments can respond to the danger of hostile missiles in four ways. They can, through diplomacy, seek to reinforce the <b>Missile Technology Control Regime </b>(<font size=-1>MTCR</font>), an agreement among 28 states to curb exports of key components. Russia has joined; China has not, but says it will observe the regime's rules; none of the rogue states is a member. The regime has no enforcement mechanisms, and does not apply to civilian rocket technology, which is little different from the military sort. So the regime--like some bilateral agreements--has slowed but not prevented the diffusion of missile know-how.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can hope to <b>deter missile attacks.</b> Any state which launched a missile at a western country could expect to be bombed. But deterrence works only if the regimes concerned can make rational calculations of their own self-interest; some dictators find that hard.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can <b>attack missile launch sites.</b> But the Gulf war illustrated the difficulties: although a significant part of America's air power was deployed in search of Iraq's well-hidden mobile launchers, none was destroyed from the air.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The imperfections of these three responses have led America and Israel to pursue a fourth: <b>missile defence systems.</b> The interceptors and radars required are neither cheap nor easy to develop. The Americans have spent nearly $50 billion on missile defence since President Reagan launched "star wars"--officially, the Strategic Defence Initiative--in 1983, but have still not got the cleverer ideas, such as space-based lasers, to work.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ballistic missiles can be shot down at three points on their flight: during the early "boost phase"; in mid-course, when most of them are outside the atmosphere; and in the terminal phase, shortly before they strike. Ideally, a defender should hit a missile during the boost phase, before it can divide into multiple warheads (if it has them) and so that the debris falls on the enemy. But that kind of interception is hard to achieve, for the boost phase even of a long-range missile will last less than three minutes; by the time satellites have spotted the launch and informed the defender, that phase may be over.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The next best time to hit the missile is in mid-course: if an interceptor misses there is time for another shot. The terminal phase is the worst time, for any debris will fall on the defender's country. But terminal interceptions are the easiest to achieve with current technology. During the Gulf war Patriot, a short-range system designed to protect particular sites, engaged Iraqi missiles with some success. Such short-range systems can also hit cruise missiles.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the time being, America can deploy only short-range systems. But the possible shape of new anti-missile defences can be discerned there, in the work of the Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation (<font size=-1>BMDO</font>). Its chief priority is to defend American forces overseas. This is because America's intelligence agencies have concluded that no rogue regime will be able to develop ballistic missiles that can threaten the continental United States for at least 15 years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>BMDO</font> is working on three short-range systems: an upgraded version of Hawk, an interceptor used by the Marines; an improved Patriot, with a new missile, for the army; and a sea-borne Navy Area Defence System. It is also developing two defences designed to protect larger areas through mid-course interception. They are called Navy Theatre Wide and, for the army, Theatre High-Altitude Area Defence (acronym: <font size=-1>THAAD</font>). Both these have undergone trials, but neither of their interceptors has yet succeeded in hitting a missile.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for that ideal of blowing up a missile in its "boost phase", a ship armed with Navy Theatre Wide that was close to the missile launch site might achieve it. The Pentagon has just awarded a contract for a prototype jumbo jet-borne laser that will-- it hopes--destroy missiles in the boost phase. But the technical obstacles remain formidable. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second and lower priority for the Clinton administration is a limited system of national missile defence, consisting of 100 interceptors linked to ground-based early-warning radars. This could protect against <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s from rogue states, though not much else. The administration says that it will spend the next three years developing this system and will then decide whether to spend a further three years deploying it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The administration's final priority is to continue research on more advanced technologies, such as space-based lasers and sensors, descendants of star wars. It is surely developing more varieties of missile defence than will actually be needed. But the American defence budget--now $265 billion a year--has room for them all. In any case, each service demands its own sorts of missile defence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton administration insists that it wishes to abide by the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty, which permits theatre defences as well as a maximum of 100 interceptors aimed at <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s. However, some of the programmes under development would, if deployed, breach the treaty. For instance it permits only ground-based defences and outlaws those based on "other physical principles". That means that lasers--whether airborne or space-based--and satellite radars, if integrated with batteries of interceptors, would contravene the treaty.<br><b>Clinton in the middle</b><br>President Clinton's policy on missile defence faces two groups of domestic critics: those who think the government should do less, many of whom are on the left, and those who think it should do more, many of whom are on the right. The first group sees little point in spending money on missile defence: a dictator who wished to terrorise a western city, they say, would find it simpler to pack a lorry with explosives than to develop long-range missiles.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These sceptics also doubt the efficacy of missile defence systems. Ted Postol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims that none of the Patriots fired during the Gulf war destroyed an Al Hussein (though classified army studies suggest a 60% success rate). Mr Postol believes that <font size=-1>THAAD</font><t--mode> </t--mode> interceptors (the army's theatre-wide anti-missile system) could easily be defeated anyway. A missile might split into several warheads and decoys to confuse the interceptors. <font size=-1>THAAD</font>'s defenders reply that such counter-measures would be neither cheap nor easy for a rogue regime to master: Britain spent 13 years and several billion pounds building Chevaline, a nuclear missile with multiple warheads and decoys.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lastly, the critics claim that America's theatre defence programmes are undermining the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty. Mr Postol argues that, if space-based radars were integrated with <font size=-1>THAAD</font>, America would have a shield capable of defending against strategic missiles, which the treaty forbids. He points out that General Malcolm O'Neill, the former director of <font size=-1>BMDO</font>, told Congress that one <font size=-1>THAAD</font> system could protect the British Isles, and that <font size=-1>THAAD</font> interceptors could in certain circumstances thwart <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s. Mr Postol reckons that a dozen such systems could cover the continental United States. That would seem to contradict the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Pentagon retorts that <font size=-1>THAAD</font> could not be an effective strategic system because it has not been tested against missiles travelling faster than 5 kilometres a second; <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s travel at 7 kilometres a second (the longer the range, the faster the missile). It also points out that the Russians accepted, during recent negotiations on clarifying the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty, that interceptors which fly at less than 3 kilometres a second (<font size=-1>THAAD</font> ones go at just below that speed) are in accordance with the treaty.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But last October Russia pulled back from signing this clarification, saying it would not accept interceptors that fly more slowly than 3 kilometres a second until both parties had agreed whether faster systems such as the navy theatre-missile shield--with interceptors that go 4.5 kilometres a second--complied with the treaty. The Russians show no signs of accepting those faster interceptors.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans say they hope the Russians will accept that the Navy Theatre Wide system complies with the treaty; but that if they do not, it will be deployed anyway, because the administration has unilaterally determined that the treaty permits it. The Russians are livid.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's missile hawks do not care: they would like to scrap the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty altogether. They view it as a relic of the cold war, when, since both America and the Soviet Union lacked missile defences, neither would risk starting a nuclear war. They argue that it has no relevance in an unstable world of irrational dictators and rapidly proliferating missile technology. The administration's view that no third-world missile attack on the continental United States would be feasible for 15 years is, to them, misleading, for it assumes that neither Russia nor China will help a rogue regime and forgets that Hawaii or Alaska could be hit much sooner. They think the president is surrounded by peaceniks who are ideologically opposed to missile defence and will never allow him to deploy any form of national defensive system.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Heritage Foundation, a hawkish think-tank, proposes, for a start, upgrading the navy's theatre-missile defence system, which is based around the powerful "Aegis" radars carried on many warships. Then it would integrate space-based sensors with that system before switching, in the long run, to space-based lasers or interceptors. This would give America a lightweight shield, effective against missiles from rogue states, China or a mad Russian submariner, but not against the full force of the Russian arsenal. The Heritage Foundation claims that all this could be deployed for an additional $2 billion a year, beyond <font size=-1>BMDO</font>'s current budget of around $3.5 billion.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bob Dole, the Republican presidential candidate, supported the idea of deploying a national missile defence system but did not specify the sort he wanted. He never made it an election issue, perhaps because most Americans seem unenthusiastic about space-based missile defence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chiefs of staff, who have other spending priorities, see merit in the argument of Bill Perry, the outgoing defence secretary, that there is no point in deploying a system before a threat emerges, for its technology would soon be out of date; and that it would be better to work on improving the technology until deployment is necessary. They recognise that, if America scrapped the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty, Russia would neither ratify the <font size=-1>START</font>-<font size=-1>2</font> treaty (limiting nuclear weapons) nor engage in further efforts at arms control.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In May 1996 the Congressional Budget Office reported that Mr Dole's "Defend America Bill"--which implied a need for space-based systems similar to those proposed by the Heritage Foundation--would cost an extra $30 billion-60 billion by 2010. That excludes operating costs (likely to be $2 billion-4 billion a year) and assumes no cost overruns. This report helped turn Congress away from star wars-style programmes and scotched the Dole bill. All the same, Congress has forced the administration to spend more on theatre missile defence in 1996-97.<br><b>Planetary problem</b><br>Israel is surrounded by potentially hostile states, brimming with missiles. So it is not surprising that it will be the first country to deploy a national missile defence system. For a country of Israel's size, theatre defence is national defence. With the help of American money, it has developed Arrow, a system designed to hit missiles in mid-course. And if Arrow fails to hit a missile, Patriot will take a shot.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Patriot system has been sold to Germany, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Japan and, in modified form, to Taiwan. The Japanese, who lie within range of Chinese and North Korean missiles, are upgrading their Patriot interceptors and talking to the Americans about buying a theatre system. That has angered China, which fears that its own fairly limited strategic arsenal could be disabled by such a system or by America's plans for a national missile defence. But the more bellicose the behaviour of China and North Korea, the more likely are Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to invest in national defence systems.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few European governments take the threat of missiles seriously. Three that did were France, Germany and Italy. A few years ago, they began work, together with America, on a "Medium Extended Air Defence System", a more mobile and powerful short-range system than Patriot. But the French pulled out in 1996 and, although the Americans are putting pressure on the British to join, the system is far from certain to be built.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since troops on expeditionary forces generally serve in multinational coalitions, it would make sense for <font size=-1>NATO</font> governments to develop a common protective system. And there would be little point in their seeking to protect their cities (if they reach that point) without collaborating. <font size=-1>NATO</font> has decided that it must protect expeditionary forces. But any decision to deploy a missile defence system will require consensus, painstaking negotiations, and lots of time. Unless, course, a rogue missile strikes a <font size=-1>NATO</font> city.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="xm0008.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>An adult affair</h1>

<p><b>The main early use of many kinds of electronic communications is to let men watch and talk to naked women. It may, in the end, lead to better things</b></p><br>
A CONFERENCE at London's plush Caf&eacute; Royal, last October. On the sixth floor, in two cavernous conference halls, a small but earnest collection of geared-up people discuss telecoms switching technology, billing systems and something called "international simple resale" before a small and scattered audience. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two floors down, the trade exhibition is humming. Pony-tailed young men demonstrate ground-breaking technology for reducing credit-card fraud on the Internet. Glamorous girls in skimpy skirts talk earnestly of turnover and call-minutes in booths emblazoned with the names of countries that nobody would readily associate with the leading edge of global communications: Sierra Leone, Moldova, Guyana. And Dan Guess, the burly chief executive of Virtual Dreams, presides happily over an admiring crowd experimenting with his videoconferencing equipment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No ordinary videoconferencing. The young Dane who has taken over the keyboard at the computer is typing furiously. "Take off your . . . " He turns to a friend. "How you spell 'clothes'?" he asks. The friend obliges. On the computer screen, a lithe young woman with long brown hair begins, jerkily, to disrobe. "All the way from San Diego," says Mr Guess proudly. "And over an ordinary telephone line."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is an annual get-together of the world's audiotext industry. The transmission of information and entertainment on telephone lines and over the Internet is at the core of the communications revolution. A great deal of the material being communicated is what the trade describes as "adult entertainment": nobody, but nobody, calls it porn. (And, just for the record, all the companies named in this article insist they stay firmly within the bounds of what is legal.) Many of the main innovations in communications are tried out first--and, in a few cases, even developed--by the adult-entertainment business. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Videoconferencing on personal computers is merely the latest in a list of electronic technologies whose chief early colonisation is by the erotic. The cinema, the videocassette, France's Minitel system, the compact disc and pay-per-view television have all been used, in their early years, partly or mainly for adult entertainment. Some of them still are. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the late 1970s, when few American homes had videocassette players, more than 75% of all videocassettes sold were in this category. Since then, following a common trend, the percentage has fallen as the medium has acquired more conventional uses. Paul Fishbein, publisher of <i>Adult Video News</i>, a trade publication based in California, reckons that sales and rentals of adult video tapes through video stores were worth about $3.1 billion in 1995. Mail-order sales may have been worth another $1 billion or so. The business thus accounts for about 14% of rentals and sales by volume, he says. But, because adult tapes sell at a premium, the business probably accounts for rather under a quarter of the $16 billion revenues of the home video market. There is, Mr Fishbein complains, "a glut of products on the market. The profit margins are not what they once were."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Germany, too, adult fare accounts for the largest single chunk of the market for video rentals: 40% of a market worth about DM2.8 billion ($1.8 billion). The figures come from the trade association of erotic-video producers, which spends its time collecting royalties for its 190 or so specialist producers of adult films. <br>
</p><p><b><b>That's entertainment?</b></b><br>
Adult entertainment is now a mainstay of pay-per-view television. In American hotels $150m-175m, or at least half of the revenues for pay-per-view films, usually comes from adult entertainment. Not surprisingly, as pay-per-view television in the United States has become available on cable and satellite channels, the two main companies in the business, Playboy and Spice Entertainment (which owns the Spice Networks), have rushed to take advantage of it. Between them, their four adult channels account for perhaps $200m of the $600m American market for pay-per-view television.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both have done well from the launch of direct-to-home digital satellite television in the United States two years ago. Now, both Playboy and Spice are bringing their television and film channels to more sex-starved parts of the globe: in late 1995 Playboy was launched into Latin America, and the Spice Networks have been moving into Asia. Within five to ten years, both of them think that at least half of their television revenues will come from abroad.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, both have big plans to make money from cybersex. At Spice, Roger Faherty, the chairman, believes that "if there is money in the on-line world, it will be in sex and sport." His company has launched Cyberspice, an "on-line peepshow". Tony Lynn, president of Playboy Entertainment, sees his company's Internet site, with 5m "hits" a day, as "potentially our most important revenue earner". The company is now experimenting with charging people to peek at a page.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elsewhere, a cable channel is already using the Internet--legitimately--to avoid the irritations of regulation on television channels. In Britain, the Adam and Eve film channel has found it hard to win permission to broadcast throughout the day. Instead, the company is running its films of erotic cavorting around the clock on the Internet (at www.adamandevechannel.com, if you really must know). Ray Miller, the channel's chief executive, grumbles that it is hard to establish his tasteful offerings in the Internet's thickets of hardcore porn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Larger companies, such as Spice and Playboy, face a similar dilemma. They aim to provide, as Mr Faherty of Spice puts it, "good taste within the genre". They are keen to offer value for money, because they recognise the need for repeat customers. "You can't throw garbage out there and expect people to pay for it," says Mr Faherty. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But they know good taste is not always the first concern of those who watch adult entertainment. Spice runs Eurotica, a more explicit cable service, in some European markets, and is exploring ways to launch a version in America. And on the Internet they will come head-to-head with competitors battle-hardened in an area where the ability to make good use of the latest electronic kit is the key to success. These are the veterans of the telephone sex industry.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A vision of the future</b></b><br>
One such is Mr Guess of Virtual Dreams. "The two contents that drive technology are warfare and sex," he avers. "And sex generates the revenues." His company gets $700,000 a month in revenue from its "videoconferencing" service, which has been running for two and a half years. The service is, in fact, a one-way broadcast (the customer sees the girl, but not vice versa) with a two-way connection for typed messages or for a voice conversation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The picture comes across an ordinary telephone line. The service hopes to show 12 frames a second to a viewer with a standard computer and a basic modem. That will be jerkier than a television broadcast, which shows 30 frames a second, but is still an astonishing testament to the powers of digital compression. "Like getting an elephant down a garden hose and reconstituting it at the other end," says Mr Guess--a little unkindly, considering that winsome figure in San Diego.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the customers dialling Virtual Dreams' videoconferencing service, 75% are in the United States and the rest abroad. On January 1st the company launched an Internet-based service, which it expects will eventually be a far bigger business. It will be possible, for instance, to offer a broadcast with several hundred people watching the same live show. In time, the user will be able to control the camera from his home computer. It will also be possible to offer customers sites all over the world (eager viewers at morning sessions in the Caf&eacute; Royal had to wait for the girl in San Diego to finish her breakfast before she would perform). And customers outside the United States who use the telephone have to pay the high cost of an international telephone call. An Internet link cuts out that cost and opens the service to the world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The service, in any case, does not come cheap. Customers pay $5.99 a minute, and stay on the line, on average, for 13 minutes, running up a bill of $78. The girl at the other end receives $25 an hour. At least some of the difference goes to finance the development of a technology that will ultimately change many activities apart from voyeurism. Medicine, education and a whole host of commercial and industrial transactions will eventually apply the technology now used almost exclusively for long-distance sex. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Hold the phone</b></b><br>
"Telephone sex may be good for development." Who says? The International Telecommunication Union (<font size=-1>ITU</font>), the staid club of national telephone operators. While Virtual Dreams and its handful of competitors offer live colour video pictures of lightly dressed lasses (and lads, who are what one caller in five wants to watch), a larger and more established business sends live or recorded sex chat across an ordinary telephone line.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Customers may pay in one of two ways: through the cost of the call (in which case the bill appears on their ordinary telephone bill--or their employer's) or by credit card. To escape regulatory constraints, companies using the first method frequently run their services from faraway places with strange-sounding names, many of them penurious developing countries. Others use domestic premium-rate lines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The industry reckons that 1.5% of all international traffic is telephone sex, with a global turnover of around $2 billion a year. The key to the business, explains the <font size=-1>ITU</font> (whose interest in it is purely academic), is a settlement system which ensures that the country in which an international call originates and the one in which it terminates share the revenue from the call.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This settlement system means that the public telephone operator (<font size=-1>PTO</font>) of a small developing country can benefit hugely if it can generate a large amount of incoming traffic. The <font size=-1>PTO</font> splits its share of settlement payments with the service provider, who drums up business and provides the girls. Often, the calls are routed back over a leased line (on which there are no settlement payments) to the country where the call began. The amorous fellow thus pays for an international call to talk to a woman who may be just a few miles away.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prize example is Guyana, a dirt-poor country in Latin America (<font size=-1>GDP</font> per head around $2,000 a year). Since the country's <font size=-1>PTO</font> was taken over in 1991 by <font size=-1>ATN</font>, an American company, it has increased its volume of incoming calls from 23.8m minutes to 139.7m in 1995, a compound annual growth rate of 56%. As a result, its yearly revenue from telecommunications services is now around $130m, or the equivalent of 40% of the country's 1993 <font size=-1>GDP</font>, or--to put it another way--$700 per household. Not all the revenue stays in the country, but with the money that does the <font size=-1>PTO</font> has been building one of the region's finest telephone networks. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ITU</font> points to a couple of even more extraordinary instances. Niue, a New Zealand protectorate in the South Pacific, handles many calls from Japan, one of the fastest growing markets for telephone sex. The island has more lines than inhabitants. Some of the lines are connected to answering machines rather than human operators. Others are routed back to a call centre in Toronto which is manned by operators who can speak English, French, Spanish, Greek, Italian and Swedish. Like many other countries in the business, one of Niue's selling points is that the tiny size of its population guarantees short telephone numbers. Dial the international access code of 683, and another four numbers will connect you to your heart's desire. It would be easy for the naive or ignorant to imagine they were making a local call.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dutch Antilles, in 1994, was receiving the equivalent of 2,600 incoming minutes of calls for every telephone subscriber in the country and generating at least $1,000 a head from settlement payments. Since Germany alone accounted for 47% of its incoming minutes in 1994, the tiny country will have been badly hit by Deutsche Telekom's decision in 1995 to clamp down on international sex calls--part of an effort to clean up before privatisation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany is a big loss: all told, it accounted for about a third of the 60m minutes a month of the world's international sex calls. After the German clampdown, the United States is now the biggest caller. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even with Germany knocked out, more poor countries are crowding into the chat trade. Should <font size=-1>PTO</font>s be in this business at all? Those in the developing countries are, says Stuart Sharrock, editor of <i>Voice+</i>, one of the main trade magazines, "quite open about it. They are often in a tough commercial situation, and this allows them to invest in equipment that allows all sorts of facilities for their domestic customers. Many of them are well-run organisations with slick operations and published accounts." And, because they split their takings with the service providers, they make less from the business than the telephone companies in the rich countries where the calls originate, which pocket the other half of the settlement payment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The international business is run by perhaps five to ten companies worldwide. More are based in the Netherlands than anywhere else, but all move easily between countries. Delegates at the Caf&eacute; Royal perked up when Sean Taylor, from Redwood Technologies, spoke of the work his company had put into developing telephone equipment that could work in any country, and be used equally for international and domestic calls. That sort of flexibility will be useful to many businesses, but is perfect for the adult market.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The puritan counter-attack</b></b><br>
For it is, not surprisingly, a trade that has to keep one step ahead of the regulators. That is even more the case for the domestic premium-rate business. Premium-rate services allow telephone companies to charge callers a higher rate than the normal telephone tariff for dialling certain services. When premium-rate services were first introduced, in the 1980s, many of them were sex-chat lines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gradually, national regulators have clamped down on many of them. Richard Cadman, author of a recent study of premium-rate services in Europe for Eurodata, a telecommunications consultancy based in London, reckons that adult services are 25% of the premium-rate market in Switzerland, 14% in Finland, but hard to measure anywhere else. A growing number of countries have banned or restricted the services or advertising for them. In Britain, where 70% to 80% of all premium-rate calls were to adult services when premium rates were launched in the late 1980s, the proportion is now down to less than 1%, according to the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services. Why? British Telecom and Vodafone required would-be customers to register for a special identification number and prove that they are over 18. That, not surprisingly, scuppered the market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995 the industry in Britain sought a way to revive it: by setting up closed user groups, telephone networks used by businesses such as travel agents or hotels to link their branches together. Connected to such a network by clever software, a customer can take part in a live conference call. Today, the conference agenda may be smut. But here, too, there is potential consolation for the moralists. In future, such a network could link a family or a group of housebound disabled people.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The problem with getting paid</b></b><br>
In the United States, premium-rate sex calls have suffered from a different handicap: the difficulty of extracting payments. Telephone companies are obliged by law to tell customers at regular intervals that as long as they pay for the transmission of a sex-chat call, they do not need to pay for the content. As a result, the industry suffers from huge bad debts--perhaps 30-40% of all the business in the United States, say some.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is one of the reasons adult services have increasingly moved to charging their customers by credit card. There are other advantages: once they have persuaded a customer to divulge a credit-card number, some services make it hard to cancel. And, in many countries, the range of premium rates that telephone companies will charge is limited and the top band is low: only 13 tariff bands are available in Britain, ranging up to $2.30 a minute, says Eurodata's Mr Cadman, compared with 28 in Finland, ranging up to $4.75. Above all, credit-card calls have been less regulated than premium-rate calls: regulators have accepted that, since only adults are eligible for credit cards, the system offers some automatic protection for children.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, as the adult business suffers so much fraud, credit-card billing is not necessarily a protection. Banks often refuse to accept such business. Two years ago Richard Gordon, a Californian businessman, developed a system for detecting and preventing fraudulent credit-card calls. When, in response to a request by a chat-line, a customer punches a credit-card number into the telephone, Mr Gordon's system checks it against an elaborate database. If the number is approved, his company processes and clears the payment. He claims to have almost eliminated bad debts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, more than half the company's new credit-card business arises not from the telephone but from the Internet. That brings problems. Credit-card fraud rates are high. Moreover, while companies taking calls from telephone customers in the United States can see the telephone number from which they are calling--and thus spot whether the call is from a number with a history of attempted frauds--an Internet connection provides no such protection. So Mr Gordon's company is developing a system of electronic "finger-printing" to recognise a particular computer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a system will, in time, be used not only for adult entertainment but for all the other services traded on the Internet. It is already being used by some companies selling software on-line. Software distributed that way, says Mr Gordon, shares a key characteristic with adult entertainment: there is no "deferred delivery". By the time the trader has found out that credit-card details are fraudulent, the customer has already received (and, in the case of porn, consumed) the product.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guesses about what proportion of Internet trade is adult entertainment are bound to be vague. Forrester Research, a Boston-based consultancy that specialises in communications issues, reckons that adult services in 1996 accounted for about $50m-worth of business, or about 10% of all retailing on the Internet to customers in the United States (although that includes materials ordered on-line and then sent by post). That put adult business behind sales of computer products and travel. But the figure may well be too low. Mr Gordon reckons the market for telephone video-conferencing has been running at $1.5m a month recently; and that market is shifting rapidly to the Internet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet has many advantages for the adult-entertainment trade. It is global; it is cheap to use over long distances; above all, it is hard to regulate. For a trader, though, it has drawbacks: customers are hard to trace, and intellectual piracy is rife. The adult-entertainment business, which has pioneered so many communications technologies, will find ways to solve these problems and will thus blaze a trail for more conventional businesses. To expect their gratitude, though, would be a mistake.<br>

That makes it difficult to treat with drugs. Now people are finding ingenious new ways to smuggle medicines into it</b></p><br>IF THE body truly were a temple, then the brain would be its holiest shrine. It is, literally, the nerve-centre of the whole operation--and like the holy of holies in many religions, few may enter. To keep the organ pure, a gatekeeper known as the blood-brain barrier screens any molecule that might try to gain access.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The blood-brain barrier is omnipresent. It consists of all the endothelial cells that line all the blood vessels that flow through the brain. These, unlike the cells lining the vessels servicing less critical organs, form tight, impenetrable junctions with their neighbours. Only a few substances necessary for the brain's proper functioning are able to get past this close-knit thicket of endothelium.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is normally a sensible arrangement. The brain is the body's most sensitive organ as well as its most vital one. The blood-brain barrier keeps out things that might upset it. It also keeps essential biochemicals, such as neurotransmitters (molecules that carry messages between nerve cells), in their proper place inside it. But its vigilance can be a drawback. For it also keeps out a few things that might help the brain--such as drugs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment, the conventional way of getting round the blood-brain barrier is by the painful procedure of intracerebroventricular instillation--that is, dropping the drugs in question into a patient's brain through holes drilled in his head. But even this delicate operation can deliver medicines only to the brain's surface. Deeper centres (where disease may lie) are inaccessible to it. What is needed, therefore, is a less invasive, less expensive way of breaking through the blood-brain barrier.<br></p><p><b><b>Rites of passage</b></b><br>William Pardridge, at the Brain Research Institute of the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks he has one. His method is to get his drugs to tag along with the chosen few natural molecules that are permitted access to the inner sanctum.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These privileged chemicals (such as the components of proteins and genes) are carried in by special receptor proteins, each tailored to a particular substance. So one way of sending drugs across the blood-brain barrier is by subverting a receptor into carrying them in, too.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Pardridge has succeeded in doing so for a range of substances, including an anti-cancer drug called daunomycin. The real job of the receptor he exploits for his trick is to transport a protein called transferrin across the barrier. (Transferrin carries atoms of iron and manganese into the brain, picking them up on one side of the barrier and releasing them on the other.) Dr Pardridge is able to make the receptor carry his drug, too, by using another protein, known as a monoclonal antibody, as a molecular roof-rack.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antibodies are normally manufactured by the immune system. They are designed to latch on to particular substancess in a highly specific way. This allows them to neutralise key molecules in disease-causing invaders without damaging similar, but not quite identical, molecules in the body they are supposed to be protecting.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This requires that hundreds of billions of slightly different antibodies exist in a single animal. But by cloning the cells that make a single variety of antibody, a pure version of that antibody (ie, a monoclonal version) can be produced. Dr Pardridge uses a monoclonal antibody that sticks specifically to rat transferrin receptor (like many drug researchers, his preferred experimental animals are rodents). When the receptor crosses the barrier, the antibody is also dragged across. And by attaching drug molecules to the antibodies before they are injected, these too are pulled inside the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, Dr Pardridge can do better than that. By stuffing his drugs into balls of fat called liposomes, and attaching each liposome itself to a number of antibodies, he can get as many as 10,000 drug molecules across the barrier in one packet. In a paper just published in <i>Proceedings of the Na tional Academy of Science</i>, he has shown that his "immunoliposomes" can successfully shuttle daunomycin into the brains of experimental rats up to 24 hours after they are injected into the rats' bloodstreams.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is the transferrin receptor the only one on which this sort of trick can be pulled. At Neuromedica, a drug-delivery firm based in Conshohockon, Pennsylvania, Victor Shashoua is studying the receptor that transports cis-docosahexaenoic acid or <font size=-1>DHA</font>--a naturally-occurring fatty acid that forms a significant proportion of the brain's grey matter--across the blood-brain barrier. Dr Shashoua is using this receptor to sneak dopamine into the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dopamine is one of the most important neurotransmitters, and a lack of it is implicated in several diseases, including tardive dyskinesia, a progressive loss of motor control which afflicts more than 300,000 people in America alone.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Attempts to boost the level of dopamine in the brain in order to treat such diseases have often been thwarted by the blood-brain barrier. But Dr Shashoua has been able to increase the brain's uptake of dopamine almost eightfold by attaching it to <font size=-1>DHA</font>, and getting the receptor to carry it across. He hopes his <font size=-1>DHA</font>-dopamine combination, known as "Doprexin", may make a drug that combats tardive dyskinesia.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If hitching a lift on a receptor fails, though, a drug designer has two other options for getting into the brain without the aid of a drill. One is to disguise the drug as something that is normally allowed in. The other is to exploit natural weaknesses in the barrier.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Disguising a molecule usually means making it look more like a fat. Fatty molecules are able to slide across the blood-brain barrier because the membranes surrounding endothelial cells are also composed of fats. It is a general property of fats that one can easily dissolve in another. So, if a drug can be modified to make it more fatty without affecting its action, it can often be absorbed into the brain without having to involve any receptors.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This trick was first performed over a century ago (though the details were not properly understood at the time). The result--a modified, fat-loving form of morphine that was once used as cough mixture--was named "Heroin" by Bayer, a German drug company which marketed it. It can cross the blood-brain barrier 100 times more easily than morphine. Now the trick is being recreated--ironically to assist the passage of enkephalin, one of the family of neurotransmitters that heroin mimics in order to produce its effects.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The work is being done by Nicholas Bodor, at the Centre for Drug Discovery at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Enkephalin would make a good drug because it is a natural pain-relieving substance. But, like morphine, it is spurned by the blood-brain barrier. So Dr Bodor is attaching lipophilic chemical groups to it in order to ease its passage into the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Bodor's chemical disguises are very cunning. Though fat-like in the blood and thus easily ushered through the endothelium, they are transformed by enzymes on the other side into water-soluble compounds known as pyridinium salts. This means that once through, the enkephalin is locked in by the barrier and should thus build up inside the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A paper recently published by Dr Bodor in the <i>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry </i> shows that enkephalin travelling through the blood in such chemical incognito does indeed concentrate in the brain, rather than the peripheral nervous system. And recent clinical trials in Britain have demonstrated that this method can work with drugs other than enkephalin. Oestrogen-- the principal female hormone--can also be effectively and selectively delivered to the brain by tinkering with it to make it more fat-soluble. This reduces the likelihood of complications from high hormone levels in other tissues.<br></p><p><b><b>A chink in the armour</b></b><br>The third way to bypass the blood-brain barrier--exploiting existing weaknesses in it--is perhaps the neatest. This is because such weaknesses are often caused by the diseases that the drugs are intended to cure.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Occasionally, particularly in cases of cancer, the barrier lets down its guard. The blood vessels supplying gliomas--malignant brain tumours which strike almost 200,000 Americans each year--are more likely to leak than those in healthy brain tissue. This is because the diseased endothelium is much more responsive to a naturally occurring chemical called bradykinin, which causes endothelial cells to pull apart.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scientists at Alkermes, a drug-delivery firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are exploiting this weakness in tumours in order to push anti-cancer agents across. Their weapon is <font size=-1>RMP-7</font>, a bradykinin look-alike, which has been biochemically tailored to increase its stability and potency. A swift intravenous dose of <font size=-1>RMP-7</font> can open up the blood-brain barrier just long enough for toxic anti-cancer drugs such as carboplatin to sweep inside the tumour. And since the action is specific to the tumour, the rest of the brain--untouched by malignancy--is also unaffected by <font size=-1>RMP-7</font>.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>RMP-7</font>-carboplatin combination has been put through its paces in several clinical trials in Europe and America. Results from European studies (announced late in December) show that almost 90% of patients with recurrent malignant brain tumours that have failed to respond to surgery and radiotherapy do respond to monthly intravenous injections of <font size=-1>RMP-7</font> and carboplatin. Indeed, in three-quarters of the cases the tumours were either completely stalled or even reversed. The new treatment appears to double the chance of survival. And there is not a drill in sight.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="st4107.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

It seems, however, that war may open some soldiers' minds, too--in many cases a little too literally. Research in Israel by Alon Friedman at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in Beersheva, and Hermona Soreq at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem suggests that stress may cause soldiers' blood-brain barriers to leak.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a recent paper in <i>Nature Medicine</i>, Dr Friedman and Dr Soreq follow up an earlier observation that Israeli soldiers from the Gulf-war period are three times more likely than peacetime volunteers to experience central-nervous-system effects from a substance known as pyridostigmine. This chemical is an anti-nerve-gas agent widely used to protect troops from the effects of organophosphates in chemical weapons. It is designed to safeguard the peripheral nervous system from the effects of such weapons, thus keeping essential organs--particularly the heart and lungs--functioning.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But pyridostigmine cannot enter the brain (where it causes such tell-tale symptoms as headaches, insomnia and nervousness) unless the blood-brain barrier is breached. Dr Friedman and Dr Soreq believe that stress, of both mind and body, is to blame for the soldiers' fragile brain defences. They have found that mice put under pressure--by forcing them to swim a few laps of a small swimming pool, for instance--are 100 times more susceptible to the brain effects of pyridostigmine than those allowed to rest. This is primarily due to the increase in the amount of the drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biochemical basis of the connection between stress and the blood-brain barrier, though noted in other experiments, is as yet unknown. Dr Soreq speculates that neurotransmitters such as serotonin--a known disrupter of the barrier which has recently been implicated in anxiety disorders--may play a part.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stress afflicts patients, as well as soldiers. If the blood-brain barrier does open up under duress, this creates new opportunities for delivering drugs to the brain and new complications for sending them to other organs. In medicine as in war, a weak defence demands a careful offence.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1 align=center>Palestine by proclamation</h1>


<CleverDrop>THE settlements grow, the talks stagnate and the prospect of Palestinian frustration leading to endless violence grows apace. Is there a way for Yasser Arafat to avert the coming explosion and make Israelis once again take the "peace process" seriously?
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Arafat has few instruments at his command other than gestures, and gestures can often prove empty. Even so, this could be the moment to take a risk--and proclaim Palestine independent. He has in fact done it before, in Algiers on November 15th 1988. Some 60 countries recognised the new state almost at once, and as many again have done so since. Nothing happened. But this time it just might be different.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason is that outside opinion has shifted Mr Arafat's way. Most of the democratic world was hugely pleased to see the success of the Oslo peace effort, and distinctly apprehensive when, in May 1996, Binyamin Netanyahu was elected Israel's prime minister, bringing with him a Likud-led government hostile to the concept of a land-for-peace deal on which the accords rest. Still, the world was ready to wait and see. It has now done so, and the evidence suggests that Mr Netanyahu is not prepared to contemplate serious bargaining over basic issues, including borders and settlements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For their part, the Palestinians have downgraded their expectations. All they insist on, they say, is that Israel should implement agreements already signed: not so much over Hebron (about which there is now little dispute) but on "further redeployments", something that sounds boringly technical but isn't. Under an agreement signed in 1995, Israel is supposed in the next year or so to give the Palestinians full (rather than just civic) control over the villages where most West Bankers live, and to move its army out of most of the countryside. Since Mr Netanyahu is deeply reluctant to do any such thing, he seems to be suggesting that the two sides skip redeployment and move briskly into the final-status talks. There, if present circumstances are any guide, he can make sure that nothing happens at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this prospect that makes a renewed declaration of Palestinian independence seem less outlandish. Mr Arafat could argue that a Palestinian state already exists, recognised by most countries. He could go on to acknowledge that the Palestinian Authority is, in effect, a Trojan horse for an elected Palestinian government with an executive, a legislature, a judiciary and its own security forces. He would then apply for membership of the United Nations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What would all this achieve? It would pre-empt time-wasting argument about what the Palestinian "entity" should eventually be. More important, it would raise the sights of the peace process. Instead of an indeterminate crowd of former guerrillas and exiles begging for "concessions" from the all-powerful state that defeated them, the negotiations would be between two states, equal under international law even if far from equal in brute power, and the talks would be about borders, security and perhaps a shared capital.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, Israel would not accept this straightaway. Yet the notion of a Palestinian state is no longer anathema to most Israelis; the Labour Party did not oppose it in its latest election manifesto. And with the peace process stuck, there is an argument for building a stronger foundation for the time when it eventually unsticks itself. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By giving Palestine international standing, membership of the <font size=-1>UN</font> could help cement that foundation. Palestine already has observer status. Were it to gain full membership, it would be no more curious than some other <font size=-1>UN</font> members. Its alphabetical neighbour, Palau, for instance, is a fully sovereign and independent state of 15,000 people on 340 Pacific islands with its own American zip code. It makes no pretence of being responsible for its own defence. Palestine would have to accept its own defence limitations.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The world on the spot</b></b><br>
China and Russia would support Palestine. Two other members of the Security Council, France and Britain, have expressed support for eventual statehood. For a while at least, Britain, which likes to make the recognition of other states technical rather than political, would nitpick about the criteria. Is Palestine a defined territory over which sovereignty is not seriously contested? And has it effective control over territory and population? A fuzzy yes can be given to both questions. Israel has not claimed sovereignty over the Palestinian land it conquered in 1967, East Jerusalem apart (admittedly, a crucial exception). Egypt administered Gaza but never asserted sovereignty over it. Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank in 1988. And the Palestinian Authority, with its sometimes brutal security forces, does control most of the people in the territory, if not most of the land itself. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, then, would the United States do? Optimists argue that it was the all-pervading paralysis of the American election that helped to send the peace process spiralling downwards. Now that Bill Clinton is safely into his second term, he can, they hope, rise above his reputation as Israel's favourite president. Might he support Palestine's application to join the <font size=-1>UN</font>? He should. If Palestine were a recognised state within the United Nations, it would increase the hope of a peaceful Middle East. But the reality is that American public opinion has not been prepared for it, and Mr Clinton, however exasperated he is with Israeli policy, is not, at present, likely to stick his neck out for the Palestinians.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the biggest objection to a unilateral declaration of independence. America is the only country that can influence Israel. A Palestinian <font size=-1>UDI</font> would be seen by many Americans as provocative, drawing attention away from Israeli backsliding and robbing the Palestinians of whatever sympathy they may currently enjoy. A cynic might argue that Mr Arafat would do better to wait until Israel had unambiguously shown its contempt for the peace process, openly reneging on its 1995 agreement on the villages. Yet to wait for that might be to await the shedding of lots more blood. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another objection is that after <font size=-1>UDI</font> the Palestinians could find themselves worse off. They might jeopardise all hopes of regaining control of their villages. They might see renewed border closures, even occupation of areas already handed over. And so they might. Yet these are risks they run anyway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has long been accepted that there can be no confident peace in the region until the Israelis believe themselves secure and the Palestinians believe their rights restored. Neither of these things can happen, absolutely. But an established state should give the Palestinians the confidence to accept the restrictions--on guerrilla movements, arms and foreign policy--that are vital if the Israelis are to be confident too. A declaration of independence is a risk worth running.<br>

<h2>The great survivor</h2>
 <p>
<b>Boris Yeltsin</b> survived two challenges: a campaign for re-election and a heart-bypass operation. His security adviser, Alexander Lebed, made peace in Chechnya, and was then sacked.<p>
<b>NATO </b>agreed to start talks in 1997 about letting some East European countries join. Russia said it would discuss a charter to define its relations with the alliance. <font size=-1>NATO</font> troops kept the peace in <b>Bosnia</b>, and will remain until mid-1998.<p>
<b>Helmut Kohl </b>became Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck. Spain elected its first right-wing government since Franco; a left-leaning coalition won power in Italy. Both countries ran austerity budgets in preparation for a single currency, as did Germany and France, despite record unemployment. The European Union agreed on a <b>stability and growth pact</b> for countries that adopt a single currency in 1999.<p>
Necmettin Erbakan became Turkey's <b>first Islamist prime minister</b>.<p>
The European Union banned exports of <b>British beef</b> after scientists discovered a link between "mad-cow disease" and a new variant of <font size=-1>CJD</font>, a fatal human brain illness.<p>
Voters ousted <b>former communists</b> in Romania and Lithuania and elected reformist presidents in Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia. Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Republic's pro-market prime minister, hung on to power. Alexander Lukashenka, Belarus's despotic president, tightened control.<p>
<h2>Peace broken?</h2>
<b>Binyamin Netanyahu</b>'s narrow win in Israel's election stopped the Arab-Israeli peace process. Before the election, bombs in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem killed 59 people. Israel attacked Hizbullah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, killing many civilians. Later in the year, over 70 people died in two days of Israeli-Palestinian clashes.<p>
<b>Carnage in Algeria </b>continued, as Islamist guerrillas battled the army, and both killed ordinary people. Voters approved a constitutional ban on parties based on religion.<p>
Iraq provoked <b>American missile strikes </b>by helping one group of Kurds against another. <p>
America moved 4,500 troops in <b>Saudi Arabia</b> to a new base after 19 servicemen were killed by a bomb in Dhahran. <p>
<b>Kofi Annan</b>, Ghanaian head of peacekeeping at the United Nations, will be the <font size=-1>UN</font>'s secretary-general after America vetoed another term for Boutros Boutros-Ghali.<p>
The civil wars in Rwanda and Burundi spilled over into <b>eastern Zaire</b>. Tutsi rebels established an enclave there, and 500,000 Hutu refugees went back to Rwanda.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
President Mandela inaugurated a new constitution for South Africa. Nigeria's General Sani Abacha permitted small steps towards a return to <b>democracy</b>. Somalia carried on fighting.<p>
<h2>A great comeback</h2>
<b>Bill Clinton</b> won a second term as president, the first Democrat to win two presidential elections since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. Mr Clinton picked Madeleine Albright to replace Warren Christopher as secretary of state and William Cohen, a Republican, as defence secretary. The Whitewater investigations rumbled on.<p>
Mr Clinton ended the 61-year federal guarantee of <b>welfare payments</b>, replacing it with block grants to the states.<p>
The president signed the Helms-Burton law, allowing Americans to sue foreign investors in <b>Cuba</b>, but delayed its application, after protests from other countries. <p>
Latin America's move toward <b>market economics </b>stumbled on. Venezuela's ex-populist president bowed to the "Washington consensus". Ecuador's new populist president ate his campaign words even faster. Brazil saw some privatisations and congressional steps toward bigger ones. But in Mexico ruling-party activists rebelled against fresh sell-offs.<p>
Colombia endured an upsurge of killings by <b>guerrillas </b> and paramilitaries opposed to them. Peru's Shining Path and Tupac Amaru terrorists came vigorously to life again; Guatemala's agreed to peace. In Mexico a new left-wing armed movement emerged.<p>
<h2>Containing China</h2>
 <p>
East Asia saw its tensest <b>military confrontation</b> since the end of the cold war. China staged missile tests off Taiwan. America dispatched two aircraft carriers. Taiwan pressed on with its first democratic presidential election, which was won by Lee Teng-hui of the ruling Kuomintang. <p>
<b>Japan</b>'s Liberal Democratic Party staged a comeback. After three years ruling in coalition, the <font size=-1>LDP</font> did well enough in the election to form a government from its own ranks.<p>
An era ended in <b>South Korea</b> with the conviction of two of the country's former presidents on charges of corruption and treason.<p>
A corruption-tarnished Congress party lost power in <b>India</b>'s election. It was replaced by a United Front coalition of left-wing and regional parties, but Congress's economic reforms survived.<p>
For the second time, <b>Benazir Bhutto</b>, Pakistan's prime minister, was turned out of office by the president.<p>
China selected Tung Chee-hwa, a local businessman, to be<b> Hong Kong</b>'s first chief executive after it reverts to Chinese rule in July 1997.<p>
<b>Australians</b> elected a right-wing government. New Zealanders clipped their rightists' wings.<p>

<h2>On the defensive</h2>
 <p>
The reconstruction of <b>America's defence industry</b> reached a climax when Boeing announced its takeover of McDonnell Douglas-- which will make it the world's biggest aerospace group. Northrop Grumman bought Westinghouse's defence-electronics business and Lockheed Martin bought most of Loral. By contrast, Europe managed one joint venture, in missiles, between Matra and British Aerospace.<p>
<b>Asia's businessmen</b> worried about slower growth. A collapse in electronics exports hit Singapore and Taiwan. And in South Korea, a slowing economy forced conglomerates to cut back at home while pushing even harder overseas. The rising Asian star was the Philippines.<p>
Although a lower yen helped exports, record losses plagued <b>corporate Japan</b>. Sumitomo Corporation, a trading company, racked up the largest trading losses in the country's history, thanks to the activities of its head copper trader, who was accused of fraud.<p>
<b>Conglomerates </b>were out, focus was in. Lord Hanson, Britain's arch-predator of the 1980s, broke up his eponymous group. <b>Daimler-Benz</b> started dismantling the industrial empire it created in the 1980s and went back to cars and some aerospace, leaving Fokker, its Dutch subsidiary, to go bust.<p>
<b>Airline alliances </b>multiplied. Germany and America signed an "open skies" treaty freeing air traffic between the two, allowing United and Lufthansa to get together. British Airways, taxiing to a deal with American Airlines, is selling its stake in <font size=-1>US</font> Air. <p>
<b>America's tobacco industry</b> had a hard year. Its legal ramparts, impregnable for 40 years, were breached when a court awarded a man with lung cancer $750,000 damages against a cigarette maker. Bill Clinton warmed to a proposal to restrict sales and advertising on the ground that nicotine is a drug.<p>
<h2>Wired</h2>
 <p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">table</a>)<br>A law opening America's <b>telecoms markets </b>brought mergers galore. Most notable was the $21 billion takeover of <font size=-1>MCI</font>, America's second-largest long-distance firm, by Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font>. In Europe, where liberalisation is due in 1998, progress was slower--though <b>Deutsche Telekom</b> was partially privatised. Japan pretended to split up <b>NTT</b>.<p>
<b>Microsoft</b> embraced the Internet, which had challenged the company's dominance of the computer-software industry. Microsoft's new Internet software threatened to dethrone Netscape, the Internet king of 1995.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Consolidation continued in <b>drugs and health care</b>. Ciba and Sandoz, two Swiss drug firms, merged to form the world's largest life-sciences company, Novartis. Aetna took over U.S. Healthcare to become America's biggest medical-benefits group. Trials of protease inhibitors, a new type of <b>drug for AIDS</b>, brought hope that the disease might be controllable.<p>
France bungled two privatisations. The sale of <b>Thomson</b>, a defence-electronics firm, fell apart after the privatisation committee said Thomson's multimedia unit should not be sold to a South Korean firm; that of <b>CIC</b>, a group of regional banks, failed when the committee said the bidding had been mismanaged.<p>
<b>Olivetti</b>, a computer maker once symbolising Italian flair, drifted towards disaster, shedding its long-time boss, Carlo De Benedetti, on the way.<p>
<h2>Courting couples</h2>
<b>Rogue-watchers </b>were busy. Deutsche Bank bailed out Morgan Grenfell Asset Management after a unit-trust manager breached investment rules. A manager at Jardine Fleming caused the Hong Kong-based merchant bank similar embarrassment.<p>
<b>Lloyd's of London</b> settled with its names, the once-rich investors who supply the insurance market's capital. The agreement will allow the market to pay for past losses while underwriting new risks.<p>
<b>In court</b>: Ian and Kevin Maxwell were acquitted in London of fraud; Australia's Alan Bond wasn't, and was jailed; the European Court of Human Rights decided Ernest Saunders, ex-Guinness, had an unfair trial in 1990; German prosecutors indicted Jose Ignacio Lopez, General Motors' defector to Volkswagen, for betraying company secrets; and Swiss banks were pressed to reveal their holdings of war-time loot.<p>
Two <b>banking mega-mergers</b> were sealed: Bank of Tokyo's marriage to Mitsubishi Bank, and Chase Manhattan's to Chemical. A big new one in the pipeline: NationsBank's $9 billion purchase of Boatmen's Bancshares.<p>
Consolidation continued in <b>global insurance</b>. Two of the biggest deals: Munich Re, the largest reinsurer, purchased American Re; and France's <font size=-1>AXA</font> merged with Union des Assurances de Paris.<p>
<h2>Bullish</h2>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The rampant Dow set the tone for <b>stockmarkets </b>almost everywhere except Tokyo: the Nikkei rose only 1%.<p>
At the first pow-wow of trade ministers since the Uruguay round of <font size=-1>GATT</font>, the <b>World Trade Organisation</b> reached agreement in principle on scrapping tariffs on high-technology goods.<p>
<b>Oil prices </b>beat expectations. Brent crude rose from $18 a barrel in January to $25 in October, dipping later when the first exports of Iraqi crude for six years began after partial lifting of a <font size=-1>UN</font> embargo.<p>

<h1 align=center>Gentle giants</h1>


<p><b>Technology can create near-monopolies. That is sometimes a good thing</b></p><br>
MONOPOLIES are usually ugly. They tend to be fat and lazy. They tend to charge high prices for dull products. Yet the computer industry seems to say otherwise. Many computer firms have won 70% or more of their markets while remaining lean, mean and keen to innovate. The best known is Microsoft--a firm much investigated by America's antitrust authorities these days. However, as our series on other technological monopolies--technopolies--has shown (see <a href="$link 108.html page"></a>), plenty of other firms are comparably powerful within their markets yet attract hardly a word of complaint from trustbusters or even competitors: Cisco (which dominates the market for Internet routers), <font size=-1>IBM</font> (mainframe software), Intel (microprocessors) and Intuit (personal-finance software).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why are these technopolies so much nicer than your average monopoly? The answer is not, if anybody was naive enough to think so, that they have devoted themselves to the greater good of mankind. Nor is it their sunny disposition-- the motto of Intel's boss, Andy Grove, is: "Only the paranoid survive." Technopolies are neighbourly because it is in their interests to act that way. More important, they retain their market power because it is in the interests of other high-tech companies to let them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology is about standards. To succeed with consumers, one firm's gadget often has to work with other gadgets from other firms. Technology moves so quickly that standards set by committees usually come too late. Instead, the industry organises itself around de facto standards championed by single firms with the clout to make them stick--as, for instance, Intel has done with microprocessors. By bringing order to an otherwise chaotic marketplace, the standard can serve as a foundation from which many firms can sell compatible products, strengthening the industry as a whole.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As long as the technopoly puts most of its effort into expanding the overall market (as Intel has with <font size=-1>PC</font>s), the rest of the industry is happy. And if a technopoly uses its dominance to charge too much, then its customers are quick to rebel. When <font size=-1>IBM</font> began to plunder the mainframe-software market in the mid-1980s, it only accelerated the move towards networked <font size=-1>PC</font>s; ever since the early 1990s, Big Blue has had to cut prices. One of the beauties of technology is that even a seemingly well-entrenched monopoly can be overthrown by a challenge from outside its market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where a technopoly's empire is not built on proprietary standards its ability to throw its weight around is even more limited. Both Cisco and Intuit gained an early lead in their markets by offering better products than their peers. The technology industry's propensity to coalesce around one winner has left both firms with enormous market shares and, in Cisco's case, a huge stockmarket valuation (it is worth as much as General Motors). However, their products are accepted as "standards" only in that most people who use Internet routers or financial software would rather stick with what they know than change to something else. Their position depends on their ability to out-innovate their peers.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Big, bad Bill is sweet William now</b></b><br>
If technopolies are such a good thing, why is Microsoft so unloved? Bill Gates's problem is that he has broken one of the cardinal rules of technopoly by using his power in one software market (operating systems) to push into others (such as word-processing and now the Internet). This was a good business decision, but it is surely right for trustbusters to keep an eye on how he colonises these areas. That said, Mr Gates has also provided the industry with a standard and he is still vulnerable to competition, just like other technopolists. If Microsoft either gouged its market (in fact, it has consistently lowered its prices) or failed to deliver a new technology quickly enough, it would lose its lofty perch. That, rather than Mr Gates's undoubtedly sweet nature, is what keeps Microsoft and its technopolistic peers so charming.<br>

<h1>The perils of complacency</h1>

<p><b>A combination of neglect and misuse seems to have made the word liberal almost meaningless. That is not just a pity, it is dangerous</b></p><br>
ONE of the rudest things you can call an American politician nowadays is a liberal. Bob Dole threw this insult at Bill Clinton so often during the presidential campaign that Mr Clinton, laughing at the idea that there might be anything in it, called the slur a "golden oldie". In the now-standard American usage, a liberal is the opposite of a conservative--and almost the same as what Europeans used to call a socialist, or possibly a social democrat. That is, someone who favours big government, lots of taxes and public spending; someone, in short, willing to infringe economic liberties in pursuit of the common good.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Europe, to the extent that "liberal" is used at all, it is more often an opposite of "socialist" than a synonym. A European liberal will favour limited government, and give freedom priority over the supposed interests of society. Historians would say this sense of the word has the prior claim. But today, even in Europe, people with such views would more often be called conservative. So it seems that in America "liberal" has become detached from its proper meaning and attached to the opposite, whereas in Europe it is merely falling out of common political parlance. Abuse, misuse and disuse: a sorry fate for such a word.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The confusion is by no means confined to everyday speech. In political philosophy, liberalism sometimes seems so broad a term as to exclude almost nothing--that is, to mean almost nothing. The philosopher Robert Nozick is a liberal, in the tradition that descends from Locke. Mr Nozick's view of the just society (as set out in "Anarchy, State and Utopia") calls for the minimal state: the demands of liberty are such that governments may legitimately carry out only the narrowest range of functions. But then the philosopher John Rawls is also a liberal, in a different tradition that runs through Bentham and Mill. His view, explained in "A Theory of Justice", calls for a large state, one of whose jobs is to decide the distribution of income among citizens.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Speaking loosely, Mr Nozick the liberal is well to the right of any mainstream conservative in Britain or America, and Mr Rawls the liberal (if he accepts the implications of his analysis) well to the left of any social democrat. If "liberal" imparts so little information even to those whose job it is to use such terms carefully, why worry about its corruption in popular parlance? Why not return to matters of substance?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put aside whether the American or the European sense of liberal should prevail (the European sense is the better-rooted). There is a more important issue.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two apparently contradictory things are true. One is that, however much some may protest, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, John Major and Tony Blair, Robert Nozick and John Rawls, not to mention Locke, Bentham and Mill, are indeed all liberals, in a perfectly intelligible sense of the word. The second is that, even when defined so broadly as to accommodate all of these and more, "liberal" still means something important. To understand why it means something to be a liberal, even when membership of the club is flung indiscriminately wide, is to see why liberalism is worth not merely defining but also defending.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Freedom and its limits</b></b><br>
Despite the countless quarrels that liberals have had with each other over the past three centuries, certain core beliefs, clear in the writings of the earliest thinkers, have been central throughout. In different ways, almost all of these beliefs are concerned with protecting the status of the individual confronted with the demands of larger social groups. The liberal society, as it was first conceived, aims to guarantee freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from coercion, freedom from illegitimate authority (ie, from unconstitutional government), freedom to buy and sell property (including one's own labour), and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liberals have always recognised the need to set limits to the freedoms of individuals. But in describing how these limits should be devised, liberals only made their tendency to exalt the individual all the more apparent. The scope of freedom in a liberal society is given by the "harm principle", which in Mill's formulation says this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.
 There must be curbs on the freedoms of individuals, the classical liberals conceded, but only to prevent those freedoms hurting others. Perhaps the individual is the best judge of his own interests, perhaps not; but, unless the well-being of others is jeopardised, he should be the judge. A crucial implication is that, if freedom is to be infringed, the burden of proof rests with the infringer. The individual does not have to prove that his actions harm nobody. The state that limits his freedom, if it is to act rightfully, has to prove the opposite.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is obvious that the harm principle formulated this way, or indeed in any plausible way, is open to many interpretations-- each supporting a different kind of liberalism. First and foremost, what does "harm to others" mean? My conspicuous consumption may offend people: should my visits to Bond Street and Rodeo Drive be curbed? My pornographic novel may corrupt them: should it be banned?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every economic interaction among individuals has implications for third parties. Some such externalities (pollution, for instance) are relatively uncontroversial cases for regulation--that is, for liberty to be infringed. But a different kind of externality (called a pecuniary externality) is pervasive in economic life, as when I decide to buy something, and thereby force up (however fractionally) the price that others must pay. Attempting to curb "harms" of that kind would be inconsistent with the very idea of a market economy, an idea that all liberals are committed to.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider also what Mill meant by his stipulation of a "civilised community". Not, as you might suppose, that any society which failed to apply the harm principle must be uncivilised. His point was that only civilised people--mature and educated--could use liberty wisely. The principle did not apply to children. Power can be rightfully exercised over them, though not over adults, so long as it is for their own good, and regardless of whether third parties would otherwise be harmed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mill said the same was true of "barbarians" (a term which is harder to define than "children"). In other words, the full set of liberal rights was not granted to all people merely by virtue of their being people. Rather, it was extended to those who qualified by virtue of their ability to behave responsibly--that is, to members of civilised communities. From this idea springs the liberal passion for education and for equality of opportunity: only a civilised society, in this special sense, can be a liberal society. But the fact remains that, just as it is unclear exactly what liberals mean by "harms", it is also unclear under exactly what circumstances people qualify for liberal freedoms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Difficulties such as these are only the beginning. A larger, indeed inexhaustible, source of dispute is the fact that some liberal freedoms appear to be in conflict. For instance, if the state is to provide its citizens with freedom from coercion, it will need to exact some resources from them (policemen need to be paid). Even in Mr Nozick's liberal state the government must confiscate some property: one freedom is secured only at the expense of another.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More generally, a distinction is often drawn between two kinds of freedom: the negative kind, such as freedom from illegitimate authority, and the positive kind, such as freedom to lead a good life. The first (freedom from . . .) protects the individual from outside interference; the second (freedom to . . .) may often require it. Even liberals who favour a minimum night-watchman state regard it as the state's job to secure certain positive freedoms. Its role in protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, and so on, may all be seen in this light.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most classical liberals went further, arguing that the state should provide relief to the poor, and supply the services (notably education) needed if people are to play a full part in society. Such ambitions require larger takings from citizens. And some liberals went further still, defending an idea of distributive justice that requires transfers of income from rich to poor, not to relieve poverty but to achieve a "just" distribution of income (Mr Rawls's theory is a modern example). A case for the full-blown modern welfare state can be developed along similar lines. For each such regime, different schools of liberals have proposed different ways of establishing its legitimacy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given these complexities and uncertainties, each one creating a niche for a different kind of liberalism, it is hardly surprising that "liberal" is a term that stretches so widely. But what matters is whether the things that all liberals have in common are more important than the things they disagree about. If they are, then the term, however elastic, is serving some purpose.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A profusion of liberalisms</b></b><br>
If Bill Clinton, Robert Dole and (yes) Newt Gingrich are all liberals, the answer might seem quite the opposite. What divides them is surely bigger than what unites them: on the face of it, apart from being white American men, these politicians have little in common. To say this would be a mistake, however, and a revealing one. For all three share a belief in the liberal society as defined above: a society that provides constitutional government (rule by laws, not by men) and freedom of religion, thought, expression and economic interaction; a society in which infringements of individual liberty must be justified.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So what?" you might say. By that definition, everyone in the mainstream of American politics is a liberal. Quite so. America's system of government, for all its faults, is probably the most successful liberal-constitutional regime the world has seen. And virtually all other systems of government in the West, and the politicians within them, are liberal too, despite their competing policies. They are liberal because the systems embody, and the politicians share, those defining beliefs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this sense, despite the anger and bitterness they generate, the quarrels of western politics are arguments among friends. But this is not proof that "liberal" is too vague a term to be useful. Rather, it demonstrates the extraordinary triumph of liberalism in the West--a victory so total, in fact, that it brings perils of its own.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joseph Nye, an American expert on international relations, once drew an analogy between security and oxygen. It serves here just as well. In the West, we have come to take fundamental liberal freedoms for granted--as we do with breathing. Normally, it is easy and even desirable to forget about breathing. But sometimes it becomes terribly obvious that breathing is necessary. When that happens, nothing else matters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two centuries ago, it was plain that what united liberals was more important than what divided them, because liberals were opposed to many aspects of the ruling order. All denounced autocratic rule, religious intolerance and political power by inheritance. In the West these battles have been won so decisively that no serious politician any longer questions--even thinks about--such fundamental preferences. But here lies the danger: the liberal triumph has encouraged a kind of complacency, a corroding intellectual laziness, in the West's politics. It takes a variety of forms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For instance, so secure does the West feel in its liberal freedoms that its politicians feel able to look indulgently on countries in other parts of the world where rulers still deny their people such liberty. Several East Asian economies have startled the world with their economic progress in recent years, but in some cases their governments have failed to enact the full range of liberal rights. Some of these rulers defend this as a matter of policy: they argue that liberal freedoms are not for their people, saying that Asian values and western licence do not mix. This is listened to politely, even sympathetically, in the West.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If their own liberal freedoms were less securely entrenched, western sympathisers would need to temper this indulgence. Otherwise it might be seen as support for new restrictions on freedoms at home. (The sympathisers would appear to be asking why, if Singapore can do so well without a free press, Britain or America should need one.) Precisely because those liberties are taken for granted in the West, nobody need fear being so accused. But that also means there is no need to rehearse the arguments that helped to entrench the liberties in the first place--and nobody need be reminded that those arguments apply to Asians every bit as much as to Europeans and Americans. In short, we may be liberals, but we seem to be forgetting why.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The poverty of anti-liberalism</b></b><br>
Not content merely to neglect the arguments for liberalism, other western thinkers, such as Alasdair MacIntyre in America and John Gray in Britain, these days go much further, and pronounce grandly on the failure of "the liberal project". Western rationalism has smashed traditional modes of thinking, they argue, and the result is disastrous: incipient moral collapse. Again, what licenses intellectual anti-liberals to embark on such a critique is the very fact that liberalism seems so secure.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just 60 years ago in Western Europe, and a mere ten years ago in Europe east of the iron curtain, any thinker who declared liberalism a failure would have been understood as proposing a radical alternative--such as fascism or Soviet-style communism. In one way, that was a good thing: it helped concentrate minds on the virtues of a liberal order. Today, few in the West can even imagine desiring any such alternative. So announcing the failure of liberalism arouses no fears, and elicits no urgent reflection on what life is like in an illiberal regime. ("Obviously, when I say that liberalism has failed and morality is collapsing, I don't mean that we should repudiate our civil liberties, tear up the constitution and install an authoritarian regime." No, quite, of course not. But then, what <i>do</i> you mean?)<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet another form of modern, house-trained anti-liberalism is emerging from what used to be the socialist left. For several decades, the increasingly apparent failure of communism sapped this movement's animating spirit. Then, when communism collapsed altogether, the jolt was such that even leftist politicians who had never been communists had to rethink their ideas. Popular opinion has turned against planning, exaggerated concern with economic equality, grandiose schemes of public spending and the grandiose taxes needed to pay for them. The left must therefore shift its ground accordingly. Now deprived of its economic distinctiveness, it is seeking a big new idea to mark out its territory.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such idea is to question the naive liberalism, as the left would call it, of the political right. A favourite theme is to deplore the classical-liberal emphasis on self-interest. This is worth a moment's pause. The notion is especially popular just now in Britain, where Tony Blair's Labour Party is trying to shape a new post-socialist political vision. The liberalism of the political right, says Mr Blair, puts the individual too much at the centre; it glorifies selfishness and naked competition; it allows too small a role, if any, for altruism or the common good. Margaret Thatcher and Adam Smith were wrong: there is such a thing as society.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By all means let there be a vigorous argument between liberals who want to promote new forms of social co-operation and liberals who do not. That, in itself, would be fine. But it will be a great pity if ex-socialists come to rest their case solely on a repudiation of liberal self-interest--because that argument can succeed only if people forget what liberals actually mean by self-interest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Adam Smith was no 18th-century precursor of Gordon Gekko, pronouncing "Greed is good." To say that individual self-interest promotes collective welfare is not to glorify selfishness, but merely to explain how a market economy can work. And, by the way, Margaret Thatcher was quoted out of context. When she said, "There is no such thing as society," she was replying to a questioner who had argued that society should bear the cost of some new initiative. Mrs Thatcher was merely pointing out that individual taxpayers, not some disembodied "society", would still have to pay. No liberal--indeed, nobody with an ounce of sense--ever denied that man is a social animal, and that social virtues such as trustworthiness and a willingness to co-operate are essential to man's well-being. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When classical liberals praised self-interest, it was not to contrast it with altruism or virtuous self-sacrifice, but to recommend it in preference to blind habit and irrational passion (such as racial or religious bigotry). Implicitly, self-interest always meant enlightened self-interest. As Hobbes, a "pre-liberal", argued, if men had always been rational pursuers of self-interest, history would not have been an endless tale of savagery and mayhem. For the classical liberals, moreover, the idea of self-interest had a crucial moral component, always neglected by modern anti-liberals. To recommend self-interest as a guide to behaviour is to acknowledge that no individual's interests have priority over another's. What goes for you goes for everyone. That claim, in turn, is the cornerstone of the case for constitutional government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tacit approval of illiberal regimes abroad, grandly paradoxical denunciations of liberalism at home, casual attacks on liberal virtues--none of these may pose an immediate threat to our liberal freedoms. The West's modern anti-liberals, softies by comparison with their predecessors, have no such agenda. Indeed, they are nearly all liberals like the rest of us, if only they would admit it. Yet, unalarming as they may be, they are still to be opposed. Their arguments help people to forget why liberal freedoms matter. That is a pity in itself, and it eases the way for any bolder followers who may come along.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the West, by and large, we are all liberals now. Instead of ignoring or affecting to deplore this, we should be recognising and reaffirming it. Or else, you never know, it might one day no longer be true.<br>

<h1>And a wary Christmas to you</h1>

<p><b>Can the Net save you from joyless Christmas-shopping treks through dank streets and chaotic malls? We asked our resident geek to find out. His reply came through gritted teeth</b></p><br>
LIKE other computer journalists, I have written my share of stories about how Internet shopping will revolutionise the retail trade. On the Net, I usually explain, anyone--department store or corner grocery-- can set up an on-line shopfront, and reach the world. The overheads are tiny: just an Internet connection and a computer to tend the store. Here is a whole new dimension to shopping, with far more information than any salesman or shelf display can provide. There was, though, one nagging irony in all this punditry: I had never actually bought anything on-line, and virtually nobody I know had, either.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure, I had tried demonstrations of futuristic "electronic cash" schemes, paying for a report or two with fake cyberbucks. I had even spent real money a few times for subscriptions to on-line newspapers and their woollier cousins, the "e-zines". But I had never bought a physical thing, something that would show up at my door in a cardboard box, or an envelope. For all the Internet's potential to reshape the world of commerce, I had not even come close to matching on-line what I routinely do with a telephone or a stamp.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few years ago it was easy to explain this away by pointing to the embryonic state of the on-line industry. It was easy for hackers to steal a credit-card number. There were not many big stores on-line, anyway. These days, those excuses look thin. Any glance at an Internet directory reveals thousands of wired stores, including most of the famous real-world ones. Indeed, it is rare to find an advertisement these days that does not point to some Web site. And most on-line stores that accept credit cards over the Net use software that allows a Web browser to send them in an encrypted code, which is practically unbreakable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, nobody I knew bought anything on-line. Why not? The only way to find out was to try, and try big. I would do my Christmas shopping on the Net this year. Whatever happened, it was bound to be better than the usual sweaty rush around a blur of identically random malls and department stores. Or so I thought.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Which way do I turn, please?</b></b><br>
I start with the usual gift list. Clothes for a sister, <font size=-1>CD</font>s for a brother-in-law, and so on. I turn to my <font size=-1>PC</font>, fire up a Web browser, and dial in. This is when I discover the first problem with Internet shopping. I have no idea where to do it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I try the closest thing the Internet has to a subject index: Yahoo (<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a>). Alas, "shopping" is not listed on the front screen, but, after typing it into the search box, I am gratified to see some responses. More than 500 listings later, I realise I need to be more specific. I am also irritated by the time it takes for the stuff to trickle down the telephone line. My old modem makes each a minute-long ordeal. Perhaps the first thing to buy is a new modem.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Typing in "modem" seems to bring up only manufacturers, so I decide to go to an on-line mall. The word "mall" turns up another stream of listings, about half of them simply advertisements for real malls. When I finally find the on-line malls, more than 600 are listed, 23 starting with "cyber" alone: Cyber Home, CyberShopper, CyberShop, CyberShoppe, Cyber Park, CyberWorld . . . Eyes glazing, I scroll down until I happen to spot <font size=-1>ISN</font>, the Internet Shopping Network (<a href="http://www.isn.com">www.isn.com</a>), which, as I recall, was bought by cable television's Home Shopping Network a few years ago. Cubic zirconia rings are a risk, but Yahoo says it specialises in computer gear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ISN</font> was one of the first sites to suggest the nearly infinite opportunities that fired the hype about Internet shopping. It offered not only product pictures but links to reviews in trade magazines. Apparently, this does not extend as far as modems. <font size=-1>ISN</font> lists about 300 of them--but most had only a price; no linked reviews are in sight.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, I decide to buy one I have heard good things about. At last, my first purchase. Great. I click on "add to shopping basket". My browser (I am using America Online's at the moment) reports that the document does not exist. This strikes me as unlikely, since it would be a relatively high priority of a shopping service to keep a till open. I switch to another Internet access provider, and navigate into <font size=-1>ISN</font> again using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time it works fine, and over in America <font size=-1>ISN</font> confirms that I have selected a modem to purchase. Or rather, four of them. Hmmm. I reset it to one, then click on "buy". <font size=-1>ISN</font> asks me to join its shopping club first. I plough my way through the application form, typing in my name and address, until I get to "state", which is tough as I live in London. I muse about this for a moment until I see a note at the bottom about international ordering. I click. Oh. <font size=-1>ISN</font> will not sell outside the United States. "We are working to develop an international shipping policy and procedure. However, until this is completed, all orders placed by international customers with international credit cards and/or addresses will be cancelled." So much for the much-vaunted global reach of the Internet.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The mouse is tiring</b></b><br>
Start again. This time, I go through Yahoo's regional listings. I try the European Shopping Centre (<a href="http://www.euroshops.co.uk">www.euroshops.co.uk</a>): lots of clothes, but no computer stores. Then the London Mall (<a href="http://www.londonmall.co.uk">www.londonmall.co.uk</a>), which has mobile telephone and Psion gear, but no <font size=-1>PC</font> hardware. I decide to try MarketNet (<a href="http://mkn.co.uk">mkn.co.uk</a>): again, a random assortment of stores, but not, I fear, a computer one. The <font size=-1>UK</font> Shopping Centre (<a href="http://www.ukshops.co.uk:8000">www.ukshops.co.uk:8000</a>) has a software store (by now I have given up on a modem and will settle for anything for my <font size=-1>PC</font>, even a game). Its virtual storefront turns out to be a listing of products in alphabetical order-- and it stops at N.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few stores later, I realise why each seems to have an arbitrary selection of a few <font size=-1>PC</font>s, a monitor or two, and some software, at prices that are no lower than those of a dusty little high-street dealer. They actually are dusty little high-street dealers, but with some tenner-a-month space on someone's Web site. Each takes about six mouse clicks (and, with my slow modem, about three minutes) to reveal the bareness of the shelves that I would have spotted through the real-world window. Perhaps it is time to go back to America, and see if I can find a firm willing to ship overseas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I try another index service, Excite (<a href="http://www.excite.com">www.excite.com</a>), which claims to have reviews of its sites. It does, of sorts. But it has only a fraction of Yahoo's listings, and the "reviews" are simply two-sentence descriptions of the site, giving up to four stars. I back out when I see that a site which simply lists the telephone number and address of a Greek jewellery shop gets two stars. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, I try a few more computer shops I find there. The first four turn me off by taking international orders only with a bank wire transfer, but eventually I stumble on NetBuyer (<a href="http://www.netbuyer.com">www.netbuyer.com</a>), which serves as a broker for several computer mail-order companies and is the on-line side of <i>Computer Shopper</i> magazine. It has a slick interface and provides technical comparisons between products. I am so pleased that I overlook the fact that it lists only one vendor for each product (no doubt at the insistence of its clients), making price comparisons impossible. I place the order, and get a confirmation. Time elapsed since I started: about four hours.<br>
</p><p><b><b>So, down to business</b></b><br>
Emboldened by this apparent success, I dive into my real Christmas list, starting with the <font size=-1>CD</font> for my brother-in-law. On Yahoo, I notice a link to a site where Andersen Consulting is demonstrating Bargain Finder (<a href="http://bf.cstar.ac.com/bf/">bf.cstar.ac.com/bf/</a>), an experimental "electronic agent" that shops at various on-line music stores to find the best price for a <font size=-1>CD</font>. I ask for The Cure's "Mixed Up". After a minute or so, it comes back with the results: three of the biggest stores had blocked its agent (presumably because they are not keen to be forced into a price war), but three others had responded. Prices range from $10.54 to $13.98. I pick out the cheapest, <font size=-1>GEMM</font> (<a href="http://www.gemm.com">www.gemm.com</a>), which turns out to be another sort of agent, in this case a broker. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Searching <font size=-1>GEMM</font>'s site, I find someone selling the <font size=-1>CD</font> for even less, $9.98, which makes me wonder a bit about the efficiency of Andersen's agent. Shipping costs $7 outside the United States, and it would go by regular post, which could take weeks, but even then it would be cheaper than buying it from a British retailer. I am just about to enter my credit-card number when I check my browser's status bar. Despite the site's promise of "secure ordering", it is not encrypting the transmission. I get a queasy feeling, and back out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, agents sound like just what I need to help me through the digital maze. I have heard raves about Firefly, a site set up by Agents Inc (<a href="http://www.ffly.com">www.ffly.com</a>), which is designed to help you find music you might like as well as order it. It turns out to be the best thing I have found on-line for months. It asks me to type in a few of my favourite bands, then to rate some other bands it displays: Bryan Adams: "hate it"; Sex Pistols: "great stuff". After a few more lists, it is dead on, suggesting most of the other bands I like, as well as (and this is the useful bit) throwing in some bands I don't know but are recommended by people who tend to like the stuff I like. Click on any band name and you get a biography, discography, reviews from other visitors, reviews from the music press, links to Web sites on the band, and a place to order the music. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I realise that I have fallen into the trap of shopping for myself again, so I stop playing around and pick a <font size=-1>CD</font> I think my brother-in-law might want. The store will ship it abroad, but that will cost $15, which is more than the <font size=-1>CD</font> itself. I decide that the local record shop is looking better by the minute, and move on to clothes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At this point, my standards have fallen to the point where anything actually ordered on-line will suffice: my sister will be impressed by the novelty factor alone. J.C. Penney, a big American retailer, is advertising its site a lot on-line, so I click on one of the ads that pop up while surfing elsewhere and go to www.jcpenney.com. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like most big stores, J.C. Penney is offering only a tiny sample of its wares on-line, with no more information than their catalogue listing. (Why is this? Surely the whole point of Web sites is that they can show you more than mere paper.) Since I am still stuck with my slow modem, I have turned pictures off to speed the downloads. But the J.C. Penney site consists mostly of a column of pictures, with no text. Since the pictures' file names give no clue to their contents, I have to spend three minutes downloading them all to know that they carry nothing I would want to buy. Other parts of the site do not work at all. To add insult to injury, the fine print, several layers in, reveals that the company does not sell abroad ("We are still developing our domestic market").<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Someone mentions Lands' End, another catalogue retailer with a line that my sister might actually wear. Its site is faster, but no bigger than J.C. Penney's, and with no explanation for the relatively bare virtual shelves. What is there looks reasonable, except that the pictures are about two inches high, and scanned at low resolution. I decide I would be better off buying clothes from across a room, and bolt back across the Atlantic. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the British stores I try are worse. Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and J. Sainsbury are on-line, but only two are actually selling anything--and that is only wine and chocolates. I decide to order two bottles of champagne from Sainsbury's, but see a note at the bottom which says orders must be in multiples of 12. I place the order for two anyway--and hope.<br>
</p><p><b><b>At last! he cried</b></b><br>
Now getting slightly desperate, I surf randomly until I stumble on British Telecom's on-line shop (<a href="http://www.btshop.bt.com">www.btshop.bt.com</a>), which reminds me that my sister-in-law needs a new answering machine. <font size=-1>BT</font> has a reasonable one for &#163;29 ($48.72), so I place the order with my credit card, which goes smoothly until the last step, where it confirms the order and displays an electronic receipt--"Sub-total: &#163;569000.43; delivery charge: &#163;3.99". I really hope that is wrong.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few days later, a box from <font size=-1>BT</font> shows up with the right machine, and by separate post a letter from <font size=-1>BT</font>. The good news is that it is not a bill for half a million pounds; the bad news is that it is still a bill. Despite having been given my credit-card number on the site, <font size=-1>BT</font> has sent me a demand for &#163;33. I call the customer-service desk. The lady gets a bit lost when I mention the Web site, then goes off to find a supervisor. She returns to say someone will call me back. The next day, a manager leaves a message: "The system is a bit slow in putting debits against credits." Apparently, the credit-card checking process is still done by someone over the telephone, giving the billing system time to sneak in and claim my order. Ignore the bill, I am instructed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I see a very grim Christmas coming if I do not buy something else, soon. With eyes smarting and repetitive stress injury looming, I find the idea of tromping through real-world malls now positively blissful compared with another minute on the Web. Before I disconnect for the last time, a colleague suggests that I give books a shot. A store called Amazon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a>) is the toast of cyberspace these days. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I become a believer in Internet commerce again. Amazon offers a million books from around the world, including hard-to-find and special-order ones. You can search by title, by author, or by fragments of each. Visitors are invited to post their own reviews. You can order a book with gift wrapping (from a choice of papers) and with a card, delivered straight to the lucky gift-getter. The prices are at least 10% less than retail and often even better. And shipping is even a reasonable $13 for 14-day delivery to Britain. Scrambling for my credit card, I order a stack of Beatrix Potter books. Even with wrapping paper, card and shipping, the total is still less than I might pay at my local bookshop. Maybe the preceding week of on-line hell had been an aberration, and this really was the future. Perhaps my original journalistic optimism had not been so naive after all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three weeks pass. The books, the modem and the champagne have still not arrived. Amazon has sent an e-mail saying it has shipped the order, but no word from the others. I will give them another week before I slink out into the real world to do my shopping all over again. Galling as it may be, I am secretly looking forward to rediscovering the little pleasures of pre-electronic shopping: holding things in my hands, trying them on, and even taking them home with me after I have paid.<br>

<h1>Bad, but not that bad</h1>

INTERNET shopping is a mess, but perhaps not for the reasons you think. Here are two frequently-heard fallacies:<br>
<li> The Net is unsafe. Alas, this is only half wrong. By and large, the least of the problems with shopping on-line is the risk that hackers may intercept your messages and steal your credit-card details. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get the same information that we happily give any shop assistant, a hacker would have to comb through all the trillions of bytes of Internet transmissions looking for strings of characters that look like credit card numbers. Even then, they would probably fail: most of the larger online retailers operate their Web sites from "secure servers" which tell the browser to scramble all information before sending it. Breaking such codes is a matter for supercomputers and weeks of effort--hardly worth it for a credit card with a spending limit of $3,000.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But fraud remains a more serious worry. In the real world, when you walk into a store you usually get what you pay for on the spot--and the size of the store or its name gives you an idea of whether it will be there next week if something goes wrong. On the Internet, two teenagers in a bedroom can set up a site that looks every bit as professional as those of the biggest retailers. They can scan a store's worth of merchandise out of some catalogue, and make up a grand name--"The Computer Megaplex". Getting listed by the big indexing sites like Yahoo is as easy as asking. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Endowed with such instant credibility, the site's owners simply wait for the punters to show up: the choice of whether to run a legitimate business or simply to keep the storefront up long enough to collect a stack of credit card numbers is a matter of morals, not practicality. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a few years, a system for authenticating merchants will become widespread, but until then the best bet is to stick with real-world names you know (but type carefully: for a while www.micr0soft.com --with a zero-- was actually an anti-Microsoft site). <br>
<li> The Net is waiting for "digital cash". Much of the publicity about electronic commerce has focused on efforts to develop a new currency and payment system, tailored for the Internet. The idea is appealing: "e-cash" could be used anywhere and would not even require a bank account. But clever as such digital cash schemes may be, none has won much support yet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This lack is less of a barrier than one might suppose. The real advantage of e-cash schemes is that they allow "microtransactions": sales of a few cents or fractions of a cent--far too little to process efficiently with credit cards. Someday we may pay for information this way (pay-per-view news, for example), but for hard goods, this smacks of overkill. Credit cards work fine for purchases above $10 or so, and they are every bit as international as digital cash hopes to be.<br>

<h1>The coming global tongue</h1>

<p><b>It is, says Jacques Chirac, a "major risk for humanity". AIDS? The bomb? Over-eating? No: what frightens the president of France is what the Internet may do to language, not least his own country's language</b></p><br>
THE spectre haunting the president of France is not new. In 1898, when Otto von Bismarck was an old man, a journalist asked him what he saw as the decisive factor in modern history. He replied: "The fact that the North Americans speak English." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This Bismarckian alarm, says Geoffrey Nunberg, of Stanford University in California, now has a new significance. For the electronic media that bind the world together are essentially carriers of language. To work efficiently, they need a common standard. The personal computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>) has one: Microsoft's operating system, Windows. The Internet has another: <font size=-1>TCP/IP</font>, its Esperanto or transmission protocol, which allows computers anywhere in the world to hook into it, whether they are <font size=-1>PC</font>s or rival Apple Macs. The English language is now the operating standard for global communication.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, electronic communications have affected, and will continue to affect, language in three distinct ways. First, they change the way language is used. Secondly, they have created a need for a global language--and English will fill that slot. Third, they will influence the future of other languages which people will (perhaps perversely) continue to speak.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Start with the simplest sort of change: the way English is used in electronic converse. The language of electronic chat is splattered with abbreviations that make it not just faster to type but also impenetrable to the novice. Plenty of activities have vocabularies of their own, badges of identity for the cognoscenti: think of motoring enthusiasts. So, too, with electronics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology is, after all, fertile ground for vocabulary. Technology and science, including medicine, together account for 50-60% of the new words in the addenda pages of "Webster's Third New International Dictionary", according to Frederick Mish, editor-in-chief of its publishing company. The test of cyberjargon will be its durability. Mr Mish is mulling over the inclusion of "Internet", "browser", "newsgroup" and "World Wide Web" for the 1997 "Collegiate Dictionary", which changes more often than the main volume. He says sternly: "We want to look at a new word for three to five years before considering it for publication." In the instant world of cyberspace, that is eternity. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not only is the vocabulary of electronic communication different from ordinary English; so is the way in which it is used. In his magisterial "Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language", David Crystal argues that broadcasting has already created some novel language forms. One is for sports: "Because commentary is an oral reporting of ongoing activity, it is unlike other kinds of narrative (which are typically reported in past time)." Indeed, it is unlike any other kind of speech. A radio commentary is a particularly odd creature. Charles Ferguson, an American linguist, describes it as "a monologue . . . directed at an unknown, unseen, heterogenous mass audience who voluntarily choose to listen, do not see the activity being reported, and provide no feedback to the speaker".<br>
</p><p><b><b>Weirder yet and weirder</b></b><br>
Other kinds of speech have been created by electronic communications. The answering machine, or voice-mail, has prompted new versions of the monologue (and one, to judge by the messages that most people leave, which most of us do not much enjoy delivering). The telephone itself made common something that had previously been a rarity: a conversation with somebody you cannot see. Like talking in the dark, it encourages speakers to confide. For the listener, concentration on the voice alone, stripped of misleading body language, can be far more telling than a face-to-face conversation. One study found that it was easier to detect when a person was lying in a telephone call than either in a video call or face-to-face.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Electronic mail has created another novelty: the written conversation. Charles Evans of Chyden.Net, a company based in Virginia which retails software electronically around the world, describes the style: "There's no social pressure to avoid the broken sentence. The key word is 'bandwidth'--which implies that the Internet will collapse if you use flowery language, but really just means 'Get to the point.' " Hence the staccato style of much electronic exchange: "The five-word sentence doesn't rattle on the screen as much as it does on paper." And getting it right first time is less important than in a letter or a fax: "The cost of clarifying later is low."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A written conversation has one great advantage over the spoken word: writers can refine their words before "speaking" them. But it also lacks a key quality of speech: the tone of voice that conveys emotion. In electronic mail, says Mr Evans, "I find we all have a tendency to apologise for the fact that we can't see the other person's expression or hear their tone of voice. You wouldn't do that in a letter. It's because we're thinking of it as a conversation."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At one point, some users solved this problem with the "smiley", a use of punctuation to express delight by :-) and sorrow by :-(. Other symbols represent other basic responses. True cyberians now dismiss such typographical fancies. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Being <i>pass&eacute; </i>on the Internet is a hideous offence, as socially ghastly as speaking with the wrong accent at the Ritz. To help the <i>parvenu</i> (or "newbie") avoid "flaming"--insults and attack--a whole collection of books offer advice on "netiquette". So vast has the industry become that anthropologists such as Steve Mizrach, of the University of Florida College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, are writing theses on the "sociolinguistics of electronic mail", exploring the proposition that "social power is linguistic power in virtual communities." Or, to put it another way, if you write clearly, people will take more notice of what you say--even in cyberspace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To foster such clarity <i>Wired</i>, a magazine much read by the <i>digerati</i>, recently produced its own style guide, grandly called "Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age". It is rather odd, therefore, that the guide seems notably uninterested in being comprehensible to those whose first language is not English--or, indeed, to some of us who had thought that English was our mother tongue. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, in a chapter called "Screw the Rules", the <i>Wired</i> guide offers this exemplary gem from its pages:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On August 17, Mike Nelson, the government's point person on encryption, stepped up to the podium at a workshop . . . and proceeded to blow smoke up the ass of more than 100 crypto wonks.
Constance Hale, the guide's editor, explains: "I would be very cautious about accessibility being our first requirement, because it seems to me that you then wash out some of the most lively language." <br>
</p><p><b><b>A new Latin</b></b><br>
But in spite of the best efforts of the geeks to give English "freedom from the shackles of grammar" (as the <i>Wired</i> press release promises), the development of the Internet will be one more fillip to the development of English as a world language. Mr Crystal, whose book on English as a global language will soon be published by Cambridge University Press, argues that something unprecedented is occurring. "There has never been a language spoken by so many people in so many places" as English, he says. The result will soon be something even more extraordinary: a language spoken by more people as a second tongue than a first. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, the United States contains four times as many English mother-tongue speakers as any other country. Britain is next. Between them, these two have 70% of the 320m people whose first language is English. That number excludes another 57m who speak creole, or creolised English, in countries such as the Gambia, Liberia and Jamaica. But far more rapid growth is taking place in the number of people who speak English as a subsidiary language. Within a decade, their numbers will exceed the number of mother-tongue speakers. Peter Strevens, a Cambridge don who wrote about the rise of world English, predicted a time when "English will be taught mostly by non-native speakers of the language, to non-native speakers, in order to communicate mainly with non-native speakers."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is an extraordinary state of affairs. Carl Mills, professor of English at the University of Cincinnati, says nervously: "It will be the first time in the history of the world that the language is not ours any more. If a language is no longer the property of its native speakers, it will change, and it's not clear what the consequences will be." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The change, Mr Crystal points out, has occurred only since the 1960s. But the foundations of the growth of English as a world language were laid earlier, with Britain's expansion as a world power, peaking towards the end of the 19th century, and the emergence of the United States as the leading power of the 20th century. America's commercial dominance has, in the latter years of the century, been built partly on products that incorporate the English language. It is easily the world's biggest exporter of intellectual property--ranging from the conventionally intellectual, such as Miller and Mailer, through the less conventional Madonna, to digital Microsoft.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the 1950s, the number of countries in the world has tripled. Most newly independent countries have given English a special role, making it the dominant or official language in over 60 countries. Of course, the English is not always of the queen's variety. "Don't leave your values in the trolley," exhorts a sticker in a Hong Kong supermarket. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, Mr Crystal lists 75 countries where, on a rather broader definition, English is "routinely in evidence, publicly accessible in varying degrees, and part of the nation's recent or present identity." Their combined population would now be two billion--more than a third of the world's population--routinely exposed, at least in theory, to the English language. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His list includes none of the countries of continental Europe, where learning English has become as much the proper prelude to a professional career as learning to play the piano was for a Jane Austen heroine. Bernabe Feria of Berlitz International, the world's largest language school, says that 70% of the 5m lessons that Berlitz gives each year are for English, compared with between 5% and 7% for French and slightly fewer for Spanish. In Europe, French is the second most popular language; in the United States, Spanish; in Asia, Japanese. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Winner take all</b></b><br>
The demand to learn English may be only in its infancy. For a growing share of world trade will be goods and services that incorporate language--maybe just on the packaging or in the instruction leaflet, but also in the form of entertainment and information. Standardising on English is a safety measure (which is why it is virtually the universal language of air-traffic control); but it also makes communications easier and cheaper. Like falling telephone tariffs and lower transport costs, it will create a virtuous circle: communication becomes less expensive, so more of it occurs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of it will be between computers. Already 80% of the information stored in the world's computers is in English. On the Internet, English is dominant, although exactly how dominant is hard to quantify. Mr Crystal has tried searching for a variety of words for one thing--"orchestra", say--in different languages. The research suggests that, for scientific subjects, almost all material on the Internet is in English; in all, the proportion is around 70-80%. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the understandable upshot of the fact that most Internet hosts and users are in the United States. "The proportion of native English-speakers on the Internet is dropping very rapidly," Stanford's Mr Nunberg points out. People are finding ways to overcome the difficulty of sending and receiving accented characters--Norwegians, for instance, have standardised on using OO as a substitute for their character O/--and non-Roman characters. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big question is: as the proportion of Internet users who are not native English-speakers rises, will they make disproportionate use of English? If so, then the Internet will further drive the spread of the English language, and perhaps incidentally create a large new category of users: those who can write the language colloquially, but not necessarily speak it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What might hinder the spread? One obstacle could be the emergence of some other potentially global language. But even Spanish, which Mr Crystal reckons is the world's fastest-growing language, is still used by far fewer people than English. The lead that English has already established is probably too great to be challenged. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another possibility is machine translation. If it were reliable, then English as a world language would not be needed. Geoffrey Kingscott, editor of <i>Language International</i>, a magazine for translators and other language professionals, argues that the problem is the ambiguity of much language. He cites a sign at London's Heathrow Airport: "No electric passenger carrying vehicles beyond this point."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Machine translation may be better than nothing, but it calls for a highly restricted use of language, with limited use of subordinate clauses and no word used with more than one meaning--for instance, "replace" must always mean either "put back" or "substitute" but not both. Such rigour may be too much to ask of most native-speaking writers of electronic mail, and certainly the contributors to <i>Wired</i>. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a serious competitor, linguistic or mechanical, English may now be impregnably established as the world standard language: an intrinsic part of the global communications revolution. If so, what are the consequences for other languages--and for their users?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far as the Internet is concerned, its main impact is likely to be to protect subsidiary languages, rather than to kill them. In that sense, it is unlike radio and television. For one thing, the limitless space on the Internet means that languages do not compete in the head-on way they do in other media. A Danish rock festival can advertise itself on the World Wide Web in English, German and Swedish--but it can also tout its wares in Danish. Moreover, languages with few speakers may gain in other ways, says Stanford's Mr Nunberg:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In half an hour's wandering around the Net the other day I found discussion groups in more than 60 languages, at which point I stopped counting. The Italians were talking about . . . elections, as they always are. The French people were exchanging dirty jokes. The Indonesians as best I could tell were arguing over whether the movie "True Lies" was anti-Islam or merely stupid . . . If you give people the chance, they are less interested in turning the Net into a world forum than a backyard fence.
On his cyber-wanderings, Mr Nunberg also discovered that discussions were going on in Aragonese, Armenian, Basque, Breton, Cambodian, Catalan, Esperanto, Estonian, Gaelic, Galician, Hindi, Hmong, Macedonian, Swahili, Welsh and Yoruba--and so on and on. The Internet may be just the thing for people separated from their esoteric and exotic linguistic roots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, increasingly, people will have two languages: one for doing the shopping and talking to their friends, the other for communicating with the formal world. That language will be English. As Robert Frank and Philip Cook argue in "The Winner-Take-All Society", published in 1995 by the Free Press, that will give the English-speaking countries an advantage in attracting and keeping the world's professionals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will be true not only for the United States and Britain, but for developing countries too. The Philippines, one of the largest English-speaking (or, rather, American-speaking) countries, hopes to exploit that advantage, together with high literacy and a deregulated telephone service, to become a media centre. India and Jamaica both use their familiarity with English to sell data-processing services to rich countries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who are lucky enough to grow up speaking English will have a career advantage in big multinational companies. Provided, that is, the future non-native speakers of English can understand them. <br>
