<P>The Physicians for Mercy released these guidelines which they believe should become an accepted standard of care for physicians aiding in the suicide of terminally ill patients. According to the guidelines, assisted suicide should be provided only by an "obitiatrist," (a medical specialty not yet recognized) and no fee should be charged for the service. Dr. Jack Kevorkian is a member of this Michigan-based group.</P>

<H3>Physicians for Mercy</H3>

<H4>Approved Guidelines for Patholysis (Medically-Assisted Suicide)</H4>

<P>1. The request for patholysis must be made voluntarily by the patient.</P>

<P>2. The request must be in writing, dated, and signed by the patient and by any physician involved in the request, as well as signed by two competent adults as witnesses having no financial relationship with the patient and no financial interest in the patient's life or death. The signatures of the witnesses must be notarized.</P>

<P>3. The request thus validated is to be forwarded to a qualified obitiatrist who will refer the patient for medical consultation to:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>a specialist dealing with the patient's specific affliction
<LI>a specialist in pain management (if pain is a major factor)
<LI>a psychiatrist (in every case)
</UL>

<P>4. The above consultations must verify the patient's mental competence with regard to making an independent informed decision, and verify that the affliction is incurable, that the agony cannot be relieved or controlled, and/or that the side effects of pain management or medical therapy are intolerable for the patient.</P>

<P>5. Completed reports of all consultations must conform to current medical standards.  The reports are to be sent to the obitiatrist, or with the requesting physician, or with another physician designated by the patient.</P>

<P>6. The time and site of the final patholytic procedure are to be decided solely by the patient.  This decision must be made within three weeks after review of the consultation reports; the decision must be documented as an informed consent in writing, dated, timed, and signed by the patient under conditions set forth in paragraph two (2) above.</P>

<P>7. The final patholytic procedure must be performed within seventy-two (72) hours of the time of signing of the informed consent, but no sooner than twenty four (24) hours from the date of such signing.</P>

<P>8. This entire process from the initial request to the final patholytic procedure shall be constantly under the control of the patient who may stop it at any time.</P>

<P>9. Every physician involved at any time in the entire process delineated herein (except the obitiatrist) may be present to observe or console, but will not participate actively in the final procedure of patholysis.</P>

<P>10. The final action is to be performed only by an obitiatrist and there will be no professional fee for the service.</P>

<H3>Justice Thomas on 'Heroes and Victims'</H3>

<H4>Legal Times</H4>

<P>Clarence Thomas may keep a lower profile than many of his colleagues on the Supreme Court bench. But when he does speak out, he almost always makes an impact. That was the case late last month, when Thomas made headlines with a speech excoriating what he termed "the modern ideology of victimhood." </P>

<P>In his remarks, delivered to the Federalist Society's Ninth Annual Lawyers Convention, Thomas criticized contemporary society for exalting victims -- in not only the political realm, but in the courts as well. He marveled at the breadth and depth of the victim mentality, finding irony in the white men today who, "preoccupied with oppression," have "fallen prey to the very aspects of the modern ideology of victimology that they deplore." And, sounding a classic conservative theme, Thomas concluded that "the idea that government can be the primary instrument for the elimination of misfortune is a fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition." </P>

<P>The full text of Thomas' speech, delivered Sept. 22 in Washington, D.C., follows. It is reprinted with permission. </P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>I would like thank my friends here at the Federalist Society for once again inviting me to be a part of an important and timely conference. And I would like to begin by returning to a topic I touched upon in my last speech at a conference co-sponsored by this organization: personal responsibility. It says something about the current state of affairs in our society that a conference on victims -- that is, a conference on the rise of the practice of blaming circumstances for one's situation rather than taking responsibility for changing things for the better -- is even necessary. </P>

<P>As many of you have heard me say before, the very notion of submitting to one's circumstances was unthinkable in the household in which I was raised. The mere suggestion that difficult circumstances could prevail over individual effort would evoke a response that my brother and I could lip-sync on cue: "Old man 'can't' is dead; I helped bury him." Or, another favorite response: "Where there is a will, there is a way." Under this philosophy -- the essential truth of which we all recognize in our hearts -- victims have no refuge. </P>

<P>It may have seemed harsh at the time to be told that failure was one's own fault. Indeed, there may have been many circumstances beyond our control. But there was much that my family and my community did to reinforce this message of self-determination and self-worth, thereby inoculating us against the victim plague that was highly contagious in the hot, humid climate of segregation.</P>

<P>What has become clear to me over the years, as I have witnessed the transformation of our society into one based upon victims rather than heroes, is that there is a more positive message to be gained from adversity: Success (as well as failure) is the result of one's own talents, morals, decisions, and actions. Accepting personal responsibility for victory as well as for defeat is as liberating and empowering as it is unpopular today. Overcoming adversity not only gives us our measure as individuals, but it also reinforces those basic principles and rules without which a society based upon freedom and liberty cannot function. </P>

<P>In those years of my youth, there was a deep appreciation of heroes and heroic virtue. Art, literature, and even popular culture (unlike today) often focused on people who demonstrated heroic virtues -- courage, persistence, discipline, hard work, humility, triumph in the face of adversity, just to mention a few. These building blocks of self-reliance were replicated and reinforced at home, school, and church. The "rags to riches" Horatio Alger stories were powerful messages of hope and inspiration to those struggling for a better life. And many of us used to read and dream about heroes -- not to mention our favorite television heroes, something perhaps unbelievable these days. I am certain that many of you who attended grammar school in the 1950s or earlier probably remember reading a favorite account of the integrity and work ethic of George Washington, or of Abraham Lincoln, or of George Washington Carver, or even of some baseball or football legend. It seemed that we all had heroes (not role models, a term of far more recent vintage). Indeed, it would have been odd for a child of several decades ago not to have had a hero. </P>

<P>But today, our culture is far less likely to raise up heroes than it is to exalt victims -- individuals who are overcome by the sting of oppression, injustice, adversity, neglect, or misfortune. Today, victims of discrimination, racism, poverty, sickness, and societal neglect abound in the popular press. Today, there are few (if any) heroes. Often, it seems that those who have succumbed to their circumstances are more likely to be singled out than those who have overcome them. </P>

<P>What caused this cultural shift -- from an emphasis on heroes to a preoccupation with victims? Why are there more victims and virtually no heroes recognized today? Why in years past was there much less of an emphasis on victimage? </P>

<P>I think two things contributed to this change in the state of affairs. The first is that our political and legal systems now actively encourage people to claim victim status and to make demands on society for reparations and recompense. The second is that our culture actually seeks to denigrate or deconstruct heroes. Why would a civilized society travel down two such destructive paths? Why has it become no more admirable to rise valiantly above one's circumstances than it is to submit to them -- all the while aggressively transferring responsibility for one's condition to others? </P>

<P>Let's begin with our political and legal systems -- how have they contributed to this state of affairs? The classical conception was that government and the law were meant to ensure freedom and equality of opportunity by giving people the most room possible for self-provision and self-determination. James Madison made this point in The Federalist Papers when he observed that the "protection" of the "diversity of faculties in men" was the "first object" of government. And, in more recent times, the great political economist Friedrich von Hayek -- who witnessed totalitarianism first-hand -- made a similar point when he observed that "the chief aim of freedom is to provide both the opportunity and the inducement to insure the maximum use of the knowledge that an individual can acquire." </P>

<P>Between the New Deal and the 1960s, a far different view began to hold sway -- namely, that the role of the state was to eliminate want, suffering, and adversity. Freedom was no longer simply a right to self-provision and self-determination, but was instead a right to make demands on government and society for one's well-being and happiness. That is the import of Franklin Roosevelt's "Citizen Bill of Rights," which spoke of freedom from want -- rights to minimum income, housing, and other "adequate protections from economic fears." And, I think it is axiomatic that the call for such new rights (if not claims) became ever more prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s. </P>

<P>No doubt, this gradual transformation in ideas took root and flourished (at least in part) because of the aggregate growth in wealth and resources we were witnessing in this country during the course of the 20th century. Against the background of this prosperity, poverty stood out in bold relief and in uncomfortably stark contrast -- even as the number of people suffering from it shrank. It is not surprising that people began to think that, in a world of seemingly unlimited resources, adversity could be eliminated, or, at the very least, remedied. The ideal of the "benevolent state" took hold. In our "enlightened" society, neglect, misfortune, and injustice did not have to be accepted as inevitable facts of life. Good government and laws could step in when necessary, as many believed they had successfully done during two World Wars, the Great Depression, and the civil rights movement. </P>

<P>If one assumes that suffering and adversity can be eliminated, but sees a number of people continuing to suffer from adversity or misfortune, then there must be some forces in society that relegate the "have nots" to this fate. Or, at the very least, the less fortunate are being ignored. Those facing adversity, hence, are victims of a society that is not doing as much as it could (if it so desired), and these victims can (and should) stake a legitimate claim against the political and legal systems for recompense. In this view, neglect or selfishness on the part of society and government is responsible for the sting of oppression, injustice, and misfortune that the unfortunate and "have nots" feel today. </P>

<P>In light of this modern ideology, is it any surprise that people identify themselves as victims and make demands on the political systems for special status and entitlements? Our culture expects (and, indeed, encourages) people to do exactly that. Consider, for example, the creation and continued expansion of the welfare state and other social programs in this country. How often have we heard proponents of these programs lull the poor into thinking that they are hopeless victims, incapable of triumphing over adversity without "benevolent intervention" by the state? How often have we heard these proponents encouraging the less fortunate in our society to become indignant about their situation in life and more demanding on the political system to find solution to their problems? </P>

<P>It is not only in the political system, though, that we see our society and its leaders succumbing to the modern ideology of victimhood. As with the political system, people today also are strongly encouraged to make demands on the legal system by claiming victim status. Indeed, the legal system has, in many ways, become a significant driving force behind the modern ideology of victimhood. Courts are viewed as an effective means of forcing (or at least pressuring) political institutions into meeting demands for protected status and new rights or entitlements. </P>

<P>Pointing to perceived "victimization" by "the system" or by others in society, our legal culture has often told the least fortunate in our society that their last hope is to claim special legal rights and benefits, or to seek exoneration for the harmful, criminal consequences of their acts. The least fortunate are encouraged to turn to legal arguments that admit defeat and that challenge the moral authority of society. In these ways, courts are called upon to solve social problems -- by creating special rules, and by crafting remedies that will satisfy the claims and demands of victim groups but that do not apply to all of us. </P>

<P>Appealing to the legal system, though, was not as easy a task as making demands on the political system. Our legal system has traditionally required that redress for grievances only be granted after very exacting standards have been met. There had to be, for example, very distinct, individualized harm. And, the definition of harm was circumscribed by a traditional understanding of adjudication under the common law, where narrow disputes regarding traditional property rights were resolved among private parties who could not settle matters on their own. Very generalized claims of misfortune or oppression or neglect -- the kinds of assertions made in the political system -- would not easily fit into this common mold of court activity. It would not be enough for people to be indignant, angry, and demanding about their situation in life. There would have to be an assertion of a legal wrong and a persuasive argument that a legal remedy was available. </P>

<P>The pressure of victimology "revolutionized" -- and that word does not always have positive connotations -- the courts and the law. For those in our culture seeking to use the courts as agents of social change, poverty, unemployment, social deviancy, and criminal behavior were not just unfair conditions in our society that could be eliminated if only people or politicians cared. Instead, these abstract problems were personified as the direct actions of local schools, churches, businesses, and other social institutions so that they could be sued for causing individualized harm to the victims. Based on this new kind of harm -- a kind of legalistic understanding of "victimage" -- the courts were said to be obligated to recognize special rights and protected status under the law. </P>

<P>Take, for example, welfare rights and due process. Beginning with Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), our cases underscored the importance of welfare as a means of preventing social malaise, promoting the general welfare, and securing the blessings of liberty for all Americans. The rights to life, liberty, and property were, in effect, transformed from freedom from government interference into a right to welfare payments. There are countless other examples in legal literature and judicial opinions -- some have argued that inner city minorities and the poor should not be held responsible for the consequences of their criminal acts because of oppression and misfortune; and, of course, there is the debate now raging about preferences based on sex, race, and ethnicity. </P>

<P>This change in our political and legal systems has been accompanied by the rise of the "victim group." These groups are quite useful to public officials for building coalitions for future political support and legitimacy, as well. And, for the courts, "victim groups" provide useful justification or cover for energizing the legislative process, changing the legislative agenda, forcing reconsideration of spending priorities, and transforming public debate. </P>

<P>But the rise of victimhood, and its perpetuation by government and the law, is only part of the modern tragedy. There is also the dearth of heroes in our culture. Significantly, as the number of these "victim groups" has escalated, there has been a corresponding decline in the amount of attention that our culture has paid to heroes or, even worse, a conscious attempt to cheapen their achievements. Today, success or a commitment to fighting for noble ideas is attributed to self-interest, revenge, self-aggrandizement, insecurity, or some psychological idiosyncrasy. </P>

<P>Just thumb through recently published biographies in the library or bookstore -- in many of them, it is not a conscious effort to be virtuous or to do good, but instead a series of unforeseeable and external forces, that lead to greatness or success. And, in many of these biographies, we are introduced to the uncut, "never before seen" foibles, mistakes, and transgressions of people our culture idealized for centuries. The message: that these so-called heroes are really just regular people capable of folly and vice who happened to have a few good breaks. </P>

<P>In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville anticipated this state of affairs when he said: "Historians who live in democratic times do not only refuse to admit that some citizens may influence the destiny of a people, but also take away from the people themselves the faculty of modifying their own lot and make them depend on an inflexible providence or a kind of blind fatality." </P>

<P>Now, the problem these days is not that there are no people who should be singled out as heroes. Rather, as Daniel Boorstin suggests in his book, The Image, society is preoccupied with celebrities. And heroism and celebrity status are two very different things. The word "hero" refers to people of great strength, integrity, or courage who are recognized and admired for their accomplishments and achievements. The word "celebrity," on the other hand, refers to a condition -- the condition of being much talked about. It is a state of notoriety or famousness. As Boorstin says, "A celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness." Thus, while a hero is distinguished by his achievement, celebrities are created by the media and are simply a trademark. Celebrities are, in short, neither good nor bad -- they are just a big name. Publicity is the defining feature of a celebrity's existence, and, unlike a hero who will become greater as time passes, time destroys celebrities. Over time the glare of publicity, as Boorstin notes, melts away the celebrity by shedding light and heat on his vices and commonplaceness. </P>

<P>This pattern of ignoring and deconstructing heroes -- and focusing instead on the ephemeral celebrity who is known for his well-knownness rather than character or individual worth -- stems from the rise of radical egalitarianism. In the 1960s, many of the cultural elite saw a need to ensure absolute equality. On this view, differences in ability and level of achievement are random or uncontrolled; and to permit these characteristics to dictate human happiness and well-being would therefore be unfair. Celebrity status, in contrast, is not a problem for egalitarians, for as Boorstin notes, "anyone can become a celebrity, if only he can get into the news and stay there." Certainly, real achievement is not necessarily required. </P>

<P>It should surprise no one that our culture now has far less difficulty recognizing celebrities than it does those who achieve success as a result of personal effort and character traits that we traditionally would consider heroic. Denigrating heroic virtue -- in other words, chalking heroism up to circumstance -- fits quite well with the notion that we must all be the same and that there can be no significant differences in our achievement, social standing, or wealth. </P>

<P>Anyone can see what these intellectual currents have done to the ideals of human dignity, personal responsibility, and self-determination. Preoccupation with victim status has caused people to focus covetously on what they do not have in comparison to others, or on what has happened to them in the past. Many fail to see the freedom they do have and the talents and resources that are at their disposal. </P>

<P>Our culture today discourages, and even at times stifles, heroic virtues -- fortitude, character, courage, a sense of self-worth. For so many, the will, the spirit, and a firm sense of self-respect and self-worth have been suffocated. Many in today's society do not expect the less fortunate to accept responsibility for (and overcome) their present circumstances. Because they are given no chance to overcome their circumstances, they will not have the chance to savor the triumph over adversity. They are instead given the right to fret and complain, and are encouraged to avoid responsibility and self-help. This is a poor substitute for the empowering rewards of true victory over adversity. </P>

<P>One of my favorite memories of my grandfather is how he would walk slowly by the cornfield, admiring the fruits of his labor. I have often thought that just the sight of a tall stand of corn must have been more nourishing to his spirit than the corn itself was to his body. </P>

<P>But the culture of victimology -- with its emphasis on the so-called benevolent state -- delivers an additional (and perhaps worse) blow to dignity and self-worth. When the less fortunate do accomplish something, they are often denied the sense of achievement which is so very important for strengthening and empowering the human spirit. They owe all their achievements to the "anointed" in society who supposedly changed the circumstances -- not to their own efforts. </P>

<P>Long hours, hard work, discipline, and sacrifice are all irrelevant. In a world where the less fortunate are given special treatment and benefits -- and, significantly, where they are told that whatever gains or successes they have realized would not be possible without protected status and special benefits -- the so-called beneficiaries of state-sponsored benevolence are denied the opportunity to derive any sense of satisfaction from their hard work and self-help. There is not a one among us who views what others do for us the same way we view what we do for ourselves. No matter how much we appreciate the help, it is still just that -- help, not achievement. </P>

<P>It also bears noting that our culture's preoccupation with grouping victims has balkanized society. The "we/they" mentality of calling oneself a victim of society breeds social conflict and calls into question the moral authority of society. The idea that whole groups or classes are victims robs individuals of an independent spirit -- they are just moving along with the "herd" of other victims. Such individuals also lack any incentive to be independent, because they know that as part of an oppressed group they will neither be singled out for the life choices they make nor capable of distinguishing themselves by their own efforts. </P>

<P>As victim ideology flourishes and people are demoralized by its grip, more and more people begin to think that they must claim victim status to get anywhere in this world. Indeed, is it any surprise that anyone and everyone can claim to be a victim of something these days? In his book The Abuse Excuse, Alan Dershowitz criticizes countless examples of conditions that "victimize" people and thereby release them from responsibility for their actions. Here are just a few examples: </P>

<P>x The "black rage defense," which asserts that blacks who are constantly subjected to oppression and racial injustice will become uncontrollably violent; </P>

<P>x "Urban survival syndrome," which claims that violent living conditions justify acts of aggression in the community; </P>

<P>x "Self-victimization syndrome," which maintains that people become less productive and creative, and become severely depressed, as a result of societal neglect and discrimination. </P>

<P>Most significantly, there is the backlash against affirmative action by "angry white males." I do not question a person's belief that affirmative action is unjust because it judges people based on their sex or the color of their skin. But something far more insidious is afoot. For some white men, preoccupation with oppression has become the defining feature of their existence. They have fallen prey to the very aspects of the modern ideology of victimology that they deplore. </P>

<P>Some critics of affirmative action, for example, fault today's civil rights movement for demanding equality yet supporting policies that discriminate based on race. These critics expect the intended beneficiaries of the civil rights regime to break away from the ideology of victimhood: to cherish freedom, to accept responsibility, and, where necessary, to demonstrate fortitude in the face of unfairness. </P>

<P>I do not quarrel with this. But these critics should hold themselves to the same standards, resisting the temptation to allow resentment over what they consider reverse discrimination to take hold of their lives and to get the best of them. They must remember that if we are to play the victim game, the very people they decry have the better claim to victim status. </P>

<P>Of course, de-emphasizing heroism exacerbates all these problems. Human beings have always faced the temptation to permit adversity or hate to dominate and destroy their lives. To counter this tendency, society had heroes -- people capable of overcoming the very adversity or injustice that currently affects today's victims. They rose above their circumstances and inherent imperfections. Heroes cherished freedom, and tried to accomplish much with what little they had. Heroes demonstrated perseverance in the face of adversity and used hardship as a means to strive for greater virtue. And heroes accepted responsibility -- they did what they did despite fear and temptation, and tried to do the right thing when presented with a choice between good and evil. It is awfully hard for society to inculcate these values without some useful models from the past and present. </P>

<P>I may not have realized it as a child, but my grandfather was a hero who had a tremendous impact on my life. He certainly would not be a celebrity by today's standards. Though barely able to read and saddled with the burdens of segregation, he worked hard to provide for his family. He was a deeply religious man who lived by the Christian virtues. He was a man who believed in responsibility and self-help. And though this could not bring him freedom in a segregated society, it at least gave him independence from its daily demeaning clutches. </P>

<P>In all the years I spent in my grandparents' house, I never heard them complain that they were victims. Now, they did not like segregation or think that it was right. In fact, there was no question that it was immoral and that anyone who promoted it was morally reprehensible. But there was work to be done. I assure you that I did not enjoy the demands he placed on us. I saw no value in rising with the chicken, and, unlike him, I was not obsessed with what I will call the "reverse Dracula syndrome": that is, fear that the rising sun would catch me in bed. </P>

<P>It would not be until I was exposed to the most fortunate and best educated in our society that I would be informed that all this time I had been a victim. I am sure you can imagine what it was like when I returned home to Savannah, and informed my grandparents that with the education I had received because of their tremendous foresight and sacrifice, I had discovered our oppressed and victimized status in society. Needless to say, relations were quite strained and our vacation visits were somewhat difficult. My grandfather was no victim and he didn't send me to school to become one. </P>

<P>There are many people like my grandfather alive today. The cultural elite does not honor them as the heroes they are, but instead views them as people who are sadly ignorant of their victim status or who have forgotten where they came from. Our social institutions do not train today's young to view such people as heroes and do not urge them to emulate their virtues. </P>

<P>In idealizing heroic virtue and criticizing the victim ideology of our day, I am not saying that society is free from intractable and very saddening injustice and harm. That would not be true. But the idea that government can be the primary instrument for the elimination of misfortune is a fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition. There has always been bad and suffering in the world, and we must admit that wrongs have been and will continue to be committed. People will always be treated unfairly --  we can never eliminate oppression or adversity completely, though we can and should fight injustice as best we can. </P>

<P>But keep in mind that all of us are easily tempted to think of ourselves as victims and thereby permit adversity to be the defining feature of our lives. In so doing, we deny the very attributes that are at the core of human dignity -- freedom of will, the capacity to choose between good and bad, and the ability to endure adversity and to use it for gain. Victimhood destroys the human spirit. </P>

<P>I also am not saying that we should expect everyone to be a hero all of the time. We humans are weak by our very nature; all of us at times will permit hardship to get the very best of us. But having a set of norms to guide us and to push us along -- the stuff of heroes -- can be a source of great strength. If we do not have a society that honors people who make the right choices in the face of adversity -- and reject the bad choices -- far fewer people will make the right choices. Ultimately, without a celebration of heroic virtue, we throw ourselves into the current state of affairs, where man is a passive victim incapable of triumphing over adversity and where aggression, resentment, envy, and other vice thwart progress and true happiness. </P>

<P>What I am saying is that it requires the leadership of heroes and the best efforts of all to advance civilization and to ensure that its people follow the path of virtue. And, because of the role law has played in perpetuating victim ideology and because of the influence law can have in teaching people about right and wrong, lawyers have a special obligation here. We should seek to pare back the victimology that pervades our law, and thereby encourage a new generation of heroes to flourish. </P>

<P>I am reminded of what Saint Thomas Kempis wrote more than 500 years ago about the human spirit. His standard is a useful one for thinking about the instruction that our law should be offering: "Take care to ensure that in every place, action, and outward occupation you remain inwardly free and your own master. Control circumstances, and do not allow them to control you. Only so can you be a master and ruler of your actions, not their servant or slave; a free man. . . ." </P>

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

ORENSTEIN, United States Magistrate Judge  
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Plaintiff Eclipse Enterprises, Inc. ("Eclipse") challenges the 
constitutionality of Nassau County Local Law Number 11-1992 
which makes it a Class A misdemeanor to sell to minors trading 
cards which depict a "heinous crime, an element of a heinous 
crime, or a heinous criminal and which is harmful to minors." 
(Local Law 11- 1992 is attached herein as an appendix to the 
Report and Recommendation). Plaintiff publishes "True Crime" 
trading cards, and other sets of trading cards similar in kind 
which are targeted by the ordinance. Defendant County of 
Nassau ("County") asserts that the ordinance is an appropriate 
exercise of its power to protect the welfare of children.[fn 1]  
 
District Judge Arthur Spatt referred the matter to this Court to 
conduct an evidentiary hearing and to report and recommend its 
findings. A hearing was conducted on March 23 and 28, April 7, 
and May 23, 1994. This Court was requested inter alia to report 
and recommend whether 1) Nassau County Local Law Number 
11-1992 ("the law" or "law") violates the First Amendment or is 
the least restrictive means to further the County's interest in 
providing for the well-being of minors; and 2) whether the types 
of trading cards prohibited by the statute are "harmful to 
minors" as defined in the statute.  
 
As a content-based restriction, the Law is subject to the strictest 
First Amendment scrutiny. For the reasons set forth below, this 
Court reports and recommends that Nassau County Local Law 
Number 11-1992 is 1) an unconstitutional restraint of free 
speech in that it is not narrowly tailored to further the 
ordinance's stated purpose; 2) is overbroad and 3) is void for 
vagueness. The Court further finds that no definitive evidence 
was presented at the hearing from which this Court could 
conclude that the type of trading cards at issue are "harmful to 
minors" as defined in the statute. Moreover, Defendant failed to 
present evidence to support its claimed connection between the 
trading cards in question and the commission of or increase in 
juvenile crime, or that the cards impair the "ethical and moral 
development of youth."  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
The stated purpose of Local Law 11-1992 is to protect the 
welfare of children generally, and 1) prevent juvenile crime and 
2) ensure the proper moral and ethical development of county 
youth specifically. Local Law 11-1992 Section 1. The 
substantive portion then attempts to execute its intent by 
criminalizing the sale of trading cards containing depictions of 
violence and criminals to children under the age of seventeen.  
 
The Legislative Intent section of Local Law 11-1992 provides in 
pertinent part:  
 
"The Board of Supervisors finds that in light of their limited 
experience, education and emotional development, children 
under the age of seventeen are impressionable and susceptible to 
the influence of violence and criminal conduct in our society. 
The dissemination of materials devoted to the depiction of 
heinous crimes and heinous criminals is a contributing factor to 
juvenile crime, a basic factor in impairing the ethical and moral 
development of our youth and a clear and present danger to the 
citizens of Nassau County."  
 
Section 1, Law 11-1992. 
 
1. Protected Speech 
 
The ordinance prohibits the sale of trading cards which depict 
heinous crimes or heinous criminals and are harmful to children. 
Local Law 11-1992 Section 3. The ordinance explicitly defines 
"heinous crime" as murder, assault, kidnapping, arson, burglary, 
robbery, rape or other sexual offenses. Local Law 11-1992 
Section 2(C). A "heinous criminal" is defined as one who has 
been found guilty of committing a heinous crime. Local Law 
11-1992 Section 2(D).  
 
Speech which contains depictions of crime or violence is not 
considered "obscene" and is thus accorded the protection of the 
First Amendment. See Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 508 
(1948) (holding magazines and other written material depicting 
stories of bloodshed, lust, or crime protected under the First 
Amendment); Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Webster, 968 F. 
2d 684, 688 (8th Cir. 1992) (video cassettes depicting violence 
protected under the First Amendment); American Booksellers 
Ass'n., Inc. v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 330 (7th Cir. 1985) 
(television violence is protected speech), aff'd, 475 U.S. 1001 
(1986); Sovereign News Co. v. Falke, 448 F. Supp. 306, 394 
(N.D. Ohio 1977) (violent material given the highest degree of 
First Amendment protection).  
 
Plaintiff's products, and trading cards by other manufacturers, 
are sets of cards which digest various topical material. Some 
contain depictions of violence or of persons who committed 
crimes of violence. One set of cards, True Crime (Plaintiff's 
Exhibit, hereinafter "Pl. Ex." 10), comprises cards that create an 
encyclopedic history of infamous criminals. However, not all 
sets of cards focus on violent individuals or activity. Coup 
D'etat (Pl. Ex. 3), published by the plaintiff, is a set of cards 
which discusses the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
The individual cards which discuss the shooting of the 
President, Officer Tippit, and Lee Harvey Oswald contain 
depictions of "heinous crimes" as defined in the statute. 
Similarly, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union (from Lenin to 
Yeltsin), contains a comprehensive introduction to the history of 
the Soviet Union (Pl. Ex. 6). One card in the set discusses the 
murder of the Czar and his family, another, the wholesale 
murder of millions in the Stalinist "purges" of the early 1930's. 
The set Foul Ball (Baseball's Greatest Scandals, Scoundrels and 
Screw-ups), (Pl. Ex. 28), contains a card which discusses Ty 
Cobb's violent assault on a spectator, and another card which 
digests a former major league catcher's violent bat-wielding 
assault on a former major league pitcher during their active 
playing days. Inspection of the sets reveals that only some of the 
cards fall within the purview of the law.  
 
Nevertheless, the County relies upon the Local Law's legislative 
intent of protecting the physical and psychological well-being of 
minors. (Defendant's Post-hearing Memorandum of Law, 
hereinafter "Def. Mem. of Law" at 1.) The County argues that 
Local Law 11-1992 is an appropriate exercise to "shield minors 
from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult 
standards." (Id. at 1-2.)  
 
There is no doubt that the protection of the physical and 
psychological well-being of minors is a compelling 
governmental interest, and that the government may 
constitutionally regulate protected speech in order to promote 
such an interest. Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. 
F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989) (citing Ginsberg v. New York, 
390 U.S. 629, 639-40 (1968)); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 
747, 756-57 (1982). In furtherance of their goal, the government 
may adopt more stringent controls on what communicative 
material is available to minors as opposed to adults. Erznoznik 
v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212 (1975). Minors are 
entitled to significant First Amendment protection. Therefore, 
the government's ability to prohibit public dissemination of 
protected materials is limited to "relatively narrow and well-
defined circumstances." Id. at 212-13. To withstand 
constitutional scrutiny, the government must act by narrowly 
drawn regulations designed to serve those interests without 
unnecessarily interfering with a minor's First Amendment 
freedoms. Sable 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Schaumburg v. Citizens 
for a setter Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980) (citations 
omitted)). Even in the context of regulating a minor's access to 
sexually oriented materials, the Supreme Court has held that 
"speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some 
other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to 
protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body 
thinks is unsuitable for them." Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 213-14.  
 
2. Content-Based Ordinance 
 
Laws that "by their terms distinguish favored speech from 
disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed 
are content-based." Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. F.C.C., 
114 S. Ct. 2445, 2459 (1994). Regulations which attempt to 
control expression on the basis of content are presumptively 
invalid. Simon & Schuster v. N.Y. Crime Victims Board, -- U.S. 
--, 112 S. Ct. 501, 508 (1991); Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 
641, 648-49 (1984). The danger of such regulations is that 
government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints 
from the marketplace based solely on disagreement with the 
message conveyed. Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. at 508. The 
Supreme Court has repeatedly warned against prohibiting 
expression simply because society finds the idea offensive or 
disagreeable. See, e.q., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 
(1989); Hustler Magazine Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 55 
(1988) ("the fact that society may find speech offensive is not a 
sufficient reason for suppressing it.").  
 
Local Law 11-1992 is clearly content-based. It prohibits the sale 
to minors of trading cards depicting violent acts, while allowing 
athletic and other topical cards to be sold. As a content-based 
restriction, the Law is subject to the highest First Amendment 
scrutiny. Defendant must prove that the regulation is narrowly 
tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest without 
unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms. Perry 
Educ. Ass'n. v. Perry Local Educ. Ass'n., 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983) 
. Additionally, the government must choose the least restrictive 
means to further the articulated interest. Sable Communications, 
492 U.S. at 126. The government must demonstrate that the 
"ordinance 'does not burden substantially more speech than is 
necessary to further the government's legitimate interests. 
Turner Broadcasting, 114 S. Ct. at 2470 (quoting Ward v. Rock 
Against Racism, 491 U.S. 791, 799 (1989) .  
 
3. Narrowly Tailored 
 
No empirical evidence, beyond mere speculation or conjecture, 
was presented at the hearing from which the Court could find 
any causal connection between the sale to minors of this genre 
of trading cards and juvenile crime or that such sale impairs the 
ethical or moral development of minors.  
 
The government has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating 
that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to achieve or serve its 
stated compelling interest. See Turner Broadcasting, 114 S. Ct. 
at 2470; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; Perry, 460 U.S. at 45. 
Legislative bodies are not required to draft legislation with 
scientific certainty. Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 642-
43 (1968) (citing Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U.S. 104, 
110 (1911)). However, even in the context of commercial 
speech, with its attendant lower "rational relation" standard, the 
Supreme Court requires the governmental body seeking to 
sustain a restriction on protected speech to demonstrate that the 
restriction directly advances the state interest involved. 
Edenfield v. Fane, 113 S. Ct. 1792, 1800 (1993) (citing Central 
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New 
York, 447 U.S. 557, 564 (1980)). "The regulation may not be 
sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the 
government's purpose." Id. The government's burden is not 
satisfied by "mere speculation or conjecture," Edenfield, 113 
S.Ct. at 1800, and must do more than simply "'posit the 
existence of the disease sought to be cured. Turner Broadcasting 
Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2470 (1994) (quoting 
Quincy Cable Television, Inc. v. F.C.C., 768 F. 2d 1434, 1455 
(D.C. Cir. 1985)). In Edenfield, the Supreme Court noted the 
lack of any studies, empirical data, or anecdotal evidence 
indicating a connection between the government's stated 
interests and the restriction on protected speech. 113 S. Ct. at 
1800-01.  
 
In the instant case the evidence presented by Nassau County is 
similarly weak and insufficient to justify the broad restriction. 
The Local Law concludes that the dissemination of 
communications about heinous crimes or heinous criminals "is a 
contributing factor to juvenile crime, [and] a basic factor in 
impairing the ethical and moral development of [county] youth. 
Local Law 11-1992 Section 1. At the hearing, a member of the 
county legislature testified that in passing the ordinance, the 
Board had no evidence that any crime had been linked to the 
reading of a trading card depicting heinous crimes or criminals. 
(Hearing Transcript, hereinafter "Tr." at 4:73-74.)[fn 2] 
Moreover, the same witness testified that the Board did not 
consult any mental health professionals with respect to the effect 
on minors of this genre of trading cards. (Tr. at 4:74.) In fact, 
the witness testified that the County's conclusion that trading 
cards which depict crimes or criminals are a contributing factor 
to juvenile crime was based solely upon "surmise." (Tr. at 4:83-
85.)  
 
Defendant's witnesses testified that no study, scientific or 
otherwise, has ever been conducted to examine whether trading 
cards which depict crime or criminals affect minors. (Tr. at 
1:58; 1:197.) Much testimony focused upon the effect of 
violence in the media on minors. Most studies have specifically 
addressed violence on television and not violence in literature. 
Yet, television or videos and films combine the senses of sight 
and hearing. Trading cards are merely speech, or involve the 
sense of sight.  
 
Even assuming that the studies on violence in the media are 
analogous to trading cards, evidence of a causal relationship is 
contradictory and inconclusive. See Stephen J. Kim, Viewer 
Discretion Advised: A Structural Approach To The Issue Of 
Televised Violence, 142 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1383, 1383-85 (1994) 
(noting the various conflicting studies and debates regarding the 
effects of violence in television on society). The only obvious 
conclusion to be drawn is the clear difference of opinion over 
this sensitive issue. Accordingly, little in the testimony and 
exhibits justifies the regulation of the protected speech herein.  
 
In addition, the County fails to offer any justification for a 
distinction between trading cards and other forms of 
communication that depict violence in furthering its interest of 
preventing juvenile crime and protecting the welfare of minors. 
See Simon & Shuster, 112 S. Ct. at 510 (no justification offered 
for distinction between regulating profits of criminals from 
books and other assets). Books, magazines, and other forms of 
media contain depictions of the very same crimes and criminals 
as the trading cards at issue. Plaintiff demonstrated that 
hundreds of such books are available to minors in the County's 
schools and public libraries. (Pl. Exs. 24, 25.)  
 
Defendant urges that Local Law 11-1992 is narrowly tailored 
because its language is specific and contains strict definitions, in 
contrast to the ordinance in Video Software Dealers Ass'n. v. 
Webster, 968 F. 2d 684 (8th Cir. 1992). (Def. Mem. at 5.) The 
Court agrees that Webster is distinguishable in this respect. In 
Webster the court relied primarily on the failure of Missouri's 
statute to define the type of violence at issue. Here, however, the 
Court draws its conclusions not from the County's failure to 
clearly define the type of communication which is banned, but 
from the utter failure of the County to demonstrate that the 
restrictions placed on the First Amendment are in any way 
tailored to attain the compelling interest sought to be achieved. 
The statute unnecessarily infringes on freedom of expression. 
See Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  
 
4. Overbreadth 
 
Under the law, heinous crime has been defined as "murder, 
assault, kidnapping, arson, burglary, robbery or other sexual 
offenses." Local Law 11-1992 Section 2. Plaintiff argues that 
the law is overbroad and sweeps within its prohibition virtually 
all discussion of history, politics, and current events. (Pl. Mem. 
at 16-17.) Defendant argues that the overbreadth doctrine must 
be employed only as a last resort. (Def. Mem. at 6). The County 
further argues that in any event, the statute's clearly defined 
terms prevent application of the ordinance in an overbroad 
manner. (Id. at 6-7.)  
 
However, based upon the testimony of Defendant's own experts, 
it is clear that the Local Law's comprehensive definitions 
inevitably create this very defect. The ordinance's broad 
definition of heinous crimes covers murder in a war context, an 
assaultive tackle on a football card, and a fictional story or 
thriller. A card which would depict and tell the story of Cain 
slaying Abel comes within the Law's purview, as does a card 
which would depict the Holocaust. Cards which selectively copy 
photographs from the True Crime set include cards about Elliot 
Ness and J. Edgar Hoover, in addition to cards about Al Capone 
and "Lucky" Luciano. (Pl. Ex. 10.) The set also contains a card 
detailing the kidnapping of the Lindberg baby, in addition to the 
St. Valentine's Day massacre. Id. Defendant's own experts noted 
numerous innocuous cards that, in their expert opinion, would 
not contribute to juvenile crime yet would be banned for sale to 
minors. (Tr. at 1:68, 69, 70, 77-78, 79, 81, 84; 2:25, 39, 49.)  
 
The law fails to account for the varying degrees of violence that 
might be revealed in a particular card. Additionally, the context 
of the violence is not taken into account. For example, the 
reprint set of trading cards Horrors of War details the early days 
of World War II and the Spanish civil war. (Pl. Ex. 8.) Each and 
every card in the set ends its digest with the epitaph, in bold 
print, "To know the HORRORS OF WAR is to want PEACE." 
(Id.) Local Law 11-1992 would prevent minors in Nassau 
county from purchasing cards with that message. The law 
sweeps within its ambit every trading card which contains a 
depiction of violence regardless of context or pervasiveness, and 
no matter how tangential or incidental the violence may be. See 
Simon & Shuster, 112 S. Ct. at 511; Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 
213.[fn 3]  
 
5. Vagueness 
 
Plaintiff also maintains that the law is void for vagueness. (Pl. 
Mem. at 17.) Defendant claims that the statutory language 
provides explicit definitions from which an ordinary person 
could determine which trading cards could not be sold to 
minors. (Def. Mem. at 9.) Local Law 11-1992 requires a 
determination not only of whether the particular cards contain 
depictions of "heinous crimes or "heinous criminals," but also 
whether the particular card is "harmful to minors." Plaintiff does 
not dispute that the ordinance provides explicit definitions and 
guidelines with respect to what is a "heinous crime" or "heinous 
criminal." (Pl. Mem. at 18.) The plaintiff challenges the 
vagueness of the term "harmful to minors." Id.  
 
A statute must "give the person of ordinary intelligence a 
reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited" and 
"provide explicit standards for those who apply [the statute]" so 
as to avoid "arbitrary and discriminatory application." Grayned 
v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972); see also 
Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 572-73 (1974); Bantam Books 
v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 71 (1963).  
 
Defendant contends that any trading card which depicts a 
"heinous crime" or "heinous criminal" is de facto "harmful to 
minors." Therefore, so the argument goes, one need only look to 
the definitions to determine what trading cards are prohibited. 
(Def. Mem. at 9.) However, this assertion fails to acknowledge 
the statutory language of the criteria required for a 
determination that a card is harmful to minors. The County has 
adopted a modification of the Miller v. California obscenity test 
in an attempt to provide guidelines for the statute's application 
of what is "harmful to minors." "Harmful to Minors" means that 
quality of any description or representation in whatever form of 
a heinous crime, an element of a heinous crime or a heinous 
criminal, when it 1) considered as a whole, appeals to the 
depraved interest of minors in crime; and 2) is patently 
offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a 
whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors; and 
3) considered as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political 
and scientific value for minors.  
 
The Court finds the application of this test "elusive." See Video 
Software, 968 F.2d at 690 (adoption of Miller obscenity test for 
regulation of sale to minors of violent video cassettes void for 
vagueness). In a clear exposition of the inability of one of 
ordinary intelligence to reasonably know what is prohibited, 
Defendant's own psychological experts contradicted each other, 
and themselves, as to whether certain cards are "harmful to 
minors." Dr. Sandra Kaplan testified that a card depicting 
General Suharto from the Friendly Dictators, featuring 36 of 
America's Most Embarrassing Allies trading card set (Pl. Ex. 2) 
would not be harmful. (Tr. at 1:79.) Later, Dr. Kaplan testified 
that the very same card was harmful. (Tr. at 1:126.) In another 
example, Dr. Kaplan testified that a card depicting Rick Mazzeo 
from the Rotten to the Core, The Best and Worst of New York 
City's Politics (Pl. Ex. 4) trading card set was harmful.[fn 4] (Tr. 
at 1:60.) Another defendant expert, Dr. Miriam Miedzian, 
testified that the Rick Mazzeo card was "certainly not a 
problem." (Tr. at 2:70.)  
 
The Court finds that under Local Law 11-1992, a person of 
ordinary intelligence cannot reasonably distinguish between 
those trading cards which are "harmful to minors" and those that 
are not. 92 S. Ct. at 2298-99.  
 
6. The Statutory Presumption 
 
Section 4 of the ordinance provides for a presumption of 
"knowledge of the character and content of the material sold or 
loaned." Local Law 11-1992 Section 4. Plaintiff challenges the 
ordinance on the basis that it imposes strict liability on one who 
disseminates speech in the form of trading cards targeted by the 
local law. (Pl. Mem. at 19.) Defendant asserts that the 
presumption is a proper inference which may substitute for 
direct evidence of intent. (Def. Mem. at 12.).  
 
The First Amendment requires that statutes imposing criminal 
sanctions for distribution of unprotected speech must contain a 
scienter requirement. New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 765 
(1982); Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 151-53 (1959) (strict 
liability for possession of obscene material is unconstitutional as 
it carries the risk of self-censorship); Video Software, 968 F.2d 
at 690 (lack of knowledge requirement renders statute 
unconstitutional).  
 
Moreover, "a criminal statutory presumption must be regarded 
as 'irrational' or 'arbitrary', and hence unconstitutional, unless it 
can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed 
fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on 
which it is made to depend." Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 
36 (1969); accord Young v. Abrams, 698 F.2d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 
1983); see also Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 467-68 
(1943).  
 
Defendant asserts that "there is clearly a rational connection 
between the sale of trading cards depicting "heinous crimes" 
and/or "heinous criminals" and the presumption that one sold a 
package of these cards with knowledge of its contents." (Def. 
Mem. at 13). Contrary to Defendant's assertions, neither the 
United States Supreme Court in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 
U.S. 629 (1968), nor the New York Court of Appeals in People 
v. Hartman, 244 N.E. 2d 710 (N.Y. 1968), endorsed the 
presumption provision of 235.22 of the New York State Penal 
Law. In fact, both cases were decided under 484-h, the earlier 
version of 235.22, which did not contain Section 4 of the 
present Nassau County Local Law 11-1992. See Ginsberg, 390 
U.S. at 632 n. 1; Hartman, 244 N.E.2d at 711.  
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds that the presumption provision of 
Nassau County Local Law 11-1992 is neither irrational nor 
arbitrary. Specifically, the Court concludes that it is more likely 
than not that a disseminator of trading cards depicting heinous 
crimes and/or criminals deemed harmful to minors would have 
knowledge of the general character and content of such 
materials. In so holding, the Court emphasizes that Section 4 of 
Local Law 11- 1992 merely sets forth a permissive, not 
mandatory inference of fact and is rebuttable. See Young, 698 
F.2d at 136 (discussing New York Penal Law 235.10, which 
contains an almost identical presumption provision in the 
obscenity context). The presumption that a disseminator of 
trading cards had knowledge of the contents & character of his 
materials may constitutionally be substituted for direct evidence 
on the issue of scienter. See Young, 698 F.2d at 136-37; 
Overstock Book Co. v. Berry, 436 F.2d 1289, 1294 (2d Cir. 
1970) (both cases upholding constitutionality of New York 
Penal Law 235.10); see also Smith, 361 U.S. at 154 
("Eyewitness testimony of a bookseller's perusal of a book 
hardly need be a necessary element in proving his awareness of 
its contents. The circumstances may warrant the inference that 
he was aware of what a book contained, despite his denial.") 
(Brennan, J., opinion).  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based upon the foregoing, this Court reports and recommends 
that Nassau County Local Law 11-1992 is an unconstitutional 
restriction on the distribution of free speech and ideas. The law 
is not narrowly tailored to further the ordinance's stated 
purposes of preventing juvenile crime and protecting the welfare 
of children under the age of 17.  
 
The law is overbroad in that all cards which depict violence are 
targeted, even if the violence is tangential or incidental.  
 
The Court further finds that the law is vague and ambiguous in 
that no reasonable person can determine whether a particular 
trading card or set of cards taken as a whole is harmful to 
minors.  
 
Finally, the Court finds that no credible or empirical evidence 
was presented from which this Court could conclude that the 
trading cards cause juvenile crime or impair moral and ethical 
development.  
 
Despite this Court's findings and recommendations, the 
County's attempt to deal with a societal problem is 
praiseworthy. Today, more and more children are exposed to 
more and more senseless activity. Many are born addicted to 
narcotic drugs or with fetal alcohol syndrome. Unlike a 
generation ago, children today are raised in a culture where 
violence is depicted in the media on a daily basis. As a result, 
children are growing up desensitized to the horrors of the 
violence around them, which could very well predispose them to 
certain anti-social behaviors. But, however praiseworthy the 
local law and its goals, the County cannot enact legislation 
which fails to pass constitutional muster. The burdens of living 
in a democracy are great. One of those burdens is that we must 
often accept offensive or tasteless speech.  
 
"Madison admonished us: A popular Government, without 
popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a 
Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge 
will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be 
their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power 
knowledge gives."

1.  In the defendant's Post-hearing memorandum of law, the 
defendant argues that the law is a permissible regulation of 
commercial speech. (Def. Mem. at 16.) The Court finds no merit 
to this argument. See Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia 
Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 762 (1976) 
(commercial speech is limited to that which proposes a 
commercial transaction).

Volume 3, April 7, 1994; Volume 4, May 16, 1994; and Volume 
5, May 23, 1994.  
 
3.  In a recent case before the District of Columbia Circuit 
Court, Action For Children's Television v. FCC, 1995 WL 
384630 (D.C. Cir. 6/95), the court concluded that the Public 
Communications Act of 1992, which banned indecent 
broadcasting on television between the hours of 6:00 A.M. until 
midnight, was constitutional. That case is distinguishable due to 
the unique nature of broadcasting, and the limited First 
Amendment concerns in that context. The trading cards in 
question do not present the "captive audience" or unwilling 
listener problem, and involve more serious First Amendment 
concerns. The cards, similar to the indecent phone call in Sable, 
require affirmative acts to obtain a desired message. 
Unsuspecting or innocent youngsters are not in danger of 
viewing the cards, like a passing indecent scene on television or 
the evening television news broadcasts.  
 
The Communications Act seeks to channel indecent messages to 
certain times of the day, while the Nassau County law attempts 
to ban all sales of cards to minors at all times. Lastly, the 
Nassau County law is broadly defined and supported by 
minimal evidence, while the Public Communications Act is 
narrowly defined, and adequately supported by FCC studies.  
 
4.  The Court also notes that Dr. Kaplan's courtroom testimony 
with respect to the Rick Mazzeo card was different than at her 
deposition. (Tr. at 1:60.)

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR A

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND FOR LEAVE TO FILE

A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  INTRODUCTION



   This action was commenced in 1990 by producers of "leased

access" cable television programming in New York City to

challenge the practices of Manhattan Cable Television, Inc.

("MCTV"), a Time Warner subsidiary, that subjected that

programming to pre-screening and pre-censorship by the cable

company.  By agreement of the parties and the concurrence of

the Court, that challenge has been held in abeyance pending

developments in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d

105 (D.C. Cir. 1995).



   On July 17, 1995, MCTV's successor, the Time Warner New

York City Cable Group ("Time Warner"), issued a statement

entitled "Time Warner New York City Cable Group Leased

Access Policy on Indecent and Obscene Programming" that

announced that, "pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Cable

Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,"

effective October 1, 1995 it would "scramble" certain

"leased access"[fn 1] programs that it regards as "indecent"

and that it would make such programming available on its

leased access channels only to customers who request such

programming in advance and in writing.



   The programming of the original plaintiffs in this suit

will be scrambled by Time Warner under this new policy.  In

addition, the programs of several other producers of leased

access programming now cablecast on Time Warner's system

will also be scrambled under the policy.  .Several of those

producers now move, along with the original plaintiffs, for

leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, which would add

those producers as plaintiffs and which would add claims

challenging Time Warner's new scrambling policy.  All those

producers also now move for a preliminary injunction halting

the implementation of the new policy pending the

determination of these motions.



   The programs that will be scrambled present a wide range

of material.  Some consist entirely of discussions and

reports on important contemporary and political issues,

including matters of health care as well as matters

addressing sexual themes.  For example, movants Gay Cable

Network, Inc. ("GCN") and Lou Maletta produce a program

entitled "Downtime" that is devoted exclusively to the

presentation of jazz music and another program, entitled

"Gay U.S.A.," that consists entirely of news reports and

features addressed primarily to gay and lesbian viewers that

contains no depictions of sexual activity, and no nudity.

Other programming produced by movants include sexually

suggestive adult entertainment which -- despite its possible

offensiveness to some -- remains fully protected by the

First Amendment.  Salem Inn Inc. v. Frank, 501 F.2d 18 (2nd

Cir. 1974)), aff'd in large part, Doran v. Salem Inn. Inc.,

422 U.S. 922 (1975); See also Sable Communications. Inc.,

492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).



   Movants contend that such adverse and burdensome

treatment of a particular category of expression, as defined

by Time Warner, clearly violates their free speech rights;

furthermore, movants contend that as a result of that

treatment their programming will not reach the audience to

which it now has access and will suffer a significant

diminution in viewership and in advertising revenue; and

that they will therefore suffer irreparable injury if the

policy is implemented.  Movants contend that this new policy

cannot be justified by Section 10 of the Cable Television

Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, codified at

47 U.S.C. Sections 532(h), 532(j) and 558 ("the 1992

Act"),[fn 2] because that statute violates the First and

Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and is

therefore unconstitutional.   Movants further contend that

even if Section 10 of the 1992 Act is found constitutional,

Time Warner's new policy cannot be sustained under it for

several reasons: first, the policy cannot rest upon the

principal provision of Section 10(a), which, by its terms,

only authorizes a total prohibition of programming that the

cable company "reasonably believes" to be "indecent";

second, the policy cannot rest on Section 10(b) because this

provision is not self-executing and is dependent on the

implementation of FCC regulations, which regulations are

currently stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for

the District of Columbia Circuit; third, the Time Warner

policy also cannot rest on Section 10(b) because the policy

fails to comply with the procedural requirements imposed by

that section and the FCC's resultant regulations.



   Movants finally contend that if Time Warner's policy of

scrambling their leased access programs cannot be justified

by Section 10 of the 1992 Cable Act, the policy violates

Section 829 of the New York Executive Law, which prohibits

content-based censorship of leased access programming by

cable companies and which provides that "[n]o cable company

may prohibit or limit any program or class or type of

program presented over a [leased access] channel . . . ."

Also, movants contend that Time Warner's new policy imposes

an "unreasonable" condition on them which the Court should

strike under Section 612(d) of the federal Cable Act, 47

U.S.C. Section 532(d).  See generally Media Ranch, supra

n.1.



     Movants therefore assert that Time Warner's new

scrambling policy is being undertaken without lawful

authority and in contravention of the United States

Constitution and applicable law. On these legal claims, and

to prevent irreparable injury, movants seek a temporary

restraining order and a preliminary injunction to restrain

Time Warner from implementing its scrambling policy on

October 1, 1995 and to maintain the status quo ante while

the important constitutional and statutory claims raised by

this controversy are considered and resolved.





STATEMENT OF THE CASE The 1984 Cable Act



   As cable television became an increasingly important

medium for communication in the 1970s and 1980s, public

officials and others became concerned that -- because of

various technological and practical characteristics of the

medium[fn 3] -- cable companies that were awarded franchises

by municipalities would acquire monopolistic or

near-monopolistic control over television programming within

the geographic regions of their franchises. "Public access"

and "leased access" channels were seen as a modest means by

which expressive opportunities were available on cable

television for voices and sources of programming that cable

operators would not otherwise offer to their subscribers.



     Thus, in 1972 New York State enacted an elaborate

statutory framework for the regulation of cable television

that, inter alia, provided for leased and public access

channels and prohibited cable companies from controlling the

content of programming on these channels.  New York

Executive Law, Section 829.  At the same time, the New York

statutory scheme immunized cable companies from any claim

"for damages arising from any obscene or defamatory

statements . . . occurring during any program when the

[cable] company does not originate or produce such program."

New York Executive Law, Section 830.



   In 1984 Congress adopted a similar approach.  In enacting

the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No.

98-549, 98 Stat. 2780, codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 521 et

seq. (1984) ("the 1984 Cable Act"), Congress sought to

assure, inter alia, "the widest possible diversity of

information sources and services to the public."  47 U.S.C.

Section 521(4).  In Section 612 of the 1984 Cable Act, 47

U.S.C. Section 532, Congress established a detailed means of

creating leased access channels, the purpose of which, as

quoted by this Court in Media Ranch, supra n.1 at 314, was

to "assure that the widest possible diversity of information

sources are made available to the public from cable systems

in a manner consistent with growth and development of cable

systems."



   Like the New York statute, the 1984 Cable Act

specifically prohibited cable operators from "exercis[ing]

any editorial control over any video programming provided"

over any access channel, 47 U.S.C. Sections 531(e),

532(c)(2).  At the same time, the 1984 Cable Act immunized

cable operators from liability for programming over which

they had no editorial control.  47 U.S.C. Section 558.



   Congress specifically recognized that access channels

represented "the video equivalent of the speaker's soapbox

or the electronic parallel to the printed leaflet . . . in

the electronic marketplace of ideas," H.R. Rep. No. 934,

98th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1984).  These channels have since

served as fora for innovative and frank programming on a

variety of community-based concerns and they have also

provided expressive opportunities for voices who would

otherwise be excluded from the cable system if access were

left exclusively to the editorial discretion and business

judgments of the cable operator.



   The 1984 Cable Act also required that all operators make

available "lockboxes" -- l.e., electronic devices "by which

the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable

service," whether on a premium, access, or regular

commercial channel -- "during periods selected by that

subscriber."  47 U.S.C. Section 544(d)-(2)(A).  Congress

found that lockboxes "effectively restrict the availability

of [undesired] programming, particularly with respect to

[programs that may be inappropriate for] child viewers,

without infringing the First Amendment rights of the cable

operator, the cable programmer, or other cable viewers."

H.R. Rep. No. 934, supra, at 70.  Indeed, the Federal

Communications Commission ("FCC") found that content-neutral

lockboxes afforded such effective protection that, in 1985,

it repealed its content-based rule that had proscribed

indecent programming on cablechannels, including access

channels.  See Implementation of the Provisions of the Cable

Communications Policy Act of 1984, MM Dkt. No. 84-1296, 50

Fed. Reg. 18,637, 18,656 (1985).





The Earlier Phase of This Suit



   This case, when originally commenced, rested principally

on the 1984 Cable Act.  The original plaintiffs, Al

Goldstein and Media Ranch, Inc., produce a late-night,

sexually-oriented television program entitled "Midnight

Blue" that was cablecast by MCTV on its leased access

Channel 35 in portions of Manhattan. They challenged MCTV's

practice of pre-screening the content of "Midnight Blue"

which, on several occasions, resulted in the refusal to

cablecast portions of "Midnight Blue" on the basis of its

content.  Plaintiffs claimed that this content-based

censorship violated Section 612(c)(2) of the 1984 Cable Act,

47 U.S.C. Section 532-(c)(2).  Plaintiffs further contended

that MCTV's practice violated the prohibition against

censorship by cable companies set forth in Section 829 of

the New York Executive Law.  Finally, plaintiffs asserted

that MCTV's practice violated 3.7.02 of the Franchise

Agreement entered into on June 28, 1990 between MCTV and the

City of New York ("the Franchise").  That provision of the

Franchise states that "[t]he leased [access] channels shall

be administered by the [cable] Company as required by

Section 612 of the Cable Act [47 U.S.C. Section 532]."



   Upon these claims, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment

in or about November 1991.  Defendants cross-moved for

summary judgment.  Both motions were submitted to the Court

in or about February 1992. The 1992 Cable Act While those

motions were sub judice, in October 1992 Congress enacted

the 1992 Cable Act.  On the last legislative day before the

Senate approved its version of the bill, two senators

separately added three related floor amendments.  With no

committee consideration and limited debate, these amendments

became Section 10 of the 1992 Act. Section 10(a) of the Act

amended Section 612(h) of the 1984 Cable Act in two

respects: first, it added the words "or cable operator" to

the references to "unprotected expression" in that section.

As amended, the first sentence of Section 612(h), 47 U.S.C.

Section 532(h), now reads:  Any cable service offered

pursuant to this section shall not be provided, or shall be

provided subject to conditions, if such cable service in the

judgment of the franchising authority or cable operator is

obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in that

it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise

unprotected by the Constitution of the United States.  [New

language is underlined]. Section 10(a) of the 1992 Act also

added a new sentence to Section 612(h) which provided:  This

subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce

prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting

programing that the cable operator reasonably believes

describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or

organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by

contemporary community standards. Section 10(b) of the 1992

Act directed the FCC to promulgate regulations "designed to

limit the access of children to indecent programming" on

leased access channels and to mandate that, in circumstances

where the cable company has not elected to ban such

programming, it shall be required "to place on a single

channel all indecent programs, as identified by program

providers" and "to block such single channel unless the

subscriber requests access to such channel in writing."

Section 10(b) of the 1992 Act further directed the FCC to

promulgate regulations "requiring programmers to inform

cable operators if the program would be indecent as defined

by Commission regulations."



   Section 10(c) of the 1992 Act was directed at "public

access" channels and required the FCC to develop regulations

"to enable a cable operator of a cable system to prohibit



                                                       

any programming which contains obscene material, sexually

explicit conduct, or material soliciting or promoting

unlawful conduct."



   Finally, Section 10(d) deprived cable operators of one

aspect of the immunity they previously enjoyed under 47

U.S.C. Section 558.  It provided that cable companies would

face civil and criminal liability if they fail to prohibit

programming that "involves obscene material."



   Notwithstanding that the 1992 Act represented a

comprehensive review and revision of the 1984 Cable Act,

neither Section 10 nor its sparse legislative history

mentioned, much less discussed, lockboxes in any way.

Congress thus made no finding that these parental blocking

devices, which were required by 47 U.S.C. Section

544(d)(2)(A), had somehow become ineffective since the 1984

Cable Act was passed.



      In the FCC's informal rulemaking proceedings relating

to the implementation of Section 10, the overwhelming

consensus of those who submitted comments -- including

programmers who provide material that appears on access

channels, viewers who watch access programming, and cable

operators charged with censoring such programs -- was that

Section 10 was inconsistent with the First Amendment.

However, the FCC apparently felt constrained to implement

the 1992 Act, and it complied with the directive in Section

10 and promulgated implementing regulations.  See First

Report and Order of the FCC, Implementation of Section 10 of

the Cable Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,

58 Fed.Reg. 7990, 7993 (Feb. 1, 1993), 47 C.F.R. 76.701.[fn

4]  See also Second Report and Order of the FCC, 58 Fed.Reg.

19.623, 19.626 (March 25, 1993), codified at 47 C.F.R.

76.702.



   Petitions for review challenging the constitutionality of

the FCC's Section 10 regulations were submitted to the

United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

Circuit in or about February 1993.  The petitions were

consolidated sub. nom. The Alliance for Community Media et

al. v. FCC and United States of America.  On or about April

7, 1993 and May 7, 1993, the D.C. Circuit stayed the

Commission's Section 10 regulations pending disposition of

the petitions.  On November 23, 1993, a panel of the D.C.

Circuit declared Section 510(a) and (c) of the 1992 Act

unconstitutional and found Section 10(b) and the FCC's

regulations under it to raise such serious questions as to

require the FCC to reconsider the matter in light of the

unconstitutionality of Section 10(a) and (c).  Alliance for

Community Media v. FCC, 10 F.3d 812 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The

full Court subsequently vacated the panel's decision and,

banc, a divided Court upheld Section 10 and the  upon

rehearing en Commission's regulations.  Alliance for

Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  On

July 10, 1995, the Court of Appeals continued to stay

implementation of the FCC's regulations pending the filing

of certiorari petitions.[fn 5]  By operation of law, that

stay will continue in effect until the Supreme Court acts on

the two certiorari petitions that were timely filed with the

Court.  See F.R.A.P. Rule 41(b).[fn 6]



The Current Phase of This Suit



   By agreement among counsel and with the approval of the

Court, the cross-motions for summary judgment that were

pending prior to the enactment of the 1992 Act were

withdrawn and further litigation under the original

Complaint was held in abeyance pending resolution by the

D.C. Circuit of the constitutional challenge to Section 10

and its regulations.  That Court rendered its en banc

decision in Alliance on June 6, 1995.



   On or about July 17, 1995, Time Warner announced that,

commencing October 1, 1995, it would scramble the signal of

leased access programming that it considered "indecent."

See "Time Warner New York City Cable Group Leased Access

Policy On Indecent and Obscene Programming."[fn 7] That

policy stated that leased access "programming that is

determined to be indecent" would be scrambled even if such

programming is scheduled for viewing "during late-night and

overnight hours."  The policy further announced that

scrambled programming would be unscrambled only if a

subscriber, over the age of 18, requests, in writing, that

the signal be unscrambled and, in such circumstances, the

signal will be unscrambled within 30 days of receiving the

request.



   The policy also requires new providers of "leased access"

programming to "certify," inter alia, that the programming

will not be obscene and to state "whether any programming it

intends to offer is indecent ..."  However, while Time

Warner's policy requires current providers of leased access

programming to certify that their programs are not obscene,

it only requires such producers "to certify that their

programming does not contain indecent material" if such

programming is to be "exhibited during hours other than the

hours that will be scrambled." The implication of this

provision is that Time Warner intends to scramble all

current programming between certain unspecified hours --

presumably during late-night and early morning hours -- upon

its assumption that all such programming offered during

these hours is necessarily "indecent" under Time Warner's

definition of "indecency."[fn 8]



   Under the policy, "[a]ny program provider who (a) refuses

to make the required certification or (b) certifies

incorrectly that its programming exhibited or sought to be

exhibited does not contain indecent or obscene material,

will not be eligible to obtain or retain leased access

channel capacity on the system." Finally, the policy

announced that even if a programmer certifies that its

programming is not indecent, Time Warner "reserves the right

to determine [for itself] whether programming exhibited or

sought to be exhibited is obscene or indecent."



   Movants contend that insofar as Time Warner's policy

purports to rest on Section 10 of the 1992 Act, that section

unconstitutionally violates the First Amendment in several

respects. Movants further contend that, even if Section 10

is constitutional, the policy cannot be sustained under its

authority.  Finally, movants assert that if the Time Warner

policy cannot rest upon the authority of Section 10 of the

1992 Act, the policy must be invalidated as inconsistent

with Section 829 of the New York Executive Law.



   Time Warner's new scrambling policy already has, and will

continue to have unless enjoined, an immediate adverse

impact on movants' ability to reach the widest possible

cable television adult audience as contemplated by Section

Section 612(a) of the federal Cable Act and to attract the

advertising necessary to sustain their programming.  For

these reasons, movants seek a preliminary injunction to

maintain the current system in place and to enjoin

implementation of Time Warner's scrambling policy until the

important constitutional and statutory issues raised by this

case are resolved.



   The Second Circuit has held that "a party seeking

preliminary injunctive relief must establish: (a)

irreparable injury and (b) either (1) a likelihood of

success on the merits of the underlying claim or (ii)

sufficiently serious questions going to the merits as to

create a far basis for litigation and a balance of hardships

tipping decidedly toward the moving party."  Sweeney v.

Bane, 996 F.2d 1384, 1388 (2nd Cir. 1993).  As demonstrated

in Point I of the Argument below, movants are likely to

succeed on the merits or, at the very least, movants raise

sufficiently serious questions going to the merits as to

create a fair ground for litigation.  In Point II below,

movants demonstrate that without preliminary injunctive

relief, they will suffer irreparable injury and that any

fair evaluation of the balance of hardships strongly

supports the issuance of the requested preliminary

injunction.  In Point III, movants demonstrate why their

motion to amend the complaint and to add parties -- a motion

that accompanies the instant motion for a preliminary

injunction -- should be granted.   



ARGUMENT



    I.   MOVANTS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF

THEIR UNDERLYING CLAIMS OR, AT THE LEAST, RAISE SUFFICIENTLY

SERIOUS CLAIMS GOING TO THE MERITS AS TO CREATE A FAIR BASIS

FOR LITIGATION



   A.   Time Warner's Scrambling Policy Cannot Be Sustained

Under the Authority of Section 10 of the 1992 Act Because

that Section Violates the First Amendment to the United

States Constitution.



   Section 10 of the 1992 Act requires cable companies

either to ban leased access programming that the cable

company "reasonably believes" is "indecent" or, pursuant to

regulations to be promulgated by the FCC, to block the

signal of "indecent" programming unless and until a

subscriber requests access to such programming in writing.

So understood, the 1992 Act unquestionably compels cable

companies to take adverse action against leased access

programming on the basis of its content.



   Such content-based action cannot be shown to advance

compelling societal interests in the least restrictive

manner and is, therefore, unconstitutional.  Moreover, the

"indecency" standard employed by Section 10 -- especially

when compounded by the requirement that programmers

"certify" whether or not their programs are "indecent" -- is

unconstitutionally vague and thus likely to cause

self-censorship by programmers.  Additionally, Section 10

compels content-based discrimination of leased access

programming without satisfying the procedural First

Amendment requirements set forth in Freedman v. Maryland,

380 U.S. 51 (1965).  Furthermore, 510 unconstitutionally

abridges the rights of individuals to receive

constitutionally protected expression free from stigma and

the compelled disclosure of their identities.  Finally,

Section 10 deviates impermissibly from the

constitutionally-driven regime of leased and public access

adopted and confirmed by the 1984 Cable Act.  Each of these

claims is explained more fully below.



   1.   The content-based discrimination compelled by

Section 10 fails to advance important societal interests in

the least restrictive manner.



   In Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989), the

Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of a federal

statute that was directed at what has come to be called

"dial-a-porn." The statute prohibited indecent as well as

obscene telephone communications.  The Court found that the

statute violated the First Amendment as to indecent but not

as to obscene expression.  In so doing, the Court emphasized

that "[s]exual expression which is indecent but not obscene

is protected by the First Amendment" (492 U.S. at 126) and

that the "[g]overnment may . . . regulate the content of

constitutionally protected speech to promote a compelling

interest" only "if it chooses the least restrictive means to

further the articulated interest."  Id.



   The Sable Court assumed that "there is a compelling

interest in protecting the physical and psychological

well-being of minors."  Id.  But, the Court concluded that

there was no legislative record indicating that, prior to

the enactment of the statute in question, Congress had ever

seriously considered -- much less rejected -- a variety of

less restrictive alternatives that were readily available

short of an absolute prohibition of indecency.  Thus, the

Court observed that "[t]he bill that was enacted . . . was

introduced on the floor; nor was there [any] committee

report on the bill from which the language of the enacted

bill was taken.  No Congressman or Senator purported to

present a considered judgment with respect to how often or

to what extent minors could or would circumvent the rules

and have access to dial-a-porn messages."  492 U.S. at 130.



     Under the principles articulated in Sable, Section 10

of the 1992 Act must similarly be found unconstitutional.

To the degree that any cable company finds itself compelled

by Section 10 to ban indecent programming completely, such a

total ban would clearly run afoul of the holding of Sable.

But even where, as here, a cable company decides -- pursuant

to Section 10 -- to scramble the signal of certain leased

access programs, such a decision cannot be upheld consistent

with the First Amendment.



     The reason for this is that -- even allowing that there

may be a compelling interest in shielding minors from

"indecency" to protect their psychological well-being[fn 9]

-- this interest can be achieved in a way that is far less

restrictive than the scrambling approach contemplated by the

statute.  Parental blocking devices already exist -- indeed,

as noted above, were mandated by the 1984 Cable Act, 47

U.S.C. Section 544(d)(2)(A) -- and there is nothing in the

legislative record to suggest that these devices have proved

ineffective in allowing parents to limit the access of young

people to sexually-oriented cable programming.  Like the

statute at issue in Sable, Section 10 was introduced at the

last legislative moment on the floor of the Senate.[fn 10]

There was no committee report on the bill from which its

language was taken. No Congressperson or Senator purported

to present a considered judgment with respect to how often

or to what extent the parental blocking devices mandated by

47 U.S.C. Section 544(d)(2)(A) have proved ineffective.  As

the Supreme Court recently observed in Turner Broadcasting

System v. FCC, ___ U.S. ___, 129 L.Ed.2d 497, 531 (1994):



"When the government defends a regulation on speech as a

means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms, it

must do more than simply "posit the existence of the disease

sought to be cured."  [citation omitted].  It must

demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely

conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate

these harms in a direct and material way."



The legislative record with respect to Section 10 fails

utterly in this regard.  The conclusion of the Sable Court

pertains here as well: "For all we know from [the

legislative] record," the parental blocking approach created

by the 1984 Cable Act may be "extremely effective, and only

a few of the most enterprising and disobedient young people

would manage to secure access" to inappropriate

leased-access programming.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 130.



   Nevertheless, in the face of these arguments, the

government in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC defended

against the constitutional challenge to Section 10(a) by

claiming that the statute raises no constitutional issue at

all, because it merely allows cable companies to pursue

"voluntarily" different methods for regulating "indecent"

programming.  This argument was initially rejected by a

panel of the D.C. Circuit, which held that Section 10(a) and

Section 10(c) were unconstitutional under the First

Amendment and that Section 10(b), as well as the FCC's

corresponding regulations, posed such serious questions that

the Commission should reconsider the matter.  Alliance, 10

F.2d 812 (D.C. Cir. 1993).



   As noted above, the panel's decision was reversed by the

Court of Appeals sitting en banc.  The en banc decision

recognized that "[i]f decisions of cable operators not to

carry indecent programs on leased or PEG access channels,

decisions Section 10(a) and Section 10(c) permit, were

treated as decisions of the government, the Commission and

the United States would be hard put to defend the

constitutionality of these provisions."  Alliance, 56 F.3d

at 113; cert. pending, Nos. 95-124, 95-227 (July 18, 1995;

Aug. 9, 1995).  The Alliance Court concluded, however, that

"Sections 10(a) and 10(c) do not command.  Cable operators

may carry indecent programs on their access channels, or

they may not." Id.  Accordingly, the Alliance Court held

that Section 10(a) "is a federal statute authorizing action

by private cable operators [and] is therefore not itself

sufficient to trigger the First Amendment."  Alliance, 56

F.3d at 113.



    In addressing Section 10(b) of the 1992 Cable Act, the

en banc decision in Alliance implicitly recognized that this

provision compelled behavior on the part of cable companies

and that, therefore, First Amendment standards must be

satisfied.  In this regard, however, the Alliance Court

concluded that Section 10(b) represents the least

restrictive means by which Congress could protect children

against exposure to indecent programming.



    The decision of the en banc Alliance Court is flawed in

several respects.  First, as Circuit Judge Wald pointed out

in dissent: "Sections 10(a) and (b) are co-dependent parts

of one statutory scheme regulating speech.  They present

cable operators with an 'either-or' command: accentuate the

positive by banning indecent 'leased access' programming

under Section 10(a), or eliminate the negative by blocking

it under Section 10(b)." Alliance, 56 F.3d at 131.  Judge

Wald demonstrated why, despite the seemingly permissive

language of Section 10(a), the integrated statutory scheme

compels cable companies to take adverse action against

leased access programming on the basis of content.  Judge

Wald observed:



"To illustrate the effect of the "may" language of Section

10(a) when used in the context of  Section 10(b), we point

out that the operators' options -- and the burden on speech

-- would be no different if the regulations were expressed

in any of the following terms:



   1.   "an operator must ban, or in the alternative must

block; 



   2.   "an operator may block, or in the alternative must

ban;



   3.   "an operator may ban, or in the alternative may

block, but these alternatives are to the exclusion of all

others."



All these formulations, linguistically distinct, are

logically and functionally equivalent.  Each commands that

the cable operator either ban or block indecent speech.

Yet, the Section 10(a) and (b) option is no different in its

effect. Only empty formalism would elevate Congress' choice

of the nominally permissive "may" language of Section 10(a)

to demonstrate the absence of state action, when Section

10(b) lurks in the shadows ready to pounce."



Id.  The district court in Altmann v. Television Signal

Corp., 849 F. Supp. 1335 (N.D. Cal. 1994) reached the same

conclusion, noting that the "explicit purpose" of Section

10(a) and Section 10(c) was "to suppress the broadcast of

indecent materials on access channels" and "significantly

encourage"[fn 11] cable operators to censor.  Id. at 1342.

The Altmann court agreed "with the original Alliance

decision" that  Section 10 "create[s] a sufficient 'nexus'

to find that the total ban on indecent material on public

and leased access channels authorized by Sections 10(a) and

(c) and their implementing regulations constitute state

action."  Id.



    Indeed, this conclusion is compelled by Skinner v.

Railway Labor Exec. Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 615 (1989), and

Railway Employees Dep't v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), both

ignored by the en banc majority, and both holding that

private decisions authorized or encouraged by federal law

are not immune from constitutional scrutiny, particularly

where, as in Hanson and the present case, the federal

statute preempts state legislation on the subject.



    In short, the entire statutory scheme of Section 10 must

be subjected to constitutional scrutiny.  And, when so

examined, Section 10(a) is unconstitutional for the reasons

stated by the Supreme Court in Turner; it cannot survive the

"exacting scrutiny" required for laws "that suppress,

disadvantage or impose differential burdens upon speech

because of its content."  114 S.Ct. at 2458-59 (emphasis

added).



     The en banc decision of the D.C. Circuit is similarly

flawed in its conclusion that Section 10(b) of the 1992

Cable Act pursues its goal of protecting children in the

least restrictive manner.  As Judge Wald pointed out:



". . . nothing in the [legislative or administrative] record

establishes that cable lockboxes -- which cable operators

are required to provide -- are not an effective means of

protecting children from "indecent" programming.  Indeed,

the record strongly suggests otherwise . . . .  Congress has

found lockboxes to be "effective."  See H.R. Rep. 934, 98th

Cong., 2d Sess. 70 (1984) . . . (describing lockboxes as a

"means to effectively restrict the availability of such

[indecent] programming, particularly with respect to child

viewers, without restricting the First Amendment rights of

the cable operator, the cable programmer, or other cable

viewers."  The Commission on several occasions has attested

to their efficacy.  See, e.g., FCC 85-179, 1985 FCC Lexis

3475, l132 at 112-13 ("Indeed, we believe that the provision

for lockboxes largely disposes of issues involving the

Commission's standards for indecency . . . .")  . . .  Not

only cable programmers, but cable operators submitted

comments during the rulemaking stating that lockboxes are

effective.



Alliance, 56 F.3d at 140-141.



And, as Judge Wald further observed:



"Because the 1992 Cable Act indecency provisions were

adopted in a series of floor amendments, without benefit of

committee hearings or even substantial floor debate, their

legislative history is exceedingly scant.  But nowhere in

that meager history is there a single comment that anyone in

Congress thought cable lockboxes ineffective.  See 138 Cong.

Rec. 646 et seq. (daily ed., Jan. 30, 1992) (no mention of

lockboxes in Senate floor debate).



Alliance, 56 F.3d at 141.



     There is further evidence that the "scrambling"

approach at issue here is not the least restrictive means to

accomplish its asserted goal.  Thus, although Time Warner

has -- for the stated purpose of shielding minors from

"indecent" programming -- undertaken to scramble movants'

assertedly "indecent" programming and make it available only

to subscribers who request access to it in writing thirty

days in advance, Time Warner has conspicuously not imposed

similar restrictions on access to its "indecent"

programming.  Indeed, as is set forth in the Joint

Declaration of Al Goldstein, Robin Byrd, and Lou Maletta

submitted herewith, all a viewer need do to obtain access to

Time Warner's "indecent" programming is to make a telephone

call from a subscriber's home -- on the same day, indeed at

the same time -- the programming is offered.  The mere

making of that call is all that is required to obtain that

access; Time Warner does not inquire as to the age of the

person ordering the access, much less require that person to

request that access in writing thirty days in advance.

Since it must be presumed that Time Warner is no less

concerned about minors' access to its "indecent" programming

as it is about such access to movants' programming, it must

also be presumed that Time Warner's method of handling

access to its "indecent" programming adequately protects

against any such undesirable access. 



    In short, the provision of Section 10(b) that compels

cable companies to block or scramble certain "leased access"

channels cannot survive "exacting" constitutional scrutiny.

Given the efficacy of parental blocking devices, Section

10(b) cannot be upheld unless Congress can demonstrate

convincingly that parental blocking mechanisms are

inadequate.  As the Supreme Court said in Turner, conjecture

is insufficient on matters such as this. Turner, 129 L.Ed.2d

at 531.  But in this case Congress did not even engage in

speculation or conjecture.  Congress did not consider the

matter at all.



   The constitutional deficiencies of Section 10 cannot be

saved by the Second Circuit's analysis in Dial Information

Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2nd Cir. 1991), cert.

denied, 112 S.Ct. 966 (1992).  Dial Information Services

involved a constitutional challenge to a federal statute

that, post-Sable, attempted to limit access by young people

to so-called "dial-a-porn."  The post-Sable statute

effectively required companies producing "dial-a-porn"

messages either to engage in billing or collection for such

messages in a manner that was independent of the telephone

companies or to be subject to a requirement, imposed on the

phone companies, that any such messages be provided on a

presubscription basis.  In Dial Information Services, the

Second Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the statute.



   Dial Information Services is inapposite to the present

controversy for at least four reasons.  First, the statute

at issue in Dial Information Services was not nearly as

restrictive as Section 10(b) of the 1992 Cable Act.  Second,

as a matter of common experience it is quite evident that it

is far more difficult to limit access by minors to

"dial-a-porn" telephone messages that are available

throughout the day than it is to limit access by young

people to late-night, sexually-oriented cable television

programs.  Third, because of technological differences

between telephone systems and cable television systems,

"dial-a-porn" messages could not effectively be blocked

through the use of parental blocking mechanisms whereas

parental blocking mechanisms for cable television function

with technological effectiveness.



    The statute that was challenged in Dial Information

Services  did not impose a blanket requirement that

"dial-a-porn" messages could only be conveyed to individuals

who had pre-subscribed to the messages.  Under that statute,

the pre-subscription requirement was imposed only for

producers of "dial-a-porn" messages who were using telephone

companies to provide billing services and to collect charges

for those producers.  Producers of "dial-a-porn" messages

who billed and collected their charges independently

remained free to provide such communication without a

presubscription requirement.



     Secondly, but more importantly, it is far more

difficult to limit access by children to "dial-a-porn"

messages than it is to limit access to inappropriate

television programs.  Judge Wald made this point precisely

in Alliance:



"[T]elephones, including pay phones, are ubiquitous and

readily accessible to children outside the home [citations

omitted].  Although cable television is widely available, it

is not nearly as accessible to unsupervised children outside

the home as is telephone service.  Pay phones in particular

provide individual, unsupervised, private access to indecent

communications on street corners and in shopping malls,

movie theatres, restaurants, gas stations, parks and

playgrounds."



Alliance, 56 F.3d at 141-142 (Wald, J. dissenting).



     By contrast, sexually-oriented "leased access" programs

are provided after ten o'clock at night when most children

are asleep or, at least, at home and under the supervision

of a parent or other adult.  Consequently, the opportunities

for children to view sexually-oriented leased access

programming in an unsupervised setting outside the home are

virtually non-existent.



     Thirdly, there are technological differences between

telephone systems and cable television systems that reduce

dramatically the applicability of Dial Information Services

to the present controversy.  In considering the problem of

access by children to "dial-a-porn" messages, the FCC found

that "in the telephone context voluntary blocking was

ineffective because telephone companies were able to block

only local 'dial-a-porn' providers, and for technological

reasons were incapable of blocking long-distance access to

dial-a-porn services . . . . Consequently, voluntary

telephone blocking does not prevent minors from accessing

dial-a-porn services by long distance calls."  Alliance, 56

F.3d at 141 (Wald, J. dissenting) (emphasis in original).

Again, by contrast, parental blocking of cable programming

is, from a technological standpoint, entirely effective.

The lockbox system "can block any channel received in the

home."  Id.



     For all these reasons, Section 10(b) of the 1992 Cable

Act cannot be found to be the "least restrictive means" to

prevent children from gaining access to sexually-oriented

"leased access" programming without parental approval.

There is no evidence that parental blocking devices, as

mandated by the 1984 Cable Act, inadequately serve this

interest.  Section 10(b) is, therefore, unconstitutional and

Time Warner s policy of scrambling sexually-oriented leased

access programming cannot be sustained under the authority

of this provision.



   2.   The indecency standard imposed by Section 10 is

unconstitutionally vague.



   The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires

that statutes and regulations not be so vague that affected

parties are uncertain as to what actions are proscribed and

not so subjective that government officials have unbridled

discretion in their enforcement decisions.  Grayned v. City

of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972); Connally v.

General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926).  This

constitutional condemnation of vague laws applies with

special force when First Amendment rights are at stake.

Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside Hoffman Estates.

Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982).  Significantly, the new

sentence that was added to 47 U.S.C. Section 532(h) by

Section 10(a) does not purport to refer to or define the

term "indecent," which term Congress directed in Section

10(b) be defined by the FCC.  As drafted, that new sentence

is impermissibly vague not only because it turns on such

indefinable and subjective concepts as "patent

offensiveness" and "contemporary community standards," but

also because it enables cable operators to ban, and requires

access programmers to anticipate, what operators will

"reasonably believe" is within the statute's purview.



    The statute's reference to "community standards" for

what is "patently offensive" is an entirely subjective

notion that provides no guidance to programmers -- and will

undoubtedly lead to self-censorship given the penalties for

guessing wrong.  Nor do these phrases limit the whim or

caprice of cable operators.  The inevitable result of such

imprecise terms is that arbitrary enforcement will be

widespread; cable operators will censor, and programmers

will self-censor, simply because their programming may have

some sexual content or vulgar words.  See Grayned, 408 U.S.

at 108-09.[fn 12]



    Congress's use of the phrase "reasonably believes"

substantially augments Section 10's problems, because what

cable operators "reasonably believe" is proscribable by the

new sentence in 47 U.S.C. Section 532(h) is a larger and

even vaguer category than what actually is so proscribable,

resulting in both the banning of speech that is not within

the purview of the statute and in increased arbitrariness

and self-censorship.  See Bella Lewitzky Dance Found. v.

Frohnmayer, 754 F. Supp. 774, 781-82 (C.D. Cal. 1991)

(requirement that artists certify that none of their works

may be considered obscene in the NEA's judgment is void for

vagueness); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 371 (1964)

("[t]he uncertain meanings of . . . oaths require the

oath-taker 'steer far wider of the unlawfal zone' than if

the boundaries were clearly marked"); Keyishian v. Board of

Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967) (vagueness of loyalty oath

legislation "stifle[s] . free play of the spirit" in

violation of First Amendment).



      Obscenity jurisprudence does not redeem the use of

"community standards" in the definition of indecency.

Obscenity deals only with "hard-core" pornography, Miller v.

California, 413 U.S. 15, 27 (1973), which Justice Stewart

memorably described with the phrase: "I know it when I see

it," Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart,

J., concurring).  By contrast, "indecency" encompasses a

broad and undefined category that extends beyond even

"soft-core" pornography,[fn 13] and no member of the Supreme

Court has ever suggested it is recognizable on sight.

Additionally, the consideration of "serious value" in

obscenity jurisprudence, i.e., literary, artistic,

political, and scientific merit, allows speakers to make

predictive judgments and courts to develop, over time,

substantive guidance for both speakers and censors.  See

Miller v. California, 413 U.S. at 24. Section 10's

definition allows for no such safe prediction or guidance as

to what cable operators will "reasonably believe" they can

censor.  This case presents an excellent example of the

problem, as Time Warner has announced its intention to

scramble such programs as "Gay U.S.A.," which does not

present sexual material.



   Clearly, the overall result of Section 10's multiple

vagueness problems is harmful self-censorship by artists and

other programmers and unbridled discretion vested in the FCC

and its cable operator delegates to censor where programmers

do not self-censor.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly

condemned vague laws for precisely these reasons.  E.g.,

City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S.

750, 757-58 (1988); Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction,

368 U.S. 278, 283-84 (1961).



    3.   Section 10 compels content-based discrimination

against "leased access" programming without satisfying the

procedural First Amendment requirements set forth in

Freedman v. Maryland.



    In Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51 (1965), the Supreme

Court held that where an administrative agency is reviewing

expression to decide, based on its content, whether such

expression is to be curtailed, such administrative

decision-making must "take[] place under procedural

safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship

system."  Freedman, 380 U.S. at 58.  At a minimum, these

safeguards must provide for prompt judicial review initiated

by the censor, with the burden of proof on the censor.

Freedman, 380 U.S. at 58-59.



   Although Section 10 of the 1992 Cable Act imposes a

regime of censorship, it does so without any mechanism

designed to comply with the procedural requirements of

Freedman.  This deficiency is particularly significant

where, as here, Time Warner undertakes to scramble programs

based on its own assessment that such programs are indecent.

For it is inevitable that disputes will arise between

program providers and cable operators as to whether a

particular program is or is not indecent.



   The FCC, in issuing its First Report under Section 10,

was able to sidestep the requirements of Freedman by noting

that, under Section 10(b), no scrambling of a program would

take place unless the program producer certifies that the

program is indecent.  Upon this basis, the FCC concluded:

"We do not envision disputes arising from the content of

programs on the leased access channel except where a

program, not identified by a program provider as indecent,

is carried on a nonblocked leased channel, and is alleged to

be indecent."  (First Report, Paragraph 75).  Under such

circumstances, the FCC indicated that it would "entertain

special relief petitions under Section 76.7 of our rules."

Id.



     But here, Time Warner apparently intends to scramble

any program that in its judgment is "indecent," without

regard to whether the program's producer regards the program

as "indecent." Indeed, Time Warner appears to have decided

in advance that all leased access programming now cablecast

after a certain hour is "indecent," regardless of the actual

content of the individual show.  These policies will almost

certainly result in disputes about particular programs.  Yet

the Time Warner policy includes no procedure for an

expeditious judicial hearing in compliance with Freedman.

[fn 14]



     In sum, the failure of Section 10 to include a

mechanism for prompt judicial review in which cable

companies bear the burden of proving the material in

question indecent renders Section 10 unconstitutional on

this account as well.   



     4.   Section 10 unconstitutionally abridges the right

of individuals to receive constitutionally protected

expression free from stigma and the compelled disclosure of

their identities.



   This past term, in McIntyre v. Ohio Election Commission,

_ U.S. _, 131 L.Ed.2d (1995), the Supreme Court reaffirmed

that individuals must presumptively be permitted to engage

in First Amendment activity without disclosing their

identities.  At issue in McIntyre was an Ohio statute that

prohibited the distribution of anonymous campaign

literature.  In holding the provision unconstitutional, the

Court noted that the statute restricted "core political

speech" and could therefore be upheld only if it were

"narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest."

McIntyre, 131 L.Ed.2d at 440.  At bottom, the Court

concluded that the statute could not survive such scrutiny

and must be invalidated just as the Court had previously

invalidated a similar Los Angeles ordinance thirty-five

years earlier.  Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60 (1960).



   McIntyre involved the constitutional right to engage in

political speech.  But the Supreme Court has long held that

the First Amendment protects not merely the right to speak

but the right to receive information.  Board of Education v.

Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 867 (1982) (right to receive information

and ideas "is an inherent corollary of the rights of free

speech and press that are explicitly guaranteed by the

Constitution . . ."); Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S.

301, 308 (1965) (Brennan, J., concurring: "The dissemination

of ideas can accomplish nothing if otherwise willing

addressees are not free to receive and consider them.  It

would be a barren marketplace of ideas that had only sellers

and no buyers").



    Moreover, although the McIntyre Court applied "exacting

scrutiny" to the Ohio statute because the law affected "core

political speech," the Court has made it clear on many

occasions that "exacting scrutiny" will be applied, as well,

even for non-political and artistic expression when

government regulates such expression on the basis of content

(although here much of movants' programming indisputably

involves core political speech).  Simon & Schuster v. Crime

Victims Board, ___ U.S. ___ 116 L.Ed.2d 476, 488 (1991)

(exacting scrutiny applied to state law that imposed

content-based limitations upon the ability of criminals to

write a book or sell television or movie rights to their

crime stores); see also Southeastern Promotions v. Conrad,

420 U.S. 546, 558 ("no reason to hold theatre [and

theatrical performances] subject to a drastically different

[First Amendment] standard" from that applied to other forms

of expression).



   In addition, a principal concern of both McIntyre and

Lamon applies with equal force here.  In McIntyre, the Court

noted that an individual's desire for "anonymity may be

motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by

concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to

preserve as much of one's privacy as possible,"  McIntyre,

131 L.Ed.2d at 436.  In Lamont, the Court had no doubt that

an "affirmative obligation" to request mail that the

government has stigmatized as "subversive" was an

unconstitutional abridgement of the First Amendment and

would have "a deterrent effect, especially as respects those

who have sensitive positions."  Lamont, 381 U.S. at 307.



   The fear of social ostracism and the desire to preserve

privacy are equally implicated by the procedure mandated by

Section 10(b) of the 1992 Act.  As Judge Wald pointed out in

Alliance, the requirement that individuals affirmatively

request cable programming that has been labeled as

"indecent" "clearly implies governmental disapproval of the

speech in question, and it is beyond cavil that some stigma

attaches to a written request to receive it."  Alliance, 56

F.3d at 135 (Wald, J., dissenting). And even if, contrary to

common sense, the government cannot be said to be

stigmatizing indecent programming, it remains clear that

social mores and sensibilities condemn much of the material

targeted by Section 10.  Thus, as Judge Wald correctly

observed, "[m]any viewers . . . may not want a steady stream

of 'indecent' speech, and probably do not want to be

perceived (even by their cable operator, much less anyone

who might later acquire such information by subpoena or

otherwise) as the kind of people who do." Alliance, 56 F.3d

at 136 (Wald, J., dissenting).



   For these reasons, the requirement of Section 10(b) that

subscribers affirmatively and in writing request "indecent"

programming must be understood to impose a substantial

burden on the receipt of information and communication.

This burden can be upheld only if necessary to achieve an

overriding interest.  As discussed above, this requirement

is entirely unnecessary, since there is no evidence that the

lockbox mechanism inadequately protects against

inappropriate access by minors to the material that is the

subject of Section 10.



   5.   Section 10 to the 1992 Cable Act deviates

impermissibly from the constitutionally compelled regime

recognized by the 1984 Cable Act.



   Cable companies perform two discrete functions.  First,

they serve as conduits for the transmission of cable

signals.  Second, in deciding what programming will be

transmitted over their systems, they serve as editors and

producers of cable programming.  When cable companies decide

to provide such channels as HBO or Showtime or ESPN, they

perform an editorial function.  But when cable companies

provide public and leased access channels -- and do so not

voluntarily but because they are compelled to do so by law

or by virtue of a franchise agreement -- the companies are

acting simply as conduits for the speech of others.



   This conception of the separate functions of cable

companies is a fundamental predicate of the 1984 Cable Act.

Under that Act, a cable television franchise was regarded as

embracing a bundle of channels.  So understood, when a

municipal franchising authority granted a franchise to a

cable company in exchange for allowing the company to dig up

the streets or to string cables across public rights-of-way,

the municipality commonly reserved several of the company's

channels as electronic soapboxes for public and leased

access cablecasting.  These public and leased access

channels never became the property of the cable company in

the sense that the company never acquired editorial dominion

over them.  As to these channels, the cable companies were

asked by the municipalities to function simply as conduits.

See, Midwest Video v. FCC, 571 F.2d 1025, 1051 (8th Cir.

1978).  In this regard, the access channels were reserved as

public fora -- although perhaps more in a "metaphysical

sense than in a spatial or geographic sense."  Rosenberger

v. Rectors and Visitors of University of Virginia, ___ U.S.

___, 132 L.Ed.2d 700, 716 (1995).



   In Alliance, Circuit Judge Randolph, writing for the en

banc Court, argued that the First Amendment did not compel

this conception regarding the dual functions of cable

companies.  According to the Alliance majority, the First

Amendment did not require the 1984 Cable Act to be designed

the way it was, "and it certainly did not compel prohibiting

cable operators from exercising any editorial control over

access programming." Alliance, 56 F.3d at 114-115.  Upon

this premise, Judge Randolph concluded that Congress was

entirely free from constitutional constraint in altering the

1984 scheme.[fn 15]



     On this issue Judge Randolph is quite wrong.  The

conception recognized by Section 612 of the 1984 Cable Act

was constitutionally compelled.  Without that conception,

the entire regime of leased and public access channels would

be constitutionally suspect, if not invalid.  If leased and

public access channels were regarded ab initio as property

of private cable companies, it follows that neither the

federal government nor state or local governments could

compel the companies to cablecast any programming that they,

in the exercise of their editorial discretion, did not wish

to transmit.  It is axiomatic that the First Amendment right

to speak embraces, as well, the right not to speak, and

government cannot compel private entities to convey messages

with which they disagree.  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.

Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1965); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S.

705 (1977).



   It therefore follows that the only constitutionally

acceptable regime under which public and leased access may

operate is the one recognized by the 1984 Cable Act.  Under

that regime, cable companies have no editorial dominion over

public and leased access channels.  They have neither

control over nor responsibility for the content of

programming on these channels, and they must be immune from

liability flowing from such content.  These access channels

are simply not the property of the cable companies retained

for use by the public.



   Section 10 deviates markedly and impermissibly from the

constitutionally-driven conception of public and leased

access channels contemplated by the 1984 Act.  



     B.   Time Warner's Newly Announced Policy Cannot Be

Sustained Under the Authority of Section 10 of the 1992 Act.



   As noted above, the 1992 Act compels cable companies

either to ban indecent programming or to block the signal of

such programming.  If a cable company chooses to ban such

programming, it may do so under Section 10(a) of the statute

if, after promulgating a written and published policy

prohibiting indecency, it reasonably believes that certain

programming contains indecent material.



   Thus, under the fundamental structure of Section 10, if a

cable company chooses to impose a total prohibition of

indecent programming, it must do so under the procedures set

forth in Section 10(a).  If, however, a cable company elects

not to ban such programming but instead to block or scramble

the signal, it must do so under the Section 10(b) procedure.

This is the only sensible reading of the statute.  For if

Congress had intended to allow cable companies either to ban

or to block indecent programming by using the procedures and

standards set forth in Section 10(a), Section 10(b) would

have been utterly unnecessary and its direction to the FCC

to develop procedures for scrambling programs utterly

superfluous.  It follows therefore that Time Warner --

having elected to scramble and not to ban "indecent"

programming -- must employ the procedures mandated by

Section 10(b) of the 1992 enactment and cannot rely upon

Section 10(a) procedures.



   Nor can Time Warner's scrambling policy rest on the first

sentence of 47 U.S.C. Section 532(h), which now provides

that leased access programming "shall not be provided, or

shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable

service in the judgment of the franchising authority or

cable operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community

standards in that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or

indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of

the United States~."  This provision provides no authority

for the Time Warner scrambling policy for two reasons.

First, the above-quoted language -- which appeared in the

1984 Act -- can only be interpreted as a prohibition against

expression unprotected by the Constitution, to wit,

"obscenity."  Despite the use of the words "lewd,

lascivious, filthy or indecent," this language, like

identical language in analogous statutes, only reaches

constitutionally-unprotected obscenity; any other result

would violate the First Amendment.  See United States v. 12

200-Foot Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123, 130 n.7 (1973);

Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 112-13 (1974).



   This first sentence of 47 U.S.C. Section 532(h) provides

no support for Time Warner for a second reason.  Even if it

could be read as imposing a requirement on cable companies

either to ban or to impose other "conditions" upon indecent

programming, the first sentence of 532(h) does not purport

to identify the procedures that should be employed in

banning or in imposing other such conditions.  Those

procedures are left to other provisions of the 1992 Act.

And, as discussed above, if the cable company opts for a

total prohibition, it must use the procedures set forth in

Section 10(a), now codified in the second sentence of 47

U.S.C. 532(h).  If the cable company chooses the scrambling

option, it must comply with the procedures set forth in

Section 10(b) and the FCC's implementing regulations.



   Section 10(b) of the statute is not self-executing.  This

statutory provision depends entirely on the implementation

of regulations by the FCC, and, as noted, those regulations

have been stayed pending disposition of certiorari petitions

in the Alliance litigation.  See, F.R.A.P. Rule 41(b).



   Moreover, even if the FCC regulations had not been stayed

and even if Section 10(b) were currently in effect, that

provision provides no authority for Time Warner's scrambling

policy because the policy fails to comply with the

procedures set forth in Section 10(b).  Under Section 10(b),

the identification of programs that qualify as "indecent" is

left to the programs' producers.  Thus, Section 10(b)

provides in part that "the Commission shall promulgate

regulations . . . requiring cable operators to place on a

single channel all indecent programs, as identified by

program providers . . . [and] requiring cable operators to

block such single channel unless the subscriber requests

access to such channel in writing."  47 U.S.C. S 532(j)(1)

(emphasis supplied).



   Nowhere in Section 10(b) or its regulations is there any

provision authorizing cable companies to identify programs

as "indecent" and then to scramble those programs.  Yet

under Time Warner's policy it alone -- and not the program's

producer -- will have the right to identify programs as

"indecent" and then scramble those programs.



    Further, nowhere does Section 10(b) authorize a cable

company to impose sanctions on a program provider for

failure properly to identify whether a particular program is

or is not "indecent." Nevertheless, Time Warner's policy

arrogates such authority to the cable company.



   For all of these reasons, Time Warner's policy cannot be

said to rest upon Section 10 of the 1992 Act.  By its terms,

Section 10(a) sets forth the procedures to be employed by a

cable company that chooses to impose a total prohibition

against indecent programming.  Section 10(b) directs the FCC

to develop different procedures for companies that seek to

scramble such programming. Time Warner has adopted a

"scrambling" policy and, therefore, cannot use the

procedures set forth in Section 10(a).  Time Warner can

derive no authority from Section 10(b) because this

provision has effectively been stayed and because the Time

Warner policy fails to adhere to the procedures mandated by

Section 10(b).  Thus, even if, arguendo, Section 10 of the

1992 Cable Act were found to be constitutional, this statute

cannot serve as authority for Time Warner's scrambling

policy.



   C.   If Time Warner's Policy Does Not Rest upon Section

10 Of 1992 Act, it Violates Section 829 of the New York

Executive Law.



   New York Executive Law Section 829 is entitled

"Censorship Prohibited."  It provides that "[n]o cable

television company may prohibit or limit any program or

class or type of program presented over a leased channel or

any channel made available for public access or educational

purposes."  If Time Warner's policy of scrambling movants'

leased access programs cannot rest on the authority of

Section 10 -- either because Section 10 is unconstitutional

or because the Section 10(b) regulations have been stayed or

because the policy fails to comply with the procedures

mandated by Section 10 -- the policy violates Section 829 of

the New York Executive Law.  For there can be little doubt

that the policy seeks to limit and discriminate against

certain leased access programming on the basis of its

content.



   Moreover, Time Warner cannot defend its scrambling policy

in the face of the claim that it violates Section 829 by

asserting that this provision of state law has been

pre-empted by federal law. Section 636(b) of the federal

Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section  556(b), provides that

"[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to restrict

a State from exercising jurisdiction with regard to cable

services consistent with this subchapter."  Consequently, if

Section 10 is unconstitutional or has been stayed or is

inapplicable because Time Warner has failed to comply with

its narrow procedural requirements, Section 829 of the New

York Executive Law remains in full force and effect and is

not pre-empted by federal law.  Under such circumstances,

Time Warner's policy is inconsistent with and violates the

New York Executive Law.



   Finally, if Section 10 is found unconstitutional, Time

Warner's policy must be found to violate 47 U.S.C. Section

532(c)(2), which bars cable operators from exerting any

editorial control over leased access programming.  As noted,

Section 10 of the 1992 Act did not amend 532(c)(2) --

although it clearly limited its proscriptive reach. But if

Section 10 is voided as unconstitutional, the full force and

effect of 47 U.S.C. Section 532(c)(2) will be restored.

Under such circumstances the Time Warner policy would

violate not only New York Executive Law Section 829 but also

47 U.S.C. Section 532(c).



II.  MOVANTS WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE INJURY IF A PRELIMINARY

INJUNCTION IS NOT GRANTED, AND THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS TIPS

DECIDEDLY IN FAVOR OF MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO PENDING

DISPOSITION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY ISSUES

RAISED BY THIS CASE.



    The Supreme Court has held that "[t]he loss of First

Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,

unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury."  Elrod v.

Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); see also Abdul Wali v.

Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1026 (2d Cir. (1985).  Because

movants' expressive opportunities are clearly affected

adversely by the Time Warner policy, it is evident that

movants will suffer irreparable injury if the policy is not

enjoined.



    That movants will suffer an adverse impact by virtue of

the new policy cannot seriously be denied.  As Judge Wald's

opinion in Alliance acutely observed, the seriousness of the

impact can be attributed to the realities of television

viewing.  Judge Wald noted:



"The market for "indecent" speech does not break down neatly

speech in their homes, and those who do not. . . .   Many

viewers fall somewhere in between. They may not want a

steady stream of "indecent" speech, and probably do not want

to be perceived (even by their cable operator, must less

anyone who might later acquire such information by subpoena

or otherwise) as the kind of people who do.  They therefore

will not affirmatively write for access to the "indecent"

channel even if they become aware of it.  Yet, given a free

choice in the matter, they might prefer to have unimpeded,

selective access to some but not all programs that fall

within that broad umbrella designation.  Not only

aficionados of the arts or of politics but also the mildly

curious might well decide to watch an "unvarnished"

documentary on the Mapplethorpe exhibit if it is readily

available, for example, but may not write to request an

entire channel of indecency on the chance that this and

similar programs will be included.  They may want to shield

their children from most "indecent" programming, yet may

occasionally find it appropriate to expose older children to

frank, even graphic discussions of sexuality and the AIDS

epidemic, including some programs that might fall within the

FCC's definition of "indecency" (or at any rate are close

enough to the line that cable operators will ban them

altogether or relegate them to the "indecent" channel).

Whether they are "channel surfers" who like to browse before

settling on a program, or "appointment viewers" who prefer

to study a program guide and watch pre-selected programs,

this regulation makes it substantially more difficult for

cable subscribers to selectively control the content of

their viewing on a program-by-program basis.  It thus places

a substantial burden on their speech rights as adult

television viewers, while adding nothing to their ability to

exercise selective control over their children's viewing.

"At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that

each person should decide for him or herself the ideas and

beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and

adherence."  Turner Broadcasting System. Inc. v. FCC. 114

S.Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  So too, when it comes to umpiring

the "decency" of the communications permitted into our

homes, the government's role should be restricted to one

which supports not replaces society's primary institution

for moral education -- the family."



Alliance, 56 F.3d at 136.



     Moreover, as Judge Wald also pointed out,



"only those who identify themselves as having a compelling

interest in receiving the segregated category of speech are

likely to take the special affirmative steps necessary to

receive it. . . .   Others with a milder level of interest

or a lesser commitment to challenging the government's

disapproval may lack the boldness to step forward and

request it, or the initiative to take the affirmative steps

necessary to gain access to the sealed-off information.

Some may never even become aware that the speech may be

received upon special request.  Almost certainly fewer

people will ultimately hear such speech.  And under the new

economic realities of a diminished market for their product

as a result of governmental intervention, potential

producers of such controversial speech will be disinclined

to create it. Thus can government-imposed access barriers

effectively squelch constitutionally-protected speech."



Id. at 135.



    The declarations of movants Al Goldstein, Robin Byrd,

and Lou Maletta provide ample support for these conclusions,

even before Time Warner's scrambling has begun.  There seems

little doubt the movants' programming has already sustained,

and will continue to sustain, real and substantial burdens

as a direct result of Time Warner's new scrambling policy.



    Further, as the Supreme Court has consistently

recognized in cases from Lamont to McIntyre, affirmative

self-identification requirements are a substantial burden on

First Amendment rights and are sure to deter access to

expression and restrict its availability, with resulting

self-censorship pressures, loss of advertising revenues,

and, potentially, the concentration of all "indecent"

programming in the hands of the cable company -- directly

contrary to the explicit purposes of leased access

availability as articulated by Congress in Section 612(a) of

the federal Cable Act.[fn 16]  See I.A.4 supra. In sum, it

cannot be doubted that Time Warner's policy will diminish

the audience that movants will reach.  The only question is

how large the impact will be.  But however large that

impact, it seems indisputable that movants will suffer

irreparable injury if implementation of the policy is not

enjoined.  Further, it also seems indisputable that the

balance of hardships tips decidedly in favor of the issuance

of a preliminary injunction where, as here, the injunction

will simply maintain the status quo pending ultimate

resolution of the important constitutional and statutory

issued raised by this lawsuit.



III. MOVANTS' MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED

COMPLAINT AND TO ADD PARTIES SHOULD BE GRANTED.



A.   Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint



     Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

provides in part as follows:



"A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of

course at any time before a responsive pleading is served

or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading

is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the

trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within

20 days after it is served. Otherwise, a party may amend the

party's pleading only by leave of court or by written

consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely

given when justice so requires."



     Plaintiffs Al Goldstein and Media Ranch, Inc., filed

their original complaint in this action on July 18, 1990.

Subsequently, on February 22, 1993, this Court granted

plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint

pursuant to a stipulation by all counsel dated December 12,

1993.  Thereafter, on March 2, 1993, plaintiffs filed their

Amended Complaint dated November 20, 1992.  The instant

motion seeks leave to file a Second Amended Complaint dated

August 31. 1995. 



     A motion for leave to amend a pleading under

Fed.R.Civ.p. Rule 15(a) should be "freely given when justice

so requires." There are no time constraints placed upon a

party seeking to amend a pleading and courts have the

authority to grant the motion at any time before trial,

during trial, after trial and on remand from an appeal.

Carey v. Beans, 500 F.Supp. 580 (E.D. Pa. 1980), aff'd. 659

F.2d 1065 (3rd. Cir. 1983); Nance v. Gulf Oil Corp., 817

F.2d 1176 (5th Cir. 1987); Textor v. Board of Regents, 711

F.2d 1387 (7th Cir. 1983); Columbia v. Paul N. Howard Co.,

707 F.2d 338 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 893

(1983).



    Rule 15 does not specify the grounds that support a

motion for leave to amend a pleading.  But case law

recognizes the addition of claims or defenses as a valid

ground for seeking leave to amend a complaint.  Freedman v.

Bee Machine Co., 319 U.S. 448 (1943).  A request for

additional or different relief than originally demanded as

well as the addition and/or substitution of parties to an

action are also well-recognized grounds for amending a

pleading under Rule 15.  United States v. Hougham, 364 U.S.

310 (1960), reh. denied, 364 U.S. 938 (1961); Staggers v.

Otto Gerdau Co., 359 F.2d 292 (2nd Cir. 1966).



   In this case, Time Warner has implemented a new

censorship policy which will supplement its previous

censorship regime. This new policy deeply implicates the

constitutionality of the 1992 Act.  An amended complaint is

an appropriate vehicle to address this new state of affairs.





     In previously agreeing to stay this litigation, this

Court and counsel anticipated that Section 10 and the

constitutional challenge to it in Alliance would affect the

then-pending claims in this lawsuit.  Thus, defendants

cannot reasonably contend that they are surprised by these

proposed amendments or that they serve to work an injustice

upon them.  None of the interests of any litigants in this

case would in any way be prejudiced if the Court grants the

requested Rule 15 relief.  See Byrne v. Buffalo Creek R.

Co., 536 F. Supp. 1301 (S.D.N.Y. 1982).



B.   Motion for Leave to Add Parties



   In addition to the new claims, movants seek Rule 15

relief to add new plaintiffs to the action, all of whom, for

reasons explained below, will be adversely affected by Time

Warner's censorship policy.



   As stated above, a motion for relief under Rule 15 can

properly be grounded on the movant's addition and/or

substitution of parties.  Staggers v. Otto Gerdau Co.,

supra.  Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 21 minimized the harsh

consequences of misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties at

common law by authorizing the addition of parties.  See

United States v. Commercial Bank of North America, 31 F.R.D.

133 (S.D.N.Y. 1962).  In addition, Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 20(a)

allows permissive joinder of parties whenever 1) there is a

question of law or fact common to all the parties and 2)

there is asserted by or against the parties a right to

relief arising out of the same transaction or occurrence or

a series of transactions or occurrences.



     Movants seek to add as plaintiffs in this case Kee-Byrd

Productions, Inc., and Robin-Byrd, its President and

principal, and Gay Cable Network, Inc., and Lou Maletta, its

President and principal, all of whom have filed declarations

confirming their desire to join the case as plaintiffs.  As

is the case with the original plaintiffs, these proposed new

plaintiffs are also producers of leased access programs that

are cablecast on Time Warner's leased access Channel 35 who

have had their programming subject to censorship by Time

Warner through its pre-screening requirements.  In addition,

all of the plaintiffs in the proposed Second Amended

Complaint are subject to the new scrambling policy announced

by Time Warner and are therefore adversely affected by that

proposed censorship.  Undoubtedly, each of these parties

would have standing individually to institute their own

actions. The purpose of Rule 20, in authorizing the

permissive joining of these parties, is to promote trial

convenience and to expedite the final determination of

disputes, thereby preventing multiple lawsuits.  Mosely v.

General Motors Corp., 497 F.2d 1330 (8th Cir. 1974); Fair

Housing Development Fund Corp. v. Burke, 55 F.R.D. 414

(S.D.N.Y. 1972).  Clearly, this Court would achieve this

purpose by granting the requested relief.





   CONCLUSION



     For the foregoing reasons, movants' motion for a

preliminary injunction and for leave to file a Second

Amended Complaint should be granted.

1.  "Leased access" channels along with "public access"

channels are those channels that have been reserved for

communication and expression by individuals and entities who

would not otherwise gain communicative access to the cable

system if decisions about access were left exclusively to

the editorial discretion or business judgments of the cable

companies. In this sense, "access" channels have long been

understood as electronic fora that were are not under the

editorial control of cable companies but are reserved in the

interest of diverse and pluralistic expression. Among the

"access" channels, "leased access" differs from "public

access" in that "leased access" programming may include

commercial advertisements while "public access" channels

must remain commercial-free. A discussion of the background

and purposes of Section 612 of the 1984 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C.

Section 532, the first federal legislation dealing with

leased access channels, is contained in this Court's opinion

in Media Ranch. Inc.. v. Manhattan Cable Television. Inc.,

757 F. Supp. 310, 313-14 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) ("Media Ranch").



2.  A copy of Section 10 as enacted is annexed to the

affirmation of Kenneth P. Norwick as Exhibit "A.



3.   Bringing cable wire to each home, office building,

hotel and restaurant within a community was well understood

as a time-consuming and expensive proposition. And, in urban

settings -- where such a process involved digging up the

streets and sidewalks it was also seen as a disruptive

undertaking. Thus, it was anticipated that, as a practical

matter, in most communities only one franchise would be

awarded for a defined geographic region.



4.  A copy of the First Report and Order is annexed to the

affirmation of Kenneth P. Norwick as Exhibit "B."



5.  Copies of the three stay orders issued by the D.C.

Circuit in Alliance are annexed to the affirmation of

Kenneth P. Norwick as Exhibit "C."



6. After the panel decision and before rehearing en banc in

Alliance, a federal district court in California also

declared Section 10(a) and Section 10(c) of the 1992 Act to

be unconstitutional. Altmann v. Television Signal Corp., 849

F.Supp. 1335 (N.D.Cal. 1994).



7.  A Copies of that policy statement and Time Warner's

press release announcing it are annexed to the affirmation

of Kenneth P. Norwick as Exhibit "D."



8.  If this interpretation of Time Warner's policy is

correct, it means that programming will be scrambled even if

it does not in fact qualify as "indecent" under Time

Warner's own definition and interpretation of that term.

Thus, for example, if a program offered by a movant during

its regular leased access time period consisted entirely of

a round-table discussion of the constitutionality of Time

Warner's new policy, that program would nevertheless still

be scrambled by Time Warner as "indecent"



9.  This Court need not decide whether exposure to

"indecent" speech actually harms minors; at least one

respected appellate Judge has noted the absence of any

evidence that it does. See Alliance, 56 F.3d 105 at 145

(Edwards, J. dissenting, in part).



10.   As evidence of the haste and absence of consideration

given to the adoption of Section 10, it is noteworthy that

although Section 10 significantly altered the 1984

legislative scheme under which cable companies were

prohibited from censoring the content of leased access

programming, nothing in Section 10 actually amended the

provision of the 1984 Cable Act, Section 612(c)(2), that

prohibits cable companies from engaging in content-based

discrimination. Thus, Section 612(c)(2) of the 1984 Cable

Act remains unamended by Section 10 of the 1992 Act.



11.  See Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991,1004 (1982)



12.  The vagueness problem is far more acute here than in

Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d 1540-41, because the

dial-a-porn definition of indecency did not embrace whatever

a particular entity may "reasonably believe" is "patently

offensive" according to "community standards." Dial also did

not involve certification or oath requirements, with their

well-recognized chilling effect. See Baggett v. Bullitt. 377

U.S. 360, 371 (1964).



13.   For example, consider the FCC's fines against radio

stations that broadcast Howard Stern and others for

"off-color" jokes and puns, see Nudelman, "A Chilly Wait in

Radioland," 2 Jrnl. Law & Policy 115 (1994); Soocher,

"Explaining FCC Indecency Standards: Howard Stern's Radio

Flap," 8 Ent.Law & Fin 3 (Jan. 1993); "FCC Fines Radio

Station Owner $600,000 Due to Howard Stern's Airing of

'Indecent' Material," 14 Ent. L. Rptr. No. 8 (Jan. 1993).

See also United States v. Evergreen, 832 F.Supp. 1179, 1183

(N.D. Ill. 1993) (FCC indecency fines imposed for talk-show

discussions of Miss America photos in Penthouse Magazine and

song with sexual innuendos). . Consider, as well, that in

Pacifica mere "vulgar" words were considered "indecent" and

the radio station could marshal no defense resting upon the

"serious value" of the material as social satire. FCC v.

Pacifica Foundation 438 U.S. 726 (1978).



14.    Because Time Warner has established no procedure to

resolve disputes about particular programs and because Time

Warner apparently will not undertake program-by-program

determinations, this case involves the systemic failure to

provide a procedure that would comply with Freedman Should

such a procedure be developed or should movants' systemic

challenge be rejected, movants reserve the right to

challenge Time Warner determinations with respect to

particular shows in another proceeding and perhaps another

forum.



15.  Upon this premise, Judge Randolph also rejected

petitioner's "public forum" analysis. In this regard, Judge

Randolph stated that "a 'public forum' or even a 'nonpublic

forum,' in First Amendment parlance [always involves]

government property" and "state action is present because

the property is the government's and the government is doing

the restricting." Alliance, 56 F.3d at 121. Judge Randolph

was not correct in asserting that the First Amendment public

forum doctrine only applies to government property. See

Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kansas City, 723

F.Supp. 1347, 1351-52 (W.D. Mo. 1989) (public access channel

is public forum; forum analysis "has never rested entirely

on the status of its owner"); U.S. Postal Service v. Council

of Greenburgh Civic Ass'n, 453 U.S. 114 (1981) (private

mailboxes are public forum); Southwestern Promotions, Ltd.

v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975) (privately owned theater

leased to government was public forum); Cornelius v. NAACP

Legal Defense & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 801 (1985) (public

fora include "private property dedicated to public use").

More importantly, however, Judge Randolph was wrong to

conclude that the public and leased access channels are the

property of the cable companies in any way other than in a

caretaker or custodial sense. And, as discussed above, this

custodial or conduit function is constitutionally compelled.





16.   Indeed, Congress in 1992 added as a purpose of leased

access availability the desire "to promote competition in

the delivery of diverse sources of video programming." 47

U.S.C. Section 532(a).

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff BRIAN CAMPBELL was at all times material hereto a
resident of Tempe, Arizona. Plaintiff SONJA VINSON-CAMPBELL is Brian
Campbell's natural mother and his legal guardian; Plaintiff GEORGE A.
VINSON is Brian Campbell's step-father and legal guardian. Defendant
TEMPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT is a school district in the State of
Arizona, charged with educating the youth of the state. At all times
material hereto Plaintiff BRIAN CAMPBELL was a student at the Wood
School, an elementary school within the control of Defendant TEMPE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. Defendant MINNESOTA EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING
CORPORATION (MECC) (hereinafter referred to as "MECC") was at all
times material hereto a Minnesota corporation. Defendant MECC produced
and distributed the computer game at issue to Defendant TEMPE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. This Court has jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. Section 1331 and 42 U.S.C. Sections 1981, 1983, and 1988.
Plaintiff invokes the pendent jurisdiction of this Court to hear the
claims based on State law. 

2. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1391. 

COUNT ONE

(42 U.S.C. Section 1983)

3. On September 14, 1994 Brian Campbell was a student at the Wood
School, an elementary school in the Defendant TEMPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
DISTRICT school system. Brian Campbell was compelled by Arizona law to
attend school on the date in question. 

4. On that day, Brian Campbell was using one of the computers provided
by the school with his classmates. The computer had been previously
loaded by representatives of the School District with various software
programs for the use of the school children. On of these software
programs was a computer game called "Freedom." 

5. The game Freedom purports to place the student in the shoes of an
escaped African-American slave in pre-Civil War America. The object of
this game is for the student to attempt to escape from the South, to
the North via a route not unlike the Underground Railroad used by
slaves during that era. The game consists of both text and graphics. 

6. The player is told that he is illiterate as he begins the game. The
player is then forced to make a variety of choices while being pursued
by the authorities. If the slave is caught, he is returned to the deep
south where he is once again enslaved. 

7. The slave is refereed to in derogatory terms throughout the game,
(i.e. "boy"), and is told that he will be beaten upon return to the
South. 

8. Plaintiff BRIAN CAMPBELL was subjected to the humiliation of
playing this game in front of his peers and classmates. 

9. Other individuals had complained to school officials about the
nature of this "game" on at least one prior occasion, but this
complaint was ignored. It was the policy of the school district to
leave this "game" in the computer system despite the complaints of
parents. 

10. School officials, acting under color of law, made the decision to
install this game on the school computers, and to leave the game
there, even after receiving at least one complaint about the game. 

11. These actions by the school officials constitute a violation of
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution as well as the civil rights of Plaintiff BRIAN
CAMPBELL as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 et seq. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against the Defendants, and
each of them, as follows: 

1. For special damages in an amount to be determined herein; 

2. For general damages in a just and reasonable amount; 

3. For Plaintiff's cost of suit incurred herein; 

4. For Plaintiff's attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1988.


5. For prejudgment interest on all liquidated sums; and 

6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
proper. 


COUNT TWO

(Negligence)

12. Plaintiffs hereby re-allege all factual allegations contained in
Count One with the same force and effect as if set forth fully herein.


13. Defendant TEMPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT knew or should have
known that allowing the computer game "Freedom" to remain in the
school's computer system, and to be used by students at the school,
was likely to result in severe emotional distress to those students of
African- American descent. Despite this knowledge, officials of the
school district failed to remove the game from the system, or to
provide adequate supervision so that the game would not be offensive
to members of the Plaintiffs' race. Defendant had a duty to protect
Plaintiffs from this racially discriminatory computer game. Defendant
breached that duty by failing to remove the game or properly supervise
its use. 

14. Defendant MECC was negligent in designing the game "Freedom" and
in distributing that game to schools throughout the country without
adequate instruction to school officials regarding proper supervision
of students while the game is played. 

15. As a proximate result of Defendants' negligence, Plaintiffs have
sustained bodily injuries and permanent damages, including severe
emotional distress; that Plaintiffs by reason of said injuries, have
suffered and will, in the future, suffer great pain and anxiety; that
Plaintiffs have, and will incur in the future, medical and related
expenses as a result of said injuries, as well as other miscellaneous
expenses. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against the Defendant as
follows: 

1. For special damages in an amount to be determined herein; 

2. For general damages in a just and reasonable amount; 

3. For Plaintiffs' cost of suit incurred herein; 

4. For prejudgment interest on all liquidated damages; and 

5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
proper. 


COUNT THREE

(INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS) 

16. Plaintiffs hereby re-allege all factual allegations contained in
Counts One and Two with the same force and effect as if set forth
fully herein. 

17. Defendant MECC designed, produced and distributed the computer
game "Freedom" knowing that students of African-American descent would
be exposed to the game. Defendant MECC knew of the offensive nature of
the game, but failed to provide proper guidance to the schools
regarding use of the game. Defendant MECC's conduct in distributing
this game with the discriminatory graphics and language was extreme
and outrageous. Defendant MECC recklessly disregarded how this game
would affect students of African-American descent. Defendant's actions
have caused Plaintiffs to suffer severe emotional distress. 

18. As a proximate result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiffs have
sustained bodily injuries and permanent damages, including severe
emotional distress; that Plaintiffs by reason of said injuries, have
suffered and will, in the future, suffer great pain and anxiety; that
Plaintiffs have, and will incur in the future, medical and related
expenses as a result of said injuries, as well as other miscellaneous
expenses. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against the Defendant as
follows: 

1. For special damages in an amount to be determined herein; 

2. For general damages in a just and
reasonable amount;

3. For Plaintiffs' cost of suit incurred herein; 

4. For prejudgment interest on all liquidated damages; and 

5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
proper.

FACTS

15.  In September 1994, plaintiff [redacted] Scott, who at the 
time was 15 years old, became aware that she was pregnant. 
[redacted] had not questioned the absence of her menstrual 
period immediately, because her periods were consistently 
irregular.  On Monday, September 26, she informed her 
parents, plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott, that she was 
pregnant as a result of sexual relations with her boyfriend 
[redacted].  Together the plaintiffs decided to have [redacted] 
consult a physician and to consider her options. 

16.  Defendants [redacted] and his mother and stepfather 
Kathy and John Tull had become aware of the pregnancy on 
the afternoon of September 26 because Kathy had [redacted] 
take two home pregnancy tests at the Tulls' house.  Later that 
evening, Kathy and John Tull made an unsolicited visit to the 
Scotts' home.  The Tulls informed the Scotts of their desire to 
help raise [redacted] child, even though [redacted] had not yet 
decided whether or not she would carry her pregnancy to term.  

17.  On Tuesday, September 27, plaintiff [redacted] Scott was 
examined by Dr. Carol Weckmuller at the Blair Medical 
Group.  The family's regular doctor was on vacation at the 
time. [redacted] was accompanied by her mother Connie 
Scott.  Based on a physical examination, Dr. Weckmuller 
informed [redacted] and Connie Scott that she estimated that 
[redacted] was twenty-three weeks pregnant.  Dr. Weckmuller 
advised [redacted] where she could get an abortion, should 
that be her choice. [redacted] Scott informed defendant Kathy 
Tull, by telephone, of the developments that day. 

18.  On Wednesday, September 28, [redacted] spoke at length 
with her family about her options.  After extensive 
deliberation, [redacted] decided to seek an abortion. 

19.  On Wednesday, September 28, [redacted] made an 
appointment by telephone for an abortion.  During the phone 
call, [redacted] spoke to a clinic employee, who asked her a 
series of questions and then explained the abortion procedure 
to her.  Connie Scott also talked to the employee and gave her 
additional information. [redacted] then spoke again with the 
clinic employee, who asked again whether [redacted] really 
wanted an abortion. [redacted] replied yes, and scheduled an 
appointment. 

20.  Early that evening, [the boyfriend] came over to [the 
Scott's] house. [redacted] told him that she planned to have an 
abortion.  He was upset, saying she was killing a baby.  Mid- 
evening Kathy Tull called the Scotts, screaming and saying 
such upsetting things that Connie Scott hung up the telephone. 

21.  Shortly thereafter someone pounded on the Scotts' door.  
Carl Scott went to answer the door, but before he could open 
it, defendant [the boyfriend] kicked the door, causing it to hit 
Carl in the eye and [redacted] across the face.  Present with 
[the boyfriend] at the Scott home were, among others, Kathy  
and John Tull, another Tull family member, and several of 
[the boyfriend]'s friends. They were screaming, calling the 
Scotts "baby killers" and other derogatory names, pulling 
[redacted], and hitting Carl. Connie Scott called the police to 
the house because of the violence against her family.  When 
the police arrived, including defendants Willis, Lager, Thallis, 
Shear and John Does I-VIII, [the boyfriend] struck Officer 
Lager and was arrested.  Kathy Tull assaulted Connie Scott by 
kicking her in the stomach.  Kathy Tull was not arrested.  Two 
officers asked [redacted] if she had made an appointment for 
an abortion, to which she responded, yes. 

22.  At least one deputy from the Sheriff's Department, 
defendant Officer Darrell Howard, arrived at the scene 
separately.  He tried to give [redacted] a manila envelope 
containing anti-abortion literature.  Earlier that day, Officer 
Howard, who is active in the anti-choice movement in Blair, 
had met with the Tulls at their home apparently for the 
purpose of preventing [redacted] from obtaining an abortion.  

23.  After the altercation, the plaintiffs and [redacted]'s 
younger brother went to their cousins' house for the night.  
The plaintiffs had earlier told the police that they would be 
staying at their cousins' home in Blair that night and had given 
the officers their cousins' address.  

24.  That same day, September 28, without [redacted] Scotts' 
consent, defendant Kathy Tull discussed [redacted]'s 
pregnancy and abortion plans with defendants Bagby and 
Jordan apparently for the purpose of preventing [redacted] 
from obtaining an abortion.  Defendants Bagby and Jordan 
cooperated, by writing a letter stating that "any elective 
abortion could potentially cause medical and emotional 
damage to the mother at any stage of pregnancy" and that an 
abortion at twenty-three weeks "could be harmful" to 
[redacted].  (Emphasis added.)  Neither Bagby nor Jordan had 
ever examined or spoken with [redacted].  The letter does not 
state that an abortion at twenty-three weeks is legal and is 
accepted medical practice, nor does it note that carrying to 
term and delivering a child could also be harmful to 
[redacted].  Kathy Tull then took the letter to the Blair police 
station.  Attached as Exhibit A is a copy of that letter. 

25.  At around 12:30 a.m. on Thursday, September 29, the 
plaintiffs were awakened by police at their cousins' house.  
More than ten law enforcement vehicles surrounded the house.  
Present were members of the Blair Police Department, 
including defendants Lager, Thallis and Shear, as well as 
county officers.  The police took [redacted] into custody.  
They did so for the purpose of preventing [redacted] from 
obtaining an abortion.  

26.  The Scotts were told that [redacted] was being taken into 
protective custody.  The police offered the Scotts little 
explanation as to why [redacted] was being taken into custody 
except to show them the letter from defendants Bagby and 
Jordan, and to say that defendant John E. Samson, the County 
Attorney, had directed them to take [redacted] into custody.  
The police told the Scotts there would be a hearing at 9 a.m. 
that morning, and advised them to get an attorney.  They did 
not inform the plaintiffs where they were taking [redacted] or 
what they would do with her.  The plaintiffs were extremely 
frightened and confused by the police removing [redacted] in 
the middle of the night to an undisclosed place for an 
undefined purpose. 

27. [redacted] was taken by the police to the Blair police 
station. [redacted] was at the police station for several hours.  
During this time, the police did not give her written notice of 
the reasons she was taken into custody.  During this time, 
[redacted] also noticed anti-choice materials on one of the 
lockers in the station. 


28.  After several hours at the police station, [redacted] was 
transported to the home of a foster family who were strangers 
to her.  At approximately 3:30 a.m., plaintiffs Connie and Carl 
Scott received a call from Deborah Bales, whom they did not 
know, but who identified herself as being with the Nebraska 
Department of Social Services.  Ms. Bales informed the Scotts 
that [redacted] was safe and urged them to get an attorney. 

29.  Early Thursday morning, September 29, plaintiffs Connie 
and Carl Scott sought and obtained counsel.  Their attorney 
was informed by defendant County Attorney Samson that no 
hearing would be held that day because there were no judges 
in town.  Plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott were not told when 
a hearing would be held, nor were they given the option of 
going to another town to appear before a judge in order to 
avoid further delay. 

30.  On Thursday morning, defendant County Attorney John 
Samson interrogated [redacted] Scott. [redacted] was alone 
throughout the questioning, even though defendant Samson 
knew that she was under eighteen years of age and that her 
parents were available.  Defendant Samson further knew that 
the Scotts had retained counsel.  Defendant Samson also 
refused Deborah Bales' requests that he release [redacted].  
Instead, he filed a baseless petition with the Washington 
County Juvenile Court under the child protection law, alleging  
that [redacted] was in a situation dangerous to life or limb or 
injurious to her health.  The only stated reasons for the 
petition were that plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott "had made 
arrangements" for [redacted] Scott to obtain an abortion and 
that defendant Bagby had provided a letter to law enforcement 
officials stating that an elective abortion could be harmful to 
[redacted].  A copy of the petition is attached as Exhibit B. 

31.  On Thursday, September 29, the Scotts discovered that 
fliers had been posted all over Blair stating that plaintiffs Carl 
and Connie Scott were "murderers."  Members of [the 
boyfriend's] family and his friends were responsible for 
posting the fliers. 

32.  On Friday afternoon, September 30, the Honorable F.A. 
Gossett, III, of Juvenile Court of Washington County held a 
hearing regarding [redacted].  No guardian ad litem or 
attorney was ever appointed to represent [redacted]'s interests. 

33.  At the hearing, County Attorney Samson filed an 
Amended Petition alleging that [redacted] was in a situation 
dangerous or injurious to her health or morals and that she was 
being neglected by her parents.  These allegations were based 
solely on the assertion that [redacted] was twenty-three weeks 
pregnant and considering an abortion. The only evidence put 
forth by Samson was the letter from defendants Bagby and 
Jordan (Ex. A), who had never examined or spoken to 
[redacted], stating that they believed an abortion at twenty-
three weeks could be harmful to [redacted].  A copy of the 
Amended Petition is attached as Exhibit C. 

34.  The petition filed by defendant County Attorney Samson 
stated that the allegations against plaintiffs Connie and Carl 
Scott were based on reports to "Law Enforcement." The Scotts 
did not, however, receive written notification of the 
investigation from the state Department of Social Services.  
Nor were any of the other procedures typically associated with 
a child abuse or neglect investigation followed, such as the 
appointment of a guardian ad litem for [redacted]. 

35.  Upon consideration of the Amended Petition, Judge 
Gossett stated that [redacted] should not have been removed 
from the Scotts' custody.  Judge Gossett ordered that the 
temporary placement of [redacted] with the Department of 
Social Services be terminated, and further ordered that 
[redacted] be released to the custody of her parents "on the 
condition that no abortion shall be performed on the subject's 
unborn child without further order of the Court." The order 
provides that any violation of its terms is punishable as 
contempt.   A copy of the Order is attached as Exhibit D. 

36.  Subsequent to the hearing, [redacted] obtained protective 
orders from the District Court of Washington County against 
Kathy Tull and [redacted] prohibiting them from harassing 
[redacted] and entering the Scott home. These orders became 
permanent on October 14, 1994, and are still in effect. 

37.  After the incident, [the boyfriend] tried repeatedly to 
contact [redacted].  His friends followed [redacted] when she 
left the house in Blair. [redacted] was threatened with assault. 
[redacted] became afraid to leave the house alone.  School in 
Blair became so threatening that [redacted] was tutored at 
home. [redacted] was so upset by the events that she had to 
seek the advice and support of a counselor.  Connie and Carl 
Scott were also harassed. Because of the trauma to their 
family caused by these events and the ongoing harassment, 
Connie and Carl Scott decided to move from Blair.  They 
wanted [redacted] to be able to return to school and again be 
with peers.  Despite the move and passage of time, [redacted] 
continues to have nightmares. 

38.  Subsequent to the events, [the boyfriend] pleaded guilty 
to assaulting a police officer at the Scotts' house and was 
placed on probation for one year. 

39.  In December 1994, [redacted] gave birth to a baby, whom 
she is raising in [redacted]'s parents' home. 

40.  On September 22, 1995, the plaintiffs served upon 
defendants Washington County, John E. Samson, Darrell 
Howard, Kevin Willis, City of Blair, Joseph Lager, Nicholas 
Thallis, Benjamin Shear, and John Doe I-VII tort claim 
notices in the form required and provided in such cases by the 
laws of the State of Nebraska concerning claims of trespass, 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy 
and interference with the rights to reproductive choice, family 
integrity, due process, and freedom from illegal search and 
seizure as guaranteed by the Nebraska Constitution.

Nebraska law, delaying the appearance before a judge for over 
29 hours, while refusing to release [redacted], the defendants, 
willfully participating in joint activity, deprived the plaintiffs

plaintiffs were staying, taking [redacted] into custody, forcibly 
removing her from home and her parents without a judicial

Case No. CCT/3/94

In the matter of:

THE STATE

versus

T MAKWANYANE AND M MCHUNU


Heard on:     15 February to 17 February 1995

Delivered on:  6 June 1995
______________________________________________________________


                           JUDGMENT

______________________________________________________________



[1]  CHASKALSON  P:   The  two accused  in  this  matter  were
     convicted  in  the Witwatersrand Local  Division  of  the
     Supreme  Court  on four counts of murder,  one  count  of
     attempted   murder  and  one  count   of   robbery   with
     aggravating circumstances.  They were sentenced to  death
     on  each  of  the counts of murder and to long  terms  of
     imprisonment on the other counts.  They appealed  to  the
     Appellate  Division  of  the Supreme  Court  against  the
     convictions   and  sentences.   The  Appellate   Division
     dismissed the appeals against the convictions and came to
     the conclusion that the circumstances of the murders were
     such   that  the  accused  should  receive  the  heaviest
     sentence permissible according to law.

[2]  Section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act No. 51 of
     1977  prescribes that the death penalty  is  a  competent
     sentence for murder.  Counsel for the accused was invited
     by  the  Appellate  Division  to  consider  whether  this
     provision  was  consistent with  the  Republic  of  South
     Africa  Constitution, 1993, which  had  come  into  force
     subsequent  to the conviction and sentence by  the  trial
     court.  He argued that it was not, contending that it was
     in  conflict with the provisions of sections 9 and  11(2)
     of the Constitution.

[3]  The  Appellate Division dismissed the appeals against the
     sentences on the counts of attempted murder and  robbery,
     but  postponed the further hearing of the appeals against
     the  death  sentence until the constitutional issues  are
     decided by this Court.  See:  S v Makwanyane en  n  Ander
     1994  (3)  SA  868  (A).  Two issues  were  raised:   the
     constitutionality of section 277(1)(a)  of  the  Criminal
     Procedure Act, and the implications of section 241(8)  of
     the Constitution.  Although there was no formal reference
     of  these issues to this Court in terms of section 102(6)
     of the Constitution, that was implicit in the judgment of
     the  Appellate Division, and was treated as such  by  the
     parties.

[4]  The trial was concluded before the 1993 Constitution came
     into  force, and so the question of the constitutionality
     of  the  death  sentence  did not  arise  at  the  trial.
     Because evidence which might possibly be relevant to that
     issue would not have been led, we asked counsel appearing
     before  this  Court to consider whether  evidence,  other
     than undisputed information placed before us in argument,
     would  be  relevant to the determination of the  question
     referred to us by the Appellate Division.  Apart from the
     issue of public opinion, with which I will deal later  in
     this judgment, counsel were not able to point to specific
     material that had not already been placed before us which
     might  be  relevant to the decision on the constitutional
     issues raised in this case.  I am satisfied that no  good
     purpose would be served by referring the case back to the
     trial court for the hearing of further evidence and  that
     we  should  deal  with the matter on  the  basis  of  the
     information and arguments that have been presented to us.

[5]  It  would no doubt have been better if the framers of the
     Constitution  had stated specifically,  either  that  the
     death sentence is not a competent penalty, or that it  is
     permissible  in circumstances sanctioned by  law.   This,
     however, was not done and it has been left to this  Court
     to  decide  whether  the penalty is consistent  with  the
     provisions  of the Constitution.  That is the extent  and
     limit of the Court's power in this case.

[6]  No  executions  have  taken place in South  Africa  since
     1989.1  There  are  apparently  over  300  persons,   and
     possibly  as  many  as 400 if persons  sentenced  in  the
     former Transkei, Bophuthatswana and Venda are taken  into
     account,  who have been sentenced to death by the  Courts
     and  who  are on death row waiting for this issue  to  be
     resolved.  Some of these convictions date back  to  1988,
     and  approximately half of the persons on death row  were
     sentenced  more  than  two  years  ago.2   This   is   an
     intolerable  situation and it is  essential  that  it  be
     resolved one way or another without further delay.3

The Relevant Provisions of the Constitution

[7]  The Constitution
     ... provides a historic bridge between the past  of
          a  deeply  divided  society  characterised  by
          strife,   conflict,   untold   suffering   and
          injustice,  and  a  future  founded   on   the
          recognition  of  human rights,  democracy  and
          peaceful    co-existence    and    development
          opportunities   for   all   South    Africans,
          irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or
          sex.4
    
It is   a  transitional  constitution  but  one  which  itself
     establishes  a  new order in South Africa;  an  order  in
     which  human rights and democracy are entrenched  and  in
     which the Constitution:

     ... shall be the supreme law of the Republic and any
          law  or  act  inconsistent with its  provisions
          shall,  unless otherwise provided expressly  or
          by  necessary implication in this Constitution,
          be  of no force and effect to the extent of the
          inconsistency.5

[8]  Chapter   Three  of  the  Constitution   sets   out   the
     fundamental  rights  to which every  person  is  entitled
     under  the  Constitution  and  also  contains  provisions
     dealing  with  the  way in which the  Chapter  is  to  be
     interpreted  by the Courts. It does not deal specifically
     with  the  death  penalty,  but  in  section  11(2),   it
     prohibits  "cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or
     punishment."   There is no definition of what  is  to  be
     regarded  as  "cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading"   and   we
     therefore have to give meaning to these words ourselves.

[9]  In  S  v Zuma and Two Others,6 this Court dealt with  the
     approach  to  be  adopted in the  interpretation  of  the
     fundamental  rights  enshrined in Chapter  Three  of  the
     Constitution.  It gave its approval to an approach which,
     whilst  paying due regard to the language that  has  been
     used,  is "generous" and "purposive" and gives expression
     to  the underlying values of the Constitution.  Kentridge
     AJ,  who  delivered the judgment of the  Court,  referred
     with  approval7 to the following passage in the  Canadian
     case of  R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd:

     The meaning  of  a  right  or freedom guaranteed  by  the
          Charter was to be ascertained by an analysis of  the
          purpose   of  such  a  guarantee;  it  was   to   be
          understood,  in  other words, in the  light  of  the
          interests it was meant to protect.
     In my  view  this analysis is to be undertaken,  and  the
          purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be
          sought  by  reference  to the character  and  larger
          objects  of  the  Charter itself,  to  the  language
          chosen  to articulate the specific right or freedom,
          to  the historical origins of the concept enshrined,
          and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose  of
          the other specific rights and freedoms with which it
          is  associated within the text of the Charter.   The
          interpretation  should be...a generous  rather  than
          legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of a
          guarantee  and  securing for  individuals  the  full
          benefit of the Charter's protection.8
    
          [10]  Without seeking in any way to qualify anything
          that was said in Zuma's case, I need say no more in this
     judgment than that section 11(2) of the Constitution must
     not  be construed in isolation, but in its context, which
     includes  the history and background to the  adoption  of
     the  Constitution, other provisions of  the  Constitution
     itself  and,  in  particular, the provisions  of  Chapter
     Three of which it is part.9  It must also be construed in
     a way which secures for "individuals the full measure" of
     its  protection.10  Rights with which  section  11(2)  is
     associated  in  Chapter  Three of the  Constitution,  and
     which  are of particular importance to a decision on  the
     constitutionality of the death penalty  are  included  in
     section  9, "every person shall have the right to  life",
     section 10, "every person shall have the right to respect
     for and protection of his or her dignity", and section 8,
     "every person shall have the right to equality before the
     law and to equal protection of the law."  Punishment must
     meet  the requirements of sections 8, 9 and 10; and  this
     is  so,  whether  these sections are  treated  as  giving
     meaning  to Section 11(2) or as prescribing separate  and
     independent  standards with which  all  punishments  must
     comply.11
         
     [11]   Mr.  Bizos,  who  represented  the  South  African
     government  at  the hearing of this matter,  informed  us
     that  the government accepts that the death penalty is  a
     cruel,  inhuman  and  degrading punishment  and  that  it
     should be declared unconstitutional. The Attorney General
     of  the Witwatersrand, whose office is independent of the
     government, took a different view, and contended that the
     death  penalty  is  a  necessary and acceptable  form  of
     punishment and that it is not cruel, inhuman or degrading
     within  the meaning of section 11(2).  He argued that  if
     the  framers of the Constitution had wished to  make  the
     death  penalty unconstitutional they would have said  so,
     and that their failure to do so indicated an intention to
     leave  the  issue open to be dealt with by Parliament  in
     the  ordinary way.  It was for Parliament,  and  not  the
     government,  to decide whether or not the  death  penalty
     should  be repealed, and Parliament had not taken such  a
     decision.

Legislative History

[12] The  written  argument  of the South  African  government
     deals  with the debate which took place in regard to  the
     death   penalty   before   the   commencement   of    the
     constitutional  negotiations.  The  information  that  it
     placed  before us was not disputed.  It was  argued  that
     this  background information forms part  of  the  context
     within which the Constitution should be interpreted.

[13] Our   Courts   have  held  that  it  is  permissible   in
     interpreting a statute to have regard to the purpose  and
     background of the legislation in question.

          Certainly  no  less important than the oft  repeated
          statement that the words and expressions used  in  a
          statute  must  be  interpreted  according  to  their
          ordinary meaning is the statement that they must  be
          interpreted in the light of their context.   But  it
          may  be  useful to stress two points in relation  to
          the  application of this principle.   The  first  is
          that "the context", as here used, is not limited  to
          the language of the rest of the statute regarded  as
          throwing light of a dictionary kind on the  part  to
          be  interpreted.   Often of more importance  is  the
          matter  of  the  statute,  its  apparent  scope  and
          purpose, and, within limits, its background.12
         
          [14]  Debates  in  Parliament, including  statements
     made  by  Ministers  responsible  for  legislation,   and
     explanatory  memoranda providing reasons  for  new  bills
     have  not  been admitted as background material.  It  is,
     however,  permissible to take notice of the report  of  a
     judicial commission of enquiry for the limited purpose of
     ascertaining   "the mischief aimed at [by] the  statutory
     enactment in question."13  These principles were  derived
     in  part  from English law.  In England, the courts  have
     recently relaxed this exclusionary rule and have held, in
     Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart14 that, subject to the
     privileges of the House of Commons:
         
               ...reference  to  Parliamentary   material
          should   be   permitted  as  an  aid   to   the
          construction of legislation which is  ambiguous
          or  obscure  or  the literal meaning  of  which
          leads  to  an  absurdity.  Even in  such  cases
          references  in court to Parliamentary  material
          should  only  be permitted where such  material
          clearly discloses the mischief aimed at or  the
          legislative   intention   lying   behind    the
          ambiguous or obscure words.15
              
          [15] As the judgment in Pepper's case shows,  a
     similar  relaxation  of  the exclusionary  rule  has
     apparently taken place in Australia and New Zealand.16
     Whether our Courts should follow these examples  and
     extend the scope of what is admissible as background
          material for the purpose of interpreting statutes
     does  not  arise  in  the  present  case.   We   are
     concerned   with   the   interpretation    of    the
     Constitution, and not the interpretation of ordinary
     legislation.  A constitution is no ordinary statute.
     It  is  the  source  of  legislative  and  executive
     authority.  It determines how the country is  to  be
     governed  and how legislation is to be enacted.   It
     defines the powers of the different organs of State,
     including Parliament, the executive, and the  courts
     as  well  as the fundamental rights of every  person
     which must be respected in exercising such powers.
         
     [16]  In  countries  in which  the  constitution  is
     similarly the supreme law, it is not unusual for the
     courts  to have regard to the circumstances existing
     at  the time the constitution was adopted, including
     the  debates and writings which formed part  of  the
     process.   The  United  States  Supreme  Court  pays
     attention   to  such  matters,  and  its   judgments
     frequently   contain  reviews  of  the   legislative
     history  of  the  provision in  question,  including
     references to debates, and statements made,  at  the
     time   the  provision  was  adopted.17   The  German
     Constitutional  Court  also  has  regard   to   such
     evidence.18  The Canadian Supreme Court has held such
     evidence to be admissible, and has referred  to  the
     historical    background    including    the    pre-
     confederation   debates   for   the    purpose    of
     interpreting    provisions    of    the     Canadian
     Constitution,  although it attaches less  weight  to
     such  information  than  the United  States  Supreme
     Court  does.19   It also has regard  to  ministerial
     statements in Parliament in regard to the purpose of
     particular legislation.20  In India, whilst speeches
     of   individual   members  of  Parliament   or   the
     Convention are apparently not ordinarily admissible,
     the reports of drafting committees can, according to
     Seervai,   "be   a   helpful   extrinsic   aid    to
     construction."21  Seervai cites Kania CJ  in  A.  K.
     Gopalan v The State22 for the proposition that whilst
     not  taking  "...into consideration  the  individual
     opinions  of Members of Parliament or Convention  to
     construe the meaning of a particular clause, when  a
     question  is  raised  whether a  certain  phrase  or
     expression was up for consideration at all or not, a
     reference   to  debates  may  be  permitted."    The
     European  Court  of  Human  Rights  and  the  United
     Nations  Committee on Human Rights all  allow  their
     deliberations    to   be   informed    by    travaux
     prhparatoires.23
    
     [17]   Our   Constitution   was   the   product   of
     negotiations    conducted   at    the    Multi-Party
     Negotiating Process.  The final draft adopted by the
     forum  of  the Multi-Party Negotiating Process  was,
     with few changes, adopted by Parliament.  The Multi-
     Party  Negotiating Process was advised by  technical
     committees,  and the reports of these committees  on
     the   drafts  are  the  equivalent  of  the  travaux
     prhparatoires,  relied  upon  by  the  international
     tribunals.  Such background material can  provide  a
     context  for  the interpretation of the Constitution
     and,  where  it serves that purpose, I  can  see  no
     reason  why  such evidence should be excluded.   The
     precise nature of the evidence, and the purpose  for
     which  it may be tendered, will determine the weight
     to be given to it.

[18] It  has been said in respect of the Canadian constitution
     that:

          ...the  Charter  is not the product  of  a  few
          individual     public     servants,     however
          distinguished,   but  of  a   multiplicity   of
          individuals  who  played  major  roles  in  the
          negotiating,  drafting  and  adoption  of   the
          Charter.   How can one say with any  confidence
          that  within  this  enormous  multiplicity   of
          actors ... the comments of a few federal  civil
          servants can in any way be determinative.24
         
     Our Constitution is also the product of a multiplici
                                                  ty   of

                                                  played.

[19] Background evidence may, however, be useful to  show  why
     particular  provisions were or were not included  in  the
     Constitution.  It is neither necessary nor  desirable  at
     this  stage in the development of our constitutional  law
     to  express  any  opinion on whether  it  might  also  be
     relevant  for other purposes, nor to attempt to lay  down
     general  principles governing the admissibility  of  such
     evidence.   It  is  sufficient  to  say  that  where  the
     background material is clear, is not in dispute,  and  is
     relevant  to  showing why particular provisions  were  or
     were  not  included in the Constitution, it can be  taken
     into account by a Court in interpreting the Constitution.
     These conditions are satisfied in the present case.

[20] Capital  punishment was the subject of debate before  and
     during  the constitution-making process, and it is  clear
     that the failure to deal specifically in the Constitution
     with this issue was not accidental.25

     [21] In February 1990, Mr F W de Klerk, then President of
     the  Republic of South Africa, stated in Parliament  that
     "the  death  penalty  had been the subject  of  intensive
     discussion  in recent months", which had led to  concrete
     proposals for reform under which the death penalty should
     be  retained as an option to be used in "extreme  cases",
     the  judicial  discretion in regard to the imposition  of
     the  death sentence should be broadened, and an automatic
     right of appeal allowed to those under sentence of death.26
     These  proposals  were  later enacted  into  law  by  the
     Criminal Law Amendment Act No. 107 of 1990.
    
     [22] In August 1991, the South African Law Commission  in
     its  Interim  Report on Group and Human Rights  described
     the   imposition   of  the  death  penalty   as   "highly
     controversial".27  A working paper of the Commission which
     preceded  the Interim Report had proposed that the  right
     to life be recognised in a bill of rights, subject to the
     proviso that the discretionary imposition of the sentence
     of  death be allowed for the most serious crimes.   As  a
     result  of  the comments it  received, the Law Commission
     decided  to  change the draft and to adopt  a  "Solomonic
     solution"28 under which a constitutional court  would  be
     required  to decide whether a right to life expressed  in
     unqualified terms could be circumscribed by a limitations
     clause  contained in a bill of rights.29  "This  proposed
     solution" it said "naturally imposes an onerous  task  on
     the  Constitutional Court.  But it is a task  which  this
     Court will in future have to carry out in respect of many
     other  laws and executive and administrative  acts.   The
     Court  must not shrink from this task, otherwise we shall
     be back to parliamentary sovereignty."30
    
    
    
     [23] In March 1992, the then Minister of Justice issued a
     press statement in which he said:

          Opinions  regarding the death  penalty  differ
          substantially.  There are those who feel  that
          the  death penalty is a cruel and inhuman form
          of punishment.  Others are of the opinion that
          it  is  in  some extreme cases the community's
          only effective safeguard against violent crime
          and  that it gives effect in such cases to the
          retributive   and   deterrent   purposes    of
          punishment.31

     He  went  on  to say that policy in regard to  the  death
     penalty might be settled during negotiations on the terms
     of  a  Bill  of Fundamental Rights, and that pending  the
     outcome   of  such  negotiations,  execution   of   death
     sentences   which  had  not  been  commuted,   would   be
     suspended.  He concluded his statement by saying that:

          The   government  wishes  to  see   a   speedy
          settlement of the future constitutionality  of
          this  form  of punishment and urges interested
          parties to join in the discussions on  a  Bill
          of Fundamental Rights.32

[24] The  moratorium was in respect of the carrying  out,  and
     not  the  imposition, of the death sentence.   The  death
     sentence  remained a lawful punishment and  although  the
     courts   may  possibly  have  been  influenced   by   the
     moratorium, they continued to impose it in cases in which
     it  was  considered  to  be the "only  proper"  sentence.
     According  to  the  statistics  provided  to  us  by  the
     Attorney  General,  243 persons have  been  sentenced  to
     death since the amendment to section 277 in 1990, and  of
     these sentences, 143 have been confirmed by the Appellate
     Division.

[25] In  the  constitutional negotiations which followed,  the
     issue   was   not  resolved.   Instead,  the   "Solomonic
     solution"  was  adopted.33  The death  sentence  was,  in
terms,  neither  sanctioned  nor excluded,  and  it  was  left
     to   the  Constitutional  Court  to  decide  whether  the
     provisions of the pre-constitutional law making the death
     penalty a competent sentence for murder and other  crimes
     are  consistent  with Chapter Three of the  Constitution.
     If  they  are,  the  death sentence remains  a  competent
     sentence  for  murder in cases in which those  provisions
     are  applicable,  unless and until  Parliament  otherwise
     decides; if they are not, it is our duty to say  so,  and
     to declare such provisions to be unconstitutional.

Section 11(2) - Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment

     [26]  Death  is  the most extreme form of  punishment  to
     which  a  convicted  criminal  can  be  subjected.    Its
     execution is final and irrevocable.  It puts an  end  not
     only  to  the  right to life itself,  but  to  all  other
     personal  rights which had vested in the  deceased  under
     Chapter  Three  of the Constitution.  It  leaves  nothing
     except  the  memory in others of what has  been  and  the
     property  that  passes to the deceased's heirs.   In  the
     ordinary  meaning  of the words, the  death  sentence  is
     undoubtedly  a  cruel  punishment.  Once  sentenced,  the
     prisoner  waits  on  death row in the  company  of  other
     prisoners  under sentence of death, for the processes  of
     their  appeals  and  the procedures for  clemency  to  be
     carried out.  Throughout this period, those who remain on
     death  row  are  uncertain  of their  fate,  not  knowing
     whether they will ultimately be reprieved or taken to the
     gallows.   Death  is  a  cruel  penalty  and  the   legal
     processes   which   necessarily   involve   waiting    in
     uncertainty for the sentence to be set aside  or  carried
     out,   add  to  the  cruelty.   It  is  also  an  inhuman
     punishment  for  it "...involves, by its very  nature,  a
     denial  of the executed person's humanity",34 and  it  is
     degrading because it strips the convicted person  of  all
     dignity  and  treats  him  or her  as  an  object  to  be
     eliminated  by the state.  The question is not,  however,
     whether  the  death  sentence  is  a  cruel,  inhuman  or
     degrading  punishment in the ordinary  meaning  of  these
     words  but  whether it is a cruel, inhuman  or  degrading
     punishment  within the meaning of section  11(2)  of  our
     Constitution.35  The accused, who rely on section 11(2) of
     the  Constitution, carry the initial onus of establishing
     this proposition.36
    
     The Contentions of the Parties
    
     [27] The principal arguments advanced by counsel for  the
     accused   in  support  of  their  contention   that   the
     imposition of the death penalty for murder is  a  "cruel,
     inhuman  or  degrading punishment," were that  the  death
     sentence  is an affront to human dignity, is inconsistent
     with  the  unqualified right to life  entrenched  in  the
     Constitution,  cannot be corrected in case  of  error  or
     enforced in a manner that is not arbitrary, and  that  it
     negates  the essential content of the right to  life  and
     the other rights that flow from it.  The Attorney General
     argued  that  the  death  penalty  is  recognised  as   a
     legitimate form of punishment in many parts of the world,
     it  is  a  deterrent to violent crime, it meets society's
     need  for adequate retribution for heinous offences,  and
     it  is regarded by South African society as an acceptable
     form  of  punishment.  He asserted that it is, therefore,
     not  cruel,  inhuman or degrading within the  meaning  of
     section  11(2) of the Constitution.  These arguments  for
     and  against the death sentence are well known  and  have
     been  considered  in many of the foreign authorities  and
     cases to which we were referred.  We must deal with  them
     now   in   the  light  of  the  provisions  of  our   own
     Constitution.

The  Effect  of  the  Disparity in the Laws Governing  Capital
Punishment

[28] One  of the anomalies of the transition initiated by  the
     Constitution is that the Criminal Procedure Act does  not
     apply throughout South Africa.  This is a consequence  of
     section 229 of the Constitution which provides:

          Subject  to this Constitution, all laws  which
          immediately  before the commencement  of  this
          Constitution were in force in any  area  which
          forms  part  of the national territory,  shall
          continue in force in such area, subject to any
          repeal  or  amendment  of  such  laws   by   a
          competent authority.

[29] Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Constitution,  the
     Criminal  Procedure  Act was in force  only  in  the  old
     Republic  of South Africa.  Its operation did not  extend
     to  the former Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda or Ciskei,
     which   were  then  treated  by  South  African  law   as
     independent   states  and  had  their  own   legislation.
     Although  their  respective Criminal  Procedure  statutes
     were  based on the South African legislation, there  were
     differences, including differences in regard to the death
     penalty.  The most striking difference in this regard was
     in Ciskei, where the death sentence was abolished on June
     8, 1990 by the military regime,37 the de facto government
     of  the territory, and it ceased from that date to  be  a
     competent  sentence.38  These differences still  exist,39
     which means that the law governing the imposition of  the   
death  sentence  in  South Africa  is  not  uniform.  The
     greatest  disparity is in the Eastern Cape  Province.   A
     person who commits murder and is brought to trial in that
     part of the province which was formerly Ciskei, cannot be
     sentenced  to  death, whilst a person who commits  murder
     and  is  brought  to trial in another part  of  the  same
     province,  can  be  sentenced  to  death.   There  is  no
     rational reason for this distinction, which is the result
     of  history, and we asked for argument to be addressed to
     us  on the question whether this difference has a bearing
     on  the  constitutionality of section  277(1)(a)  of  the
     Criminal Procedure Act.

     [30]  Counsel for the accused argued that it  did.   They
     contended that in the circumstances section 277 was not a
     law  of general application (which is a requirement under
     section 33(1) for the validity of any law which limits  a
     Chapter  Three right), and that the disparate application
     of  the  death sentence within South Africa discriminates
     unfairly  between those prosecuted in the  former  Ciskei
     and  those  prosecuted  elsewhere in  South  Africa,  and
     offends against the right to "equality before the law and
     to equal protection of the law."40
    
     [31]  If the disparity had been the result of legislation
     enacted  after the Constitution had come into  force  the
     challenge to the validity of section 277 on these grounds
     may  well  have been tenable.  Criminal law and procedure
     is  a  national  competence and the  national  government
     could   not   without   very  convincing   reasons   have
     established  a  "safe  haven"  in  part  of  one  of  the
     provinces  in  which  the  death  penalty  would  not  be
     enforced.   The disparity is not, however, the result  of
     the  legislative  policy of the  new  Parliament,  but  a
     consequence  of  the Constitution which  brings  together
     again  in  one country the parts that had been  separated
     under  apartheid.   The purpose of  section  229  was  to
     ensure   an   orderly  transition,  and   an   inevitable
     consequence  of  its  provisions is that  there  will  be
     disparities  in the law reflecting pre-existing  regional
     variations, and that this will continue until  a  uniform
     system  of  law has been established by the national  and
     provincial legislatures within their fields of competence
     as contemplated by Chapter Fifteen of the Constitution.

[32] The  requirement of section 229 that existing laws  shall
     continue  to  be  in  force subject to the  Constitution,
     makes the Constitution applicable to existing laws within
     each  of  the geographic areas.  These laws have to  meet
     all  the standards prescribed by Chapter Three, and  this
     no  doubt calls for consistency and parity of laws within
     the boundaries of each of the different geographic areas.
     It   does  not,  however,  mean  that  there  has  to  be
     consistency and parity between the laws of the  different
     geographic areas themselves.41  Such a construction would
defeat  the  apparent  purpose of section  229,  which  is  to
     allow  different legal orders to exist side by side until
     a  process of rationalisation has been carried  out,  and
     would  inappropriately expose a substantial part  if  not
     the  entire body of our statutory law to challenges under
     section   8   of  the  Constitution.   It  follows   that
     disparities  between the legal orders in different  parts
     of the country, consequent upon the provisions of section
     229 of the Constitution, cannot for that reason alone  be
     said  to  constitute  a  breach of the  equal  protection
     provisions  of  section 8, or render the laws  such  that
     they are not of general application.

International and Foreign Comparative Law

     [33] The death sentence is a form of punishment which has
     been used throughout history by different societies.   It
     has long been the subject of controversy.42  As societies
     became more enlightened, they restricted the offences for
     which this penalty could be imposed.43  The movement away
     from  the death penalty gained momentum during the second
     half  of  the  present century with  the  growth  of  the
     abolitionist  movement.   In some  countries  it  is  now
     prohibited in all circumstances, in some it is prohibited
     save  in  times of war, and in most countries  that  have
     retained  it  as a penalty for crime, its  use  has  been
     restricted  to  extreme  cases.   According  to   Amnesty
     International,   1,831  executions   were   carried   out
     throughout the world in 1993 as a result of sentences  of
     death,  of  which 1,419 were in China, which  means  that
     only  412 executions were carried out in the rest of  the
     world in that year.44  Today, capital punishment has been
     abolished as a penalty for murder either specifically  or
     in  practice  by almost half the countries of  the  world
     including  the democracies of Europe and our neighbouring
     countries, Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.45  In most  of
     those  countries  where it is retained,  as  the  Amnesty
     International statistics show, it is seldom used.
    
     [34]  In the course of the arguments addressed to us,  we
     were   referred  to  books  and  articles  on  the  death
     sentence,  and to judgments dealing with challenges  made
     to  capital  punishment in the courts of other  countries
     and  in  international tribunals.  The international  and
     foreign  authorities  are of value because  they  analyse
     arguments for and against the death sentence and show how
     courts of other jurisdictions have dealt with this  vexed
     issue.  For that reason alone they require our attention.
     They  may  also  have to be considered because  of  their
     relevance  to  section 35(1) of the  Constitution,  which
     states:

          In  interpreting the provisions of  this  Chapter  a
          court of law shall promote the values which underlie
          an  open and democratic society based on freedom and
          equality and shall, where applicable, have regard to
          public   international   law   applicable   to   the
          protection of the rights entrenched in this Chapter,
          and may have regard to comparable foreign case law.

[35] Customary  international  law and  the  ratification  and
     accession  to international agreements is dealt  with  in
section    231   of   the   Constitution   which   sets    the
     requirements  for  such law to be  binding  within  South
     Africa.    In  the  context  of  section  35(1),   public
     international law would include non-binding  as  well  as
     binding law.46  They may both be used under the section as
     tools  of  interpretation.  International agreements  and
     customary   international  law  accordingly   provide   a
     framework within which Chapter Three can be evaluated and
     understood, and for that purpose, decisions of  tribunals
     dealing  with comparable instruments, such as the  United
     Nations  Committee on Human Rights,47 the  Inter-American
     Commission on Human Rights,48 the Inter-American Court of
     Human Rights,49 the European Commission on Human Rights,50
     and  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights,51  and   in
     appropriate  cases, reports of specialised agencies  such
     as  the  International  Labour Organisation  may  provide
     guidance  as to the correct interpretation of  particular
provisions of Chapter Three.

     [36]  Capital  punishment  is not  prohibited  by  public
     international law, and this is a factor that  has  to  be
     taken  into  account  in deciding whether  it  is  cruel,
     inhuman  or  degrading punishment within the  meaning  of
     section  11(2).  International  human  rights  agreements
     differ, however, from our Constitution in that where  the
     right  to  life  is expressed in unqualified  terms  they
     either  deal  specifically with the  death  sentence,  or
     authorise exceptions to be made to the right to  life  by
     law.52    This   has  influenced  the  way  international
     tribunals  have  dealt with issues  relating  to  capital
     punishment, and is relevant to a proper understanding  of
     such decisions.
    
     [37]  Comparative "bill of rights" jurisprudence will  no
     doubt  be of importance, particularly in the early stages
     of  the  transition when there is no developed indigenous
     jurisprudence in this branch of the law on which to draw.
     Although we are told by section 35(1) that we "may"  have
     regard to foreign case law, it is important to appreciate
     that this will not necessarily offer a safe guide to  the
     interpretation  of  Chapter Three of our  Constitution.53
     This  has  already  been  pointed  out  in  a  number  of
     decisions  of the Provincial and Local Divisions  of  the
     Supreme Court,54 and is implicit in the injunction  given
     to the Courts in section 35(1), which in permissive terms
     allows the Courts to "have regard to" such law.  There is
     no injunction to do more than this.
    
     [38]   When   challenges  to  the   death   sentence   in
     international  or  foreign  courts  and  tribunals   have
     failed,  the constitution or the international instrument
     concerned   has   either  directly   sanctioned   capital
     punishment or has specifically provided that the right to
     life  is  subject to exceptions sanctioned by  law.   The
     only  case to which we were referred in which there  were
     not  such express provisions in the Constitution, was the
     decision  of  the Hungarian Constitutional Court.   There
     the   challenge  succeeded  and  the  death  penalty  was
     declared to be unconstitutional.55
    
     [39]  Our Constitution expresses the right to life in  an
     unqualified form, and prescribes the criteria  that  have
     to  be  met  for  the  limitation of  entrenched  rights,
     including the prohibition of legislation that negates the
     essential  content  of an entrenched right.   In  dealing
     with  comparative law, we must bear in mind that  we  are
     required to construe the South African Constitution,  and
     not  an  international instrument or the constitution  of
     some  foreign country, and that this has to be done  with
     due   regard  to  our  legal  system,  our  history   and
     circumstances, and the structure and language of our  own
     Constitution.56   We  can derive assistance  from  public
     international law and foreign case law, but we are in  no
     way bound to follow it.
    
     Capital Punishment in the United States of America
    
     [40] The earliest litigation on the validity of the death
     sentence seems to have been pursued in the courts of  the
     United  States of America.  It has been said  there  that
     the  "Constitution  itself poses the  first  obstacle  to
     [the]   argument  that  capital  punishment  is  per   se
     unconstitutional".57   From  the  beginning,  the  United
     States  Constitution  recognised  capital  punishment  as
     lawful.  The Fifth Amendment (adopted in 1791) refers  in
     specific   terms  to  capital  punishment  and  impliedly
     recognises   its  validity.   The  Fourteenth   Amendment
     (adopted in 1868) obliges the states, not to "deprive any
     person of life, liberty, or property, without due process
     of  law" and it too impliedly recognises the right of the
     states  to  make laws for such purposes.58  The  argument
     that capital punishment is unconstitutional was based  on
     the  Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and  unusual
     punishment.59  Although the Eighth Amendment "has not been
     regarded as a static concept"60 and as drawing its meaning
     "from  the  evolving standards of decency that  mark  the
     progress  of  a  maturing society",61 the fact  that  the
     Constitution   recognises  the  lawfulness   of   capital
     punishment has proved to be an obstacle in the way of the
     acceptance of this argument, and this is stressed in some
     of the judgments of the United States Supreme Court.62
    
     [41] Although challenges under state constitutions to the
     validity of the death sentence have been successful,63 the
     federal  constitutionality of the  death  sentence  as  a
     legitimate form of punishment for murder was affirmed  by
     the  United  States Supreme Court in Gregg v.  Georgia.64
     Both  before and after Gregg's case, decisions  upholding
     and  rejecting challenges to death penalty statutes  have
     divided  the  Supreme Court, and have  led  at  times  to
     sharply-worded  judgments.65   The  decisions  ultimately
     turned  on  the votes of those judges who considered  the
     nature   of   the  discretion  given  to  the  sentencing
     authority to be the crucial factor.
    
     [42] Statutes providing for mandatory death sentences, or
     too  little discretion in sentencing, have been  rejected
     by  the  Supreme  Court because they  do  not  allow  for
     consideration of factors peculiar to the convicted person
     facing  sentence, which may distinguish his or  her  case
     from  other cases.66  For the same reason, statutes which
     allow too wide a discretion to judges or juries have also
     been struck down on the grounds that the exercise of such
     discretion  leads  to  arbitrary  results.67    In   sum,
     therefore,   if  there  is  no  discretion,  too   little
     discretion,  or  an unbounded discretion,  the  provision
     authorising  the death sentence has been struck  down  as
     being  contrary  to  the  Eighth  Amendment;  where   the
     discretion has been "suitably directed and limited so  as
     to  minimise the risk of wholly arbitrary and  capricious
     action",68 the challenge to the statute has failed.69
    
     Arbitrariness and Inequality
    
     [43]  Basing  his  argument on the  reasons  which  found
     favour  with  the majority of the United  States  Supreme
     Court  in  Furman  v. Georgia, Mr Trengove  contended  on
     behalf  of  the  accused that the imprecise  language  of
     section 277, and the unbounded discretion vested by it in
     the Courts, make its provisions unconstitutional.

[44] Section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides:

          Sentence of death

                     (1)   The sentence of death  may  be
               passed  by a superior court only and  only
               in the case of a conviction for-

                              (a)  murder;
                              (b)  treason
                    committed   when   the
                    Republic is in a state
                    of war;
                              (c)  robbery
                    or  attempted robbery,
                    if   the  court  finds
                    aggravating
                    circumstances to  have
                    been present;
                                       (d)
                    kidnapping;
                               (e)  child-
stealing;
                              (f)  rape.

                     (2)  The sentence of death
               shall be imposed-

                               (a)   after
                    the   presiding  judge
                    conjointly  with   the
                    assessors  (if   any),
                    subject     to     the
                    provisions    of     s
                    145(4)(a), or, in  the
                    case  of a trial by  a
                    special       superior
                    court,   that   court,
                    with due regard to any
                    evidence  and argument
                    on  sentence in  terms
                    of  section  274,  has
                    made a finding on  the
                    presence or absence of
                    any   mitigating    or
                    aggravating   factors;
                    and

                               (b)  if the
                    presiding   judge   or
                    court, as the case may
                    be, with due regard to
                    that    finding,    is
                    satisfied   that   the
                    sentence  of death  is
                    the proper sentence.

                           (3)   (a)   The
                    sentence   of    death
                    shall  not be  imposed
                    upon  an  accused  who
                    was  under the age  of
                    18  years at the  time
                    of  the commission  of
                    the      act     which
                    constituted        the
                    offence concerned.

                               (b)  If  in
                    the   application   of
                    paragraph (a) the  age
                    of   an   accused   is
                    placed  in issue,  the
                    onus  shall be on  the
                    State  to show  beyond
                    reasonable doubt  that
                    the  accused  was   18
                    years  of age or older
                    at the relevant time.

[45] Under  our court system questions of guilt and innocence,
     and  the  proper  sentence to be imposed on  those  found
     guilty  of crimes, are not decided by juries.  In capital
     cases, where it is likely that the death sentence may  be
     imposed, judges sit with two assessors who have an  equal
     vote  with  the judge on the issue of guilt  and  on  any
     mitigating  or aggravating factors relevant to  sentence;
     but  sentencing  is the prerogative of the  judge  alone.
     The  Criminal Procedure Act allows a full right of appeal
     to  persons  sentenced  to death, including  a  right  to
     dispute  the  sentence  without having  to  establish  an
     irregularity  or misdirection on the part  of  the  trial
     judge.   The Appellate Division is empowered to  set  the
     sentence aside if it would not have imposed such sentence
     itself, and it has laid down criteria for the exercise of
     this  power by itself and other courts.70  If the  person
sentenced   to   death   does   not  appeal,   the   Appellate
     Division is nevertheless required to review the case  and
     to  set  aside the death sentence if it is of the opinion
     that it is not a proper sentence.71

     [46]   Mitigating   and  aggravating  factors   must   be
     identified by the Court, bearing in mind that the onus is
     on  the  State  to  prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt  the
     existence of aggravating factors, and to negative  beyond
     reasonable  doubt the presence of any mitigating  factors
     relied  on by the accused.72  Due regard must be paid  to
     the  personal circumstances and subjective factors  which
     might have influenced the accused person's conduct,73 and
     these  factors  must then be weighed  up  with  the  main
     objects  of  punishment, which  have  been  held  to  be:
     deterrence,  prevention, reformation, and  retribution.74
     In  this  process "[e]very relevant consideration  should
     receive the most scrupulous care and reasoned attention",75
     and the death sentence should only be imposed in the most
     exceptional cases, where there is no reasonable  prospect
     of reformation and the objects of punishment would not be
     properly achieved by any other sentence.76
    
     [47]  There  seems to me to be little difference  between
     the guided discretion required for the death sentence  in
     the  United  States, and the criteria laid  down  by  the
     Appellate  Division  for  the  imposition  of  the  death
     sentence.  The fact that the Appellate Division, a  court
     of  experienced judges, takes the final decision  in  all
     cases   is,  in  my  view,  more  likely  to  result   in
     consistency  of sentencing, than will be the  case  where
     sentencing  is  in the hands of jurors  who  are  offered
     statutory  guidance as to how that discretion  should  be
     exercised.

[48] The  argument  that the imposition of the death  sentence
     under  section 277 is arbitrary and capricious does  not,
     however,  end there.  It also focuses on what is  alleged
     to  be  the arbitrariness inherent in the application  of
     section 277 in practice. Of the thousands of persons  put
     on  trial  for  murder, only a very small percentage  are
     sentenced  to  death by a trial court, and  of  those,  a
     large number escape the ultimate penalty on appeal.77  At
     every stage of the process there is an element of chance.
     The outcome may be dependent upon factors such as the way
     the  case is investigated by the police, the way the case
     is  presented  by  the  prosecutor, how  effectively  the
     accused  is  defended,  the  personality  and  particular
     attitude to capital punishment of the trial judge and, if
     the  matter goes on appeal, the particular judges who are
     selected  to hear the case.  Race78 and poverty are  also
alleged to be factors.

     [49]  Most  accused facing a possible death sentence  are
     unable to afford legal assistance, and are defended under
     the  pro deo system. The defending counsel is more  often
     than  not  young  and  inexperienced,  frequently  of   a
     different race to his or her client, and if this  is  the
     case, usually has to consult through an interpreter.  Pro
     deo  counsel are paid only a nominal fee for the defence,
     and  generally  lack  the  financial  resources  and  the
     infrastructural  support  to  undertake   the   necessary
     investigations  and research, to employ expert  witnesses
     to  give advice, including advice on matters relevant  to
     sentence,  to  assemble witnesses, to  bargain  with  the
     prosecution,  and  generally  to  conduct  an   effective
     defence.   Accused persons who have the money to  do  so,
     are able to retain experienced attorneys and counsel, who
     are  paid  to undertake the necessary investigations  and
     research,  and  as a result they are less  likely  to  be
     sentenced to death than persons similarly placed who  are
     unable to pay for such services.79
    
     [50]  It  needs to be mentioned that there are  occasions
     when   senior  members  of  the  bar  act  pro   deo   in
     particularly  difficult cases - indeed the  present  case
     affords  an  example  of that, for Mr  Trengove  and  his
     juniors have acted pro deo in the proceedings before  us,
     and  the  Legal Resources Centre who have acted as  their
     instructing attorneys, have done so without  charge.   An
     enormous amount of research has gone into the preparation
     of  the argument and it is highly doubtful that even  the
     wealthiest  members of our society could have  secured  a
     better service than they have provided.  But this is  the
     exception and not the rule.  This may possibly change  as
     a  result  of the provisions of section 25(3)(e)  of  the
     Constitution,  but  there  are limits  to  the  available
     financial and human resources, limits which are likely to
     exist for the foreseeable future, and which will continue
     to  place  poor accused at a significant disadvantage  in
     defending themselves in capital cases.
    
[51] It  cannot be gainsaid that poverty, race and chance play
     roles  in  the outcome of capital cases and in the  final
     decision as to who should live and who should die.  It is
     sometimes said that this is understood by the judges, and
     as  far as possible, taken into account by them.  But  in
     itself   this   is   no  answer  to  the   complaint   of
     arbitrariness;  on  the contrary,  it  may  introduce  an
     additional factor of arbitrariness that would  also  have
     to  be  taken  into account.  Some, but not  all  accused
     persons  may  be  acquitted because such  allowances  are
     made, and others who are convicted, but not all, may  for
     the same reason escape the death sentence.80

     [52] In holding that the imposition and the carrying  out
     of   the   death   penalty  in  the  cases   then   under
     consideration constituted cruel and unusual punishment in
     the  United States, Justice Douglas, concurring in Furman
     v.    Georgia,   said   that   "[a]ny   law   which    is
     nondiscriminatory on its face may be applied  in  such  a
     way  as  to  violate the Equal Protection Clause  of  the
     Fourteenth Amendment."  Discretionary statutes are:

          ...pregnant     with     discrimination     and
          discrimination is an ingredient not  compatible
          with  the idea of equal protection of the  laws
          that  is  implicit  in the ban  on  "cruel  and
          unusual" punishments.81
          [53]  It  was  contended that we should  follow
     this  approach and hold that the factors to which  I
     have  referred, make the application of section 277,
     in  practice, arbitrary and capricious and, for that
     reason,  any  resulting  death  sentence  is  cruel,
     inhuman and degrading punishment.

[54] The differences that exist between rich and poor, between
     good  and bad prosecutions, between good and bad defence,
     between  severe  and lenient judges, between  judges  who
     favour  capital punishment and those who do not, and  the
     subjective attitudes that might be brought into  play  by
     factors  such  as  race and class, may  in  similar  ways
     affect  any  case that comes before the  courts,  and  is
     almost  certainly  present to some degree  in  all  court
     systems.  Such factors can be mitigated, but not  totally
     avoided,  by  allowing convicted persons to appeal  to  a
     higher  court.  Appeals are decided on the record of  the
     case  and  on findings made by the trial court.   If  the
     evidence  on  record  and  the findings  made  have  been
     influenced  by these factors, there may be  nothing  that
     can  be done about that on appeal.  Imperfection inherent
     in  criminal trials means that error cannot be  excluded;
     it  also  means  that persons similarly  placed  may  not
     necessarily receive similar punishment.  This needs to be
     acknowledged.  What also needs to be acknowledged is that
     the possibility of error will be present in any system of
     justice  and  that  there cannot be perfect  equality  as
     between  accused persons in the conduct  and  outcome  of
     criminal trials.  We have to accept these differences  in
     the  ordinary criminal cases that come before the courts,
     even  to the extent that some may go to gaol when  others
     similarly  placed  may  be  acquitted  or  receive   non-
custodial   sentences.   But  death  is  different,  and   the
     question   is,  whether  this  is  acceptable  when   the
     difference   is   between   life   and   death.    Unjust
     imprisonment  is a great wrong, but if it is  discovered,
     the  prisoner  can be released and compensated;  but  the
     killing of an innocent person is irremediable.82

     [55]  In  the  United  States,  the  Supreme  Court   has
     addressed  itself  primarily to the  requirement  of  due
     process.   Statutes  have  to  be  clear  and  discretion
     curtailed without ignoring the peculiar circumstances  of
     each  accused  person.  Verdicts are  set  aside  if  the
     defence has not been adequate,83 and persons sentenced to
     death are allowed wide rights of appeal and review.  This
     attempt  to  ensure  the utmost procedural  fairness  has
     itself  led  to  problems.  The most   notorious  is  the
     "death row phenomenon" in which prisoners cling to  life,
     exhausting  every possible avenue of redress,  and  using
     every  device  to put off the date of execution,  in  the
     natural  and  understandable hope that there  will  be  a
     reprieve from the Courts or the executive.  It is  common
     for prisoners in the United States to remain on death row
     for  many years, and this dragging out of the process has
     been  characterised as being cruel and degrading.84   The
     difficulty of implementing a system of capital punishment
     which  on  the one hand avoids arbitrariness by insisting
     on  a  high standard of procedural fairness, and  on  the
     other hand avoids delays that in themselves are the cause
     of  impermissible  cruelty and inhumanity,  is  apparent.
     Justice  Blackmun, who sided with the majority in Gregg's
     case,  ultimately came to the conclusion that it  is  not
     possible  to design a system that avoids arbitrariness.85
     To  design a system that avoids arbitrariness and  delays
     in carrying out the sentence is even more difficult.
    
     [56] The United States jurisprudence has not resolved the
     dilemma  arising  from  the fact  that  the  Constitution
     prohibits  cruel  and  unusual  punishments,   but   also
     permits,  and  contemplates that there  will  be  capital
     punishment.  The acceptance by a majority of  the  United
     States  Supreme  Court  of the proposition  that  capital
     punishment  is not per se unconstitutional, but  that  in
     certain  circumstances  it may  be  arbitrary,  and  thus
     unconstitutional,   has   led  to   endless   litigation.
     Considerable expense and interminable delays result  from
     the  exceptionally-high standard of  procedural  fairness
     set  by  the United States courts in attempting to  avoid
     arbitrary  decisions.  The difficulties  that  have  been
     experienced  in  following this path,  to  which  Justice
     Blackmun and Justice Scalia have both referred,86 but from
     which they have drawn different conclusions, persuade  me
     that we should not follow this route.
    
     The Right to Dignity
     [57]  Although  the United States Constitution  does  not
     contain  a  specific guarantee of human dignity,  it  has
     been accepted by the United States Supreme Court that the
     concept  of  human  dignity  is  at  the  core   of   the
     prohibition  of  "cruel and unusual  punishment"  by  the
     Eighth  and Fourteenth Amendments.87  For Brennan J  this
     was decisive of the question in Gregg v. Georgia.
    
          The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment
          of  death  is that it treats "members of  the  human
          race  as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with  and
          discarded.  [It  is]  thus  inconsistent  with   the
          fundamental  premise  of the Clause  that  even  the
          vilest  criminal remains a human being possessed  of
          common human dignity."88
         
          [58]  Under  our constitutional order the  right  to
     human dignity is specifically guaranteed.  It can only be
     limited by legislation which passes the stringent test of
     being  'necessary'. The weight given to human dignity  by
     Justice  Brennan is wholly consistent with the values  of
     our Constitution and the new order established by it.  It
     is   also   consistent  with  the  approach  to   extreme
     punishments followed by courts in other countries.

[59] In Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court has stressed
     this aspect of punishment.
    
          Respect  for  human dignity especially requires  the
          prohibition   of  cruel,  inhuman,   and   degrading
          punishments.   [The state] cannot turn the  offender
          into  an object of crime prevention to the detriment
          of  his  constitutionally protected right to  social
          worth and respect.89
         
          [60]  That capital punishment constitutes a  serious
     impairment  of human dignity has also been recognised  by
     judgments  of  the  Canadian Supreme  Court.   Kindler  v
     Canada90 was concerned with the extradition from Canada to
     the United States of two fugitives, Kindler, who had been
     convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the  United
     States, and Ng who was facing a murder charge there and a
     possible  death sentence.  Three of the seven judges  who
     heard  the  cases expressed the opinion  that  the  death
     penalty was cruel and unusual:
         
               It   is  the  supreme  indignity  to   the
          individual,  the ultimate corporal  punishment,
          the   final  and  complete  lobotomy  and   the
          absolute and irrevocable castration.   [It  is]
          the ultimate desecration of human dignity...91
              
          [61]  Three  other judges were of  the  opinion
     that:

          [t]here  is  strong  ground  for  believing,  having
          regard  to  the  limited extent to which  the  death
          penalty  advances  any valid penological  objectives
          and  the  serious  invasion  of  human  dignity   it
          engenders, that the death penalty cannot, except  in
          exceptional  circumstances,  be  justified  in  this
          country.92
         
     In  the  result, however, the majority of the Court  held
     that  the validity of the order for extradition  did  not
     depend upon the constitutionality of the death penalty in
     Canada, or the guarantee in its Charter of Rights against
     cruel  and unusual punishment.  The Charter was concerned
     with  legislative  and  executive  acts  carried  out  in
     Canada, and an order for extradition neither imposed  nor
     authorised any punishment within the borders of Canada.

[62] The issue in Kindler's case was whether the action of the
     Minister  of  Justice, who had authorised the extradition
     without any assurance that the death penalty would not be
     imposed,  was  constitutional.  It was argued  that  this
     executive  act was contrary to section 12 of the  Charter
     which  requires  the executive to act in accordance  with
     fundamental principles of justice. The Court decided by a
     majority   of  four  to  three  that  in  the  particular
     circumstances of the case the decision of the Minister of
     Justice  could  not  be set aside on these  grounds.   In
     balancing  the  international obligations  of  Canada  in
     respect  of  extradition,  and  another  purpose  of  the
     extradition legislation - to prevent Canada from becoming
     a  safe haven for criminals, against the likelihood  that
     the fugitives would be executed if returned to the United
     States, the view of the majority was that the decision to
     return  the fugitives to the United States could  not  be
     said  to  be  contrary to the fundamental  principles  of
     justice.    In  their  view,  it  would  not  shock   the
     conscience of Canadians to permit this to be done.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

[63] Ng  and  Kindler  took their cases to  the  Human  Rights
     Committee  of the United Nations, contending that  Canada
     had  breached  its  obligations under  the  International
     Covenant  on  Civil  and Political Rights.   Once  again,
     there was a division of opinion within the tribunal.   In
     Ng's case it was said:

          The  Committee  is aware that, by definition,  every
          execution  of a sentence of death may be  considered
          to constitute cruel and inhuman treatment within the
          meaning of article 7 of the covenant.93

[64] There  was  no  dissent  from that  statement.   But  the
     International  Covenant  contains provisions  permitting,
     with  some  qualifications,  the  imposition  of  capital
     punishment for the most serious crimes.  In view of these
     provisions,  the majority  of the Committee were  of  the
     opinion  that the extradition of fugitives to  a  country
     which enforces the death sentence in accordance with  the
     requirements of the International Covenant, should not be
     regarded   as  a  breach  of  the  obligations   of   the
     extraditing  country.   In  Ng's  case,  the  method   of
     execution  which he faced if extradited was  asphyxiation
     in  a  gas chamber.  This was found by a majority of  the
     Committee  to  involve unnecessary  physical  and  mental
     suffering  and,  notwithstanding the  sanction  given  to
     capital  punishment,  to be cruel punishment  within  the
     meaning  of article 7 of the International Covenant.   In
     Kindler's  case, in which the complaint was delivered  at
     the  same time as that in the Ng's case, but the decision
     was  given  earlier,  it  was held  that  the  method  of
     execution which was by lethal injection was not  a  cruel
     method of execution, and that the extradition did not  in
     the   circumstances  constitute  a  breach  of   Canada's
     obligations under the International Covenant.94

     [65]  The  Committee  also held in  Kindler's  case  that
     prolonged  judicial proceedings giving rise to the  death
     row  phenomenon does not per se constitute cruel, inhuman
     or  degrading  treatment.  There were  dissents  in  both
     cases.   Some  Commissioners  in  Ng's  case  held   that
     asphyxiation  was  not  crueller  than  other  forms   of
     execution.   Some  in  Kindler's  case  held   that   the
     provision  of  the  International  Covenant  against  the
     arbitrary deprivation of the right to life took  priority
     over  the provisions of the International Covenant  which
     allow  the death sentence, and that Canada ought  not  in
     the  circumstances to have extradited Kindler without  an
     assurance that he would not be executed.

[66] It  should be mentioned here that although articles  6(2)
     to  (5) of the International Covenant specifically  allow
     the   imposition  of  the  death  sentence  under  strict
     controls "for the most serious crimes" by those countries
     which have not abolished it, it provides in article  6(6)
     that "[n]othing in this article shall be invoked to delay
     or  to prevent the abolition of capital punishment by any
     State Party to the present Covenant."  The fact that  the
     International Covenant sanctions capital punishment  must
     be  seen  in  this context.  It tolerates  but  does  not
     provide justification for the death penalty.

[67] Despite these differences of opinion, what is clear  from
     the decisions of the Human Rights Committee of the United
     Nations  is that the death penalty is regarded by  it  as
     cruel  and inhuman punishment within the ordinary meaning
     of  those  words, and that it was because of the specific
     provisions of the International Covenant authorising  the
     imposition  of  capital punishment by  member  States  in
     certain  circumstances, that the words had to be given  a
     narrow meaning.

The European Convention on Human Rights

[68] Similar  issues  were debated by the  European  Court  of
     Human Rights in Soering v United Kingdom.95  This case was
     also  concerned with the extradition to the United States
of a fugitive  to  face  murder  charges  for  which   capital
     punishment was a competent sentence.  It was argued  that
     this  would expose him to inhuman and degrading treatment
     or  punishment  in breach of article 3  of  the  European
     Convention  on Human Rights.  Article 2 of  the  European
     Convention  protects  the right  to  life  but  makes  an
     exception in the case of "the execution of a sentence  of
     a  court following [the] conviction of a crime for  which
     this  penalty is provided by law."  The majority  of  the
     Court  held  that  article 3 could not  be  construed  as
     prohibiting all capital punishment, since to do so  would
     nullify  article 2.  It was, however, competent  to  test
     the  imposition of capital punishment in particular cases
     against  the requirements of article 3 -- the  manner  in
     which   it   is   imposed  or  executed,   the   personal
     circumstances   of   the   condemned   person   and   the
     disproportionality to the gravity of the crime committed,
     as   well   as  the  conditions  of  detention   awaiting
     execution,  were  capable of bringing  the  treatment  or
     punishment  received by the condemned person  within  the
     proscription.

     [69]  On the facts, it was held that extradition  to  the
     United States to face trial in Virginia would expose  the
     fugitive  to  the  risk  of treatment  going  beyond  the
     threshold  set  by article 3.  The special factors  taken
     into account were the youth of the fugitive (he was 18 at
     the  time  of the murders), an impaired mental  capacity,
     and the suffering on death row which could endure for  up
     to  eight  years  if  he  were convicted.   Additionally,
     although the offence for which extradition was sought had
     been committed in the United States, the fugitive who was
     a  German  national was also liable to be tried  for  the
     same  offence  in Germany.  Germany, which has  abolished
     the  death sentence, also sought his extradition for  the
     murders. There was accordingly a choice in regard to  the
     country  to which the fugitive should be extradited,  and
     that  choice  should have been exercised in a  way  which
     would  not  lead to a contravention of article  3.   What
     weighed  with  the  Court was the fact  that  the  choice
     facing  the  United  Kingdom was  not  a  choice  between
     extradition  to  face  a possible death  penalty  and  no
     punishment, but a choice between extradition to a country
     which  allows the death penalty and one which  does  not.
     We  are  in a comparable position.  A holding by us  that
     the  death  penalty for murder is unconstitutional,  does
     not  involve  a  choice  between freedom  and  death;  it
     involves  a  choice between death in the very  few  cases
     which  would otherwise attract that penalty under section
     277(1)(a), and the severe penalty of life imprisonment.

Capital Punishment in India

[70] In the amicus brief of the South African Police, reliance
     was  placed on decisions of the Indian Supreme Court, and
     it  is necessary to refer briefly to the way the law  has
     developed in that country.

[71] Section  302  of  the  Indian Penal Code  authorises  the
     imposition of the death sentence as a penalty for murder.
     In Bachan Singh v State of Punjab,96 the constitutionality
     of  this provision was put in issue.  Article 21  of  the
     Indian Constitution provides that:

     No person  shall  be  deprived of his  life  or  personal
          liberty   except according to procedure  established
          by law.

[72] The  wording of this article presented an obstacle  to  a
     challenge  to  the death sentence, because  there  was  a
     "law"  which  made  provision  for  the  death  sentence.
     Moreover,  article  72 of the Constitution  empowers  the
     President  and Governors to commute sentences  of  death,
     and article 134  refers to the Supreme Court's powers  on
     appeal  in  cases  where  the  death  sentence  has  been
imposed.     It    was   clear,   therefore,   that    capital
     punishment  was specifically contemplated and  sanctioned   
by  the  framers of the Indian Constitution, when it  was
     adopted by them in November 1949.97

     [73]  Counsel  for  the accused in  Bachan  Singh's  case
     sought  to  overcome this difficulty by  contending  that
     article  21  had  to  be read with article  19(1),  which
     guarantees  the  freedoms  of  speech,  of  assembly,  of
     association, of movement, of residence, and  the  freedom
     to  engage in any occupation.  These fundamental freedoms
     can  only be restricted under the Indian Constitution  if
     the  restrictions are reasonable for the attainment of  a
     number of purposes defined in sections 19(2) to (6).   It
     was  contended that the right to life was  basic  to  the
     enjoyment  of  these fundamental freedoms, and  that  the
     death  sentence restricted them unreasonably in  that  it
     served  no  social  purpose,  its  deterrent  effect  was
     unproven and it defiled the dignity of the individual.

[74] The  Supreme  Court  analysed the provisions  of  article
     19(1)  and came to the conclusion, for reasons  that  are
     not material to the present case, that the provisions  of
     section  302  of the Indian Penal Code did "not  have  to
     stand  the  test of article 19(1) of the Constitution."98
     It  went  on,  however, to consider "arguendo"  what  the
     outcome would be if the test of reasonableness and public
     interest under article 19(1) had to be satisfied.

     [75]  The  Supreme Court had recognised in  a  number  of
     cases that the death sentence served as a deterrent,  and
     the  Law  Commission  of India, which  had  conducted  an
     investigation  into  capital  punishment  in  1967,   had
     recommended  that  capital punishment be  retained.   The
     court  held  that in the circumstances it  was  "for  the
     petitioners  to  prove  and  establish  that  the   death
     sentence  for murder is so outmoded, unusual or excessive
     as  to  be devoid of any rational nexus with the  purpose
     and object of the legislation."99
    
     [76]  The Court then dealt with international authorities
     for   and  against  the  death  sentence,  and  with  the
     arguments concerning deterrence and retribution.100  After
     reviewing  the  arguments  for  and  against  the   death
     sentence, the court concluded that:
    
          ...the  question whether or not [the] death  penalty
          serves  any  penological  purpose  is  a  difficult,
          complex  and  intractable issue [which]  has  evoked
          strong, divergent views.  For the purpose of testing
          the constitutionality of the impugned provisions  as
          to   death   penalty   ...   on   the   grounds   of
          reasonableness in the light of Articles 19 and 21 of
          the  Constitution,  it is not necessary  for  us  to
          express any categorical opinion, one way or another,
          as to which of these antithetical views, held by the
          Abolitionists and the Retentionists, is correct.  It
          is sufficient to say that the very fact that persons
          of  reason,  learning and light are  rationally  and
          deeply  divided in their opinion on this  issue,  is
          ground  among others, for rejecting the petitioners'
          argument  that  retention of death  penalty  in  the
          impugned provision, is totally devoid of reason  and
          purpose.101
         
     It  accordingly held that section 302 of the Indian Penal
     Code  "violates  neither  the letter  nor  the  ethos  of
     Article 19."102
    
     [77]  The Court then went on to deal with article 21.  It
     said that if article 21 were to be expanded in accordance
     with   the   interpretative   principle   applicable   to
     legislation limiting rights under Article 19(1),  article
     21 would have to be read as follows:

          No  person  shall be deprived of  his  life  or
          personal liberty except according to fair, just
          and reasonable procedure established by a valid
          law.

     And  thus  expanded, it was clear that  the  State  could
     deprive  a person of his or her life, by "fair, just  and
     reasonable procedure."  In the circumstances, and  taking
     into account the  indications that capital punishment was
     considered by the framers of the constitution in 1949  to
     be  a  valid penalty, it was asserted that "by no stretch
     of   the   imagination  can  it  be   said   that   death
     penalty...either  per se or because of its  execution  by
     hanging  constitutes an unreasonable,  cruel  or  unusual
     punishment" prohibited by the Constitution.103
    
     [78]  The  wording  of  the relevant  provisions  of  our
     Constitution  are  different.  The question  we  have  to
     consider  is  not  whether the imposition  of  the  death
     sentence  for  murder is "totally devoid  of  reason  and
     purpose",  or whether the death sentence for  murder  "is
     devoid of any rational nexus" with the purpose and object
     of  section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act.   It
     is  whether in the context of our Constitution, the death
     penalty  is cruel, inhuman or degrading, and  if  it  is,
     whether it can be justified in terms of section 33.

[79] The  Indian Penal Code leaves the imposition of the death
     sentence  to  the  trial judge's discretion.   In  Bachan
     Singh's   case  there  was  also  a  challenge   to   the
     constitutionality of the legislation on  the  grounds  of
     arbitrariness,  along the lines of  the  challenges  that
     have  been successful in the United States.  The majority
     of the Court rejected the argument that the imposition of
     the  death  sentence in such circumstances is  arbitrary,
     holding that a discretion exercised judicially by persons
     of experience and standing, in accordance with principles
     crystallized  by judicial decisions, is not an  arbitrary
     discretion.104   To complete the picture,  it  should  be
     mentioned  that  long delays in carrying  out  the  death
     sentence in particular cases have apparently been held in
     India  to  be unjust and unfair to the prisoner,  and  in
     such circumstances the death sentence is liable to be set
     aside.105


The Right to Life

     [80] The unqualified right to life vested in every person
     by  section  9  of  our Constitution  is  another  factor
     crucially  relevant  to the question  whether  the  death
     sentence is cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment within
     the  meaning  of  section 11(2) of our Constitution.   In
     this respect our Constitution differs materially from the
     Constitutions  of the United States and India.   It  also
     differs  materially from the European Convention and  the
     International  Covenant.  Yet in the cases decided  under
     these  constitutions and treaties there were  judges  who
     dissented  and  held  that notwithstanding  the  specific
     language  of  the  constitution or instrument  concerned,
     capital punishment should not be permitted.

[81] In  some  instances the dissent focused on the  right  to
     life.   In  Soering's case before the European  Court  of
     Human  Rights,  Judge de Meyer, in a concurring  opinion,
     said that capital punishment is "not consistent with  the
     present  state of European civilisation"106 and for  that
     reason  alone,  extradition to the  United  States  would
     violate the fugitive's right to life.

     [82]  In  a  dissent in the United Nations  Human  Rights
     Committee   in  Kindler's  case,  Committee   member   B.
     Wennergren also stressed the importance of the  right  to
     life.

          The  value  of  life is immeasurable for  any  human
          being, and the right to life enshrined in article  6
          of  the Covenant is the supreme human right.  It  is
          an obligation of States [P]arties to the Covenant to
          protect  the  lives  of all human  beings  on  their
          territory  and under their jurisdiction.  If  issues
          arise  in respect of the protection of the right  to
          life,  priority must not be accorded to the domestic
          laws  of  other  countries or to (bilateral)  treaty
          articles.  Discretion of any nature permitted  under
          an  extradition treaty cannot apply, as there is  no
          room for it under Covenant obligations.  It is worth
          repeating   that  no  derogation  from   a   State's
          obligations  under  article  6,  paragraph   1,   is
          permitted.  This is why Canada, in my view, violated
          article  6, paragraph 1, by consenting to  extradite
          Mr.  Kindler  to  the United States, without  having
          secured  assurances that Mr. Kindler  would  not  be
          subjected to the execution of the death sentence.107
         
          [83]   An  individual's  right  to  life  has   been
     described  as  "[t]he  most  fundamental  of  all   human
     rights",108 and was dealt with in that way in the judgments
     of  the  Hungarian Constitutional Court declaring capital
     punishment to be unconstitutional.109  The challenge to the
     death sentence in Hungary was based on section 54 of  its
     Constitution which provides:
         
               (1) In the Republic of Hungary everyone has the
          inherent  right to life and to human dignity, and no
          one shall be arbitrarily deprived of these rights.
    
               (2) No one shall be subjected to torture or  to
          cruel or inhuman or degrading punishment
    
[84] Section  8,  the  counterpart  of  section  33   of   our
     Constitution,  provides that laws shall  not  impose  any
     limitations  on  the  essential  content  of  fundamental
     rights.   According to the finding of the Court,  capital
     punishment imposed a limitation on the essential  content
     of  the  fundamental  rights to life and  human  dignity,
     eliminating   them  irretrievably.   As   such   it   was
     unconstitutional.   Two  factors  are  stressed  in   the
     judgment  of the Court.  First, the relationship  between
     the  rights  of  life and dignity, and the importance  of
     these  rights  taken  together.  Secondly,  the  absolute
     nature of these two rights taken together.  Together they
     are the source of all other rights.  Other rights may  be
     limited,  and  may  even be withdrawn  and  then  granted
again,  but  their  ultimate  limit is  to  be  found  in  the
     preservation  of  the twin rights of  life  and  dignity.
     These twin rights are the essential content of all rights
     under  the  Constitution.  Take them away, and all  other
     rights cease.  I will deal later with the requirement  of
     our  Constitution that a right shall not  be  limited  in
     ways  which  negate  its  essential  content.    For  the
     present  purposes it is sufficient to point to  the  fact
     that  the Hungarian Court held capital punishment  to  be
     unconstitutional on the grounds that it  is  inconsistent
     with the right to life and the right to dignity.

[85] Our Constitution does not contain the qualification found
     in  section  54(1)  of the Hungarian constitution,  which
     prohibits  only the arbitrary deprivation  of  life.   To
     that extent, therefore, the right to life in section 9 of
     our  Constitution is given greater protection than it  is
     by the Hungarian Constitution.

[86] The  fact that in both the United States and India, which
     sanction  capital  punishment, the  highest  courts  have
     intervened on constitutional grounds in particular  cases
     to  prevent the carrying out of death sentences,  because
     in  the particular circumstances of such cases, it  would
     have  been  cruel  to  do  so, evidences  the  importance
     attached  to  the  protection  of  life  and  the  strict
     scrutiny  to  which the imposition and  carrying  out  of
     death  sentences  are  subjected  when  a  constitutional
     challenge is raised.  The same concern is apparent in the
     decisions of the European Court of Human Rights  and  the
     United  Nations Committee on Human Rights.   It  led  the
     Court in Soering's case to order that extradition to  the
     United  States, in the circumstances of that case,  would
     result in inhuman or degrading punishment, and the  Human
     Rights  Committee to declare in Ng's case that he  should
     not   be   extradited  to  face  a  possible   death   by
     asphyxiation in a gas chamber in California.

Public Opinion

[87] The  Attorney General argued that what is cruel,  inhuman
     or  degrading depends to a large extent upon contemporary
     attitudes within society, and that South African  society
     does  not regard the death sentence for extreme cases  of
     murder   as  a  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading  form   of
     punishment.  It  was  disputed  whether  public  opinion,
     properly informed of the different considerations,  would
     in  fact  favour  the  death  penalty.   I  am,  however,
     prepared to assume that it does and that the majority  of
     South  Africans agree that the death sentence  should  be
     imposed in extreme cases of murder.  The question  before
     us,  however, is not what the majority of South  Africans
     believe  a proper sentence for murder should be.   It  is
     whether the Constitution allows the sentence.

[88] Public  opinion may have some relevance to  the  enquiry,
     but in itself, it is no substitute for the duty vested in
     the  Courts to interpret the Constitution and  to  uphold
     its provisions without fear or favour.  If public opinion
     were   to  be  decisive  there  would  be  no  need   for
     constitutional  adjudication.  The protection  of  rights
     could  then  be left to Parliament, which has  a  mandate
     from the public, and is answerable to the public for  the
     way  its mandate is exercised, but this would be a return
     to  parliamentary sovereignty, and a retreat from the new
     legal order established by the 1993 Constitution.  By the
     same  token the issue of the constitutionality of capital
     punishment cannot be referred to a referendum, in which a
     majority  view  would  prevail over  the  wishes  of  any
     minority.  The very reason for establishing the new legal
     order,  and for vesting the power of judicial  review  of
     all  legislation in the courts, was to protect the rights
     of  minorities and others who cannot protect their rights
     adequately through the democratic process.  Those who are
     entitled  to  claim  this protection include  the  social
     outcasts and marginalised  people of our society.  It  is
     only  if there is a willingness to protect the worst  and
     the weakest amongst us, that all of us can be secure that
     our own rights will be protected.

[89] This  Court cannot allow itself to be diverted  from  its
     duty to act as an independent arbiter of the Constitution
     by making choices on the basis that they will find favour
     with  the  public.110  Justice Powell's  comment  in  his
     dissent in  Furman v Georgia bears repetition:

     ...the  weight  of the evidence indicates that  the
          public  generally has not accepted either  the
          morality  or the social merit of the views  so
          passionately   advocated  by  the   articulate
          spokesmen for abolition.  But however one  may
          assess   amorphous  ebb  and  flow  of  public
          opinion generally on this volatile issue, this
          type  of inquiry lies at the periphery  -  not
          the   core  -  of  the  judicial  process   in
          constitutional  cases.   The   assessment   of
          popular  opinion is essentially a legislative,
          and not a judicial, function.111

So too  does  the comment of Justice Jackson in West  Virginia
     State Board of Education v Barnette:

     The very  purpose  of  a Bill of Rights was  to  withdraw
          certain  subjects from the vicissitudes of political
          controversy,  to  place them  beyond  the  reach  of
          majorities  and officials and to establish  them  as
          legal principles to be applied by the courts.  One's
          right  to  life,  liberty,  and  property,  to  free
          speech,  a  free  press,  freedom  of  worship   and
          assembly  and other fundamental rights  may  not  be
          submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of  no
          elections.112
    
     Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Punishment
    
          [90]  The  United Nations Committee on Human  Rights
     has  held that the death sentence by definition is  cruel
     and   degrading   punishment.   So  has   the   Hungarian
     Constitutional  Court, and three judges of  the  Canadian
     Supreme Court.  The death sentence has also been held  to
     be  cruel or unusual punishment and thus unconstitutional
     under  the  state  constitutions  of  Massachusetts   and
     California.113
    
[91] The California decision is People v. Anderson.114  Capital
     punishment  was held by six of the seven  judges  of  the
     Californian Supreme Court to be "impermissibly  cruel"115
     under  the California Constitution which prohibited cruel
or unusual punishment.  Also,

     It degrades  and dehumanizes all who participate  in  its
          processes.  It is unnecessary to any legitimate goal
          of the state and is incompatible with the dignity of
          man and the judicial process.116
    
          [92]  In  the  Massachusetts  decision  in  District
     Attorney for the Suffolk District v.  Watson,117 where the
     Constitution  of  the  State of Massachusetts  prohibited
     cruel or unusual punishment, the death sentence was  also
     held,  by  six  of the seven judges, to be  impermissibly
     cruel.118
         
     [93]  In  both cases the disjunctive effect of  "or"  was
     referred  to  as  enabling the Courts to declare  capital
     punishment unconstitutional even if it was not "unusual".
     Under  our Constitution it will not meet the requirements
     of   section  11(2)  if  it  is  cruel,  or  inhuman,  or
     degrading.

[94] Proportionality is an ingredient to be taken into account
     in  deciding  whether  a penalty  is  cruel,  inhuman  or
     degrading.119    No   Court  would   today   uphold   the
constitutionality   of   a  statute  that  makes   the   death
     sentence  a  competent sentence for the cutting  down  of
     trees or the killing of deer, which were capital offences
     in England in the 18th Century.120  But murder is not to be
     equated  with such "offences."  The wilful taking  of  an
     innocent  life calls for a severe penalty, and there  are
     many countries which still retain the death penalty as  a
     sentencing option for such cases.  Disparity between  the
     crime  and  the  penalty is not the  only  ingredient  of
     proportionality;  factors  such  as  the   enormity   and
     irredeemable   character  of  the   death   sentence   in
     circumstances  where neither error nor arbitrariness  can
     be excluded, the expense and difficulty of addressing the
     disparities  which  exist  in  practice  between  accused
     persons  facing  similar charges, and which  are  due  to
     factors  such  as race, poverty, and ignorance,  and  the
     other  subjective factors which have been mentioned,  are
     also factors that can and should be taken into account in
     dealing  with this issue.  It may possibly be  that  none
     alone  would  be  sufficient under  our  Constitution  to
     justify  a  finding  that the death  sentence  is  cruel,
     inhuman  or degrading. But these factors are  not  to  be
     evaluated in isolation. They must be taken together,  and
     in  order to decide whether the threshold set by  section
     11(2) has been crossed121 they must be evaluated with other
relevant  factors,  including the two  fundamental  rights  on
     which  the  accused rely, the right to  dignity  and  the
     right to life.

     [95]  The  carrying  out of the death  sentence  destroys
     life,   which  is  protected  without  reservation  under
     section  9  of  our  Constitution, it  annihilates  human
     dignity which is protected under section 10, elements  of
     arbitrariness are present in its enforcement  and  it  is
     irremediable.  Taking these factors into account, as well
     as  the  assumption that I have made in regard to  public
     opinion  in South Africa, and giving the words of section
     11(2)  the broader meaning to which they are entitled  at
     this stage of the enquiry, rather than a narrow meaning,122
     I  am  satisfied that in the context of our  Constitution
     the   death  penalty  is  indeed  a  cruel,  inhuman  and
     degrading punishment.
    
     Is capital punishment for murder justifiable?
    
     [96]  The  question  that now has  to  be  considered  is
     whether  the imposition of such punishment is nonetheless
     justifiable  as a penalty for murder in the circumstances
     contemplated by sections 277(1)(a), 316A and  322(2A)  of
     the Criminal Procedure Act.

[97] It is difficult to conceive of any circumstances in which
     torture,  which is specifically prohibited under  section
     11(2),  could  ever  be justified.   But  that  does  not
     necessarily   apply   to  capital  punishment.    Capital
     punishment,  unlike  torture,  has  not  been  absolutely
     prohibited by public international law.  It is  therefore
     not  inappropriate to consider whether the death  penalty
     is  justifiable under our Constitution as a  penalty  for
     murder.   This  calls  for  an enquiry  similar  to  that
     undertaken by Brennan J in Furman's case123 in dealing with
the contention   that   "death  is  a   necessary   punishment
     because it prevents the commission of capital crimes more
     effectively than any less severe punishment."124  The same
     question is addressed and answered in the negative in the
     judgment of Wright CJ in People v Anderson.125  Under the
     United    States   Constitution   and   the   Californian
     Constitution,  which  have  no limitation  clauses,  this
     enquiry had to be conducted within the larger question of
     the  definition  of  the right.  With  us,  however,  the
     question has to be dealt with under section 33(1).

     [98] Section 33(1) of the Constitution provides, in part,
     that:
    
          The rights entrenched in this Chapter may be limited
          by  law  of general application, provided that  such
          limitation-
               (a)   shall  be permissible only to the  extent
               that it is-
                              (i)  reasonable;  and
                               (ii) justifiable in an open and
                    democratic  society based on  freedom  and
                    equality;  and
                      (b)   shall  not  negate  the  essential
               content of the right in question.

[99] Section  33(1)(b) goes on to provide that the  limitation
     of  certain rights, including the rights referred  to  in
     section  10 and section 11 "shall, in addition  to  being
     reasonable  as  required  in paragraph  (a)(I),  also  be
     necessary."

The Two-Stage Approach

[100]     Our Constitution deals with the limitation of rights
     through a general limitations clause.  As was pointed out
     by Kentridge AJ in Zuma's case,126 this calls for a "two-
     stage"  approach, in which a broad rather than  a  narrow
     interpretation   is  given  to  the  fundamental   rights
     enshrined  in Chapter Three, and limitations have  to  be
     justified through the application of section 33.  In this
     it  differs  from the Constitution of the United  States,
     which  does not contain a limitation clause, as a  result
     of which courts in that country have been obliged to find
     limits   to  constitutional  rights  through   a   narrow
     interpretation  of the rights themselves.   Although  the
     "two-stage" approach may often produce the same result as
     the  "one-stage" approach,127 this will not always be the
     case.

     [101]      The  practical consequences of this difference
     in approach are evident in the present case.  In Gregg v.
     Georgia,  the conclusion reached in the judgment  of  the
     plurality was summed up as follows:

          In  sum,  we  cannot say that the  judgment  of  the
          Georgia legislature that capital punishment  may  be
          necessary   in   some   cases  is   clearly   wrong.
          Considerations of federalism, as well as respect for
          the  ability of a legislature to evaluate, in  terms
          of   its   particular  state  the  moral   consensus
          concerning the death penalty and its social  utility
          as a sanction, require us to conclude in the absence
          of  more convincing evidence, that the infliction of
          death  as  a  punishment for murder is  not  without
          justification,  and  is thus not  unconstitutionally
          severe.128
         
          [102]      Under  our Constitution, the position  is
     different.  It is not whether the decision of  the  State
     has  been  shown to be clearly wrong; it is  whether  the
     decision  of  the State is justifiable according  to  the
     criteria prescribed by section 33.  It is not whether the
     infliction  of death as a punishment for murder  "is  not
     without  justification", it is whether the infliction  of
     death  as  a punishment for murder has been shown  to  be
     both  reasonable and necessary, and to be consistent with
     the  other  requirements of section 33.  It  is  for  the
     legislature, or the party relying on the legislation,  to
     establish  this  justification, and  not  for  the  party
     challenging it to show that it was not justified.129
         
          The Application of Section 33
         
     [103]      The  criteria prescribed by section 33(1)  for
     any  limitation of  the rights contained in section 11(2)
     are  that the limitation must be justifiable in  an  open
     and democratic society based on freedom and equality,  it
     must  be  both reasonable and necessary and it  must  not
     negate the essential content of the right.

[104]      The  limitation  of  constitutional  rights  for  a
     purpose  that is reasonable and necessary in a democratic
     society involves the weighing up of competing values, and
     ultimately an assessment based on proportionality.130  This
     is implicit in the provisions of section 33(1).  The fact
     that  different  rights have different  implications  for
     democracy, and in the case of our Constitution,  for  "an
open and    democratic   society   based   on   freedom    and
     equality", means that there is no absolute standard which
     can  be  laid  down  for determining  reasonableness  and
     necessity.   Principles  can  be  established,  but   the
     application    of   those   principles   to    particular
     circumstances can only be done on a case by  case  basis.
     This  is  inherent in the requirement of proportionality,
     which calls for the balancing of different interests.  In
     the  balancing process, the relevant considerations  will
     include the nature of the right that is limited, and  its
     importance  to  an open and democratic society  based  on
     freedom and equality; the purpose for which the right  is
     limited  and  the importance of that purpose  to  such  a
     society; the extent of the limitation, its efficacy,  and
     particularly  where the limitation has to  be  necessary,
     whether  the  desired ends could reasonably  be  achieved
     through  other  means  less  damaging  to  the  right  in
     question.   In  the process regard must  be  had  to  the
     provisions of section 33(1), and the underlying values of
     the  Constitution, bearing in mind that,  as  a  Canadian
     Judge  has said, "the role of the Court is not to second-
     guess the wisdom of policy choices made by legislators."131

Limitation of Rights in Canada

     [105]      In  dealing with this aspect of the  case,  Mr
     Trengove placed considerable reliance on the decision  of
     the Canadian Supreme Court in R v Oakes.132  The Canadian
     Charter  of  Rights,  as  our  Constitution  does,  makes
     provision for the limitation of rights through a  general
     clause.  Section 1 of the Charter permits such reasonable
     limitations  of  Charter rights "as can  be  demonstrably
     justified  in a free and democratic society."  In  Oakes'
     case it was held that in order to meet this requirement a
     limitation of a Charter right had to be directed  to  the
     achievement  of an objective of sufficient importance  to
     warrant the limitation of the right in question, and that
     there   had  also  to  be  proportionality  between   the
     limitation  and  such objective.  In  a  frequently-cited
     passage,   Dickson  CJC  described  the   components   of
     proportionality as follows:
    
          There   are,   in  my  view,  three   important
          components  of a proportionality test.   First,
          the measures adopted must be carefully designed
          to achieve the objective in question. They must
          not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational
          considerations.   In  short,   they   must   be
          rationally connected to the objective.  Second,
          the  means, even if rationally connected to the
          objective  in  this first sense, should  impair
          "as little as possible" the right or freedom in
          question:  R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd. at p.  352.
          Third,  there must be a proportionality between
          the   effects   of  the  measures   which   are
          responsible for limiting the Charter  right  or
          freedom,  and  the  objective  which  has  been
          identified as of "sufficient importance".133
         
[106]      Although  there  is  a rational connection  between
     capital  punishment  and  the purpose  for  which  it  is
     prescribed, the elements of arbitrariness, unfairness and
     irrationality  in  the imposition  of  the  penalty,  are
     factors that would have to be taken into account  in  the
     application of the first component of this test.  As  far
     as  the  second component is concerned, the fact  that  a
     severe  punishment  in the form of life  imprisonment  is
     available  as an alternative sentence, would be  relevant
     to  the  question whether the death sentence impairs  the
     right  as little as possible.  And as I will show  later,
     if all relevant considerations are taken into account, it
     is  at  least  doubtful  whether a  sentence  of  capital
punishment  for  murder  would  satisfy  the  third  component
     of the Oakes test.

[107]      The second requirement of the Oakes test, that  the
     limitation  should  impair  the  right  "as   little   as
     possible"  raises  a  fundamental  problem  of   judicial
     review.   Can, and should, an unelected court  substitute
     its  own  opinion of what is reasonable or necessary  for
     that of an elected legislature?  Since the judgment in  R
     v  Oakes, the Canadian Supreme Court has shown that it is
     sensitive  to  this tension, which is particularly  acute
     where  choices have to be made in respect of  matters  of
     policy.  In Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec (Attorney General),134
     Dickson CJ cautioned that courts, "must be mindful of the
     legislature's representative function."   In Reference re
     ss. 193 and 195 (1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Manitoba),135
     it was said that "the role of the Court is not to second-
     guess   the   wisdom   of   policy   choices   made    by
     ...legislators"; and in R v Chaulk, that the  means  must
     impair the right "as little as is reasonably possible".136
     Where   choices  have  to  be  made  between   "differing
     reasonable  policy  options", the courts will  allow  the
     government the deference due to legislators, but  "[will]
     not  give  them an unrestricted licence to  disregard  an
     individual's Charter Rights.  Where the government cannot
     show  that it had a reasonable basis for concluding  that
     it   has   complied  with  the  requirement  of   minimal
     impairment  in  seeking  to attain  its  objectives,  the
     legislation will be struck down."137
Limitation of Rights in Germany

     [108]      The  German Constitution does  not  contain  a
     general  limitations  clause but  permits  certain  basic
     rights  to  be  limited by law.  According  to  Professor
     Grimm,138  the Federal Constitutional Court  allows  such
     limitation  "only  in  order to make  conflicting  rights
     compatible  or to protect the rights of other persons  or
     important community interests...any restriction of  human
     rights not only needs constitutionally valid reasons  but
     also has to be proportional to the rank and importance of
     the  right at stake."  Proportionality is central to  the
     process  followed by the Federal Constitutional Court  in
     its  adjudication  upon the limitation  of  rights.   The
     Court   has  regard  to  the  purpose  of  the   limiting
     legislation, whether the legislation is suitable for  the
     achievement   of   such  purpose,   which   brings   into
     consideration  whether it in fact achieves that  purpose,
     is  necessary therefor, and whether a proper balance  has
     been  achieved  between  the  purpose  enhanced  by   the
     limitation,  and  the  fundamental right  that  has  been
     limited.139  The German Constitution also has a provision
     similar to section 33(1)(b) of our Constitution, but  the
     Court  apparently avoids making use of this provision,140
     preferring  to  deal with extreme limitations  of  rights
     through the proportionality test.
     Limitation of Rights Under the European Convention
    
     [109]      The  European Convention also has  no  general
     limitations clause, but makes certain rights  subject  to
     limitation   according   to  specified   criteria.    The
     proportionality  test  of  the European  Court  of  Human
     Rights calls for a balancing of ends and means.  The  end
     must  be a "pressing social need" and the means used must
     be  proportionate to the attainment of such an end.   The
     limitation  of  certain rights is  conditioned  upon  the
     limitation being "necessary in a democratic society"  for
     purposes  defined  in  the  relevant  provisions  of  the
     Convention.   The  national  authorities  are  allowed  a
     discretion  by  the  European Court of  Human  Rights  in
     regard to what is necessary - a margin of appreciation  -
     but  not  unlimited power.  The "margin of  appreciation"
     that  is allowed varies depending upon the nature of  the
     right  and  the  nature and ambit of the restriction.   A
     balance  has to be achieved between the general interest,
     and   the  interest  of  the  individual.141   Where  the
     limitation  is  to  a  right  fundamental  to  democratic
     society, a higher standard of justification is required;142
     so too, where a law interferes with the "intimate aspects
     of private life."143  On the other hand, in areas such as
     morals  or social policy greater scope is allowed to  the
     national authorities.144  The jurisprudence of the European
     Court  of Human Rights provides some guidance as to  what
     may  be considered necessary in a democratic society, but
     the   margin   of   appreciation  allowed   to   national
     authorities  by the European Court must be understood  as
     finding its place in an international agreement which has
     to  accommodate the sovereignty of the member states.  It
     is  not  necessarily a safe guide as  to  what  would  be
     appropriate under section 33 of our Constitution.
    
     Is  Capital Punishment for Murder Justifiable  under  the
     South African Constitution?
    
     [110]      In Zuma's case, Kentridge AJ pointed out  that
     the  criteria  developed by the Canadian Courts  for  the
     interpretation  of section 1 of the Canadian  Charter  of
     Rights may be of assistance to our Courts, but that there
     are differences between our Constitution and the Canadian
     Charter  which have a bearing on the way in which section
     33  should  be dealt with.  This is equally true  of  the
     criteria  developed by other courts, such as  the  German
     Constitutional  Court  and the European  Court  of  Human
     Rights.   Like  Kentridge AJ, "I see no  reason  in  this
     case...  to attempt to fit our analysis into the Canadian
     pattern,"145 or for that matter to fit it into the pattern
     followed  by  any of the other courts to which  reference
     has  been made.  Section 33 prescribes in specific  terms
     the  criteria  to  be  applied  for  the  limitation   of
     different categories of rights and it is in the light  of
     these criteria that the death sentence for murder has  to
     be justified.
    
     [111]      "Every  person"  is  entitled  to  claim   the
     protection of the rights enshrined in Chapter Three,  and
     "no"  person  shall  be denied the protection  that  they
     offer.   Respect for life and dignity which  are  at  the
     heart  of  section 11(2) are values of the highest  order
     under  our  Constitution.  The carrying out of the  death
     penalty would destroy these and all other rights that the
     convicted  person  has, and a clear and  convincing  case
     must be made out to justify such action.

[112]      The  Attorney General contended that the imposition
of the  death  penalty  for murder in the most  serious  cases
     could  be justified according to the prescribed criteria.
     The  argument went as follows.  The death sentence  meets
     the  sentencing requirements for extreme cases of  murder
     more effectively than any other sentence can do.  It  has
     a  greater  deterrent effect than life  imprisonment;  it
     ensures  that  the worst murderers will not endanger  the
     lives  of prisoners and warders who would be at  risk  if
     the  "worst  of the murderers" were to be imprisoned  and
     not  executed; and it also meets the need for retribution
     which  is  demanded by society as a response to the  high
     level   of   crime.    In  the  circumstances   presently
     prevailing  in the country, it is therefore  a  necessary
     component of the criminal justice system.  This, he said,
     is  recognised  by  the  Appellate Division,  which  only
     confirms  a  death  sentence if it is convinced  that  no
     other sentence would be a proper sentence.146

The Judgements of the Appellate Division

     [113]      The  decisions  of the Appellate  Division  to
     which  the Attorney General referred are only of  limited
     relevance to the questions that have to be decided in the
     present  case.  The law which the Appellate Division  has
     applied prescribes that the death sentence is a competent
     sentence  for  murder  in a proper case.   The  Appellate
     Division has reserved this sentence for extreme cases  in
     which  the  maximum punishment would be  the  appropriate
     punishment.  Were it to have done otherwise, and to  have
     refused to pass death sentences, it would in effect  have
     been  saying  that the death sentence is never  a  proper
     sentence,  and  that  section  277(1)(a)  should  not  be
     enforced.   This  was  not within  its  competence.   The
     criteria set by the Appellate Division for the passing of
     a  death sentence for murder are relevant to the argument
     on  arbitrariness, and also provide a basis  for  testing
     the  justifiability  of  such a penalty.   They  do  not,
     however, do more than that.

The Judgement of the Tanzanian Court of Appeal

[114]      There is support for part of the Attorney General's
     argument in the judgment of the Tanzanian Court of Appeal
     in Mbushuu and Another v The Republic.147  It was held in
     this  case that the death sentence amounted to cruel  and
     degrading  punishment,  which  is  prohibited  under  the
     Tanzanian Constitution, but that despite this finding, it
     was  not  unconstitutional. The  Constitution  authorised
     derogations  to be made from basic rights for  legitimate
     purposes,  and  a derogation was lawful  if  it  was  not
     arbitrary, and was reasonably necessary for such purpose.
     The  legitimate purposes to which the death sentence  was
     directed   was   a   constitutional   requirement    that
     "everyone's  right  to life shall be protected  by  law."
     The  death  sentence was a mandatory penalty for  murder,
     but  it  was not considered by the Court to be  arbitrary
     because  decisions as to guilt or innocence are taken  by
     judges. There was no proof one way or the other that  the
     death   sentence   was  necessarily  a   more   effective
     punishment  than a long period of imprisonment.   In  the
     view  of  the Court, however, it was for society and  not
     the  courts  to decide whether the death sentence  was  a
     necessary  punishment.   The  Court  was  satisfied  that
     society  favoured the death sentence,  and  that  in  the
     circumstances "the reasonable and necessary" standard had
     been  met.  Accordingly, it held that the death  sentence
     was a lawful derogation from the prohibition of cruel and
     degrading punishment, and thus valid.

     [115]      The approach of the Tanzanian Court of  Appeal
     to issues concerning the limitation of basic rights seems
     to  have been influenced by the language of the Tanzanian
     Constitution,148 and rules of interpretation developed by
     the  Courts  to  deal with that language.   The  relevant
     provisions  of  our  Constitution are different  and  the
     correct approach to the interpretation of the limitations
     clause  must  be  found  in the language  of  section  33
     construed in the context of the Constitution as a  whole.
     It  is  for the Court, and not society or Parliament,  to
     decide  whether  the death sentence is justifiable  under
     the provisions of section 33 of our Constitution.149   In
     doing  so  we  can have regard to societal  attitudes  in
     evaluating  whether  the legislation  is  reasonable  and
     necessary, but ultimately the decision must be ours.   If
     the  decision  of  the  Tanzanian  Court  of  Appeal   is
     inconsistent  with  this conclusion, I  must  express  my
     disagreement with it.
    
          Deterrence
    
     [116]      The  Attorney  General  attached  considerable
     weight to the need for a deterrent to violent crime.   He
     argued  that the countries which had abolished the  death
     penalty   were  on  the  whole  developed  and   peaceful
     countries  in  which other penalties might be  sufficient
     deterrents.    We   had  not  reached   that   stage   of
     development, he said.  If in years to come we did so,  we
     could  do away with the death penalty.  Parliament  could
     decide when that time has come.  At present, however,  so
     the argument went, the death sentence is an indispensable
     weapon if we are serious about combatting violent crime.

[117]      The need for a strong deterrent to violent crime is
     an  end  the  validity of which is not open to  question.
     The  state is clearly entitled, indeed obliged,  to  take
     action to protect human life against violation by others.
     In  all  societies  there  are laws  which  regulate  the
     behaviour of people and which authorise the imposition of
     civil  or criminal sanctions on those who act unlawfully.
     This is necessary for the preservation and protection  of
society.    Without   law,  society  cannot  exist.    Without
     law, individuals in society have no rights.  The level of
     violent   crime  in  our  country  has  reached  alarming
     proportions.   It  poses a threat to  the  transition  to
     democracy,  and the creation of development opportunities
     for  all,  which  are primary goals of the  Constitution.
     The  high  level of violent crime is a matter  of  common
     knowledge  and  is  amply borne  out  by  the  statistics
     provided  by  the Commissioner of Police  in  his  amicus
     brief.   The  power of the State to impose  sanctions  on
     those  who  break the law cannot be doubted.   It  is  of
     fundamental importance to the future of our country  that
     respect  for  the  law  should  be  restored,  and   that
     dangerous criminals should be apprehended and dealt  with
     firmly.  Nothing in this judgment should be understood as
     detracting  in  any way from that proposition.   But  the
     question is not whether criminals should go free  and  be
     allowed  to  escape the consequences of their anti-social
     behaviour.  Clearly they should not; and equally  clearly
     those who engage in violent crime should be met with  the
     full  rigour  of  the law.  The question is  whether  the
     death  sentence for murder can legitimately be made  part
     of  that  law. And this depends on whether it  meets  the
     criteria prescribed by section 33(1).

[118]      The  Attorney  General pointed to  the  substantial
     increase in the incidence of violent crime over the  past
     five  years during which the death sentence has not  been
     enforced.  He contended that this supported his  argument
     that imprisonment is not a sufficient deterrent, and that
     we have not yet reached the stage of development where we
     can  do  without  the  death sentence.   Throughout  this
     period,  however,  the death sentence remained  a  lawful
     punishment,  and  was  in  fact  imposed  by  the  courts
     although  the  sentences were not  carried  out.150   The
     moratorium was only announced formally on 27 March 1992.151
A decision  could  have  been taken at any time  to  terminate
     the  moratorium on executions, and none of the  criminals
     had  any assurance that the moratorium would still be  in
     place  if  they  were  to be caught,  brought  to  trial,
     convicted and sentenced to death.

     [119]      The  cause  of the high incidence  of  violent
     crime cannot simply be attributed to the failure to carry
     out  the  death  sentences imposed by  the  courts.   The
     upsurge  in violent crime came at a time of great  social
     change  associated with political turmoil  and  conflict,
     particularly  during  the period 1990  to  1994.   It  is
     facile  to attribute the increase in violent crime during
     this period to the moratorium on executions.152  It was a
     progression  that  started  before  the  moratorium   was
     announced.  There are many factors that have to be  taken
     into account in looking for the cause of this phenomenon.
     It  is  a  matter of common knowledge that the  political
     conflict  during this period, particularly in  Natal  and
     the  Witwatersrand, resulted in violence and  destruction
     of  a  kind  not  previously experienced.   No-go  areas,
     random  killings  on trains, attacks and counter  attacks
     upon  political opponents, created a violent and unstable
     environment,  manipulated  by  political  dissidents  and
     criminal elements alike.
    
     [120]      Homelessness, unemployment,  poverty  and  the
     frustration  consequent upon such  conditions  are  other
     causes of the crime wave. And there is also the important
     factor  that the police and prosecuting authorities  have
     been  unable to cope with this. The statistics  presented
     in  the police amicus brief show that most violent  crime
     is  not  solved, and the Attorney General confirmed  that
     the  risk  of a criminal being apprehended and  convicted
     for  such  offences is somewhere between 30  and  40  per
     cent.   Throughout the period referred to by the Attorney
     General  the death sentence remained on the statute  book
     and  was  imposed on convicted murderers when the  Courts
     considered it appropriate to do so.

[121]     We would be deluding ourselves if we were to believe
     that  the execution of the few persons sentenced to death
     during  this  period,  and of a comparatively  few  other
     people  each  year  from  now onwards  will  provide  the
     solution  to the unacceptably high rate of crime.   There
     will  always  be  unstable, desperate,  and  pathological
     people  for  whom  the  risk of arrest  and  imprisonment
     provides no deterrent, but there is nothing to show  that
     a decision to carry out the death sentence would have any
     impact  on  the behaviour of such people, or  that  there
     will  be  more  of  them  if  imprisonment  is  the  only
     sanction.   No information was placed before  us  by  the
     Attorney General in regard to the rising crime rate other
     than  the  bare statistics, and they alone prove nothing,
     other  than  that we are living in a violent  society  in
     which most crime goes unpunished - something that we  all
     know.

[122]      The  greatest deterrent to crime is the  likelihood
     that   offenders  will  be  apprehended,  convicted   and
     punished.  It is that which is presently lacking  in  our
     criminal  justice  system; and it is at  this  level  and
     through  addressing the causes of crime  that  the  State
     must seek to combat lawlessness.

[123]      In  the  debate as to the deterrent effect  of  the
     death  sentence, the issue is sometimes dealt with as  if
     the  choice to be made is between the death sentence  and
     the  murder going unpunished.  That is of course not  so.
     The choice to be made is between putting the criminal  to
     death   and   subjecting  the  criminal  to  the   severe
     punishment  of a long term of imprisonment which,  in  an
     appropriate   case,   could  be  a   sentence   of   life
     imprisonment.153  Both are deterrents, and the question is
whether   the   possibility  of  being  sentenced  to   death,
     rather than being sentenced to life imprisonment,  has  a
     marginally  greater  deterrent effect,  and  whether  the
     Constitution sanctions the limitation of rights  affected
     thereby.

     [124]      In  the  course of his argument  the  Attorney
     General contended that if sentences imposed by the Courts
     on  convicted criminals are too lenient, the law will  be
     brought into disrepute, and members of society will  then
     take  the law into their own hands.  Law is brought  into
     disrepute  if  the  justice  system  is  ineffective  and
     criminals are not punished.  But if the justice system is
     effective and criminals are apprehended, brought to trial
     and  in serious cases subjected to severe sentences,  the
     law  will  not  fall into disrepute.   We have  made  the
     commitment  to  "a future founded on the  recognition  of
     human  rights,  democracy and peaceful co-existence...for
     all South Africans."154  Respect for life and dignity lies
     at  the heart of that commitment.  One of the reasons for
     the  prohibition of capital punishment is "that  allowing
     the  State  to kill will cheapen the value of human  life
     and thus [through not doing so] the State will serve in a
     sense as a role model for individuals in society."155  Our
     country needs such role models.
    
     [125]      The  Attorney General also contended  that  if
     even  one  innocent life should be saved by the execution
     of  perpetrators  of  vile murders,  this  would  provide
     sufficient  justification for the death penalty.156   The
     hypothesis  that innocent lives might be  saved  must  be
     weighed  against the values underlying the  Constitution,
     and  the ability of the State to serve "as a role model".
     In  the  long  run  more lives may be saved  through  the
     inculcation  of  a  rights  culture,  than  through   the
     execution of murderers.
    
     [126]      The death sentence has been reserved  for  the
     most  extreme  cases,  and the overwhelming  majority  of
     convicted   murderers  are  not  and,  since  extenuating
     circumstances became a relevant factor sixty  years  ago,
     have  not  been  sentenced to death in South  Africa.   I
     referred  earlier to the figures provided by the Attorney
     General  which  show that between the  amendment  of  the
     Criminal  Procedure Act in 1990, and January 1995,  which
     is  the date of his written argument in the present case,
     243  death  sentences were imposed,  of  which  143  were
     confirmed  by the Appellate Division.  Yet, according  to
     statistics placed before us by the Commissioner of Police
     and   the   Attorney  General,  there  were  on   average
     approximately 20 000 murders committed, and 9 000  murder
     cases  brought  to trial, each year during  this  period.
     Would the carrying out of the death sentence on these 143
     persons  have deterred the other murderers or  saved  any
     lives?

[127]     It was accepted by the Attorney General that this is
     a  much  disputed issue in the literature  on  the  death
     sentence.  He contended that it is common sense that  the
     most  feared penalty will provide the greatest deterrent,
     but  accepted  that  there is no  proof  that  the  death
     sentence  is  in  fact  a  greater  deterrent  than  life
     imprisonment  for  a long period.   It  is,  he  said,  a
     proposition  that  is not capable of proof,  because  one
     never  knows about those who have been deterred; we  know
     only about those who have not been deterred, and who have
     committed  terrible crimes.  This is no doubt  true,  and
     the  fact  that there is no proof that the death sentence
     is   a  greater  deterrent  than  imprisonment  does  not
     necessarily  mean  that the requirements  of  section  33
     cannot  be met.  It is, however, a major obstacle in  the
     way  of  the Attorney General's argument, for he  has  to
     satisfy  us that the penalty is reasonable and necessary,
     and  the  doubt  which exists in regard to the  deterrent
     effect  of  the sentence must weigh heavily  against  his
     argument.    "A punishment as extreme and as  irrevocable
     as death cannot be predicated upon speculation as to what
     the  deterrent effect might be..."157  I should add  that
     this  obstacle would not be removed by the implementation
     of a suggestion in one of the amicus briefs, that section
     277(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act should be made  more
     specific,  and should identify the extreme categories  of
     murder   for  which  the  death  sentence  would   be   a
     permissible punishment.

     Prevention

     [128]      Prevention  is another object  of  punishment.
     The  death sentence ensures that the criminal will  never
     again commit murders, but it is not the only way of doing
     so,  and  life  imprisonment also  serves  this  purpose.
     Although there are cases of gaol murders, imprisonment is
     regarded  as sufficient for the purpose of prevention  in
     the  overwhelming  number of cases  in  which  there  are
     murder convictions, and there is nothing to suggest  that
     it  is  necessary for this purpose in the  few  cases  in
     which death sentences are imposed.

     Retribution

[129]     Retribution is one of the objects of punishment, but
     it carries less weight than deterrence.158  The righteous
     anger  of  family  and  friends  of  the  murder  victim,
     reinforced  by the public abhorrence of vile  crimes,  is
     easily translated into a call for vengeance.  But capital
punishment   is  not  the  only  way  that  society   has   of
     expressing its moral outrage at the crime that  has  been
     committed.  We have long outgrown the literal application
     of  the biblical injunction of "an eye for an eye, and  a
     tooth  for  a tooth".  Punishment must to some extent  be
     commensurate   with  the  offence,  but   there   is   no
     requirement  that  it be equivalent or identical  to  it.
     The  state does not put out the eyes of a person who  has
     blinded another in a vicious assault, nor does it  punish
     a  rapist,  by castrating him and submitting him  to  the
     utmost  humiliation in gaol.  The state does not need  to
     engage in the cold and calculated killing of murderers in
     order to express moral outrage at their conduct.  A  very
     long  prison sentence is also a way of expressing outrage
     and visiting retribution upon the criminal.

     [130]      Retribution ought not to be given undue weight
     in  the  balancing process.  The Constitution is premised
     on  the  assumption  that ours will be  a  constitutional
     state founded on the recognition of human rights.159  The
     concluding provision on National Unity and Reconciliation
     contains the following commitment:
    
          The  adoption  of  this Constitution  lays  the
          secure  foundation  for  the  people  of  South
          Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of
          the  past, which generated gross violations  of
          human rights, the transgression of humanitarian
          principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of
          hatred, fear, guilt and revenge.

          These  can  now be addressed on the basis  that
          there  is a need for understanding but not  for
          vengeance,  a need for reparation but  not  for
          retaliation,  a  need for ubuntu  but  not  for
          victimisation. (Emphasis supplied)

[131]     Although this commitment has its primary application
     in  the  field  of political reconciliation,  it  is  not
     without  relevance to the enquiry we are called  upon  to
     undertake in the present case.  To be consistent with the
     value of ubuntu ours should be a society that "wishes  to
     prevent  crime...[not] to kill criminals  simply  to  get
     even with them."160



     The Essential Content of the Right

     [132]      Section  33(1)(b) provides that  a  limitation
     shall  not  negate the essential content  of  the  right.
     There  is  uncertainty in the literature  concerning  the
     meaning  of  this  provision.  It seems to  have  entered
     constitutional law through the provisions of  the  German
     Constitution,  and  in  addition  to  the  South  African
     constitution, appears, though not precisely in  the  same
     form,  in  the  constitutions of  Namibia,  Hungary,  and
     possibly  other  countries as well.   The  difficulty  of
     interpretation arises from the uncertainty as to what the
     "essential content" of a right is, and how it  is  to  be
     determined.  Should this be determined subjectively  from
     the  point  of  view of the individual  affected  by  the
     invasion of the right, or objectively, from the point  of
     view  of  the  nature of the right and its place  in  the
     constitutional  order, or possibly  in  some  other  way?
     Professor  Currie draws attention to the large number  of
     theories which have been propounded by German scholars as
     to  the  how the "essence" of a right should be discerned
     and how the constitutional provision should be applied.161
     The  German  Federal Constitutional Court has  apparently
     avoided to a large extent having to deal with this  issue
     by  subsuming  the enquiry into the proportionality  test
     that it applies and the precise scope and meaning of  the
     provision is controversial.162
     [133]     If the essential content of the right not to be
     subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment is to
     be  found  in  respect for life and  dignity,  the  death
     sentence  for  murder,  if viewed subjectively  from  the
     point  of view of the convicted prisoner, clearly negates
     the  essential content of the right.  But if it is viewed
     objectively  from  the point of view of a  constitutional
     norm that requires life and dignity to be protected,  the
     punishment  does  not  necessarily negate  the  essential
     content  of  the right.  It has been argued  before  this
     Court  that one of the purposes of such punishment is  to
     protect  the  life  and  hence the  dignity  of  innocent
     members  of  the public, and if it in fact does  so,  the
     punishment will not negate the constitutional  norm.   On
     this  analysis it would, however, have to be  shown  that
     the  punishment serves its intended purpose.  This  would
     involve a consideration of the deterrent and preventative
     effects  of the punishment and whether they add  anything
     to the alternative of life imprisonment.  If they do not,
     they  cannot be said to serve a life protecting  purpose.
     If   the   negation   is  viewed  both  objectively   and
     subjectively,  the ostensible purpose of  the  punishment
     would  have to be weighed against the destruction of  the
     individual's life.  For the purpose of that analysis  the
     element of retribution would have to be excluded and  the
     "life saving" quality of the punishment would have to  be
     established.

[134]      It is, however, not necessary to solve this problem
     in  the  present case.  At the very least  the  provision
     evinces  concern  that, under the  guise  of  limitation,
     rights  should  not  be taken away  altogether.   It  was
     presumably  the same concern that influenced Dickson  CJC
     to  say  in  R v Oakes that rights should be limited  "as
     little as possible",163 and the German Constitutional Court
     to   hold   in  the  life  imprisonment  case  that   all
     possibility of parole ought not to be excluded.164

The Balancing Process

     [135]       In   the   balancing   process,   deterrence,
     prevention  and retribution must be weighed  against  the
     alternative punishments available to the state,  and  the
     factors  which  taken  together make  capital  punishment
     cruel,  inhuman and degrading:  the destruction of  life,
     the   annihilation   of   dignity,   the   elements    of
     arbitrariness, inequality and the possibility of error in
     the enforcement of the penalty.

[136]      The  Attorney General argued that the right to life
     and   the  right  to  human  dignity  were  not  absolute
     concepts.   Like all rights they have their limits.   One
     of   those  limits  is  that  a  person  who  murders  in
     circumstances  where the death penalty  is  permitted  by
     section   277,  forfeits  his  or  her  right  to   claim
     protection  of  life and dignity.  He sought  to  support
     this  argument  by reference to the principles  of  self-
     defence.   If  the law recognises the right to  take  the
     life  of a wrongdoer in a situation in which self-defence
     is  justified,  then, in order to deter  others,  and  to
ensure  that  the  wrongdoer does not again kill  an  innocent
     person,  why  should it not recognise the  power  of  the
     state   to   take  the  life  of  a  convicted  murderer?
     Conversely,  if the death sentence negates the  essential
     content of the right to life, how can the taking  of  the
     life  of  another  person  in self-defence,  or  even  to
     protect the State itself during war or rebellion, ever be
     justified.
[137]      This argument is fallacious.  The rights vested  in
     every  person  by  Chapter Three of the Constitution  are
     subject  to  limitation under section 33.   In  times  of
     emergency, some may be suspended in accordance  with  the
     provisions  of  section 34 of the  Constitution.165   But
     subject  to  this,  the  rights  vest  in  every  person,
     including  criminals  convicted  of  vile  crimes.   Such
     criminals   do  not  forfeit  their  rights   under   the
     Constitution and are entitled, as all in our country  now
     are, to assert these rights, including the right to life,
     the right to dignity and the right not to be subjected to
     cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.  Whether or not a
     particular  punishment is inconsistent with these  rights
     depends upon an interpretation of the relevant provisions
     of the Constitution, and not upon a moral judgment that a
     murderer should not be allowed to claim them.

     [138]       Self-defence  is  recognised  by  all   legal
     systems.  Where a choice has to be made between the lives
     of  two or more people, the life of the innocent is given
     preference  over  the  life of the  aggressor.   This  is
     consistent  with  section 33(1).  To  deny  the  innocent
     person  the  right to act in self-defence would  deny  to
     that  individual his or her right to life.  The  same  is
     true  where lethal force is used against a hostage  taker
     who threatens the life of the hostage.  It is permissible
     to  kill  the  hostage  taker to save  the  life  of  the
     innocent  hostage.  But only if the hostage  is  in  real
     danger.   The  law solves problems such as these  through
     the doctrine of proportionality, balancing the rights  of
     the  aggressor  against the rights  of  the  victim,  and
     favouring the life or lives of innocents over the life or
     lives of the guilty.166  But there are strict limits to the
     taking of life, even in the circumstances that have  been
     described,  and the law insists upon these  limits  being
     adhered to.  In any event, there are material respects in
     which  killing in self-defence or necessity  differ  from
     the  execution of a criminal by the State.   Self-defence
     takes  place  at the time of the threat to  the  victim's
     life,  at the moment of the emergency which gave rise  to
     the necessity and, traditionally, under circumstances  in
     which no less-severe alternative is readily available  to
     the  potential victim.  Killing by the State takes  place
     long  after the crime was committed, at a time when there
     is  no emergency and under circumstances which permit the
     careful consideration of alternative punishment.
    
     [139]     The examples of war and rebellion are also  not
     true  analogies.   War and rebellion  are  special  cases
     which must be dealt with in terms of the legal principles
     governing  such  situations.   It  is  implicit  in   any
     constitutional order that the State can act to  put  down
     rebellion   and   to  protect  itself  against   external
     aggression.  Where it is necessary in the pursuit of such
     ends to kill in the heat of battle the taking of life  is
     sanctioned   under   the   Constitution   by    necessary
     implication,  and  as such, is permissible  in  terms  of
     section  4(1).167  But here also there are limits.   Thus
     prisoners  of war who have been captured and who  are  no
     longer a threat to the State cannot be put to death;  nor
     can  lethal force be used against rebels when it  is  not
     necessary to do so for the purposes of putting  down  the
     rebellion.
    
     [140]      The  case of a police officer shooting  at  an
     escaping criminal was also raised in argument.   This  is
     permitted  under section 49(2) of the Criminal  Procedure
     Act  as a last resort if it is not possible to arrest the
     criminal  in  the  ordinary way.  Once again,  there  are
     limits.   It  would not, for instance, be permissible  to
     shoot  at point blank range at a criminal who has  turned
     his  or  her  back  upon a police  officer  in  order  to
     abscond, when other methods of subduing and arresting the
     criminal  are possible.  We are not concerned  here  with
     the  validity of section 49(2) of the Criminal  Procedure
     Act,  and I specifically refrain from expressing any view
     thereon.  Greater restriction on the use of lethal  force
     may be one of the consequences of the establishment of  a
     constitutional state which respects every person's  right
     to  life.  Shooting at a fleeing criminal in the heat  of
     the  moment,  is not necessarily to be equated  with  the
     execution  of a captured criminal.  But, if  one  of  the
     consequences  of  this judgment might be  to  render  the
     provisions   of   section  49(2)  unconstitutional,   the
     legislature  will  have to modify the provisions  of  the
     section  in  order  to  bring  it  into  line  with   the
     Constitution.  In any event, the constitutionality of the
     death sentence for murder does not depend upon whether it
     is   permissible   for  life  to  be   taken   in   other
     circumstances  currently sanctioned by law.   It  depends
     upon  whether it is justifiable as a penalty in terms  of
     section  33  of  the  Constitution.   In  deciding   this
     question, the fact that the person sentenced to death  is
     denied  his  or  her  right to life is  of  the  greatest
     importance.

[141]      The  Attorney  General argued that  all  punishment
     involves  an impairment of dignity.  Imprisonment,  which
     is the alternative to the death sentence, severely limits
     a  prisoner's fundamental rights and freedoms.  There  is
     only  the barest freedom  of movement or of residence  in
     prison,  and  other  basic  rights  such  as  freedom  of
     expression   and   freedom  of  assembly   are   severely
     curtailed.

[142]      Dignity  is inevitably impaired by imprisonment  or
     any  other  punishment, and the undoubted  power  of  the
     state  to  impose  punishment as  part  of  the  criminal
     justice   system,  necessarily  involves  the  power   to
     encroach upon a prisoner's dignity.  But a prisoner  does
     not lose all his or her rights on entering prison.

          [Prisoners  retain]  those absolute  natural  rights
          relating  to  personality, to which   every  man  is
          entitled.   True  [their] freedom had  been  greatly
          impaired  by  the legal process of imprisonment  but
          they  were  entitled  to  demand  respect  for  what
          remained.   The  fact that their  liberty  had  been
          legally  curtailed  could afford  no  excuse  for  a
          further   legal  encroachment  upon  it.  [It   was]
          contended that the [prisoners] once in prison  could
          claim  only  such  rights as the Ordinance  and  the
          regulations  conferred.  But the  directly  opposite
          view  is surely the correct one.  They were entitled
          to  all  their personal rights and personal  dignity
          not  temporarily taken away by law,  or  necessarily
          inconsistent  with the circumstances in  which  they
          had been placed.168
         
          [143]      A prisoner is not stripped naked,  bound,
     gagged  and  chained to his or her cell.   The  right  of
     association with other prisoners, the right to  exercise,
     to   write   and  receive  letters  and  the  rights   of
     personality  referred  to  by  Innes  J  are   of   vital
     importance  to  prisoners  and  highly  valued  by   them
     precisely  because they are confined, have  only  limited
     contact with the outside world, and are subject to prison
     discipline.   Imprisonment is a  severe  punishment;  but
     prisoners retain all the rights to which every person  is
     entitled  under Chapter Three subject only to limitations
     imposed  by the prison regime that are justifiable  under
     section 33.169  Of these, none are more important than the
     section  11(2) right not to be subjected to  "torture  of
     any  kind...nor to cruel, inhuman or degrading  treatment
     or   punishment."    There  is   a   difference   between
     encroaching upon rights for the purpose of punishment and
     destroying  them altogether.  It is that difference  with
     which we are concerned in the present case.
         
               Conclusion
         
     [144]      The  rights to life and dignity are  the  most
     important  of  all human rights, and the  source  of  all
     other  personal rights in Chapter Three.   By  committing
     ourselves  to  a  society founded on the  recognition  of
     human  rights we are required to value these  two  rights
     above  all others.  And this must be demonstrated by  the
     State  in everything that it does, including the  way  it
     punishes criminals.  This is not achieved by objectifying
     murderers  and  putting them to  death  to  serve  as  an
     example  to  others in the expectation  that  they  might
     possibly be deterred thereby.

[145]      In the balancing process the principal factors that
     have to be weighed are on the one hand the destruction of
     life   and   dignity  that  is  a  consequence   of   the
     implementation  of the death sentence,  the  elements  of
     arbitrariness  and  the  possibility  of  error  in   the
     enforcement of capital punishment, and the existence of a
     severe alternative punishment (life imprisonment) and, on
     the other, the claim that the death sentence is a greater
     deterrent  to  murder, and will more effectively  prevent
     its   commission,   than  would  a   sentence   of   life
     imprisonment,  and  that there is  a  public  demand  for
     retributive  justice  to be imposed on  murderers,  which
     only the death sentence can meet.

[146]     Retribution cannot be accorded the same weight under
     our Constitution as the rights to life and dignity, which
     are  the  most  important of all the  rights  in  Chapter
     Three.   It  has  not been shown that the death  sentence
     would  be  materially more effective to deter or  prevent
     murder than the alternative sentence of life imprisonment
     would be.  Taking these factors into account, as well  as
     the  elements  of  arbitrariness and the  possibility  of
     error  in  enforcing  the death penalty,  the  clear  and
     convincing  case  that is required to justify  the  death
     sentence as a penalty for murder, has not been made  out.
     The  requirements of section 33(1) have  accordingly  not
     been  satisfied,  and it follows that the  provisions  of
     section  277(1)(a)  of the Criminal Procedure  Act,  1977
     must be held to be inconsistent with section 11(2) of the
     Constitution.  In the circumstances, it is not  necessary
     for  me  to  consider whether the section would  also  be
     inconsistent with sections 8, 9 or 10 of the Constitution
     if  they  had been dealt with separately and not  treated
     together as giving meaning to section 11(2).

     Section 241(8) of the Constitution

[147]     In the present case the trial had been completed but
     an appeal to the Appellate Division was pending, when the
     1993  Constitution came into force.  The validity of  the
     trial,  and  the  fact  that  the  death  sentences  were
     competent  sentences at the time they were  imposed,  are
     not  in  issue.   What is in issue before  the  Appellate
     Division is whether the death sentences can and should be
     confirmed.   It  has postponed its judgment  pending  the
     determination  of  the  issues referred  to  us  for  our
     decision.

[148]      It is not necessary to deal with the provisions  of
     section 241(8) in the present case.  The Attorney General
     correctly  conceded that if the death penalty for  murder
     is  unconstitutional, it would not be competent to  carry
     out  the  death sentences that have been imposed  on  the
     accused.   The prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading
     punishment  is applicable to all punishments  implemented
     after  the  27th April, and can be invoked to  prevent  a
     punishment  being carried out even if the punishment  was
     lawful when it was imposed.170

     The Order to be made

     [149]      I  have dealt in this judgment only  with  the
     provisions of section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure
     Act,  but  it  is  clear  that if  subsection  (1)(a)  is
     inconsistent with the Constitution, subsections (1)(c) to
     (1)(f)  must  also  be  unconstitutional,  so  too   must
     provisions  of  legislation  corresponding  to   sections
     277(1)(a),  (c), (d), (e) and (f) that are  in  force  in
     parts  of the national territory in terms of section  229
     of  the  Constitution.  Different considerations  arising
     from section 33(1) might possibly apply to subsection (b)
     which  makes  provision for the imposition of  the  death
     sentence for treason committed when the republic is in  a
     state  of war.  No argument was addressed to us  on  this
     issue, and I refrain from expressing any views thereon.

[150]      The proper sentence to be imposed on the accused is
     a  matter  for the Appellate Division and not for  us  to
     decide.   This, and other capital cases which  have  been
     postponed by the Appellate Division pending the  decision
     of  this  Court  on the constitutionality  of  the  death
     sentence,  can now be dealt with in accordance  with  the
     order made in this case.  Lest there be any doubt on this
     score,  one of the effects of our judgment is to prohibit
     the  State, or any of its organs, from executing  persons
     whose  appeals  against  sentences  of  death  have  been
     disposed  of.  Such persons will remain in custody  under
     the  sentences imposed on them until such sentences  have
     been set aside in accordance with law, and substituted by
     appropriate and lawful punishments.  This will form  part
     of the order made.

[151]     The following order is made:

1.   In  terms of section 98(5) of the Constitution, and  with
     effect  from  the date of this order, the  provisions  of
     paragraphs  (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of section  277(1)
     of  the  Criminal  Procedure Act, and  all  corresponding
     provisions  of  other  legislation  sanctioning   capital
     punishment which are in force in any part of the national
     territory  in  terms of section 229, are declared  to  be
     inconsistent  with the Constitution and, accordingly,  to
     be invalid.

     2.    In terms of section 98(7) of the Constitution,  and
     with effect from the date of this order:

     (a)  the  State  is  and all its organs are forbidden  to
          execute any person already sentenced to death  under
          any  of  the provisions thus declared to be invalid;
          and
                (b)   all such persons will remain in  custody
          under  the  sentences imposed on  them,  until  such
          sentences have been set aside in accordance with law
          and substituted by lawful punishments.

_______________________________
1  The  last execution in South Africa occurred on 14 November
1989.  See infra note 26.

2 This information was contained in the written argument filed
on  behalf  of  the  South  African  Government  and  was  not
disputed.

3  The  mental anguish suffered by convicted persons  awaiting
the  death sentence is well documented.  A prolonged delay  in
the  execution of a death sentence may in itself be cause  for
the  invalidation  of a sentence of death  that  was  lawfully
imposed.   In  India, Zimbabwe and Jamaica,  where  the  death
sentence is not unconstitutional, sentences of death have been
set  aside  on  these grounds.  The relevant  authorities  are
collected  and  discussed by Gubbay CJ in Catholic  Commission
for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe v Attorney-General, Zimbabwe
and  Others  1993 (4) SA 239 (ZSC), and by Lord  Griffiths  in
Pratt v Attorney-General for Jamaica [1993] 3 WLR 995 (JPC).

4  These  words  are  taken from the first  paragraph  of  the
provision on National Unity and Reconciliation with which  the
Constitution concludes. Section 232(4) provides that  for  the
purposes  of  interpreting the Constitution,  this   provision
shall   be  deemed  to  be  part  of  the  substance  of   the
Constitution,  and  shall not have a lesser  status  than  any
other provision of the Constitution.

33 This is apparent from the reports of the Technical Committee
on  Fundamental Rights and, in particular, the Fourth  to  the
Seventh  reports,  which  were brought  to  our  attention  by
counsel.  The reports show that the question whether the death
penalty  should be made an exception to the right to life  was
"up  for debate" in the Negotiating Council.  The Sixth Report
contained the following references to the right to life:

     Life: (1) Every person shall have the right to life.  (2)
     A  law  in  force  at the commencement of subsection  (1)
     relating  to capital punishment or abortion shall  remain
     in  force until repealed or amended by the [legislature].
     (3)  No sentence of death shall be carried out until  the
     [Constitutional Assembly] has pronounced finally  on  the
     abolition or retention of capital punishment.

     [Comment:   The  Council  still  has  to  decide  on  the
     inclusion of this right and if so whether its formulation
     should  admit  of  qualification of  the  type  suggested
     above. The unqualified inclusion of the right will result
     in  the  [Constitutional Court] having to decide  on  the
     validity  of  any law relating to capital  punishment  or
     abortion.]  Sixth Report, 15 July 1993 at 5.

In  the Seventh Report the right to life was formulated in the
terms   in  which  it  now  appears  in  section  9   of   the
Constitution.  The report contained the following comment:

     [Comment:  The Ad Hoc Committee appointed by the Planning
     Committee  recommends the unqualified inclusion  of  this
     right  in the Chapter. We support this proposal.] Seventh

34  Furman  v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 290 (1972)(Brennan,  J.,
concurring).

35 This has been the approach of certain of the justices of the
United States Supreme Court.  Thus, White, J., concurring, who
said  in Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 312, that "[T]he
imposition  and execution of the death penalty  are  obviously
cruel  in  the dictionary sense", was one of the justices  who
held   in  Gregg  v  Georgia,  infra  note  60,  that  capital
punishment was not per se cruel and unusual punishment  within
the  meaning  of  the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments  of  the
United  States Constitution.  Burger, CJ., dissenting,  refers
in  Furman's  case at 379, 380, and 382 to a punishment  being
cruel  "in  the constitutional sense".  See also, comments  by
Justice Stewart, concurring in Furman's case at 309, "...  the
death  sentences  now before us are the  product  of  a  legal
system  that brings them, I believe, within the very  core  of
the... guarantee against cruel and unusual punishments...it is
clear that these sentences are 'cruel' in the sense that  they
excessively  go  beyond,  not  in  degree  but  in  kind,  the
punishments  that  the  legislatures  have  determined  to  be
necessary  [citing  Weems  v.  United  States,  217  U.S.  349
(1910)]...death sentences [imposed arbitrarily] are cruel  and
unusual  in  the  same way that being struck by  lightning  is
cruel and unusual".

39  In the former Transkei, Bophuthatswana and Venda the death
sentence was a competent verdict for murder but the provisions
of  the  relevant statutes in Transkei and Bophuthatswana  are
not  identical  to  section 277.  For  the  purposes  of  this
judgment it is not necessary to analyse the differences, which
relate in the main to the procedure prescribed for appeals and
the  powers  of the court on appeal, procedures that  are  now
subject  to the provisions of section 241(1) and (1A)  of  the
Constitution, as amended by the Constitution of  the  Republic
of South Africa Third Amendment Act No. 13 of 1994.

Article  4(2) of the American Convention on Human  Rights  and
article  2 of the European Convention of Human Rights  contain
similar provisions.  Article 4 of the African Charter of Human
an People's Rights provides:

77 According to the statistics referred to in the amicus brief
of  the South African Police approximately 9 000 murder  cases
are brought to trial each year.  In the more than 40 000 cases
that have been heard since the amendment to section 277 of the
Criminal  Procedure Act, only 243 persons  were  sentenced  to
death,  and  of  these  sentences, only  143  were  ultimately
confirmed on appeal.  See also, Devenish, supra note 42, at  8
and 13.

78 In the amicus brief of Lawyers for Human Rights, Centre for
Applied Legal Studies and the Society for the Abolition of the
Death  Penalty  in  South Africa it is pointed  out  that  the
overwhelming majority of those sentenced to death are poor and
black.   There  is  an  enormous social  and  cultural  divide
between  those sentenced to death and the judges  before  whom
they  appear,  who are presently almost all white  and  middle
class.   This in itself gives rise to problems which even  the
most   meticulous  judge   cannot  avoid.   The  formal  trial
proceedings  are  recorded in English or Afrikaans,  languages
which  the judges understand and speak, but which many of  the
accused may not understand, or of which they may have only  an
imperfect  understanding.  The evidence of witnesses  and  the
discourse  between the judge and the accused often has  to  be
interpreted,   and  the  way  this  is  done  influences   the
proceedings.  The differences in the backgrounds  and  culture
of the judges and the accused also comes into the picture, and
is  particularly  relevant when the personal circumstances  of
the  accused have to be evaluated for the purposes of deciding
upon the sentence.  All this is the result of our history, and
with  the demise of apartheid this will change. Race and class
are,  however, factors that run deep in our society and cannot
simply be brushed aside as no longer being relevant.

79 I do not want to be understood as being critical of the pro
deo  counsel  who perform an invaluable service,  often  under
extremely  difficult conditions, and to whom  the  courts  are
much indebted.  But the unpalatable truth is that most capital
cases involve poor people who cannot afford and do not receive
as  good  a defence as those who have means.  In this process,
the  poor  and  the  ignorant  have  proven  to  be  the  most
vulnerable, and are the persons most likely to be sentenced to
death.

80 See the comments of Curlewis, J in [1991] SAJHR, Vol. 7, p.
229,  arguing that judges who do not impose the death sentence
when  they  should do so are not doing their  duty.   "Let  me
return  to  the  point  that troubles  the  authors:  'that  a
person's  life  may  depend upon who sits  in  judgment.'   Of
course  this  happens. I do not know why the  authors  are  so
hesitant  in saying so.  Their own reasoning, let alone  their
tables, proves this".  Id. at 230.

81 Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 257.

82 "While this court has the power to correct constitutional or
other  errors retroactively...it cannot, of course, raise  the
dead."  Suffolk District v. Watson and Others, 381 Mass.  648,
663 (1980)(Hennessy, CJ.)(plurality decision holding the death
penalty unconstitutionally cruel under the Massachusetts State
Constitution).   "Death, in its finality,  differs  more  from
life imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from one
of only a year or two.  Because of the qualitative difference,
there   is   a  corresponding  difference  in  the  need   for
reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate
punishment  in  a specific case".  Woodson v. North  Carolina,

84  Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 288-289 (Brennan, J.,
concurring).   Although in the United States  prolonged  delay
extending  even to more than ten years has not been  held,  in
itself,  a reason for setting aside a death sentence, Richmond
v.  Lewis,  948  F.2d 1473, 1491 (9th Cir.  1990)(rejecting  a
claim  that execution after sixteen years on death  row  would
constitute  curel and unusual punishment in violation  of  the
Eighth  and  Fourteenth Amendments), in other jurisdictions  a
different view is taken.

     It  is  part of the human condition that a condemned  man
     will take every opportunity to save his life through  use
     of  the  appellate procedure.  If the appellate procedure
     enables  the  prisoner to prolong the appellate  hearings
     over a period of years, the fault is to attributed to the
     appellate system that permits such delay and not  to  the
     prisoner who takes advantage of it.  Appellate procedures
     that  echo down the years are not compatible with capital
     punishment.   The  death row phenomenon must  not  become
     established as a part of our jurisprudence.

General  placed  reliance  in his  argument.   These  are  all
factors  relevant to the purpose of punishment and are present
both  in  capital  punishment,  and  in  the  alternative   of
imprisonment.  Whether they serve to make capital punishment a
more effective punishment than imprisonment is relevant to the
argument  on justification, and will be considered  when  that
argument is dealt with. For the moment it is sufficient to say
that  they  do  not  have  a bearing  on  the  nature  of  the
punishment, and need not be taken into account at  this  stage

110  "The cruel or unusual punishment clause of the California
Constitution,  like  other provisions of  the  Declaration  of
Rights, operates to restrain legislative and executive  action
and  to  protect  fundamental individual and  minority  rights
against  encroachment by the majority.  It is the function  of
the  court  to examine legislative acts in the light  of  such
constitutional  mandates to ensure that  the  promise  of  the
Declaration   of  Rights  is  a  reality  to  the   individual
(citations omitted)...Were it otherwise, the Legislature would
ever be the sole judge of the permissible means and extent  of
punishment and article I, section 6, of the Constitution would
be  superfluous."  People v. Anderson, supra note 62, at  888.
This   was also the approach of the President of the Hungarian
Constitutional  Court  in  his  concurring  opinion   on   the
constitutionality of capital punishment, where he  said:  "The
Constitutional Court is not bound either by the  will  of  the
majority or by public sentiments."  Supra note 55, at 12.  See
also,  Gregg  v.  Georgia, supra note  60,  at  880.   In  the
decisive  judgment of the Court, Justices Stewart, Powell  and
Stevens,  accepted that "...the Eighth Amendment demands  more
than   that   a   challenged  punishment  be   acceptable   to

of the Amendment." (citation omitted)

offenders.  Fine distinctions, designed to select a  very  few
from  the  many,  are inescapably capricious when  applied  to
murders  and murderers." Id. at 665.  "...[A]rbitrariness  and
discrimination...inevitably persist even under a statute which
meets  the demands of Furman." Id. at 670.  "...[T]he  supreme
punishment of death, inflicted as it is by chance and caprice,
may  not stand." Id. at 671. "The death sentence itself  is  a
declaration  that society deems the prisoner a  nullity,  less
than  human  and unworthy to live.  But that negation  of  his
personality carries through the entire period between sentence
and execution." Id. at 683 (Liacos, J., concurring).

119 E.g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 782 (1977)(imposition  of

for  a  nonlethal offence).  See also, Gregg v. Georgia, supra

death  is disproportionate in relation to the crime for  which
it is imposed."), and Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 273

121 This was the approach of Brennan, J., in Furman v. Georgia,
supra note 34, at 282 ("The test, then, will ordinarily  be  a
cumulative one:  If a punishment is unusually severe, if there
is  a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily,  if
it  is  substantially  rejected  by  contemporary  society  [a
determination  he  makes based on the infrequency  of  use  in
relation  to the number of offences for which such  punishment
may  apply],  and  if there is no reason to  believe  that  it
serves  any  penal  purpose more effectively  than  some  less
severe  punishment,  then  the continued  infliction  of  that
punishment violates the [clause prohibiting cruel and  unusual
punishment].").

130  A  proportionality test is applied to the  limitation  of

Constitutional Court and the European Court of  Human  Rights.
Although  the  approach of these Courts to proportionality  is
not  identical,  all  recognise  that  proportionality  is  an
essential  requirement  of  any legitimate  limitation  of  an
entrenched  right.  Proportionality is also  inherent  in  the
different  levels of scrutiny applied by United States  courts
to governmental action.

153 Since 1991, section 64 of the Correctional Service Act 8 of
1959 has provided that a person sentenced to life imprisonment
may   only   be   released  from  prison  in   the   following
circumstances:   (a)  the  advisory release  board  "with  due
regard  to  the  interest  of society",  recommends  that  the
prisoner  be  released  and (b) the Minister  of  Correctional
Services  accepts  that  recommendation  and  authorizes   the
release  of  the  prisoner.  This means that the  Minister  of
Correctional  Services  must  accept  responsibility  for  the
release  of  the prisoner, and can only do so if the  advisory
release board is in favour of the prisoner being released.

162 Grimm, supra note 138, at page 276 states, "operating at an
earlier  stage  than the essential content  limit  in  Article
19(2),  the proportionality principle has rendered the  former
almost insignificant."  Currie, supra note 139, notes that the
German  Federal Constitutional Court has remarked in at  least
one case that dealt with the 'essential content' question that
the Court "state[d] an alternative ground that, because of its
greater  stringency [the proportionality test],  has  made  it
unnecessary  in  most cases to inquire whether  a  restriction
invades  the  'essential content' of a basic right."   Currie,

166 Self-defence is treated in our law as a species of private
defence.   It  is  not  necessary for  the  purposes  of  this
judgement  to  examine the limits of private  defence.   Until

has   allowed  killing  in  defence  of  property,  or   other
legitimate  interest, in circumstances where it is  reasonable
and  necessary  to do so.  S v Van Wyk 1967 (1)  SA  488  (A).

order  is not a matter which arises for consideration  in  the
present  case.   What is material is that the  law  applies  a
proportionality test, weighing the interest protected  against
the  interest of the wrongdoer.  These interests must  now  be
weighed in the light of the Constitution.

167  "The  inherent right of the State to assume extraordinary
powers and to use all means at its disposal in order to defend
itself  when  its existence is at stake is recognized  by  our
common law as an exceptional and extreme constitutional tool."
Per  Selikowitz J in End Conscription Campaign v  Minister  of
Defence  1989  (2)  SA 180(C) at 199H.  Here  too  it  is  not
necessary  to examine the limits of this "inherent right",  or
the  limitations  (if any) imposed on it by the  Constitution.
All  that  need be said is that it is of an entirely different
character  than  the alleged "right" of the State  to  execute
murderers, and subject to different considerations.

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

CALIFORNIA FIRST AMENDMENT COALITION,
Plaintiff,

vs.

DANIEL E. LUNGREN,
Attorney General of the State of California, et al.,
Defendants.

No. C 95-0440-FMS

MEMORANDUM OF DECISION

Issue Presented

Do Cal. Penal Code Section 132.5 and Cal. Civil Code Section 1669.7
violate the free speech and free press guarantee of the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section
2(a) of the California Constitution?[FN1]

Introduction

On August 7, 1995, at the conclusion of oral argument in this matter,
the Court issued its ruling from the bench, finding Cal. Penal Code
Section 132.5 and Cal. Civil Code Section 1669.7 to be
unconstitutional on their face. At that time, the Court permanently
enjoined defendants, their agents, servants, employees and all others
acting in concert or participating with defendants from enforcing Cal.
Penal Code Section 132.5 and Civil Code Section 1669.7. This
Memorandum of Decision serves to set forth more fully the basis for
the Court's August 7, 1995 ruling.

In September of 1994, California Governor Pete Wilson signed two
legislative bills, which added section 132.5 to the Cal. Penal Code
and section 1669.7 to the Cal. Civil Code. This legislation prohibits
witnesses of crimes from selling their stories for a designated period
of time.

Plaintiff California First Amendment Coalition ("CFAC") is a
non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the rights to free
expression of California's journalists and citizens. CFAC's membership
consists of seven media professional associations and over two hundred
individual news organizations. On February 7, 1995, CFAC, on behalf of
its members, filed a complaint seeking a preliminary and permanent
injunction and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The complaint
names, inter alia, the California Attorney General and the District
Attorney of San Francisco County as defendants. On May 18, 1995, CFAC
filed this motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction on the
grounds that Sections 132.5 and 1669.7, on their face, violate the
free speech provisions of the United States and California
Constitutions. Plaintiff asks the Court to combine its request for a
preliminary and permanent injunction and enter judgment in its favor
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2). Defendants ("The State" or
"Defendants") ask the Court to deny plaintiff's motion for injunctive
relief, to dismiss the complaint, and to enter judgment in defendants'
favor.[FN2]

Background

In the wake of the enormous pre-trial publicity preceding the trial in
the O.J. Simpson case, California's legislature passed Cal. Penal Code
Section 132.5 ("Section 132.5") and Cal. Civil Code Section 1669.7
("Section 1669.7").[FN3] Section 132.5 makes it a crime for a person
to receive any payment or benefit for providing information about what
he or she knows or reasonably should know is a crime, or where that
person knows or reasonably should know that he or she may be called as
a witness in a criminal prosecution. Section 1669.7 renders contracts
in violation of Section 132.5 void and authorizes the Attorney General
or district attorney of the county in which a violation occurs to
bring a civil action to enjoin the enforcement of such contracts.

Section 132.5 was enacted to protect three interests: "the right of
every accused person to a fair trial, the right of the people to due
process of law, and the integrity of judicial proceedings" Cal. Penal
Code Section 132.5(a).[FN4] State Senator Quentin L. Kopp, one of the
legislation's sponsors, cited the following incident, which, in large
part, gave rise to sections 132.5 and 1669.7:

The obvious motivation for this urgent legislation is the recent O.J.
Simpson debacle, where both witnesses and potential jurors appear
tainted by the immense media publicity surrounding the case. For
example, a potentially critical prosecution witness, Jill Shively, who
received $5,000 from media tabloid "Hard Copy" and whose testimony
places the suspect near the scene of the crime at about the time of
the slayings, will not be called to testify because of lack of
credibility . . . .

State Sen. Quentin Kopp's Aug. 1, 1994 Memorandum to Members of the
Senate and Assembly, Declaration of Daniel

G. Stone in Support of Attorney's General's Opposition, Ex. A.

In addition, Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown, Jr,
author of the challenged legislation, offered his comments on why he
believes compensated speech impedes the opportunity for a fair trial:

First, it compounds the problem of pretrial publicity, since there are
clearly some people who would not talk to the press without payment.
Second, and more importantly, it intrudes upon the judicial process,
because it creates an incentive to lie. That kind of incentive can be
devastating in a trial. A witness who tells the truth, but admits to
being paid for his or her story, may lose credibility in the eyes of
the jury . . . . When such [juror and witness] participation is linked
to the receipt of large sums of cash, the very integrity of the
judicial process is at risk.

Senate Committee on Judiciary, Report on Assembly Bill 501,
Declaration of Richard S. Hoffman in Support of Plaintiff's Motion,
Ex. 1, p. 4.

In challenging the recent legislation, plaintiff has submitted
affidavits from various CFAC members detailing how the statutes have
or would have impacted their ability to communicate. For example, CFAC
offers the declaration of Dannie M. Martin, a former convict of Lompoc
penitentiary who wrote a series of prize-winning essays detailing
prison life. In one such article, "AIDS: The View From a Prison Cell"
(The Chronicle, Aug. 3, 1986) Martin described his first-hand
knowledge of homosexual sex and illicit drug use by an HIV positive
prisoner. Martin submits that the payments he received for such
articles, which often contained descriptions of penal code violations,
would have been illegal under Section 132.5, and if the statute had
been in effect at the time, it is "almost certain that many of [my] .
. . columns would not have been written." Declaration of Dannie M.
Martin in Support of Plaintiff's Motion, p. 4. CFAC has also submitted
declarations from other journalists, publishers and producers, in
which they explain how they routinely compensate their sources of
information by paying for a variety of expenses, including meals,
transportation and lodging. They also reveal how, in order to obtain
information from reluctant witnesses, they may offer their sources the
"benefit" of confidentiality. See e.a., Declarations of Todd J.
Merriman and Bruce Pottash. These declarants contend that they are
presently "chilled and intimidated" by the recent legislation from
offering any such "benefits" to individuals who may have witnessed a
crime.

In its motion, CFAC argues that the challenged statutes are
content-based regulations and fail the Supreme Court's strict scrutiny
test because they are not necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling state interest. CFAC also attacks the statutes on the
grounds that they are unconstitutionally vague. Defendants submit that
the statutes are content-neutral regulations but, even if they are
deemed to be content-based, they satisfy the strict scrutiny test.
Defendants also argue that because CFAC is "facially" challenging
these statutes, and not making an "as applied" challenge, the Court
must disregard plaintiff's "hypothetical" and "speculative"
applications of the statutes. Discussion

A. The Legal Standard

To grant a permanent injunction the Court must decide three issues: 1.
whether plaintiff has prevailed on the merits; 2. whether the balance
of the equities favors injunctive relief; and 3. what type of relief
is appropriate. LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1330 (9th Cir. 1985),
modified on other grounds, 796 F.2d 309 (9th Cir. 1986) A permanent
injunction should be issued where plaintiff has shown a "'likelihood
of substantial and immediate irreparable injury and the inadequacy of
remedies of law."' Id. at 1330 (citation omitted).

B. CFAC'S Facial Challenge Permits Court to Consider Statutes' Actual
Chilling Effect.

As a threshold matter, the Court must address defendants' contention
that because CFAC brings a facial challenge, the Court may not
consider plaintiff's hypothetical and speculative applications of the
statute. See Defendants' Opposition, p. 8 ("Court may not properly
consider, at this juncture, plaintiff's various 'What if'
arguments--such as 'What if some prosecutor were to charge a freelance
journalist under section 132.5? . . . 'What if it were applied to the
mere reimbursement of a witness's travel costs or telephone
charges"'). Plaintiff does not dispute that it mounts only a facial
challenge but argues that it is proper for the Court to consider
evidence regarding the impact the statutes have on CFAC members.

Defendants' argument is without merit. In United States v. National
Treasury Employees Union, ("NTEU") 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995), the Supreme
Court struck down a regulation banning all federal employees from
receiving fees for making speeches or writing articles. In doing so,
the Supreme Court relied on evidentiary submissions which detailed how
the statutes impacted members of the plaintiff class. See NTEU at 1010
("The record contains a number of affidavits describing respondents'
past activities that the honoraria ban would now prohibit."). As here,
while there were no enforcement proceedings pending or threatening in
NTEU, the evidence regarding the statute's impact was relevant to
demonstrate its chilling effect. See Secretary of State of Maryland v.
Joseph H. Munson Co., 104 S. Ct. 2839, 2847 (1984) (facial challenges
to overbroad statutes are allowed to prevent "the statute from
chilling the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the
court."). CFAC's challenge is not based on "imagined hypothetical
prosecutions" but on the actual effect this legislation is having on
its members' freedom of expression. [FN5] See also Simon & Schuster.
Inc. v. Members of the N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 112 S. Ct. 501,
511 (1991) (Court considered effect "Son of Sam" law would have had on
authors such as Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson, Henry Thoreau, and Martin
Luther King, Jr.).

C. The Statutes are Content-Based Regulations

Under the Supreme Court's ruling in Simon & Schuster 112 S. Ct. at 501
the statutes are content-based regulations. In that case, the Supreme
Court held that New York's "Son of Sam" law, which required that
income from a criminal's literary works describing his crime be
deposited in an escrow account for his victims, was a content-based
statute. "It singles out income derived from expressive activity for a
burden the State places on no other income, and it is directed only at
works with a specified content." Id. at 508. As in Simon & Schuster,
the statutes herein target only speech relating to crimes. See Section
132.5(b)&(c) (forbids compensated speech relating to "information
obtained as result of witnessing the event or occurrence or having
personal knowledge of the facts" that the witness "knows or reasonably
should know is a crime.").

Defendants argue that Sections 132.5 and 1669.7 are not content-based
because they only restrict compensation for speech, not the speech
itself. This argument was squarely rejected by the Simon & Schuster
Court: a "statute is presumptively inconsistent with the First
Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the
content of their speech." Id. at 508. See also NTEU at 1014
("[p]ublishers compensate authors because compensation provides a
significant incentive toward more expression. By denying respondents
that incentive, the honoraria ban induces them to curtail their
expression . . .").

The State also argues that the statutes are not content-based because
they were enacted not "to prevent speech, but only to preserve and
protect the criminal justice system." Opposition, at 9. Again, the
Supreme Court has addressed and rejected such an argument:

The Board next argues that discriminatory financial treatment is
suspect under the First Amendment only when the legislature intends to
suppress certain ideas. This assertion is incorrect; our cases have
consistently held that 'illicit legislative intent is not the sine qua
non of a violation of the First Amendment'. . proper governmental
concerns can restrict unduly the exercise of rights protected by the
First Amendment.

Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. at 509 (citations omitted).

Finally, defendants argue that the challenged statutes should be
construed as content-neutral time, place and manner regulations
because they are directed at the secondary effects of speech, not the
speech itself. See Renton v. Playtime Theatres. Inc., 106 S. Ct. 925
(1986), reh'g denied, 106 S. Ct. 1663 (1986) (ordinance prohibiting
adult theaters from locating within 1,000 feet of residential areas
held to be content-neutral.). The question of whether or not these
statutes are content-based raises an interesting question in lieu of
the Supreme Court's footnote in Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. at 511
("[b]ecause the Son of Sam law is so overinclusive, we need not
address the Board's contention that the statute is content neutral . .
. ."). Considering, however, the express holding of the Simon &
Schuster Court that "[t]he Son of Sam law is a . . . content-based
statute," this Court presumes that the Supreme Court meant what it
said. Moreover, as the Son of Sam law, the statutes herein are so
overinclusive that they would fail to meet any constitutional
standard, regardless of whether they were deemed content-neutral or
content-based.

In sum, because these statutes are directed at speech with a
particular content, they must pass muster under the Supreme Court's
strict scrutiny test.

D. Sections 132.5 and 1669.7 Are Not Necessary and Narrowly Tailored
to Serve a Compelling State Interest

When a statute imposes a financial disincentive to publish works with
a particular content, "'the State must show that its regulation is
necessary to serve a ,compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn
to achieve that end."' Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. at 509 (quoting
Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 107 S. Ct. 1722, 1728
(1987).

Two fundamental principles guide the inquiry here. First, these
statutes impose a prior restraint on speech, which is "the most
serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment
rights." Nebraska Press Asso. v. Stuart, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 2803 (1976).
Second, the speech targeted by Sections 132.5 and 1669.7 is at the
core of protected expression. As the Supreme Court made clear in Cox
Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 1045 (1975), "the
commission of crime, prosecutions resulting from it, and judicial
proceedings arising from the prosecutions . . . are without question
events of legitimate concern to the public and consequently fall
within the responsibility of the press to report the operations of
government." Keeping these two underlying principles in mind, the
Court turns to the strict scrutiny test.

1. The State's Interests

The State asserts three interests which are served by Sections 132.5
and 1669.7: "preserving the integrity of the criminal justice process,
protecting the fundamental right of citizens to a fair trial, and
ensuring the right to adduce credible evidence through the testimony
of witnesses." Opposition, pp. 11-12. The Court addresses each in
turn.

a. Integrity of the judicial process

Insofar as this interest is focused on possible erosion of public
confidence in the courts, the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that
a state's interest in maintaining "the institutional integrity of its
courts," is not sufficiently compelling to justify wholesale burdens
on speech. See Landmark Communications Inc. v. Virginia, 98 S. Ct.
1535, 1543 (1978) (state's interest in maintaining the "institutional
reputation of the courts" insufficient to justify punishment of
speech); Bridges v. California, 62 S. Ct. 190 (1941) (statute
restricting speech to preserve fair and orderly administration of
justice struck down); and Wood v. Georgia, 82 S. Ct. 1364 (1962)
(statute restricting speech to preserve fair administration of justice
struck down). The State cites only one case, Cox v. Louisiana, 85 S.
Ct. 476 (1965), reh'g denied, 85 S. Ct. 879 (1965), for its assertion
that a compelling state interest exists in insuring the appearance of
impartiality in its criminal justice system. The statute at issue in
Cox, however, was aimed primarily at conduct, namely picketing, and
was found to be a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation;
therefore, the State did not need to offer a compelling state
interest.

Because the State's asserted interest in preserving the integrity of
the judicial process has been deemed not sufficiently compelling, the
Court need not decide whether the statutes are narrowly tailored to
serve this interest. See Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. at 511.

b. Insuring a Fair Trial

CFAC does not dispute that the State has a compelling interest in
insuring the fairness of criminal trials. See Plaintiff's Memorandum,
p 18; U.S. Const. amend VI; and Cal. Const. Art. 1, Section 15.[FN6]

c. Maintain Credibility of Witnesses

In its opposition, the State claims that the statutes are designed in
part "to adduce credible evidence through the testimony of witnesses."
The Court has difficulty appreciating how this interest differs from
the State's ultimate interest in insuring a fair trial and analyzes it
as one element of the State's core interest in guaranteeing a fair
trial.

2. The Statutes are Not Necessary to Advance the State's Interest in
Insuring a Fair Trial

The State claims that Sections 132.5 and 1669.7 are necessary to
promote a fair trial because compensated witnesses are more likely to
exaggerate or lie, their testimony will appear tainted in the eyes of
the jury, and they can be easily discredited during trial.

a. Alternative, Less Restrictive Means Already Exist To Sufficiently
Promote State's Interest

The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down speech restrictive laws
when existing state law sufficiently provided a means of achieving the
State's compelling interest. In Meyer v. Grant, 108 S. Ct 1886 (1988),
the Court struck down a statute which banned payments to circulators
of initiative petitions, finding that the State had failed to
demonstrate that such a ban was necessary to promote its interest in
protecting the integrity of the initiative process. Colorado had
argued that compensation might tempt a circulator from disregarding
his duty to verify the authenticity of signatures on the petition. The
Court rejected this argument because the State had provided "[n]o
evidence to support that speculation" and Colorado already had several
provisions in place to "deal expressly with the potential danger that
circulators might be tempted to pad their petitions with false
signatures . . risk of improper conduct . . . ." Id. at 1894-95. See
also Riley v. National Federation of the Blind of North Carolina, 108
S. Ct. 2667, 2676 (1988) (in holding unconstitutional statute which
limited professional fundraisers' fees, Court found sufficient
mechanisms existed to combat fraud); and Butterworth v. Smith, 110 S.
Ct. 1376, 1382 (1990) (in striking down statute which prohibited
witnesses from ever disclosing testimony given before grand jury,
Court found State's interest in preventing subornation of witnesses
adequately served by criminal penalties for perjury and tampering with
witnesses.).

As in Meyer, Riley and Butterworth, California has sufficient
non-speech restrictive safeguards in place to serve its interest. Well
before the enactment of Sections 132.5 and 1669.7, California's
criminal courts employed a myriad of non-speech restrictive mechanisms
to minimize and discourage witness fabrication. California's statute
books contain laws banning perjury (Cal. Penal Code Section 118),
subornation of perjury (Cal. Penal Code Section 127), and the bribing
of witnesses (Cal. Penal Code Section 138). In addition, the oath
procedure (Cal. Evid. Code Sections 165, 710), witness competency
requirements (Cal. Evid. Code Sections 700-704) and the prospect of
cross-examination (Cal. Evid. Code Section 761), promote truthful and
accurate testimony by witnesses in criminal cases. Similarly, the
State's concern that jurors will be unable to assess the credibility
of a compensated witness is safeguarded by Cal. Evid. Code Sections
761, 780, and 785, which allow for the cross-examination of all
witnesses in criminal cases. California's Evidence Code also permits
the introduction of evidence regarding bias and requires instructions
to the jury on how to evaluate a witness' credibility. See 1 CALJIC
Sections 2.13, 2.20-24 (jury instructions on how to evaluate
credibility of witnesses). California's courts have previously
recognized the effectiveness of such procedures. See Sun Co. v.
Superior Court of San Bernardino, 105 Cal. Rptr. 873, 884 (1973)
(striking down pre-trial ban on disclosure of witnesses' names in
interest of insuring a fair trial because "sufficient legal safeguards
presently exist to assure the defendant of a fair trial.").

Moreover, as in Meyer, the State's assertion that witness compensation
has a deleterious effect on witnesses in criminal cases is unsupported
by the record, save the one example of Jill Shively, a witness in the
o.J. Simpson case who was not called to testify after she had been
paid $5,000 by a tabloid .[FN7] See NTEU 115 S. Ct at 1017 ("[w]hen
the Government defends a regulation on speech as a means to redress
past harms or prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than simply
posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured . . . It must
demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural,
and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct
and material way.") (quotation omitted).

Defendants argue that the above-cited safeguards are inadequate to
serve the State's goal because, once a witness has been paid for his
story, the damage to his testimony/credibility has already been done.
According to the State, it is because a witness' credibility may be
attacked on the stand and "because juries may discredit and reject
evidence because of witnesses' perceived bias or perceived financial
interests in the testimony," that the legislation is necessary.
Opposition, p. 24 (emphasis in original). In making this argument,
however, the State modifies its asserted interest from that of
insuring a fair trial to one of avoiding the inconvenience of
addressing the issue of witness compensation. This latter interest is
hardly compelling. While it would undoubtedly be more convenient if
witnesses were not compensated for their speech prior to trial, "the
First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for
efficiency." Riley, 108 S. Ct. at 2676.

The State, citing Nebraska Press Asso. v. Stuart, 96 S. Ct. 2791
(1976) and Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 111 S. Ct. 2720 (1991) next
argues that these statutes should be deemed necessary because the
First Amendment rights of criminal trial participants may be
restricted to a greater degree to protect a defendant's Sixth
Amendment right to a fair trial. Ironically, the cases defendants cite
for this proposition, reject the blanket, categorical approach taken
by California's legislature. The Nebraska Press Court held that before
any prior restraint on the rights of trial participants could be
justified, the State must meet "the heavy burden of demonstrating, in
advance of trial, that without prior restraint a fair trial will be
denied." Id. at 2807-08. In Gentile, the ethical rules of the Nevada
State Bar prohibited lawyers from making extrajudicial statements
which have a "substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing" an
adjudicative proceeding. Recognizing that lawyers are subject to
special regulation by the bodies that license the practice of law,
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, held that an
attorney's speech could be so regulated. An unanimous Court, however,
found that a "substantial likelihood" of "material prejudice" must be
demonstrated before such a speech restriction could be justified. Id.
at 2745. Section 132.5 contains no such standard. California's
reliance on Nebraska Press and Gentile is therefore misplaced.

b. The Statutes Are Substantially Overbroad

As a means of insuring the fairness of a criminal trial, the
challenged statutes are significantly overinclusive. The legislation
restricts speech relating to "crimes" regardless of whether there will
ever be a trial or even an indictment in the matter. As CFAC points
out in its brief, the vast majority of crimes go unprosecuted and, of
those that are prosecuted, few are tried. See Memorandum, p. 21, fn 7.
Sections 132.3 and 1669.7, however, inexplicably restrict speech in
all such cases. The State's asserted interest in insuring a fair trial
cannot be implicated in cases where there will be no trial.

The statutes also bar receipt of all payments or benefits, no matter
how small. The witness who receives $50 for a meal and cab fare would
therefore be covered by the legislation. In their declarations, CFAC's
members have expressed a realistic concern that non-monetary
"benefits," such as insuring witness anonymity, would also be barred
by the statute. It is difficult to understand how such de minimus
benefits would have a deleterious effect on a witness' credibility at
trial.

The statutes also provide that a witness may not be paid for any
information relating to a crime. Thus, for example, information which
is undisputed, inadmissible, or immaterial and would therefore have no
bearing on a trial's fairness, would be regulated. Contrast Cal. Penal
Code Section 118 (California's perjury statute bars only willful
deceit when the misstatement is "material" to outcome of the
proceeding.)

As in Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. 501, "these two provisions combine
to encompass a potentially very large number of works." Id. at 511.
CFAC has submitted a list of acclaimed works which would have been
barred had these statutes been in effect at the time and place of
publication. For instance, books by Watergate participants John Dean
(Blind Ambition) and John Erlichman (Witness to Power) could not have
been published until the Watergate prosecutions had reached "final
judgment." Works by citizens engaged in civil disobedience would have
been illegal if they discussed the author's contemporaneous criminal
activities. See e.g., Martin Luther King Jr's Why We Can't Wait. See
also Affidavit of Lisa Drew, Vice President of Simon & Schuster
division (cites numerous works which would have been illegal). As
these examples illustrate, the challenged statutes reach an wide range
of works that have no bearing on the fairness of a criminal trial.

The State contends that the statutes are not as overbroad as the Son
of Sam law because, unlike New York's law, these regulations only
restrict speech for a limited period of time. See Section 132.5(f)
(restriction does not apply after one year has lapsed since criminal
act and, if prosecution commenced, until judgment entered). This time
limit does not save the statutes. In Bridges v. California, 62 S. Ct.
190, 196-7 (1941), the Supreme Court rejected the contention that a
restriction on press coverage was less onerous because it was limited
to the pendency of the trial:

It must be recognized that public interest is much more likely to be
kindled by a controversial event of the day than by a generalization,
however penetrating, of the historian or scientist. Since they punish
utterances made during the pendency of a case, the[y] produce their
restrictive results at the precise time when public interest in the
matters discussed would naturally be at its height . . . . This
unfocused threat [of sanctions] is, to be sure, limited in time,
terminating as it does upon final disposition of the case. But this
does not change its censorial quality. An endless series of moratoria
on public discussion, even if each were very short, could hardly be
dismissed as an insignificant abridgment of freedom of expression.

See also Nebraska Press, 96 S. Ct. at 2803 (rejecting argument that
because court order postponed but did not prohibit press coverage it
was lesser intrusion on speech) .[FN8]

In sum, because the State's asserted need for this legislation appears
to be based on no more than speculation and because sufficient
safeguards already exist to serve its interest, Sections 1669.7 and
132.5's blanket, prior bans on speech are not necessary to serve the
State's interest. Having found that the challenged legislation is
neither necessary nor narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state
interest, the Court must decide whether injunctive relief is
appropriate.

C. Injunctive Relief Is Warranted Here

The Supreme Court has stated that "[t]he loss of First Amendment
freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes
irreparable injury." Elrod v. Burns, 96 S. Ct. 2673, 2690 (1976). As
the declarations submitted by CFAC demonstrate, its members' ability
to exercise their First Amendment rights is impaired each day that
these statutes remain on the books. Because no remedy of law would be
adequate to protect plaintiff's First Amendment rights, a permanent
injunction is appropriate.

Conclusion

At oral argument, counsel for the State argued that the statutes could
be salvaged if the Court were to narrowly construe them. [FN9] Because
the statutes' defects are so many and so basic, however, the Court is
unable to construe the legislation narrowly without engaging in
"judicial legislation." This the Court declines to do. See NTEU 115 S.
Ct. at 1019 ("[o]ur obligation to avoid judicial legislation also
persuades us to reject the Government's second suggestion - that we
modify the remedy by crafting a nexus requirement for the honoraria
ban.").

For the above reasons, on August 7, 1995, the Court GRANTED plaintiff
CFAC's motion for a permanent injunction. Plaintiff shall submit an
accounting in support of its motion for costs and attorneys' fees by
September 4 1995. Defendants shall submit their opposition, if any, no
later than September 18, 1995. The Clerk of the Court shall close the
file.

SO ORDERED.

DATED: August 9 , 1995

/s/ FERN M. SMITH

United States District Judge



==========FOOTNOTES==========

[1] The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law
makes that prohibition applicable to the states. Article I, section
2(a) of the California Constitution provides that "[e]very person may
speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects .... A
law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press." "The
right to speak freely is more broadly construed under the state
Constitution than under the First Amendment." People v. Tisbert, 14
Cal. Rptr.2d 128, 130 (1992). Because the principles used in assessing
the constitutionality of a statute under the U.S. Constitution are
virtually identical to those used in analyzing a law under
California's Constitution, the Court analyzes the statutes under both
Constitutions simultaneously.


[2] 0n May 30, 1995, the San Francisco defendants, District Attorney
Arlo Smith, Sheriff Michael Hennessey, and Chief of Police Anthony
Ribera submitted their response to plaintiff's motion in which they
deferred to the Attorney General's defense of this action.


[3] Section 132.5 reads, in relevant part, as follows:

(b) A person who is a witness to an event or occurrence that he or she
knows, or reasonably should know, is a crime or who has personal
knowledge of facts that he or she knows, or reasonably should know,
may require that person to be called as a witness in a criminal
prosecution shall not accept or receive, directly or indirectly, any
payment or benefit in consideration for providing information obtained
as result of witnessing the event or occurrence or having personal
knowledge of the facts.

(c) Any person who is a witness to an event or occurrence that he or
she reasonably should know is a crime shall not accept or receive,
directly or indirectly, any money or its equivalent in consideration
for providing information obtained as a result of his or her
witnessing the event or occurrence . . . .

(e) A violation of subdivision (b) is a misdemeanor punishable by
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months in a county jail, a
fine not exceeding three times the amount of compensation requested,
accepted, or received or contracted for by the person.

(f) This section does not apply if more than one year has elapsed from
the date of any criminal act related to the information that is
provided under subdivision (b) or (c) unless prosecution has commenced
for that criminal act. If prosecution has commenced, this section
shall remain applicable until the final judgment in the action.

(g) This section does not apply to any of the following circumstances:

(1) Lawful compensation paid to expert witnesses, investigators,
employees, or agents by a prosecutor, law enforcement agency, or an
attorney employed to represent a person in a criminal matter.

(2) Lawful compensation provided to an informant by a prosecutor or
law enforcement agency.

(3) Compensation paid to a publisher, editor, reporter, writer, or
other person connected with or employed by a newspaper, magazine, or
other publication or a television or radio news reporter or other
person connected with a television or radio station, for disclosing
information obtained in the ordinary course of business.

(4) Statutorily authorized rewards offered by governmental agencies
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of specified
offenders.

(h) For purposes of this section, "information" does not include a
photograph, videotape, audiotape, or any other direct recording of
events or occurrences.


[4] Section 132.5(a) contains the following legislative findings: (a)
The Legislature supports and affirms the constitutional right of every
person to communicate on any subject. This section is intended to
preserve the right of every accused person to a fair trial, the right
of the people to due process of law, and the integrity of judicial
proceedings. This section is not intended to prevent any person from
disseminating any information or opinion. The Legislature hereby finds
and declares that the disclosure for valuable consideration of
information relating to crimes by prospective witnesses can cause the
loss of credible evidence in criminal trials and threatens to erode
the reliability of verdicts. The Legislature further finds and
declares that the disclosure for valuable consideration of information
relating to crimes by prospective witnesses creates an appearance of
injustice that is destructive of public confidence.


[5] Defendants rely primarily on Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 40 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 402 (Cal.1995) to argue that the Court should reject CFAC's
proffered evidence. The challenged statute in Tobe, however, did not
implicate the First Amendment and any concerns regarding the chilling
effect on protected expression were not at issue. See Tobe, 40 Cal.
Rptr.2d at 417, fn. 15. Defendants themselves concede that "[w]ith
respect to a claim that the state laws are facially overbroad and/or
vague, and therefore sweep in a substantial amount of protected First
Amendment conduct, a plaintiff is given somewhat more leeway to rely
on hypothetical applications of the statute to third persons."
opposition, p. 9, fn. 9 (emphasis in original). As discussed above,
this case involves just such a facial attack.


[6] The State attempts to distinguish this case from the Supreme
Court's holding in Simon & Schuster by arguing that the State's
interest is more compelling because it implicates a constitutional
concern (the Sixth Amendment), while New York's interest did not
(providing restitution for crime victims). Even assuming arguendo that
the interest here is more compelling than the one in Simon & Schuster,
this does not alter the Court's analysis under the strict scrutiny
test, which, once a compelling interest is found, turns to whether the
means used are necessary to achieve that government interest. It is
the second part of that test, not the first, which the State fails to
satisfy.


[7] The Court further questions the State's alleged "need" for these
provisions when expert witnesses and paid government informants appear
regularly before juries. The Court does not understand how a jury can
adequately assess the paid witness' testimony when the witness is an
expert or a paid governmental informant but cannot do so when the
witness receives compensation from a news organization. While this
argument goes to the statutes' underinclusiveness, which the Court
does not address, it is raised here merely to demonstrate why the
State's claim that the statutes are necessary is problematic.


[8] Because the Court has found that these statutes are substantially
overbroad, it need not address CFAC's persuasive arguments that the
statutes are also underinclusive and vague.


[9] For example, counsel suggested that the Court could rule that the
laws do not apply to freelance journalists, to de minimus
compensation, to rewards by private third parties, to offers of
anonymity and confidentiality, or to defendants.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>Following is the text of First Lady Hillary Clinton's remarks to the United Nation's Fourth World Conference on Women delivered in Beijing on September 5, 1995.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Mrs. Mongella, distinguished delegates and guests:</P>

<P>I would like to thank the Secretary General of the United Nations for inviting me to be part of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women. This is truly a celebration -- a celebration of the contributions women make in every aspect of life: in the home, on the job, in their communities, as mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, learners, workers, citizens and leaders.</P>

<P>It is also a coming together, much the way women come together every day in every country. We come together in fields and in factories. In village markets and supermarkets. In living rooms and board rooms. Whether it is while playing with our children in the park, or washing clothes in a river, or taking a break at the office water cooler, we come together and talk about our aspirations and concerns. And time and again, our talk turns to our children and our families.</P>

<P>However different we may be, there is far more that unites us than divides us. We share a common future. And we are here to find common ground so that we may help bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world -- and in so doing, bring new strength and stability to families as well.</P>

<P>By gathering in Beijing, we are focusing world attention on issues that matter most in the lives of women and their families: access to education, health care, jobs, and credit, the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and participate fully in the political life of their countries.</P>

<P>There are some who question the reason for this conference. Let them listen to the voices of women in their homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces.</P>

<P>There are some who wonder whether the lives of women and girls matter to economic and political progress around the globe... Let them look at the women gathered here and at Huairou...the homemakers, nurses, teachers, lawyers, policymakers, and women who run their own businesses.</P>

<P>It is conferences like this that compel governments and peoples everywhere to listen, look and face the world's most pressing problems.</P>

<P>Wasn't it after the women's conference in Nairobi ten years ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis of domestic violence? Earlier today, I participated in a World Health Organization forum, where government officials, NGOs, and individual citizens are working on ways to address the health problems of women and girls.</P>

<P>Tomorrow, I will attend a gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women. There, the discussion will focus on local -- and highly successful -- programs that give hard-working women access to credit so they can improve their own lives and the lives of their families.</P>

<P>What we are learning around the world is that, if women are healthy and educated, their families will flourish. If women are free from violence, their families will flourish. If women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society, their families will flourish. And when families flourish, communities and nations will flourish.</P>

<P>That is why every women, every man, every child, every family, and every nation on our planet has a stake in the discussion that takes place here.</P>

<P>Over the past 25 years, I have worked persistently on issues relating to women, children and families. Over the past two-and-a-half years, I have had the opportunity to learn more about the challenges facing women in my own country and around the world.</P>

<P>I have met new mothers in Jojakarta, Indonesia, who come together regularly in their village to discuss nutrition, family planning, and baby care.</P>

<P>I have met working parents in Denmark who talk about the comfort they feel in knowing that their children can be cared for in creative, safe, and nurturing after-school centers.</P>

<P>I have met women in South Africa who helped lead the struggle to end apartheid and are now helping build a new democracy.</P>

<P>I have met with the leading women of the Western Hemisphere who are working every day to promote literacy and better health care for the children of their countries.</P>

<P>I have met women in India and Bangladesh who are taking out small loans to buy milk cows, rickshaws, thread and other materials to create a livelihood for themselves and their families.</P>

<P>I have met doctors and nurses in Belarus and Ukraine who are trying to keep children alive in the aftermath of Chernobyl.</P>

<P>The great challenge of this conference is to give voice to women everywhere whose experiences go unnoticed, whose words go unheard.</P>

<P>Women comprise more than half the world's population. Women are 70 percent of the world's poor, and two-thirds of those who are not taught to read and write.</P>

<P>Women are the primary caretakers for most of the world's children and elderly. Yet much of the work we do is not valued -- not by economists, not by historians, not by popular culture, not by government leaders. At this very moment, as we sit here, women around the world are giving birth, raising children, cooking meals, washing clothes, cleaning houses, planting crops, working on assembly lines, running companies, and running countries.</P>

<P>Women also are dying from diseases that should have been prevented or treated; they are watching their children succumb to malnutrition caused by poverty and economic deprivation; they are being denied the right to go to school by their own fathers and brothers; they are being forced into prostitution, and they are being barred from the ballot box and the bank lending office. Those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the responsibility to speak for those who could not.</P>

<P>As an American, I want to speak up for women in my own country -- women who are raising children on the minimum wage, women who can't afford health care or child care, women whose lives are threatened by violence, including violence in their own homes. I want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools, safe neighborhoods, clean air and clean airwaves... for older women, some of them widows, who have raised their families and now find that their skills and life experiences are not valued in the workplace. . . for women who are working all night as nurses, hotel clerks, and fast food chefs so that they can be at home during the day with their kids . . . and for women everywhere who simply don't have time to do everything they are called upon to do each day.</P>

<P>Speaking to you today, I speak for them, just as each of us speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance to go to school, or see a doctor, or own property, or have a say about the direction of their lives, simply because they are women.</P>

<P>The truth is that most women around the world work both inside and outside the home, usually by necessity.</P>

<P>We need to understand that there is no formula for how women should lead their lives. That is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family. Every women deserves the chance to realize her God-given potential.</P>

<P>We also must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected.</P>

<P>Our goals for this conference, to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all governments -- here and around the world -- accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights.</P>

<P>The international community has long acknowledged -- and recently affirmed at Vienna -- that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear.</P>

<P>No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse or torture.</P>

<P>Tragically, women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated. Even in the late 20th century, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict. Women and children make up a large majority of the world's refugees. And when women are excluded from the political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse.</P>

<P>I believe that, on the eve of a new millennium, it is time to break our silence. It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights.</P>

<P>These abuses have continued because, for too long, the history of women has been a history of silence. Even today, there are those who are trying to silence our words.</P>

<P>The voices of this conference and of the women at Huairou must be heard loud and clear:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls.<BR>

	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution.<BR>

	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline, set on fire and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small.<BR>

	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war.<BR>

	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes.<BR>

	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation.<BR>

	<LI>It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families, and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will.<BR>

	<LI>If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, it is that human rights are women's rights . . . . And women's rights are human rights.<BR>

	<LI>Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely. And the right to be heard.<BR>
</UL>

<P>Women must enjoy the right to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure.</P>

<P>It is indefensible that many women in non-governmental organizations who wished to participate in this conference have not been able to attend -- or have been prohibited from fully taking part.</P>

<P>Let me be clear. Freedom means the right of people to assemble, organize, and debate openly. It means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their governments. It means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them, mistreating them, or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions.</P>

<P>In my country, we recently celebrated the 75th anniversary of women's suffrage. It took 150 years after the signing of our Declaration of Independence for women to win the right to vote. It took 72 years of organized struggle on the part of many courageous women and men.</P>

<P>It was one of America's most divisive philosophical wars. But it was also a bloodless war. Suffrage was achieved without a shot fired. We have also been reminded, in V-J Day observances last weekend, of the good that comes when men and women join together to combat the forces of tyranny and build a better world. We have seen peace prevail in most places for a half century. We have avoided another world war.</P>

<P>But we have not solved other, deeply-rooted problems that continue to diminish the potential of half the world's population.</P>

<P>Now it is time to act on behalf of women everywhere.</P>

<P>If we take bold steps to better the lives of women, we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and families too. Families rely on mothers and wives for emotional support and care; families rely on women for labor in the home; and increasingly, families rely on women for income needed to raise healthy children and care for their relatives.</P>

<P>As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace around the world -- as long as girls and women are valued less, fed less, fed last, overworked, underpaid, not schooled and subjected to violence in and out of their homes -- the potential of the human family to create a peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized.</P>

<P>Let this conference be our -- and the world's -- call to action.</P>

<P>And let us heed the call so that we can create a world in which every women is treated with respect and dignity, every boy and girl is loved and cared for equally, and every family has the hope of a strong and stable future.</P>

<P>Thank you very much.</P>

<P>God's blessings on you, your work and all who will benefit from it.</P>

affiliated with the Georgia House of Representatives.  Rep. Kaye also sometimes 
communicates online under the pseudonym "Publius." He sues on his own behalf and on 
behalf of those who use the web site. 

12.  Plaintiff KENNETH LEEBOW is President and owner of Professional Solutions, 
Inc., a Georgia corporation with its principal place of business in Marietta, Georgia.  He 
publishes a web site and online newsletter with over 13,000 subscribers under the 
pseudonym "Norman, or "Norman, The Ultimate Business Surfer." He sues on his own 
behalf and on behalf of those who use the newsletter and web site. 



13.  Plaintiff BRUCE MIRKEN is a resident of San Francisco, California.  He is a 
journalist who writes frequently about gay issues, and frequently obtains information for 
his articles from communications and interviews with persons online who use 
pseudonyms to protect their privacy.  He sues on his own behalf and on behalf of his 
anonymous sources. 


14.  Plaintiff BONNIE NADRI is a resident of DeKalb County, Georgia.  She publishes 
two web sites on the Internet, and participates in online communications on local 
computer Bulletin Board Systems using a pseudonym or "handle" to protect her privacy.  
She sues on her own behalf and on behalf of those who access her web pages. 

15.  Plaintiff JOSH RILEY is a resident of Canton, Georgia. He publishes several web 
sites on the Internet, including one that provides a forum for web publication by churches 
and ministries in the Atlanta area and a second that publishes a variety of historical 
information relating to the Negro Baseball Leagues.  In addition, he uses screen names 
(i.e., pseudonyms) to protect his privacy while communicating on America Online and on 
Prodigy.  He sues on his own behalf and on behalf of those who use his web sites. 

16.  Plaintiff JOHN TROYER is a resident of San Francisco, California.  He maintains a 
web site known as the Safer Sex Page and moderates an online discussion group known 
as the Safer Sex Forum.  He sues on his own behalf and on behalf of those who use the 
web site and online forum. 

17.  Plaintiff JONATHAN WALLACE is a resident of New York City, New York.  He 
uses a pseudonym, Jonathan Blumen, to communicate and exchange information on the 
Internet, and to publish a newsletter on the World Wide Web called "The Ethical 

Spectacle," which expresses controversial political and ethical views and sometimes 
publishes anonymous works.  He sues on his own behalf and on behalf of those who use 
his web site. 

18.  Defendant Zell Miller is sued in his official capacity as Governor of the State of 
Georgia.  He is charged under the Georgia Constitution and by statute with supervision of 
the execution of the laws of the State. 

19.  Defendant Michael Bowers is sued in his official capacity as Attorney General of the 
State of Georgia.  He is charged under the Georgia Constitution and by statute with 
enforcement of the criminal laws of the State when required by the Governor. 

FACTS

ENACTMENT OF ACT 1029

20.  The Act was passed by the Georgia General Assembly and signed into law by the 
Governor in April 1996.  It became effective July 1, 1996.  

21.  Section 1 of the Act amends the Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act, Article 
6, Chapter 9, Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.  16-9-90 to 16-9-94), by 
adding new Code section O.C.G.A.  16-9-93.1, which provides as follows: 

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person, any organization, or any representative of any 
organization knowingly to transmit any data through a computer network or over the 
transmission facilities or through the network facilities of a local telephone network for 
the purpose of setting up, maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with an electronic 
mailbox, home page, or any other electronic information storage bank or point of access 
to electronic information if such data uses any individual name, trade  name, registered 
trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol to falsely identify the 
person, organization, or representative transmitting such data or which would falsely state 
or imply that such person, organization, or representative has permission or is legally 
authorized to use such trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or 
copyrighted symbol for such purpose when such permission or authorization has not been 
obtained; provided, however, that no telecommunications company or Internet access 
provider shall violate this Code section solely as a result of carrying or transmitting such 
data for its customers. 


(b) Any person violating subsection (a) of this Code section shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor. 

22.  In addition, Section 2 of the Act, which was not codified into the Official Code, 
provides that 

Nothing contained [in the Act] shall prohibit a member of the General Assembly from 
using the state seal or the Georgia flag which contains the state seal on a home page that 
is clearly identified with the name of the member as the home page of that member. 

23.  O.C.G.A. 16-9-94(4) authorizes venue for the offense created by the Act, inter alia, 
"[i]n any county from which, to which, or through which any use of a computer or 
computer network was made, whether by wires, electromagnetic waves, microwaves, or 
any other means of communication." 

24.  Before passing the Act, the General Assembly made no findings as to the effect of 
the Act on the free flow of information over computer networks, or on the availability of 
alternative, less restrictive means of accomplishing the goals of the Act. 

THE NATURE OF THE COMPUTER NETWORKS

AFFECTED BY THE ACT


25.  The definition of "computer networks" applicable to the Act is set forth in O.C.G.A.  
16-9-92(2) and includes any set of remotely connected computers over which 
communications can take place.  At a minimum, the content of communications over all 
of the following types of computer networks are affected by the Act. 

The Global Internet

26.  The largest computer network affected by the Act is the Internet, which is the largest 
online network in the world.  It links a large number of smaller networks set up by 
universities, industry, nonprofit organizations, governments, and individuals. While 
estimates can only be approximations due to rapid growth, the Internet is believed to 
connect at least 59,000 computer networks, 2.2 million computers, 159 countries, and 40 
million users.  By some estimates, there will be as many as 200 million Internet users by 
the year 1999. 

27.  No one owns the Internet.  It is a decentralized global medium of communication and 
expression in which governments, universities, institutions, corporations, and millions of 
ordinary people can communicate with each other, express opinions, share ideas, educate 
themselves, and seek, exchange or publish information on every imaginable topic either 
to specific recipients or to the entire world almost instantaneously and at minimal cost. 

28.  Virtually anyone can now use the Internet to communicate with other online users.  
Anyone with a personal computer, modem, and telephone line can obtain access to the 
Internet through an Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), usually for a fee.  Many businesses, 
universities, and other institutions have computer networks that are directly connected to 
the Internet, and give their employees, faculty, students, etc., free or low-cost Internet 
access accounts.  For those without a computer or access through work or school, many 
communities have established "free-nets" or community networks to provide their 
citizens with a local link to the Internet.  Many public libraries offer similar access.  
There are also a growing number of "cyberspace cafes," coffee shops where customers, 
for a small hourly fee, can use computers provided by the shop to access the Internet. 

29.  The Internet is designed to reroute communications rapidly through the network if 
one or more individual links in the network are unavailable.  This means that any data 
sent over the Internet can travel any number of different paths to get from its origin to its 
destination.  Persons transmitting information over this international computer network 
have no control over the route their messages take.  Any data transmitted over the Internet 
could potentially travel through the wires or airspace of Georgia.  

30.  There are hundreds of thousands of Internet users in the State of Georgia, all of 
whom can communicate with or receive information from any other user on the network 
anywhere in the world. 

Commercial Online Services

31.  In addition to the global Internet, communications over the large national computer 
networks known as "commercial online services," including Prodigy, America Online and 
CompuServe, are also restricted by the Act.  

32.    These services enable their customers to communicate with other customers, access 
the Internet, and access other proprietary information and services available only to 
subscribers.  There are more than twelve million subscribers to major commercial online 
services in the United States and overseas; each of these services have customers in 
Georgia, who use the services to communicate with others throughout the United States 
(and in some cases, the world). 


Local Bulletin Board Services ("BBSs")

33.  The Act also restricts expression on thousands of local dial-in computer services 
known as Bulletin Board Systems, or "BBSs."  With a relatively small investment, 
anyone with a phone line, computer, modem, and proper software, can establish a BBS to 
allow friends, neighbors, customers, or members of the general public to dial in and 
communicate with each other on topics of common interest. There are several hundred 
such BBSs in Georgia, operated by individuals, nonprofit organizations, advocacy 
groups, and as businesses.  In addition, there are thousands of additional local BBSs in 
other states, which can be reached from Georgia over long distance telephone lines or 
through a network of BBS systems known as FIDONET, which allows BBS subscribers 
to communicate with subscribers to other BBSs in Georgia and throughout the country.  

THE NATURE OF COMMUNICATION OVER COMPUTER NETWORKS 
AFFECTED BY THE ACT


34.  Computer users communicate with each other over the computer networks described 
above in many different ways.  The content of all of the following types of 
communications are restricted by the broad language of the Act. 

E-Mail

35.  E-mail is the basic method of communication over computer networks.  It allows one 
user to send a message to any other user or users on the network. 

36.  Because mass mailings via e-mail are relatively easy and inexpensive, e-mail enables 
any user to publish and distribute information on any topic simply by compiling a mailing 
list of online users and sending the newsletter to everyone.  For example, plaintiff Ken 
Leebow distributes a weekly Internet newsletter under the pen name "Norman" to more 
than 13,000 subscribers around the world. 

Discussion & Chat Groups

37.  One of the most popular forms of communication over computer networks are 
"discussion groups."  Discussion groups allow users of computer networks to post 
messages onto a public computerized bulletin board or to an automated electronic mailing 
list of subscribers, and to read and respond to messages posted by others participating in 
the discussion group.  Discussion groups have been organized on many different 
computer networks and on virtually every topic imaginable.  Discussion groups can be 
formed by individuals, institutions or organizations, or by particular computer networks. 

38.  "USENET" newsgroups are a very popular set of bulletin board discussion groups 
available on the Internet and other networks.  There are currently USENET newsgroups 
on more than 15,000 different subjects, and over 100,000 new messages are posted to 
these groups each day.  In addition, there are many thousands more Internet discussion 
groups organized through automated mailing lists to subscribers.  There are still 
thousands more organized on the various commercial online services and on local BBSs.  
All or virtually all of these discussion groups are accessible by computer users in 
Georgia.  

39.  Similar to discussion groups are "chat groups," which allow users to engage in 
simultaneous conversations with each other by typing messages and reading the messages 
typed by others participating in the "chat."  Chat groups occur over the Internet, 
commercial online services, and local BBSs.  These groups are often set up by particular 
organizations or online services, but any individual user can form an online "chat." Some 
chat groups are organized for social entertainment, and others are organized by a 
particular sponsor on a particular topics to provide a specific forum for discussion of 
issues or ideas. 

40.  Online discussion and chat groups create an entirely new public forum -- analogous 
to the village green -- in which individuals can associate and communicate with others 
who have common interests, and engage in discussion or debate on every imaginable 
topic. 

Publication and Access to Information: The World Wide Web 

41.  A third major category of communication on computer networks involves the 
publication and retrieval of information. Computer networks, and especially the Internet, 
give individuals of ordinary means a remarkable new power to publish ideas, opinions, 
poetry, stories, images, video, and sound to the world. This information can then be 
retrieved by anyone in the world who has access to the network. 

42.  The "World Wide Web" (Web) is the most popular way to publish and retrieve 
information on the Internet.  Anyone with access to the Internet and proper software can 
publish "web pages," which may contain text, images, sound and even video. The Web is 
comprised of millions of separate "web sites" that provide content provided by a 
particular person or organization, and each web site may include one or more different 
web pages published by the author of the site.  Any Internet user anywhere in the world 
can view the web pages published by others, read their text, look at their images and 
video, and listen to their sounds. 

43.  The Web was created to serve as the platform for a global, online store of knowledge, 
containing information from a diversity of sources, and accessible to Internet users 
around the world.  Though information on the Web is contained in individual computers, 
the fact that each of these computers is connected to the Internet through Web protocols 
allows all of the information to become part of a single body of knowledge.  It is 
currently the most advanced information system on the Internet. 

The Importance of Links on the World Wide Web: 

44.  The Web also provide web authors with the unique ability to "link" different web 
pages on the Internet together. These "links" can be text or images in a web page that, 
when selected by the reader, automatically transfer the reader to a different location on 
the Internet.  For example, a particular link might transport the reader to a different part 
of the same web page or to an entirely different web page stored in an entirely different 
computer anywhere in the world. 

45.  The author of any web page can create a "link" that points to any other web page 
published on the Internet, without having to contact the creator of the document.  Many 
of the plaintiffs publish such links in their web pages.  Plaintiffs Ken Leebow and Bonnie 
Nadri, for example, provide hundreds of different links to other web pages on the Internet 
that they find to be helpful or of interest.  Plaintiff Mitchell Kaye provides extensive links 
to politics-related and similar web sites. Plaintiff Josh Riley provides links to religious 
web sites, baseball-related sites, and sites with local information that will assist new 
residents moving to the Atlanta area.  Plaintiffs ACLU of Georgia, EFF, and EFGA all 
provide extensive links to web sites with information on online privacy, civil liberties, 
online access, and similar issues. 

46.  Many pages on the Web are published by corporations or organizations that operate 
under trade names.  Links to those web pages are routinely identified by the trade name 
of the organization or some other logo or trademark that readily identifies the company or 
organization to whose web page the link is directed.  For example, plaintiff EFGA 
includes in its web page a news advisory and commentary relating to a recent tariff 
increase for ISDN data telecommunications lines proposed by BellSouth.  EFGA's news 
advisory encourages readers to express their views to BellSouth regarding the proposed 
increase, and reproduces a copy of the BellSouth logo which, when clicked by the user, 
will transport the user to BellSouth's own web page for providing customer feedback to 
the company via e-mail. 

47.  "Search engines" and "directories" on the Web are services that collect and organize 
millions of different links to web pages.  "Search engines," such as Yahoo, Alta Vista, 
and Webcrawler, allow users to search the entire World Wide Web for particular words or 
phrases.  The search engine then provides a list of web pages that contain the search term, 
and allows the user to "link" to the web page of their choice.  "Directories" are large 
databases of web sites arranged according to subject matter, similar to an online card 
catalog.  Directories provide "links" to relevant web sites on particular subjects. 

48.  Without these search engines and directories, it would be much more difficult for 
Internet users to locate and retrieve information of interest on the Web.  Thus, these 
search engines and directories provide an essential service to all Internet users.  They 
routinely provide many "links" to web pages using the trade names or logos of the 
companies or organizations to whom they are linking. 

49.  The critical linking feature is the defining characteristic of the Web.  The Web is 
comprised of all web pages in the world, stored in millions of different computers around 
the globe.  The Web is the interlocking system of links created by individual users in each 
individual page.  Linking is encouraged on the Web, because it ties different web pages 
on related topics together into a coherent system, even though the individual web pages 
themselves might be stored in different computers in different parts of the world. 

50.  "Cyberspace" refers to the combination of all of the online communications systems 
described above.  Because all of the communications described above occur over 
"computer networks," they are all subject to the Act. 

WHY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY IN CYBERSPACE 

51.  For many of the same reasons that people have historically communicated 
anonymously through other media like print and the telephone, online users frequently 
communicate anonymously or pseudonymously in cyberspace.  

52.  Anonymity allows online users to voice unpopular ideas without fear of retaliation.  
Citizens can engage in political speech without identifying themselves to the party in 
power. Victims of crime or disease can request help and advice without stigma. 

53.  Anonymity also eliminates the potential for discrimination and harassment according 
to factors like gender and ethnicity.  Many women communicate online under gender- 
neutral pseudonyms to avoid harassing e-mail.  This practice is similar to women who list 
their phone number under their first initial in order to avoid harassing calls.  Similarly, 
online users may wish to use pseudonyms in order to avoid discrimination or harassment 
based on names associated with particular ethnic groups. 

54.  Anonymity also helps online users maintain their privacy.  People communicating 
about unpopular or sensitive issues might suffer unwanted invasions of privacy, both 
online and offline, if others had access to their real identity. Anonymity also allows 
famous people to communicate online as "average people," without fear of a privacy 
invasion. 

55.  In some cases, anonymity is a necessary security measure.  The personal safety of 
human rights dissidents, domestic abuse victims, and whistle-blowers would be 
compromised if they could not communicate anonymously. 

56.  Anonymity also assists users in preventing the collection and potential misuse by 
third parties of personal information about them.  Online communications can be easily 
tracked, downloaded and stored by anyone; anonymity can prevent unauthorized third 
parties from tying that information to a particular person. 

57.  In addition to the advantages of speaking anonymously in cyberspace, online users 
have many reasons for wanting to access online information anonymously.  Many users 
would be inhibited from accessing controversial, embarrassing, or sensitive information if 
they first had to reveal their identity. Political information, safe sex information, and 
information on stigmatizing diseases are just a few examples of content that some users 
might wish to access anonymously.  In addition, because most web sites collect 
information about visitors, many online users fear that using their real identity would 
threaten their privacy whenever they access the Web. 

HOW INDIVIDUALS COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY IN CYBERSPACE 

58.  As a general rule, communications over computer networks typically include 
identifying information, such as the sender s return address and message routing 
information.  This default identification of the speaker differentiates online 
communication from communication by print and telephone. 


59.  Online technology, however, provides users with a variety of ways to communicate 
over computer networks without revealing their identity. 

Online Communications Using Pseudonyms or "Screen Names" 

60.  Many Internet Service Providers, commercial online services, and local BBSs, allow 
users to set up pseudonymous accounts, permitting the user to communicate online using 
a "screen name," "user name," or "handle" that is a pen name rather than the real name of 
the account holder.  When a user sends e- mail, publishes newsletters, or participates in 
discussions or chat groups using this screen name, the message sent is identified as 
coming from the screen name adopted by the sender. 

61.  Many service providers allow their users to set up multiple "screen names" or "user 
names."  This feature allows users to use different names for different purposes.  For 
example, a user might use her real name as a "screen name" when communicating by e-
mail with someone they know personally, but use a pen name as a "screen name" when 
communicating with strangers. 

62.  Pseudonymous accounts allow users to have a consistent identity in cyberspace 
without having to reveal their true identity to the people with whom they are 
communicating.  

Anonymous Internet Access Accounts:

63.  The use of "screen names" alone, however, does not provide complete anonymity to 
the user, because the user's service provider knows the true identity of the subscriber.  To 
provide additional privacy, some Internet Service Providers and local BBS operators offer 
anonymous accounts.  That is, they do not require any identification in order to set up an 
account for communicating over the network.  These accounts provide additional privacy 
and security to the user because even the service provider has no way to identify the true 
identity of the user. 

Anonymous and Pseudonymous Remailers:

64.  In addition to the use of screen names or anonymous access accounts, there are 
special services that allow online users who normally communicate online under their 
real name to send particular messages anonymously or pseudonymously over the Internet.  
These services are known as pseudonymous and anonymous remailers, and are software 
programs that run on computers connected to the Internet.  When an online user sends e-
mail to the remailer address, the remailer strips the identifying information from the 
message and then forwards the mail to its destination.  The recipient receives mail that 
has no evidence indicating its point of origin.  Remailers can be used to send individual e-
mail, and to post messages to mailing lists or USENET newsgroups. 

65.  "Pseudonymous remailers" are remailers that set up accounts for repeated use.  The 
operator of a pseudonymous remailer knows the account holder s real e-mail address, but 
provides the account holder with a secret numeric identifier that is used whenever the 
account holder sends a message through the remailer.  Other anonymous users, each with 
their own secret numeric identifier, can then reply to the anonymous message. This 
allows users to create a double-blind situation where two or more users can have an 
ongoing exchange without ever knowing the identity of the other users.  Plaintiff 
Community ConneXion maintains a popular pseudonymous remailer known as the 
"alpha.c2.org" remailer, which any Internet user can use free of charge. 

66.  In contrast, anonymous remailers are primarily for one-time usage, do not provide a 
means to reply to the sender through a secret identifier, and thus provide additional 
anonymity and privacy.  Any Internet user can use an anonymous remailer simply by 
sending a particular e-mail message to the remailer, which will forward the message 
anonymously to its final destination. 

67.  Currently, there are over twenty public remailers that any online user may use free of 
charge.  Plaintiff Community ConneXion provides a service that allows users to use the 
World Wide Web to send messages through a series of anonymous remailers available on 
the Internet.  Plaintiff EFF provides links to some of these remailers from its web site on 
the Internet, and plaintiff EFGA has current plans to establish its own anonymous 
remailer at its Internet domain in Georgia. 

68.  To prevent abuse of such remailers, there are programs available to the public, 
known as "kill files" and "bozo filters," that provide online users with the means to screen 
out anonymous messages if they desire.  These programs reduce the likelihood of harm 
from misuse of anonymous remailers. 

Online Publishing Under Pseudonyms or Anonymously 

69.  Many publishers using the World Wide Web and online mailing lists choose to 
publish under pen names.  For example, plaintiffs Jonathan Wallace and Ken Leebow 
both publish Internet web pages and newsletters using such pen names.  Similarly, 
plaintiff Mitchell Kaye occasionally uses the pseudonym "Publius" in connection with a 
web page that he publishes providing information on the activities of the Georgia House 
of Representatives. 


70.  For additional anonymity, as in the case of e-mail accounts discussed above, some 
Internet Service Providers also allow persons and organizations to set up and maintain 
web pages anonymously.  For example, prior to the passage of the Act at issue in this 
case, plaintiff The Atlanta Freethought Society had planned to open an anonymous 
account to publish that Society's web page due to concern about threats and harassment 
that might arise as a result of the controversial nature of the issues the Society planned to 
discuss on its page.  Plaintiff Community ConneXion also provides subscribers with the 
option to publish anonymous web pages. 

Anonymous Access Services:

71.  Conversely, many online users seek to access information anonymously over the 
Internet.  As a general rule, however, obtaining information anonymously over the 
Internet is difficult because every time an online user visits a web site, she leaves a digital 
"calling card" that reveals the address of the computer from which she is linked to the 
Internet, the address of the web site she last visited, the kind of computer she is using, 
and other details.  Many web sites keep logs with this information on all of the visitors 
that access their site.  

72.  Many online users fear that their privacy will be invaded if data collected by web 
sites is misused, particularly where the user has no knowledge of the amount of data 
being collected by various web site operators. 

73.  To assist online users in protecting their privacy, there are now services that allow 
online users to access information anonymously on the Internet.  These services, called 
"anonymizers," serve as a middleman between the user and the particular pages he wants 
to retrieve.  The Anonymizer strips all references to the user s e-mail address, computer 
type, and previous page visited before downloading the web page to the user.  If the user 
follows a link from a page accessed through the Anonymizer, the linked page is also 
accessed anonymously. Plaintiff Community ConneXion provides an Anonymizer service 
to the online public free of charge. 

THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ACT UPON EXPRESSION 

OVER COMPUTER NETWORKS


74.  The Act imposes two content-based restrictions affecting all of these various types of 
communications over computer networks. 

Prohibition of Communications Using Names 

That "Falsely Identify" The User


75.  First, the Act makes it unlawful knowingly to: transmit any data through a computer 
network . . . for the purpose of setting up, maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with 
an electronic mailbox, home page, or any other electronic information storage bank or 
point of access to electronic information if such data uses any individual name . . . to 
falsely identify the person . . . . 


76.  The Act does not define the phrase "to falsely identify." 

77.  The Act contains no requirement that the user of a name that "falsely identifies" him 
have any intent to deceive or defraud by its use. 

78.  The Act contains no requirement that there be any actual deception nor even any 
likelihood of deception as a result of the use of the name that "falsely identifies" its user. 

79.  The statutory language does not limit its reach to the willful use of "false" names for 
the purpose of deceptively posing as some specific other person or organization, but 
would also prohibit the use of pseudonyms and anonymous services that "falsely 
identify" their users even though they are used simply to communicate anonymously. 

Prohibition of Communications "Using" Trade Names, 

Logos & Other Images Without Permission

80.  In addition to prohibiting the use of names which "falsely identify" their user, the Act 
makes it unlawful knowingly to: 

transmit any data through a computer network . . . for the purpose of setting up, 
maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with an electronic mailbox, home page, or any 
other electronic information storage bank or point of access to electronic information if 
such data uses any . . . trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or 
copyrighted symbol . . . which would falsely state or imply that such person . . . has 
permission or is legally authorized to use such trade name, registered trademark, logo, 
legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol for such purpose when such permission or 
authorization has not been obtained . . . . 

81.  There is no definition of the phrases "uses" or "to use" in the Act. 

82.  In contrast to the protections for intellectual property provided under other federal 
and Georgia trademark and trade name statutes, there is no requirement in the Act that the 
prohibited "use" create any likelihood of confusion as to the identity of the user, nor that 
the use in any way dilute the value of a famous and distinctive mark, nor that the "use" be 
in the context of a commercial transaction for the sale of goods and services. 

83.  In contrast to the protections provided under other federal and Georgia trademark and 
trade name statutes which impose criminal penalties, there is no requirement in the Act 
that the user have any intent to deceive the public by this "use." 

84.  The Act provides no guidance for determining whether a web page that provides a 
link to a page containing a registered trade name or logo is a prohibited "use" of the logo 
under the Act.  

85.  The Act never defines the phrase "falsely implies."  It provides no guidance for 
determining whether any particular "use" of a trade name or logo in a web page would 
"falsely imply" that the user had obtained prior permission to link to the owner's web 
page or to use the trade name or logo in some other way. 

THE RELATIONSHIP OF PLAINTIFFS TO THE ACT 


86.  All of the plaintiffs are individuals or organizations who communicate (or whose 
members communicate) over computer networks, and who are fearful that the Act has 
made their protected expression a crime. 

American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia (ACLU/GA) 

87.  As part of the ACLU of Georgia s efforts to educate the public about civil rights and 
liberties, it has established an online site on the World Wide Web, at 
http://www.mindspring.com/~acluga.  The site provides electronic copies of ACLU 
publications, reports, court briefs and decisions, news releases, announcements and other 
materials related to the ACLU s legal, legislative, educational and advocacy work.  

88.  The ACLU of Georgia has been involved with a number of sensitive issues and 
topics such as censorship, separation of Church and State, reproductive freedom, AIDS 
issues, Gay and Lesbian rights and privacy issues.  Because of the sensitive nature of 
these issues, many of which are addressed on the web site, the ACLU believes that online 
users should be able to access its web site anonymously or using a pseudonym.  Those 
who currently access the ACLU web site anonymously will likely refrain from doing so 
in the future because such anonymous correspondence on the Internet is made a crime 
under Georgia law. 

89.  In addition, persons using pseudonyms often send comments, questions or opinions 
by e-mail to the ACLU of Georgia. For example, persons have sent very sensitive 
questions, comments and opinions about such issues as the death penalty, separation of 
Church and State and gay/lesbian rights.  The ACLU believes that these persons should 
be allowed to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy. 

90.  The ACLU of Georgia s site provides a collection of links to other related Internet 
sites including the National ACLU and other state affiliates of the ACLU, various sites 
for the United States and Georgia government, online legal libraries, related civil liberties 
and electronic freedom organizations, and related mailing lists and USENET groups.  
Among the sites are Emory Law School, Cornell Law School, the Congressional Record, 
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Voters  Telecommunications Watch, Computer 
Professionals for Social Responsibility, Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Georgia 
Constitution and the official Georgia State Government site (http://www.state.ga.us). The 
ACLU did not obtain permission before linking to these sites, and it would be practically 
impossible to obtain such permission for each link. 

91.  In addition, many of the members of the ACLU of Georgia use online 
communications to receive and transmit information over the World Wide Web, online 
mailing lists, discussion groups, chat rooms, computer bulletin boards, and private e-mail.  
Many of these members use handles or pseudonyms to protect their privacy when 
communicating over computer networks. 


AIDS Survival Project

92.  Members of the AIDS Survival Project use the Internet extensively to gain and 
exchange information about AIDS and its treatment.  Many web sites on the Internet, 
such as those of the Center for Disease Control and the AIDS Information Network, 
provide its members with the most up to date information about AIDS and safer sex. 

93.  Members of the AIDS Survival Project also engage in chat room discussions on the 
Internet that serve as support groups for those dealing with AIDS-related issues.  These 
chat rooms are often the only direct emotional support available to rural members with 
AIDS or HIV. 

94.  In spite of laws meant to protect the rights of those with HIV and AIDS, including 
one making HIV status confidential, people with AIDS continue to lose jobs, insurance, 
and even their homes as a result of social prejudices.  To avoid discrimination and social 
stigma, many members of the AIDS Survival Project use pseudonyms when 
communicating or accessing information over the Internet. 

95.  To better enable its members to take advantage of the information available on the 
Internet, the AIDS Survival Project is currently developing a web page to serve as a 
conduit by providing links to other organizations' web pages.  As a small non-profit, it 
would be impossible to provide useful information to its members without using links to 
other related web pages. 

96.  As a result of the Act s prohibition against using trade names, trademarks, logos, or 
legal or official seals without permission, the AIDS survival project feels its web page, 
composed of links to other organizations' web pages, may be in conflict with the law.  
Thus, the Act has caused the AIDS Survival Project to curtail its efforts to create its web 
page. 

Atlanta Freethought Society

97.  Members of the Atlanta Freethought Society frequently use Internet mailing lists and 
USENET newsgroups that disseminate information and encourage the exchange of views 
about freethinking issues, including the separation of church and state. 

98.  Due to the controversy and threats which are sometimes generated by discussions 
that are critical of the role of religion in society, some members of the Atlanta 
Freethought Society participate in Internet discussion groups anonymously. The Act will 
discourage members from engaging in discussion groups available on the Internet and 
will leave them vulnerable to threats and harassment. 

99.  The Atlanta Freethought Society is in the process of developing its own web page.  
The purpose of the web page will be to provide information about the purpose of the 
Atlanta Freethought Society, excerpts from its newsletter, e-mail addresses to contact 
members, and press releases relating to the Atlanta Freethought Society's activity. 

100. Due to concern about threats and harassment, the President of the Atlanta 
Freethought Society had originally intended to open an account for its web page using a 
pseudonym. However, since the passage of the Act, she fears that she may be in conflict 
with the law if the web page is opened under any name other than her own.  Thus, the 
Atlanta Freethought Society's plans to create a web page are currently uncertain. 

Atlanta Veterans Alliance (AVA)

101. The Atlanta Veterans Alliance serves the needs of veterans in the State of Georgia 
who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.  All of its members take an oath of 
confidentiality to prevent its members sexual identity from being revealed to military 
authorities. 

102. Board members of the Atlanta Veterans Alliance make extensive use of the Internet 
to stay in contact with board members from other organizations which share common 
goals. Members also use e-mail and chat rooms as a low-cost forum in which to discuss 
issues such as AIDS and the status of gays and lesbians in the military with others in 
Georgia and the nation. 

103. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered persons, and persons with AIDS, continue 
to suffer economic loss and personal harassment as a result of social prejudice.  In 
addition, disclosure of the identity of AVA members who remain in active military 
service would likely end their military careers.  For these reasons, AVA members 
frequently use pseudonyms to communicate over the Internet. 

Community ConneXion

104. Community ConneXion is an Internet Service Provider that specializes in providing 
the highest level of privacy to online users.  Although it does not monitor or keep records 
regarding the kinds of communication for which its services are used, Community 
ConneXion believes that its services are used for a variety of reasons, including 
protection from persecution for controversial lifestyles, protection from privacy-invasive 
employers, protection from oppressive governments in other countries, and protection 
from marketing databases. 

105. Community ConneXion provides its subscribers with the full range of online 
services and access to the Internet. Subscribers may set up pseudonymous and 
anonymous general accounts. 

106. In addition to pseudonymous and anonymous accounts, Community ConneXion also 
offers privacy services that are available to the entire community of Internet users free of 
charge.  For example, Community ConneXion makes available a pseudonymous remailer 
that allows Internet users who normally communicate under their real name to send 
particular messages pseudonymously.  Community ConneXion also operates a service 
that allows any Internet user to use the World Wide Web to send messages through a 
series of anonymous remailers (known as the "remailer network") available on the 
Internet.  In addition, to assist online users in protecting their privacy, Community 
ConneXion now provides a service known as the "Anonymizer" that allows any online 
user to access information anonymously on the Internet. 

107. Community ConneXion does not know whether its operation of the pseudonymous 
remailer, the web access to the remailer network, or the Anonymizer to communicate and 
access information on the Internet violates the Act because it constitutes "transmit[ting] 
data through a computer network . . . if such data uses any individual name . . . to falsely 
identify the person."  Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, Community ConneXion 
will be forced to choose between shutting down these services or risking prosecution 
under the Act. 

108. Similarly, users of the pseudonymous remailer, the remailer network, and the 
Anonymizer do not know whether use of these services violates the Act because it 
constitutes "transmit[ting] data through a computer network . . . if such data uses any 
individual name . . . to falsely identify the person."  Because the meaning of the Act is 
unclear, they are forced to choose between abandoning their pseudonymity or risking 
prosecution under the Act. 

109. The Community ConneXion web site currently provides links to other relevant 
online material.  These links provide valuable references to information that may be of 
interest to readers of its web site.  For instance, the site links to the web sites of Netscape 
(a company that produces a popular browser for the World Wide Web) and DigiCash (a 
company that develops secure electronic commerce technology).  These links may 
include trade names, registered trademarks, logos, legal or official seals, or copyrighted 
symbols. 

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)

110. The Electronic Frontier Foundation educates the public about civil liberties and 
other legal issues as they arise in the context of online computer communications, or 
"cyberspace." Throughout EFF's existence, it has initiated and/or moderated several 
online forums, including a forum on the WELL (a California-based conferencing system 
and Internet Service Provider) and on USENET discussion groups.  These forums are 
primarily interactive discussion groups, but EFF representatives also frequently 
participate in online "chat" rooms, and in special online events that allow users to discuss 
and debate a variety of legal and constitutional issues. 

111. EFF also maintains eight online mailing lists.  Its primary mailing list has a 
subscriber base of approximately 7500 individuals, including many located in the State of 
Georgia. 

112. In addition, EFF has its own computer site on the Internet with extensive resources 
including articles, court cases, legal papers, news releases, newsletters, and excerpts from 
public discussions related to the EFF's legal, legislative, educational and advocacy work. 

113. As a part of EFF's efforts to protect the privacy of online users and in furtherance of 
free speech, EFF facilitates responsible anonymous communication over computer 
networks in several ways.  For example, many participants in online discussions and 
chats sponsored by EFF use "handles," i.e., assumed names, rather than their actual name.  
EFF also provides links on its web page to "anonymous remailers."  EFF believes that 
online users should be able to access its computer sites anonymously or pseudonymously.  
EFF believes that pseudonymity and anonymity allows online users to participate in 
discussions without revealing their name to strangers, and without fear of retaliation for 
the expression of unpopular or controversial viewpoints.  This protection of privacy 
furthers the public interest by facilitating freer and more frank discussions, especially on 
controversial issues. 

114. In addition, nearly all of EFF's approximately 3500 members use online 
communications.  EFF members both receive and transmit information through a variety 
of online communications, including the World Wide Web, online mailing lists, 
discussion groups, chat rooms, computer bulletin boards, and private e-mail. Many of 
EFF's members use handles or pseudonyms to protect their privacy when communicating 
over computer networks. 

115. In addition, EFF publishes through its web site an extensive archive of articles and 
other information of interest to the online community, including information on 
government and legislative activities, legal issues and cases, academic freedom, 
censorship, free expression and other civil liberties, the information infrastructure and 
network resources, intellectual property, privacy and encryption, net culture and the 
online community, and social responsibility in the use of online resources.  Included 
within these archives are hundreds of links to other information and resources made 
available by others on the Internet on related topics.  Many of these links use the trade 
names of the companies, organizations, government agencies or other entities to whom 
the link is provided.  In some cases, EFF uses the logos or other graphical symbols of the 
organizations to whom we are linking on our web site. 

Electronic Frontiers Georgia (EFGA)

116. The mission of Electronic Frontiers Georgia is to raise public awareness among the 
citizens and elected representatives in Georgia regarding issues relating to freedom, 
privacy and access in the online world.  EFGA operates an online mailing list, distributed 
to all members of EFGA, that provides a discussion forum among members of EFGA.  
Some members participate in these discussions using pseudonyms. 

117. EFGA also publishes a web page and an electronic newsletter over the Internet with 
information about online issues of free speech, privacy and access to the online medium.  
EFGA's web site contains news and commentary on issues of public concern, which often 
uses the trade names, logos, and other symbols and graphics of others to refer to the 
companies, organizations or governmental officials or agencies discussed on the page. 

118. For example, the web page currently contains a news and commentary section about 
a recent proposal by BellSouth to increase rates charged for ISDN lines, a special data 
line that allows high speed modem access to the Internet and other computer networks.  
This news advisory uses BellSouth's trade name and logo to refer to the company and 
provides a link to a BellSouth customer feedback web page to allow users to express their 
opinions to BellSouth about the rate increase by e-mail. 

119. As a second example, EFGA's web page includes an extensive news and 
commentary section relating to the Act being challenged in this lawsuit, including a 
section that publishes quotes of public commentary on the Act by several Georgia elected 
officials relating to the Act.  This section of the web page includes an image of the 
Georgia seal in its heading. 

120.   EFGA believes that online users should be able to access its web site anonymously 
and believes that information of public interest can be disseminated more fully and freely 
over computer networks if they are able to do so. 

121. EFGA members both receive and transmit information through a variety of online 
communications, including the World Wide Web, online mailing lists, discussion groups, 
chat rooms, computer bulletin boards, and private e-mail.  Many of EFGA's members use 
handles or pseudonyms to protect their privacy when communicating over computer 
networks, especially when participating in chat or discussion groups on local BBS 
systems in Georgia, but also when communicating over commercial online services such 
as America Online or CompuServe, and when posting to USENET or participating in 
chat groups on the Internet. 

Mitchell Kaye

122. As a Representative in the Georgia House of Representatives, Mitchell Kaye has 
been actively involved in the creation and publication of a web page on the Internet, 
"www.gahouse.com," that provides extensive information to the general public on the 
activities of the Georgia House of Representatives.  The web page is sponsored by the 
Conservative Policy Caucus, of which Kaye is a member, and is not an official web page 
of the Georgia House of Representatives. 

123. The Conservative Policy Caucus believes that the more the public is informed about 
government and the activities and voting records of their elected officials, the better and 
more responsive government will be.  Thus, the web page currently publishes voting 
records and explains how members of the public can obtain audiotapes of floor debates in 
the House of Representatives.  It also provides links to the full text of pending legislation 
and information on the status of bills under consideration during the session, which is 
published separately on the Internet by the Georgia Net Authority and other sources. 

124. In addition, the web page publishes information to assist members of the public in 
contacting their elected representatives.  The page publishes the names, addresses, 
telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of all House members for whom 
this information is available to the caucus. 

125. The web page also publishes information on a wide variety of related political and 
"good government" topics, and provides a forum for political commentary on issues of 
public interest, including a link to a web page that publicizes and criticizes the passage of 
the Act that is the subject of this lawsuit. 

126. The web site also provides a collection of links to other Internet sites on related 
political and governmental topics, including federal legislative information resources, 
databases that provide the full text of historical and political documents, and links to the 
web pages of various political organizations. 

127. The web page prominently displays the seal of the State of Georgia at the top of the 
page, and below that identifies the page as "Information on the Georgia House of 
Representatives." Immediately below that, the page states that the information is "being 
disseminated by the Conservative Policy Caucus."    The words "Conservative Policy 
Caucus" are in large bold letters, and are further emphasized by blinking on and off while 
the page is being viewed through a web browser.  At the end of the page, the page states: 

This WWW site is created and maintained by members of the Georgia House of 
Representatives who form a part of the Conservative Policy Caucus.  Also helpful was 
our old friend Publius.  The information or opinions expressed herein or at any of the 
sites linked from this location do not reflect official policy of the Georgia House of 
Representatives or of any individual members thereof. 


128. Notwithstanding the disclaimers, the web page has been the subject of considerable 
controversy, and other members of the House of Representatives have engaged in a series 
of efforts to shut the page down.  They have claimed that the page creates a false 
impression that it is an "official" publication of the Georgia House of Representatives.  
There is in fact an "official" web page of the House of Representatives, which can be 
accessed at http://www.state.ga.us/House/.  This "official" page includes only contact 
information and photos of House members. 

129. Among other efforts to suppress the web page, House Speaker Thomas Murphy 
threatened to sue Mr. Kaye personally in February 1996 if the "www.gahouse.com" web 
page was not removed from the Internet.  His objection, according to his statements 
reported in the press at the time, was that use of the state seal on the web page created the 
false impression that this was an "official" web page of the House of Representatives, 
which it was not. 

130. Representative Don Parsons introduced House Bill 1630, which was eventually 
enacted into law and is the Act at issue in this litigation.  Representative Parsons, the 
author of House Bill 1630, stated at the time that this bill would apply to and prohibit the 
core political expression published by the Conservative Policy Caucus through its web 
site. 

131. Mr. Kaye has never intended to deceive anyone into believing that the web page was 
an official publication of the Georgia House of Representatives.  Mr. Kaye continues to 
display prominently the state seal on the web page, and to use this and other symbols 
(such as the flag of the United States) and the name of the Georgia House of 
Representatives and other organizations on the page.  Mr. Kaye does not know whether 
his use of these symbols and names falsely implies that he has obtained permission to use 
them despite his disclaimers.  Given the history of the Act, including the fact that the 
author of the Act has stated publicly that he thinks the law would apply to the 
"www.gahouse.com" page, Mr. Kaye fears prosecution under the Act. 

132. In addition, as an expression of protest against this statute, Mr. Kaye occasionally 
uses the e-mail address "publius@gahouse.com" for online communications and 
expression. He uses the pseudonym "Publius" to draw attention to efforts of the State of 
Georgia to suppress free speech over computer networks using pseudonyms by 
contrasting these efforts with the long tradition in the United States that has encouraged 
and protected expression under pen names and pseudonyms in, for example, the 
Federalist Papers published during the original constitutional debates.  Mr. Kaye does not 
know whether use of the pseudonym "Publius" violates the Act because it "falsely 
identifies" him.  Nonetheless, he intends to continue using this pseudonym for political 
expression, protest and commentary on these issues of public concern. 

Kenneth Leebow

133. In connection with his Internet consulting business, Kenneth Leebow publishes a 
web page and online newsletter, and communicates by e-mail, under the pen name 
"Norman," or "Norman, The Ultimate Business Surfer." 

134. Mr. Leebow publishes a weekly online newsletter called "Norman's Friday Hot Tips 
and Sites To Visit Newsletter," which is distributed by e-mail to subscribers each Friday.  
The newsletter is distributed to more than 13,000 subscribers around the world.  Anyone 
with access to the Internet can subscribe to the newsletter without charge. 

135. The weekly newsletter includes discussions and advice about a variety of Internet-
related topics, and includes a number of weekly tips for new web sites.  Mr. Leebow 
regularly uses the trade names of other companies in the newsletter, to describe 
(sometimes in critical terms) their activities on the Internet, and to provide links to 
materials they are making available on the Internet.  Mr. Leebow does not request 
permission from these companies before using their trade names for the purposes of 
commenting upon their activities or providing references to their web pages or other 
Internet materials. 

136. Mr. Leebow also maintains a web page under the pseudonym "Norman," which can 
be accessed on the Internet at "http://this.is/norman."  The web page includes a wide 
variety of information useful to businesses who operate on the web.  It also includes 
"Norman's List of Superior Sites on the Internet" (also known as the "Hottest Business 
Web Sites" list), an extensive collection of links to other web sites with useful 
government and business resources.  Mr. Leebow s web page also includes "Norman's 
List of Great Internet Publications" (also known as the "Hottest Business Publications" 
list), which provides links to hundreds of newspapers and magazines that are accessible to 
Internet users.  Mr. Leebow is also currently constructing an even more extensive 
collection of links which will be called "Norman's Best 1000 of the Web." 

137. In the course of providing links to other web sites, Mr. Leebow routinely uses the 
trade names of corporations to identify the links.  He does not request prior permission 
from these companies before using their trade names to provide users with links to their 
web sites, and it would be impossible as a practical matter to do so. 

138.  Mr. Leebow began using the pen name "Norman" as a creative way of expressing 
his ideas on the Internet.  "Norman" was intended to be a fun, whimsical and somewhat 
nerdy character that surfs the Internet for resources that will be useful to readers and 
potential customers on the Internet.  Norman has become a popular character among 
subscribers and users of Mr. Leebow s web page.  He often receives e-mail and regular 
mail correspondence and feedback addressed to Norman, and sometimes receives checks 
for merchandise or services made payable to Norman. 

Bruce Mirken

139.  Plaintiff Bruce Mirken is a freelance journalist based in San Francisco, California. 

140.  Most of Mr. Mirken's articles cover lesbian and gay issues and health care, 
especially HIV/AIDS.  For example, in 1995 he wrote two articles about the Boy Scouts 
of America s policies excluding gay youth and adults from participation. 

141.  To gather material and ideas for his articles, Mr. Mirken regularly participates in 
online discussion groups on America Online (AOL), as well as several USENET 
newsgroups including sci.med.aids, misc.health.aids, and soc.support.youth.gay-lesbian-
bi on the Internet.  He also subscribes to electronic mailing lists such as AIDSLEADS.  In 
his article on gay youth in the Boy Scouts, for example, he included the perspectives of 
several gay youths Mr. Mirken contacted by posting notices in several discussion groups 
on America Online and the Internet.  He has published a number of other articles on 
similar topics, relying upon similar interviews and material collected from similar 
sources. 

142.  Mr. Mirken believes that his ability as a journalist to contact and be contacted by 
sources who need to remain anonymous is essential to his profession in general and to his 
own professional activities in particular.  Many of his sources are gay people who 
communicate with him online only because they can do so anonymously or using 
pseudonyms.  Many are young people still living at home whose families do not know of 
their sexual orientation.  Mr. Mirken could not have made contact with these sources if a 
law such as the Georgia statute had forced them to reveal their true identities when they 
communicate online. 

143.  Because of the nature of the online medium, Mr. Mirken cannot know whether any 
of the sources he communicates with online reside in Georgia.  Additionally, because it is 
impossible to determine what path a particular online communication travels, persons 
outside Georgia may be communicating  through  Georgia in order to communicate with 
him.  He is fearful, therefore, that the threat of prosecution under the statute may chill the 
willingness of his sources to continue their online communications with him. 

144.  In addition, Mr. Mirken fears that his online screen name may subject him to 
prosecution under the Act.  Although his AOL screen name, "Bmirk," is based on his real 
name, it does not identify him with specificity.  He does not know whether using "Bmirk" 
as a screen name "falsely identifies" him within the meaning of the Act. 

Bonnie Nadri

145. Bonnie Nadri operates The Page Factory, a web page design business.  She 
maintains a web site, "http://thepagefactory.org/," to advertise services and rates, and to 
solicit business for The Page Factory.  Because the design, layout and look of the web 
page itself is an example of The Page Factory s web design abilities, the design and look 
of the page is particularly important for business. 

146. Originally, The Page Factory web page published an extensive set of links to other 
related resources on the Web, including other web design resources, search engines, and 
links to the web pages of other Atlanta-area businesses.  The Page Factory web page used 
many graphics for these links in order to demonstrate its web design services and the 
possibilities for design and layout of web pages.  Many of these graphics were the logos 
or trademarks of the companies to whom the page was linked. For example, the Coca-
Cola trademark logo provided a link to the web site of the Coca-Cola Company in 
Atlanta.  Ms. Nadri did not obtain the permission of these companies before establishing 
these links, and it would be impossible as a practical matter to obtain such permission for 
every link. 

147. When Ms. Nadri learned about the passage of the Act, she became concerned that 
use of these logos and graphics to provide links from The Page Factory web page had 
become illegal. Because of this fear, Ms. Nadri removed the logos and graphics from The 
Page Factory web page, and changed the links to text- based references.  Ultimately, she 
decided to remove the links altogether, because the text-only links were drab and did not 
display very interesting web design skills.  Removing these links, logos and images 
damaged her web design business because they limited her ability to demonstrate web 
design skills to potential customers.  However, Ms. Nadri believes that reinstating the 
links would subject her to prosecution under the Act. 

148. In addition to the business web page for The Page Factory, Ms. Nadri maintains a 
personal web page, which expresses her own personal interests and provides a number of 
links to other web pages that are of personal interest to her.  This web page can be 
accessed at http://www.mindspring.com/~blnadri/. Unlike her business site, Ms. Nadri 
continues to publish text- based links on her personal web page, some of which use the 
trade names of companies or organizations to whom she is linking.  She is concerned that 
even this limited use of trade names on her personal page may still subject her to 
prosecution under the Act. 

149. Ms. Nadri also makes extensive use of the Internet and local Bulletin Board Services 
("BBSs") to communicate and interact with others in the online world.  She particularly 
enjoys participating in chat and discussion groups on local BBSs in the Atlanta area, and 
over the Internet. 

150. When participating in chat sessions or discussion groups on local BBSs, Ms. Nadri 
always uses a pseudonym or "handle."  She is a single mother and lives alone with her 
daughter in the Atlanta area.  She is very concerned about the risk of revealing her real 
name to strangers that may be participating in or simply monitoring the chat sessions or 
discussions, especially when she communicates on local BBSs. Anyone with a computer, 
modem and telephone can log into these services, and if she used her real name to 
participate in the chat sessions or discussion groups, anyone who has logged on would be 
able to find her address.  She is concerned about the risk of another user stalking or 
harassing her or her daughter. For fear of harassment (or worse), she would not continue 
to participate in these chat sessions if she had to use her real name. 

Josh Riley

151. Josh Riley is a corporate consultant and provides residential real estate brokerage 
services for a real estate brokerage company called Property Systems Real Estate in 
Atlanta. In connection with his real estate business, he operates a web site that can be 
accessed at http://www.mindspring.com/~relocate. He uses this site as a means of 
marketing his services as a real estate agent, providing information, for example, about 
property listings.  His real estate web page includes an extensive list of "Other Links" to 
Atlanta and Georgia web sites that may be helpful to people planning to move to the 
Atlanta area, including cultural institutions in the Atlanta area, banks, churches, 
employment and business resources, and tourist information. Several of these links 
include the trade names of institutions or organizations. 

152. Mr. Riley also operates two Internet "domains," or locations on the World Wide 
Web.  The first of these is "www.worship.com," which houses several web sites that Mr. 
Riley has developed and maintained for churches and ministries in the Atlanta area, 
including a web page for the First Baptist Atlanta/North Campus and a web page for the 
North Point Community Church.  The pages also include extensive links to related 
Christian ministry resources on the Internet, including organizations like Focus on the 
Family, the Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council, and Contemporary 
Christian Music Magazine. 

153. The second domain Mr. Riley operates on the World Wide Web is 
"www.blackbaseball.com," which publishes a variety of information relating to the Negro 
Baseball Leagues that flourished in the early part of this century when African- 
Americans were barred from participating in the major leagues. This web page has been 
very popular and has won awards as an outstanding Internet resource on this topic.  The 
page includes several links to other resources on the Negro Baseball Leagues and related 
baseball topics, including a page that uses the HBO (Home Box Office) logo to urge 
viewers to look for the movie "Soul of the Game." 

154. Mr. Riley has not requested permission to use trade names to provide links on his 
web sites, and it would be impossible as a practical matter to do so for all of the links. 

155. Mr. Riley also has membership accounts with America Online and Prodigy.  He uses 
several "screen names" or "handles" with these accounts that are pseudonyms.  Mr. Riley 
prefers to use a pseudonym when contributing comments to online chats and discussion 
groups about real estate and politics because he is concerned about receiving offensive 
messages from other users of the service who may disagree with views that he expresses 
in this medium.  In addition, using a pseudonym prevents people from determining his 
real identity and delivering offensive messages to him in person or over the telephone. 

John Troyer

156. John Troyer is a graduate student in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department at the 
University of California, San Francisco.  As a public service, he also maintains a site on 
the World Wide Web known as the Safer Sex Page, which can be accessed free of charge 
at http://www.safersex.org.  The Safer Sex Page is composed of two separate 
components:  the information pages and the Safer Sex Forum. 

157. The information pages include brochures about safer sex, HIV transmission, and 
condoms, as well as resources for health educators and counselors.  In this age of AIDS, 
Mr. Troyer believes the Safer Sex Page can help save lives by providing information 
about safer sex practices.  The Safer Sex Page also provides information helpful in 
avoiding other sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancy. 

158. Mr. Troyer believes that online users, especially teenagers, should be able to access 
the Safer Sex Page anonymously or using pseudonyms.  If young people could not use 
pseudonyms in order to access the site, many of them would choose not to enter at all for 
fear of disclosure.  With the rate of HIV transmission among teenagers increasing over 
the years, the consequences of denying them such information could very well cost lives. 

159. The Safer Sex Page provides a number of links to other safer sex resources available 
on the World Wide Web, including links to Planned Parenthood, the Center for Disease 
Control, Condom Club International and the Rainbow Mall.  Some of these links may 
include trade names, registered trademarks, logos, etc. Mr. Troyer has not received 
explicit permission to establish these links and it would be practically impossible for him 
to do so. 

160. In addition to maintaining the Safer Sex Web page, Mr. Troyer moderates the Safer 
Sex Forum, an online discussion group in which any Internet user can participate.  Past 
topics have included condom brands, how to talk about safer sex with a sex partner, and 
masturbation.  Because of the explicit and sensitive nature of the topics, a number of 
participants in these discussions use pseudonyms or post anonymously in order to protect 
their privacy.  Mr. Troyer believes that many people would not feel comfortable 
discussing such issues if they could not use pseudonyms.  If all participants in the Safer 
Sex Forum were forced to disclose their true identity, the quantity and the quality of the 
discussion would suffer. 

Jonathan Wallace

161. Jonathan Wallace is a software business executive and attorney based in New York 
City.  He uses the Internet extensively to communicate and access information on both 
personal and business matters.  Mr. Wallace has two "user names" that he uses when 
communicating online.  One is his real name, Jonathan Wallace, and the other is a 
pseudonym, Jonathan Blumen. 

162. Mr. Wallace began using the pseudonym Jonathan Blumen in January, 1995, in 
connection with The Ethical Spectacle, a monthly newsletter that he publishes on the 
World Wide Web.  In The Ethical Spectacle, Mr. Wallace expresses political and ethical 
views which are sometimes of a controversial nature. Since he sometimes writes and 
lectures for the New York-based software company by which he is employed, he adopted 
the Jonathan Blumen pseudonym in order to keep his business "persona" and personal 
beliefs separate.  In particular, he wanted to be able to express his views without his 
employer being held responsible for them.  For example, he wrote an essay in The Ethical 
Spectacle on the antitrust case against Microsoft, a case about which his employer could 
not safely take a position without endangering certain business relationships.  Mr. 
Wallace also uses the pseudonym Jonathan Blumen to communicate on Internet mailing 
lists and discussion groups on topics such as freedom of speech, constitutional liberty in 
America, cryptography and anonymity, and threats to the environment. 

163. The Ethical Spectacle, which can be accessed at http://www.spectacle.org, began in 
January 1995.  Each issue of The Ethical Spectacle is approximately 20-30 pages.  Mr. 
Wallace receives no payment for maintaining the newsletter.  The purpose of The Ethical 
Spectacle is to address issues at the intersection of ethics, law, and politics in American 
life.  The material in the newsletter is meant to provoke thought about these important 
issues.  Some issues of The Ethical Spectacle are dedicated to particular subjects, 
including the meaning of government, freedom of speech, ethics and science fiction, 
pornography, and Nazi concentration camps. 

164. Mr. Wallace accepts e-mail submissions for publication in The Ethical Spectacle, 
and occasionally publishes anonymous and pseudonymous submissions.  For example, 
"Bob Wilson" has written several articles that take extremely conservative positions on 
issues such as welfare and gun control.  Bob is a businessman in a Western state who 
does not care to use his real name when expressing his views.  Another article, entitled 
"Mike Tyson is a Rapist, Not a Hero", which appeared under the byline Lisa G., was 
submitted by a woman who requested that her name not appear.  Mr. Wallace has also 
received and published mail in The Ethical Spectacle that was sent through anonymous 
remailers.  One letter was from a German who read an article in The Ethical Spectacle 
about Auschwitz, and was very affected by it but was still struggling with the issue of 
whether to believe the Holocaust occurred.  This troubled individual wrote anonymously 
because he wanted to confess his emotional struggle without revealing his real name. 

165. Mr. Wallace does not know whether publishing articles by anonymous or 
pseudonymous authors in The Ethical Spectacle violates the Act because it constitutes 
"transmit[ting] data through a computer network . . . if such data uses any individual 
name . . . to falsely identify the person."  Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, he is 
forced to choose between rejecting anonymous submissions or risking prosecution under 
the Act. 

166. Mr. Wallace also believes it is important for readers of The Ethical Spectacle to be 
able to access the web site anonymously or pseudonymously.  Because it contains 
controversial material, or because they do not want their identity to be recorded by 
particular web sites, some readers might be inhibited from accessing the site if they could 
not do so pseudonymously. 

167. The Ethical Spectacle currently provides links to other relevant online material.  For 
instance, there are links to the web sites of Yahoo (a popular Internet search engine), 
Wired Magazine, United Church of Christ, the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC), Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), the American Civil Liberties Union, 
and Greenpeace.  Some of these links may include trade names, registered trademarks, 
logos, legal or official seals, or copyrighted symbols.  These links provide valuable 
references to information that may be of interest to readers of the web site. 

ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL PLAINTIFFS

168. Because of the nature of online communications, plaintiffs, their members, users, 
and subscribers have no way to determine whether a particular communication travels 
through the State of Georgia and therefore may be subject to the Act.  There is no way to 
determine the geographic location of persons who read and reply to their postings to 
online newsgroups, mailing lists, and chat rooms, or who download information from 
web sites.  Most of these fora can be accessed by anyone in the world, and there is no way 
to ensure that no one from Georgia will view the messages.  Thus, all online 
communications are subject to the Act. 

169. Plaintiffs do not intend to deceive anyone by communicating pseudonymously or 
anonymously, or by providing links in their web sites to other sites with trade names, 
trademarks, or logos. 

170. Plaintiffs do not know whether they, or their members, users, or subscribers, could 
be prosecuted for communicating and accessing information online under a pseudonym 
or anonymously because such communication constitutes the "transmi[ssion of] data 
through a computer network . . . [and] such data uses any individual name . . . to falsely 
identify the person."  Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, plaintiffs, their 
members, users, and subscribers will be forced to choose between abandoning anonymity 
or risking prosecution under the Act. 

171. Plaintiffs do not know whether they could be prosecuted under the Act for their use 
in web publications of the trade names, logos, etc., of other companies or organizations -- 
particularly, their use of these names or logos to provide links to other web sites -- 
because it constitutes "transmit[ting] data through a computer network . . . us[ing] any . . . 
trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol to 
falsely . . . imply . . . permission or legal[] authoriz[ation] to use such trade name, 
registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol." Because some 
of the plaintiffs' uses of these names or logos are in the context of critical news or 
commentary (such as the use of the BellSouth logo by EFGA, or Mitchell Kaye's use of 
the Georgia seal), and because of the large number of links in many of the other plaintiffs  
web sites, it would be impossible as a practical matter for plaintiffs to obtain this 
permission. Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, plaintiffs will be forced to choose 
between removing the links, which would significantly decrease the value and usefulness 
of their web sites, or risking prosecution under the Act. 

THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ACT UPON EXPRESSION OVER OTHER 
NETWORKS 


172. Although the restrictions imposed by the Act certainly apply to any communications 
over computer networks, they are not limited to that context.  The statute also makes it 
illegal knowingly: 

to transmit any data . . . over the transmission facilities or through the network facilities 
of a local telephone network for the purpose of . . . exchanging data with . . . [any] point 
of access to electronic information. 

173. The Act never defines the phrase "point of access to electronic information."  The 
phrase is exceedingly vague, and broad enough that it could reasonably be construed to 
include not only any computer, but also fax machines, telephone answering machines, 
voicemail systems, ham or citizen band radios, magnetic tapes and tape recorders, and a 
whole host of other similar devices.  For example, an ordinary voice telephone can 
certainly provide a "point of access to electronic information," and "data" as defined in 
the Act is broad enough to include voice data transmitted over local telephone lines. 

174. Thus, in addition to the communications over computer networks described above, 
the Act could be construed to criminalize any communications using pseudonyms or 
assumed names in many other contexts such as, for example, communications over local 
private computer Local Area Networks ("LANs"), private telephone conversations, fax 
communications, communications to a telephone answering machine or voice mailbox, 
and so forth.  As in the case of communications over computer networks, this broad 
sweep would prohibit a wide array of protected expression and would violate the 
Constitution for all the same reasons discussed above. 

CAUSES OF ACTION

175. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraph 1 - 174. 

176. The Act (on its face and as applied) violates the plaintiffs' rights to free expression, 
association and access to information protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments 
and Art. 1,   1,   5 of the Georgia Constitution, and their rights to privacy protected by the 
First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, and Art. 1,   1,    1, 3, 5 & 9 of the Georgia 
Constitution. 

177. The Act is substantially overbroad in violation of the First and Fourteenth 
Amendments and Art. 1,   1,   5 of the Georgia Constitution. 

178. The Act is impermissibly vague in violation of the plaintiffs' First, Fourth and 
Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Art. 1,   1,    1 & 5 of the 
Georgia Constitution. 

179. The Act imposes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce in violation 
the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 

WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request the Court to: 

(1)  Declare that the Act violates the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth 
Amendments, and the Commerce Clause, of the United States Constitution, and Art. 1,  1,  
1, 3, 5 & 9 of the Georgia Constitution, and enjoin its enforcement. 

(2)  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1988, award plaintiffs reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 

(3)  Award plaintiffs such further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

CIVIL ACTION  
  
BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION   
  
Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of Act No. 1029, Ga.  
Laws 1996, p. 1505, codified at O.C.G.A. 16-9-93.1 ("the Act"), a recently enacted  
Georgia statute that unconstitutionally restricts free expression over the Internet and other  
computer networks. Specifically, the Act unconstitutionally prohibits plaintiffs and others  
from using pseudonyms or communicating anonymously over computer networks. The  
Act also unconstitutionally restricts the "use" by plaintiffs and others of trade names,  
logos and certain other graphics over computer networks. Plaintiffs are individuals and  
organizations, and their members, users, and subscribers, Hereinafter, "plaintiffs" will  
refer collectively to plaintiffs, their members, users and subscribers. who communicate  
over computer networks and who are fearful that the Act has made their protected  
expression a crime.   
  
The Act's enforcement should be enjoined for the following reasons:   
  
(1) The Act violates the plaintiffs' federal and state constitutional rights to free  
expression, association, and privacy;   
  
(2) The Act is substantially overbroad;  
  
(3) The Act is unconstitutionally vague; and   
  
(4) The Act violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because it  
regulates commerce occurring wholly outside the borders of the State of Georgia.   
  
FACTUAL BACKGROUND  
  
RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ACT  
  
The Act imposes two content-based restrictions upon expression over computer networks,  
including the world-wide network known as the Internet. First, it prohibits  
communications over computer networks using a name that "falsely identifies" the  
speaker. Specifically, the Act makes it a crime for:   
  
any person . . . knowingly to transmit any data through a computer network . . . for the  
purpose of setting up, maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with an electronic  
mailbox, home page, or any other electronic information storage bank or point of access  
to electronic information if such data uses any individual name . . . to falsely identify the  
person . . . .   
  
Second, the Act makes it a crime to publish information over computer networks if the  
information "uses" trade names, logos, and other symbols in certain ways. Specifically,  
the Act makes it a crime for:   
  
any person . . . knowingly to transmit any data through a computer network [for the  
purposes set forth above] if such data uses any . . . trade name, registered trademark, logo,  
legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol . . . which would falsely state or imply that  
such person . . . has permission or is legally authorized to use [it] for such purpose when  
such permission or authorization has not been obtained.   
  
O.C.G.A. 16-9-93.1(a) (1996) (emphasis supplied).The Act provides two exceptions to its  
general application. The first provides that a "telecommunications company or Internet  
access provider" does not violate the law "solely as a result of carrying or transmitting  
such data for its customers." O.C.G.A. 16-9-93.1(a) (emphasis supplied). The second, not  
codified in the Official Code, provides that a "member of the General Assembly" does  
not violate the Act by displaying the state seal or flag "on a home page that is clearly  
identified with the name of the member as the home page of that member." Act No. 1029,  
2, Ga. Laws 1996, at 1506 (emphasis supplied).   
  
TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS AFFECTED BY THE ACT   
  
To understand the breadth of communications the Act censors, it is necessary to  
appreciate the unique nature of the online medium. The definition of "computer  
networks" in the Act encompasses any set of remotely connected computers over which  
communications can take place, including the Internet, commercial online services such  
as America Online, and local and national computer bulletin board systems. See  
O.C.G.A. 16-9-92(2). The venue provisions of the statute provide that it applies to any  
communications that pass at any time through the wires or airspace of Georgia. See  
O.C.G.A. 16-9-94(4). Because of the nature of the online medium, the restrictions upon  
expression imposed by the Act therefore apply to a wide variety of communications over  
thousands of different local, national and international computer networks, within and  
outside Georgia.   
  
Types of Computer Networks Affected  
  
Specifically, the Act affects communications over at least the following three types of  
computer networks:   
  
The Internet -- The Internet is the largest computer network in the world, linking together  
tens of thousands of smaller computer networks established by individuals, universities,  
governments, organizations, and businesses. Approximately 20-40 million users  
communicate and publish or receive information over this network. These include  
hundreds of thousands of users in Georgia, all of whom can communicate with or receive  
information from any other user on the network anywhere else in the world. Declaration  
of Shari Steele (Ex. A) ["Steele Aff."] 14-18.All affidavits cited in this memorandum are  
attached as Exhibits A - N to plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Much, if not  
most, of the communication over the Internet is non-commercial in nature.   
  
The Commercial Online Services -- Communications over large national computer  
networks known as "commercial online services," including Prodigy, America Online and  
CompuServe, are also restricted by the Act. These services enable their customers to  
communicate with other customers, access the Internet, and access other proprietary  
information and services available only to subscribers. They have more than twelve  
million subscribers in the United States and overseas; all of the major providers have  
customers in Georgia and facilitate online communications into and out of this State.  
Steele Aff. 19-20.   
  
Local Bulletin Board Services ("BBSs") -- The Act also restricts expression on thousands  
of local computer networks known as Bulletin Board Systems, or "BBSs." A BBS can be  
established by anyone with a phone line, computer, modem, and proper software, to allow  
people with common interests to communicate with each other and share information.  
There are several hundred BBSs in Georgia, and thousands more outside the state that can  
be reached from Georgia through long distance telephone lines. Steele Aff. 21.   
  
Methods of Online Communications Affected   
  
Computer users communicate with each other over computer networks in several similar  
ways. Because the restrictions imposed by the Act apply to the transmission of "any data  
through a computer network . . . for the purpose of . . . exchanging data with an electronic  
mailbox, home page, or any other electronic information storage bank or point of access  
to electronic information," the Act applies to virtually any communication over these  
networks that originates from, can be received in, or simply passes through the State of  
Georgia. O.C.G.A. 93-9-93.1(a) (emphasis supplied); Steele Aff. 22. At a minimum, the  
Act applies to the following types of communications which are particularly relevant to  
this motion:   
  
E-mail -- E-mail is the basic method of communication over computer networks. It  
allows one user to send a message to any other user or users on the network. Because  
mass mailings via e- mail are relatively easy and inexpensive, e-mail enables any user to  
publish and distribute information on any topic simply by compiling a mailing list of  
online users and sending the newsletter to everyone on the list. Steele Aff. 23-24.   
  
Discussion groups -- A second common method of communication over computer  
networks are "discussion groups," which allow users to post public messages onto a  
computerized bulletin board or to an electronic list, and to read and respond to messages  
posted by others. Computer discussion groups have been organized on many different  
computer networks on virtually every topic imaginable. They have created an entirely  
new public forum for the vigorous exchange, discussion and debate of ideas. These public  
discussion groups are one of the most popular uses of the Internet and other computer  
networks. Steele Aff. 25-26.   
  
Chat Groups -- Similar to discussion groups are "chat groups," which allow users to  
converse simultaneously with each other over computer networks by typing messages and  
reading messages typed by others participating in the "chat." Some chat groups are  
organized for social entertainment, and others are organized by a particular sponsor to  
provide a specific forum for discussion of a particular topic or set of issues. Steele Aff.  
27-28.   
  
Publication & Access To Information -- Finally, computer networks provide a powerful  
new medium for publishing information and for accessing information published by  
others. The best-known, most accessible, and potentially most powerful publishing  
medium over computer networks is the "World Wide Web" of the Internet. Anyone with  
access to the Internet and proper software can publish "web pages" on the Internet, which  
may contain text, images, sound and even video. Any Internet user anywhere in the world  
can view the web pages published by others, read their text, look at their images and  
video, and listen to their sounds. The World Wide Web therefore provides citizens of  
ordinary means with an extraordinary new power to publish ideas to the world and to  
access the ideas and information published by others. Steele Aff. 29-31.   
  
In addition, the World Wide Web provides the unique ability to "link" different web  
pages together to direct users to additional web pages known to the publisher on topics of  
interest. A "link" in a web page allows a user to move from one web site to another  
merely by "clicking" on specified text or graphics with a computer mouse; the software  
will then automatically transfer the user to a different location on the Internet. A link in a  
web page can lead to a different page within the same web site, or the link may transport  
the user to an entirely different web site published on an entirely different computer in a  
different part of the world. This linking ability makes the World Wide Web a unique and  
powerful publishing platform, in effect tying the entire World Wide Web together into a  
single interconnected body of knowledge made up of all the individually published web  
pages of millions of different users around the world. Steele Aff. 32- 37.   
  
THE EFFECT OF THE ACT UPON THE PLAINTIFFS'   
  
COMMUNICATIONS OVER COMPUTER NETWORKS  
  
As set forth above, the Act imposes two restrictions upon communications over computer  
networks. The first prohibits communications using a name that "falsely identifies" the  
user. The second prohibits the use of trade names, logos, symbols etc. in a way that  
"would falsely state or imply" that the person using the name or logo has obtained  
permission to do so. Plaintiffs use or seek to use computer networks for protected  
communications prohibited by either or both of these restrictions. See Exhibits A - N,  
attached to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (plaintiffs' affidavits).   
  
The Use of Pseudonyms and Other Anonymous   
  
Communications That "Falsely Identify" Online Users   
  
Plaintiffs and many other online users communicate over computer networks in a way  
that they fear may "falsely identify" them within the meaning of the Act. Specifically,  
almost every online user is identified when they communicate online by an "e-mail  
address" that is not their full legal name. For example, one of plaintiff Jonathan Wallace's  
e-mail addresses is "jw@bway.net." Declaration of Jonathan Wallace (Ex. B) ["Wallace  
Aff."] 4. Similarly, plaintiff Bruce Mirken uses the screen name "Bmirk" when  
communicating on America Online. Declaration of Bruce Mirken (Ex. C) ["Mirken Aff."]  
4. Although these e-mail addresses and screen names bear some relationship to their  
user's real name, they do not identify their users with specificity and therefore may  
"falsely identify" their users within the meaning of the Act. It would be technologically  
impossible on many computer networks to include a user's full name in their e-mail  
address.   
  
Moreover, plaintiffs and many other online users use so-called "screen names,"  
"handles," pen names, or other online pseudonyms that purposefully bear no resemblance  
to their real name when they communicate online. For example, Mitchell Kaye, a Georgia  
legislator, occasionally uses the pen name "publius;" staff members of the Electronic  
Frontier Foundation use handles such as "mnemonic" and "mech;" and members of  
Electronic Frontiers Georgia use handles including "decius," "soth" and "pooh."  
Declaration of Mitchell Kaye (Ex. D) ["Kaye Aff."] 18; Steele Aff. 11; Declaration of  
Robert Costner (Ex. E) ["Costner Aff."] 14. Some computer users also use "anonymous  
remailers" and "anonymizers," which strip the identifying information from a particular  
message or communication. Declaration of Sameer Parekh (Ex. F) ["Parekh Aff."] 5-7;  
12-16; 20-23.   
  
Plaintiffs and other online users communicate anonymously for a variety of reasons. For  
example, several of the plaintiffs use screen names or pseudonyms so that they can  
participate anonymously in online discussions or chats on topics that are sensitive,  
embarrassing, or might subject them to social ostracism. Members of the AIDS Survival  
Project use pseudonyms to participate in online chat groups that offer therapeutic support  
to persons with AIDS and HIV. Declaration of Jeff Graham (Ex. G) ["Graham Aff."] 6-8.  
The Safer Sex Web Page hosts online discussions on sex education topics, in which many  
participants use pseudonyms to protect their anonymity. Declaration of John Troyer (Ex.  
H) ["Troyer Aff."] 12-14.   
  
Certain plaintiffs speak anonymously online because they fear retaliation for expressing  
unpopular or controversial views. The members of Atlanta Veterans Alliance, an  
organization that serves the needs of gay, lesbian and bisexual veterans, use the Internet  
anonymously not only to avoid harassment and discrimination, but also to protect their  
careers since those in active military service would face discharge if their identities were  
disclosed. Declaration of Eric Van Pelt (Ex. I) ["Van Pelt Aff."] 3,5. Members of the  
Atlanta Freethought Society participate in online discussions anonymously because their  
views advocating the separation of church and state often engender resentment and  
threats from others. Declaration of Kimberly Lyle-Wilson (Ex. J) ["Lyle-Wilson Aff."] 3- 
6. Plaintiff Bruce Mirken, a journalist who writes frequently about gay issues, obtains  
information for his stories from gay youth online; these youth would be unwilling to  
speak to Mirken if they could not use pseudonyms to protect their identity. Mirken Aff. 4- 
9.   
  
Certain plaintiffs use pseudonyms so that other online users cannot find their phone  
number or address to contact and potentially harass them. For example, Bonnie Nadri, a  
single mother, uses a pseudonym in chat and discussion groups on local BBSs because  
she does not want strangers on the network to obtain her real name. Declaration of  
Bonnie Nadri (Ex. K) ["Nadri Aff."] 7-9. Josh Riley uses screen names in  
communications over America Online to avoid receiving harassing or unwanted phone  
calls or messages. Declaration of Josh Riley (Ex. L) ["Riley Aff."] 7. Similarly, many  
online users, including Members of Electronic Frontiers Georgia, the Electronic Frontier  
Foundation, and the ACLU of Georgia, engage in anonymous online speech simply to  
protect their privacy. Costner Aff. 14; Steele Aff. 11; Declaration of Teresa Nelson (Ex.  
M) ["Nelson Aff."] 9-11.   
  
Three plaintiffs publish online newsletters or web pages on topics of public interest using  
"pen names," i.e., pseudonyms. Jonathan Wallace, a software executive and also a  
recognized author, publishes a newsletter on the Web under the pen name Jonathan  
Blumen to distinguish his business identity from his personal views. Wallace Aff. 8-14.  
Ken Leebow publishes a newsletter under the pen name "Norman, The Ultimate Business  
Surfer" as a whimsical and successful marketing strategy. Declaration of Kenneth  
Leebow (Ex. N) ["Leebow Aff."] 3-14. Similarly, Mitchell Kaye is a Georgia legislator  
who occasionally uses the pseudonym "Publius" in e-mail and in connection with a web  
page he publishes providing information on the activities of the Georgia House of  
Representatives. Kaye Aff. 4-10; 18.   
  
Just as many plaintiffs and other online users desire anonymity for themselves when  
communicating to others, many plaintiffs believe it is important for members and users  
who wish to obtain sensitive or controversial information to be able to access that  
information anonymously. See, e.g., Graham Aff. 8-10 (information about AIDS/HIV);  
Van Pelt Aff. 5 (gay and lesbian issues); Troyer Aff. 6-9 (safer sex information); Wallace  
Aff. 15-17 (controversial political issues).   
  
Finally, certain plaintiffs facilitate and encourage the responsible use of anonymous  
communications by computer users in order to protect their privacy. For example,  
Community ConneXion is an Internet Service Provider that operates an "anonymous  
remailer," which enables any Internet user to send particular messages anonymously over  
the Internet. Parekh Aff. 12-19. Community ConneXion also operates a service known as  
the Anonymizer, which enables any Internet user to browse and to retrieve documents  
from the Internet anonymously. Parekh Aff. 20- 26. Plaintiff Electronic Frontier  
Foundation encourages the responsible use of anonymous remailers to protect their  
members' privacy, and provides links to anonymous remailers available on the Internet  
for use by the public. Steele Aff. 9. Similarly, Electronic Frontiers Georgia plans to offer  
an anonymous remailer for public use from its Internet domain in Georgia. Costner Aff.  
13.   
  
The Use of Trade Names and Logos Online  
  
Plaintiffs and other online users also make use of "trade name[s], registered trademark[s],  
logo[s], legal or official seal[s], or copyrighted symbol[s]" in their online expression, and  
are fearful that their legitimate and constitutionally protected use of these names and  
logos are now prohibited by the Act. Several of the plaintiffs publish web pages that use  
the trade names, symbols or logos of others to refer or to provide links on the World  
Wide Web to the organizations whose trade names, logos, or symbols they use. Plaintiffs  
Leebow, Nadri, Riley, Troyer, and Wallace, for example, all use names, logos or symbols  
in this way to direct their users to other web pages on the Internet. Leebow Aff. 7-8A;  
Nadri Aff. 3-7; Riley Aff. 3-6; Troyer Aff. 2-3, 10-11; Wallace Aff. 8, 18-19. Some of the  
plaintiffs -- for example, Mitchell Kaye and Electronic Frontiers Georgia -- use the seals  
or symbols of Georgia or the United States as a part of their political and educational  
speech published over the World Wide Web. Kaye Aff. 4-11; Costner Aff. 8-11. All of  
these plaintiffs are concerned that their use of these trade names, logos, or symbols is  
now prohibited by the Act, and plaintiff Nadri has removed certain logos and images  
from her web page for fear of prosecution under the law. Costner Aff. 12; Kaye Aff. 12- 
17; Leebow Aff. 15; Nadri Aff. 5-7; Riley Aff. 4 & 6; Troyer Aff. 11; Wallace Aff. 19.  
Similarly, the AIDS Survival Project seeks to publish a web page using trade names to  
provide links to other web sites with information on AIDS and HIV, but has been  
deterred from doing so for fear that such links will violate the Act. Graham Aff. 11.   
  
ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITIES  
  
Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Act because it is  
an unconstitutional restriction upon the right to free expression over computer networks.  
A preliminary injunction is appropriate when the movant establishes: "(1) a substantial  
likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the  
injunction [is] not granted; (3) that the threatened injury to the plaintiff[s] outweighs the  
harm an injunction may cause the defendant[s]; and (4) that granting the injunction would  
not disserve the public interest." Teper v. Miller, 82 F.3d 989, 992-93 n.3 (11th Cir.  
1996). Plaintiffs satisfy each of these requirements.   
  
I. PLAINTIFFS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE  
MERITS   
  
The Act is facially unconstitutional for at least four reasons. First, the Act prohibits  
anonymous expression over computer networks, in violation of the rights of free  
expression, association and privacy protected by the United States and Georgia  
Constitutions. Second, the Act is substantially overbroad. Third, the Act is impermissibly  
vague. Finally, the Act violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution  
because it regulates commerce occurring wholly outside the borders of the State of  
Georgia.   
  
A. The Act Restricts Anonymous Speech In Violation of Plaintiffs' Constitutional Rights   
  
The Act is an unconstitutional content-based restriction on plaintiffs and other online  
users' rights of free expression, association and privacy. These fundamental civil liberties  
are at least as important in cyberspace as they are in traditional contexts. "The Internet is  
a far more speech-enhancing medium than print, the village green, or the mails." ACLU  
v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824, 882 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (Dalzell, J.). "As the most participatory  
form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from  
governmental intrusion." Id. at 883.   
  
1. The Act's Restriction on the Use of Pseudonyms, Pen Names & Screen Names  
Unconstitutionally Prohibits Protected Expression   
  
The right to speak and publish anonymously is a fundamental right that has its roots in a  
long tradition that dates to the very founding of democracy in this country. As one  
commentator has noted, "At the time the first amendment was adopted, the device of  
anonymous political authorship was well known, and utilized by many of the founding  
fathers." "The Right to Anonymity," 70 Yale L.J. 1084, 1085 (1961). The Federalist  
Papers, published during the original constitutional debates, were published  
anonymously. Thomas Paine wrote the famous pamphlet "Common Sense" under a  
pseudonym. Just last year, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the long- recognized  
constitutional right to anonymity in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 115 S.Ct. 1511  
(1995) (striking down Ohio statute prohibiting anonymous distribution of campaign  
literature). The Court observed that "'[a]nonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and  
even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind.... Persecuted  
groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize  
oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all.'" Id. at 1516 (quoting  
Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, 64 (1960) (declaring unconstitutional a California  
ordinance that prohibited the distribution of anonymous handbills))(citations  
omitted).The right to anonymity is also protected by various provisions of the Georgia  
Constitution. See Ga. Const. Art. 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, & 9. See also Multimedia WMAZ, Inc. v.  
Kubach, 212 Ga. App. 707, 443 S.E.2d 491 (1994) (right of privacy under Georgia law  
protected AIDS patient's right to appear anonymously and with identity disguised on  
local television show).   
  
The Court has explained that a law prohibiting anonymity is a content-based regulation  
because "the identity of the speaker is no different from other components of the  
document's content that the author is free to include or exclude." 115 S. Ct. at 1519.  
Moreover, "content-based regulations are presumptively invalid." R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505  
U.S. 377, 382 (1992) (emphasis supplied). The government may regulate the content of  
protected speech only to promote a "compelling interest" and only "if it chooses the least  
restrictive means to further the articulated interest." Sable Communications of California,  
Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). Thus, the Court has consistently held that  
prohibitions against anonymous speech are subject to "'exacting scrutiny'" and can be  
upheld "only if . . . narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest." 115 S. Ct. at  
1519 (emphasis supplied).   
  
The Supreme Court struck down statutes prohibiting anonymous expression in both  
McIntyre and Talley, supra, because the statutes at issue in both of those cases failed this  
exacting level of scrutiny. See McIntyre, 115 S.Ct. at 1524; Talley, 362 U.S. at 65. As the  
McIntyre Court observed, neither the "interest in preventing fraudulent and libelous  
statements" nor the "interest in providing the electorate with relevant information" was  
"sufficiently compelling to justify the anonymous speech ban," particularly because the  
restriction captured within its net expression that was not false or misleading. Id. at 1519- 
22. In the absence of a compelling interest, the Talley Court noted that "[t]here can be no  
doubt that . . . an identification requirement would tend to restrict freedom to distribute  
information and thereby freedom of expression." 362 U.S. at 64.   
  
Like the statutes invalidated in McIntyre and Talley, the prohibition in the Georgia Act  
encompassing anonymous online communications is an invalid content-based restriction  
upon speech that cannot withstand strict scrutiny. When First Amendment rights are at  
stake, courts must make an independent inquiry to assess whether the record supports the  
government's asserted interests. Sable, 492 U.S. at 129; Landmark Comm., Inc. v.  
Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 843 (1978). The Georgia legislature identified no compelling  
interest requiring its passage. Even assuming that the "false names" prohibition was  
intended to address a perceived problem of online fraud or misrepresentation, the  
prohibition is a blunderbuss attack on speech and not in any sense narrowly tailored to  
achieve its ends. The prohibition applies regardless of whether a speaker has any intent to  
deceive and regardless of whether any actual deception occurs. The criminal restriction  
therefore applies even when -- as in the case of all of the plaintiffs in this case -- online  
pseudonyms are used not to deceive but to protect privacy (see Nadri Aff. 8- 9; Riley Aff.  
7; Costner Aff. 14; Steel Aff. 11), or as creative expression (see Leebow Aff. 13), or as "a  
shield from the tyranny of the majority, . . . to protect unpopular individuals from  
retaliation -- and their ideas from suppression -- at the hand of an intolerant society." 115  
S.Ct. at 1524. See Graham Aff. 7- 8(AIDS Survival Project); Lyle-Wilson Aff. 6 (Atlanta  
Freethought Society); Van Pelt Aff. 5 (Atlanta Veterans Alliance).   
  
Second, as in McIntyre, Georgia has numerous less restrictive means to address  
intentional fraud and misrepresentation, in the form of a variety of specific criminal and  
civil sanctions under Georgia law. See, e.g., O.C.G.A. 16- 8-3 (1996)(theft by deception);  
O.C.G.A. 16-9-93(a)(2) (1996) (computer theft by deception); O.C.G.A. 10-1-453 (1994)  
(unauthorized and deceitful use of name or seal of another); O.C.G.A. 10-1-393 (Supp.  
1996) (unfair and deceptive consumer trade practices); Georgia-Pacific Corp. v.  
Lieberam, 959 F.2d 901, 907 (11th Cir. 1992) (common law action for fraud). The Act's  
sweeping prohibition of all anonymous expression over computer networks therefore is  
not narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling state purpose, and the Act is an  
unconstitutional restriction upon speech.   
  
2. The Prohibition of the Use of Pseudonyms, Pen Names & Other Anonymous Online  
Speech Unconstitutionally Violates The Plaintiffs' Association and Privacy Rights   
  
In addition to violating their rights to free expression, the Act's prohibition against the use  
of online pseudonyms violates the right of the plaintiffs and their members to associate  
with others over computer networks while protecting their anonymity. The prohibition of  
the use of pseudonyms in online communications effectively prohibits online users,  
including members of plaintiffs ACLU of Georgia, Electronic Frontiers Georgia,  
Electronic Frontiers Foundation, AIDS Survival Project, Atlanta Veterans Alliance, and  
Atlanta Freethought Society, from associating in discussion or chat groups online without  
publicly disclosing their identities to any other user on the network. It is therefore an even  
broader disclosure requirement than the statutes that required organizations to disclose  
their membership lists to the government, a practice the Supreme Court has repeatedly  
invalidated as an unconstitutional intrusion into the protected right of free association.  
See, e.g., Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 527 (1960) (invalidating Little Rock  
ordinance requiring organizations to provide lists identifying their members and  
contributors); NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 466 (1958) (reversing court order  
requiring NAACP to disclose Alabama membership list).   
  
3. The Act Violates Plaintiffs' Right to Receive Information Anonymously   
  
Similarly, the Act prohibits anonymity even to access information online. Just as an  
online user may "falsely identify" himself under the Act when sending messages or  
information anonymously or using a pseudonym, an online user may "falsely identify"  
himself when searching for and retrieving information anonymously.   
  
Thus, the Act is analogous to the federal statute invalidated in Lamont v. Postmaster  
General, 381 U.S. 301 (1965), which prohibited anonymous access by traditional mail to  
communist political materials. The statute required recipients of such material  
affirmatively to request receipt by delivering a reply card to the post office, which the  
post office used to maintain a list of recipients of such material. See 381 U.S. at 307.  
Similarly, the Georgia Act would require people to identify themselves publicly, in a  
manner which would make this information available to the government and others,  
before they could receive information to which they are constitutionally entitled.  
Members of plaintiff Atlanta Veterans Alliance would have to identify themselves in  
order to retrieve information about gay and lesbian issues. Users of the Safer Sex Page,  
and members of the AIDS Survival Project, would have to identify themselves in order to  
gain access to potentially life-saving information. Such a requirement would chill  
protected expression and is clearly unconstitutional.   
  
4. The Broad Restriction On The Use of Trade Names, Logos, Etc., Unconstitutionally  
Prohibits Protected Expression   
  
The Act's broad restriction upon the use of trade names, logos, etc., in online  
communications also tramples upon the First Amendment. Like the "false name"  
prohibition, the restriction on the use of trade names and logos is a content-based  
restriction on speech and cannot withstand the strict scrutiny that applies to such  
restrictions.   
  
First, the restriction is again a shotgun assault on speech. The restriction is not confined  
to commercial use of trade names logos, etc., nor does the Act require intent to deceive or  
any actual deception. The potential breadth of this restriction is magnified by the new  
technological context of the Internet, because at least one commentator has already  
argued that the unique "linking" feature of the Web may "falsely imply" official  
sponsorship or permission to unsophisticated users simply because the links provide  
automatic connections between web pages. See Stuart D. Levi, Web-Site Hypertext Links  
Raise Issues of Control, Nat'l L.J., Aug. 12, 1996, at B12 (asserting that the mere link  
itself combined with the use of a distinctive logo to identify it "falsely impl[ies] formal  
relationships between the sites.").   
  
The Act's language is so broad, therefore, that it appears to prohibit even clearly  
noncommercial use of names and logos to provide links in web pages in the absence of  
express permission from the corporations, organizations, or agencies to whom the links  
lead. Many of the plaintiffs use trade names or logos in this manner to create links for  
noncommercial purposes, and in many cases their use of these trade names or logos  
occurs in the context of political speech, religious speech, news and commentary, and  
other public interest and educational expression. See, e.g., Troyer Aff. 3-6, 10-11; Riley  
Aff. 4A-6; Wallace Aff. 8-11, 18-19; Nelson Aff. 3-5, 7-8; Costner Aff. 9-12; Steele Aff.  
13; Leebow Aff. 5-10; Nadri Aff. 6-7. It would be practically impossible for plaintiffs  
and other web publishers to obtain permission for all the links in their web sites, and  
eliminating links would destroy the most useful and acclaimed feature of the World Wide  
Web.   
  
That this broad restriction prohibits expression clearly protected by the First Amendment  
is perhaps best illustrated by the case of the web page published by plaintiff Mitchell  
Kaye and other members of the Conservative Policy Caucus of the Georgia House of  
Representatives. See Kaye Aff. 4-11. This web page provides extensive information of  
public interest on the activities of the Georgia House of Representatives and reflects core  
protected political speech. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976) ("The First  
Amendment affords the broadest protection to . . . political expression."). The web page  
has also been the subject of considerable controversy since its creation. It contains  
repeated disclaimers that it is not an official publication of the Georgia House of  
Representatives, but uses the Georgia State Seal and other symbols and has --  
notwithstanding the disclaimers -- been misidentified by several third party computer  
network users as the "official" page of this body. Kaye Aff. 11-12, 16.Rep. Kaye has tried  
to correct these errors promptly whenever he learns of them. Kaye Aff. 16.  
Representative Don Parsons, the original drafter of the bill that became the Act at issue in  
this case, stated during house debates on the bill and to the press that he believed the bill  
would apply to and prohibit Mitchell Kaye's web page publication. Kaye Aff. 15.   
  
While the State may have an interest in laws that legitimately secure intellectual property  
rights, the State may not suppress protected expression under the thin guise of protecting  
intellectual property. As one court noted, "It offends the Constitution . . . to invoke [a  
state intellectual property statute] as a basis for enjoining the noncommercial use of a  
trademark by a defendant engaged in a protected form of expression." L.L. Bean, Inc. v.  
Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 32 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1013 (1987)  
(refusing to apply Maine trademark anti-dilution statute to enjoin parody using  
defendant's trademark); see also Stop the Olympic Prison v. U.S.O.C., 489 F. Supp. 1112  
(S.D.N.Y. 1980) (federal statute protecting "Olympic" trademark could not  
constitutionally be used to enjoin use of the trademark in a political protest), cited with  
approval in San Francisco Arts & Athletics v. U.S.O.C., 483  U.S. 522, 536 n.14 (1987);  
Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S.  46 (1988) (First Amendment barred common law  
action against magazine for offensive parody using plaintiff's name and image).Similarly,  
Georgia may not defend the broad prohibitions of the Act by citing a need to prevent the  
misuse of official state symbols. A State cannot suppress protected expression through  
statutes that purport to prohibit the alleged misuse of official state symbols. See, e.g.,  
Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405 (1974) (Washington statute prohibiting certain uses  
of flag was unconstitutional as applied to student's display of flag upside down with  
peace symbol affixed to it). See also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989) (Texas  
statute prohibiting desecration of U.S. flag could not be used to suppress political  
expression involving flag-burning).   
  
It was precisely Congress' concerns about the interplay of the First Amendment and  
intellectual property rights that led it to limit expressly the scope of the new Federal  
Trademark Dilution Act. Congress made clear that the federal Act did not apply to the  
noncommercial "use" of trademarks, nor to use of such marks in news reporting or  
commentary, or fair use in comparative advertising. See 15 U.S.C. 1125(c)(4); H.R. No.  
104-374 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1031 & 1035 (explaining that  
these exemptions were included to "address[] legitimate First Amendment concerns  
espoused by the broadcasting industry and the media," and that the section was "designed  
to preclude the courts from enjoining speech that courts have recognized to be  
constitutionally protected."). The Act at issue in this case contains no such exemptions,  
and thus restricts protected expression.   
  
Moreover, assuming the purpose of this vague prohibition is to protect the intellectual  
property of others, there are already numerous other less restrictive civil and criminal  
remedies to achieve this end. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 1125 (federal remedy for trademark  
infringement); O.C.G.A. 10-1-450 et seq. (1994) (Georgia remedy for trademark and  
trade name infringement); O.C.G.A. 10-1-453 (1994) (unauthorized and deceitful use of  
name or seal); O.C.G.A. 10-1-393 (Supp. 1996) (unfair and deceptive consumer trade  
practices); O.C.G.A. 10-1-372 (1994) (deceptive trade practices); Jellibeans, Inc. v.  
Skating Clubs of Georgia, Inc., 716 F.2d 833, 837 & n. 6 (11th Cir. 1983) (common law  
action for unfair competition). If the purpose of the restriction is to prevent fraud, then the  
statutory and common law remedies discussed in section I-A-1, supra, are already  
available for that purpose.   
  
Thus, the Act's broad restriction upon the use of trade names, logos, etc. is not narrowly  
tailored to serve any compelling state interest, and is an unconstitutional content-based  
restriction upon protected expression.   
  
B. The Act Is Substantially Overbroad  
  
The Georgia Act is also substantially overbroad, and therefore facially unconstitutional,  
because it "sweeps protected activity within its proscription." M.S. News Co. V. Casado,  
721 F.2d 1281, 1287 (10th Cir. 1983) (citing Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S.  
205, 212-13 (1975); see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 114 (1972). In  
the First Amendment context, the overbreadth doctrine applies to invalidate statutes even  
where some applications of the statute are valid. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S.  
739, 745 (1987); National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d 1271,  
1280 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring) (citing numerous cases), aff'd, 115 S.  
Ct. 1003 (1995). The rule is "based on an appreciation that the very existence of some  
broadly written laws has the potential to chill the expression of [persons] not before the  
court." Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 (1992); see also  
Secretary of State of Maryland v. Munson, 467 U.S. 947 (1984); Broadrick v. Oklahoma,  
413 U.S. 602, 612 (1973).   
  
The Georgia Act is a classic example of a "substantially overbroad" law that was not  
written with anything like the precision required of statutes regulating speech. As  
discussed in section I-A, supra, the Act prohibits a wide range of constitutionally  
protected speech, including the use of pseudonyms and anonymity to avoid social  
ostracism, to prevent discrimination and harassment, and to protect privacy; and the use  
of trade names or logos in non-commercial educational speech, news and commentary,  
and even core political expression. Thus, even if the Georgia Act could constitutionally  
be applied to persons who intentionally "falsely identify" themselves in order to deceive  
or defraud the public, or to persons whose commercial use of trade names and logos  
creates a substantial likelihood of confusion or the dilution of a famous mark, the Act is  
unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine because it operates unconstitutionally for  
"a substantial category" of the speakers it covers (indeed, almost every online user is  
potentially in violation of the statute), Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better  
Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 634 (1980), and because it "criminalizes a substantial  
amount of constitutionally protected speech," City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 466  
(1987).   
  
In addition, the Act's broad sweep has already chilled protected expression -- the very  
vice the overbreadth doctrine was designed to prevent. Forsyth County, 112 S. Ct. at  
2401; Munson, 467 U.S. 947; Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 612. For example, the AIDS  
Survival Project has placed on hold its plans to publish a web page providing links to  
Internet resources on HIV and AIDS-related topics for fear of violating the statute.  
Graham Aff. 11. Similarly, Bonnie Nadri has altered the content of her web page for the  
same reason. Nadri Aff. 5. It is impossible to determine the extent to which this  
overbroad criminal statute may have chilled expression by the many thousands of other  
computer users potentially affected.   
  
C. The Act Is Unconstitutionally Vague  
  
O.C.G.A. 16-9-93.1 is also invalid because it fails to define clearly the conduct it renders  
criminal. "[T]he void-for- vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the  
criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what  
conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and  
discriminatory enforcement." Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). The  
policies underlying the vagueness doctrine apply with special force where, as here, the  
statute at issue restricts constitutionally protected expression:   
  
If the Government is going to intrude upon the sacred ground of the First Amendment  
and tell its citizens that their exercise of protected speech could land them in jail, the law  
imposing such a penalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only for the  
potential offender but also for the potential enforcer."   
  
ACLU v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824, 860 (E.D.Pa. 1996) (Buckwalter, J.) (enjoining  
enforcement of federal statute prohibiting "indecent" speech over computer networks).  
There are three basic policies underlying the vagueness doctrine, all of which are violated  
by the statute at issue in this case: (1) the Act does not give fair notice as to the scope of  
conduct it proscribes, (2) the Act provides wide leeway for arbitrary enforcement, and (3)  
the Act infringes upon and has already chilled the exercise of free expression by the  
plaintiffs. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. at 108-09.   
  
1. The "False Identification" Restriction Fails To Give Adequate Notice of What Conduct  
is Prohibited   
  
The Act makes it a crime to use names that "falsely identify" their user, but never defines  
the phrase "falsely identify" and provides no guidance or standards by which the phrase is  
to be defined. The Act, for example, contains no requirement of specific intent to deceive  
by the use of a false name, nor any requirement that actual deception be proved. This  
prohibition therefore fails to meet its constitutionally required burden of allowing  
"ordinary people [to] understand what conduct is prohibited." Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357.   
  
Specifically, as set forth in section I-A, supra, plaintiffs have no intent to deceive anyone  
by their anonymous communications, and in fact have many legitimate and important  
reasons for communicating anonymously. Yet plaintiffs cannot determine whether their  
anonymous or pseudonymous online communications are prohibited by the Act. E.g.,  
Costner Aff. 15-16; Graham Aff. 8; Kaye Aff. 18; Leebow Aff. 15; Lyle-Wilson Aff. 6;  
Mirken Aff. 10; Nadri Aff. 10; Nelson Aff. 11; Riley Aff. 8; Steele Aff. 12; Van Pelt Aff.  
6; Wallace Aff. 7. Do pseudonyms, screen names and pen names such as those used by  
the plaintiffs "falsely identify" their users? Does the user of an anonymous remailer or an  
anonymizer violate the Act because it "falsely identifies" the user? Does the Act require  
everyone communicating online to use their full legal names (a requirement that is not  
technically feasible on many networks) or to use names from which their true identities  
can be ascertained? The Act provides no answers to these questions and is therefore void  
for vagueness because it fails to give a "person of ordinary intelligence" notice as to the  
scope of the conduct it prohibits. Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.   
  
2. The Restriction on the Use Of Trade Names, Logos, etc., Fails To Give Adequate  
Notice of What Conduct is Prohibited   
  
Similarly, the Act provides no guidance as to the meanings of the terms "use" or "falsely  
imply" in its restriction on the use of trade names and logos. This distinguishes the Act  
from other statutory protections for trademarks and similar intellectual property under  
Georgia or federal law, which expressly limit the definition of "use" to "use" in a  
commercial context. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 1125 (federal trademark infringement);  
O.C.G.A. 10-1- 440(b) (1994) (defining "use" for purposes of Georgia trademark and  
trade name infringement); O.C.G.A. 10-1-450 (1994) (Georgia trademark & trade name  
infringement); O.C.G.A. 10-1-453 (1994) (unauthorized and deceitful use of name or  
seal). Similarly, these other protections of intellectual property are typically limited to  
"use" of a mark that creates a substantial likelihood of confusion as to origin of products  
or services, or that creates a risk of dilution of a famous mark. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 1125;  
O.C.G.A. 10-1-450 (1994). In contrast, the only limitation upon the "use" proscribed by  
this Georgia statutes is that the "use" must "falsely imply" that permission has been  
obtained to use the name or symbol.   
  
This limitation provides little if any guidance given the unique "linking" feature of the  
Web."In statutes that break into relatively new areas, such as this one, the need for  
definition of terms is greater, because even commonly understood terms may have  
different connotations or parameters in this new context." Reno, 929 F. Supp. at 865  
(Buckwalter, J.) (striking down federal statute restricting "indecent" expression over  
computer networks). As noted above, at least one commentator has already argued that  
the mere use of a logo to create a link is sufficient to "falsely imply formal relationship  
between the sites." Levi, supra, at B12. Many of the plaintiffs in this case "use" trade  
names or logos in this way in their protected expression, with no intention whatsoever to  
deceive or mislead anyone. See, e.g., Costner Aff. 12; Leebow Aff. 13; Nadri Aff. 5;  
Riley Aff. 4&6; Steele Aff. 13; Troyer Aff. 10-11; Wallace Aff. 18-19. Is this alone  
sufficient to violate the law? The Act provides no answer to this question.   
  
3. . The Act's Failure to Define A "Point of Access To Electronic Information" Renders It  
Impermissibly Vague   
  
Moreover, the Act is vaguer still because it applies not just to communications over  
computer networks but also to the transmission of "any data . . . over the transmission  
facilities or through the network facilities of a local telephone network for the purpose of  
. . . exchanging data with . . . [any] point of access to electronic information." O.C.G.A.  
16-9-93.1 (1996) (emphasis supplied). There is no definition of the term "point of access  
to electronic information," a phrase so vague it could include not just any computer or  
modem, but also every telephone, fax machine, answering machine, voicemail system,  
pager, and a whole host of other similar electronic devices that might be connected to  
telephone network facilities. Does the Act therefore prohibit anonymity and restrict the  
use of trade names in fax and telephone communications? Does it prohibit anonymity in  
communications with voicemail, answering machines, and pagers? Again, the Act  
provides no answer to these questions.   
  
Persons of ordinary intelligence therefore cannot determine from this Act whether their  
conduct is prohibited, and the statute is impermissibly vague.   
  
4. The Vague Restrictions In The Act Create A Risk of Arbitrary And Discriminatory  
Enforcement   
  
The Act is void not only because it fails to give potential defendants notice of what  
conduct is prohibited, but equally importantly because it fails to give that notice to  
potential enforcers of the law. As Chief Judge Sloviter of the Third Circuit wrote of the  
void-for-vagueness doctrine,   
  
[T]he bottom line is that the First Amendment should not be interpreted to require us to  
entrust the protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors. Prosecutors come and go.  
Even federal judges are limited to life tenure. The First Amendment remains to give  
protection to future generations as well.   
  
ACLU v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. at 857. See, e.g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358  
(1983) (striking down California statute that required loiterers to provide "credible and  
reliable" identification when requested by the police because it "vest[ed] virtually  
complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect ha[d]  
satisfied the statute."). See also Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 576 (1974) ("Where  
inherently vague statutory language permits such selective law enforcement, there is a  
denial of due process.").   
  
Because the Act fails to provide adequate guidelines for law enforcement officials, it  
gives local prosecutors and police wide leeway for selective prosecution of speech by  
individuals and organizations -- like some of the plaintiffs in this case -- who express  
minority or potentially unpopular social, political, or religious views. See, e.g., Graham  
Aff. 7-8 (information on AIDS/HIV); Lyle-Wilson Aff. 5-6 (separation of church and  
state); Wallace Aff. 10-14; (controversial political views); Van Pelt Aff. 3&5 (gay  
veterans); Kaye Aff. 3-15 (members of minority party in Georgia House of  
Representatives). This possibility for selective enforcement renders the Act  
unconstitutional.   
  
5. The Statute's Vagueness Is Particularly Impermissible Because It Chills Protected  
Expression   
  
Finally, the vagueness doctrine applies with particular rigor in this case because the Act is  
a regulation of protected expression. "If . . . the law interferes with the right of free  
speech or association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply." Village of Hoffman  
Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982) (footnote  
omitted); Grayned, 408 U.S. at 109 ("Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to  
'"steer far wider of the unlawful zone" . . . than if the boundaries of forbidden areas were  
clearly marked.'"); Goguen, 415 U.S. at 573; Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358. As discussed in  
section I-B, supra, the Act at issue in this case has indeed "'operate[d] to inhibit the  
exercise of [plaintiffs' First Amendment] freedoms,'" Grayned, 408 U.S. at 109, by  
deterring valuable and protected expression from the online medium. E.g., Nadri Aff. 5;  
Graham Aff. 11. For all these reasons, the Act's restrictions are impermissibly vague and  
unconstitutional.   
  
D. The Act Violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution   
  
Finally, the Act violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (U.S.  
Const, Art. I, 8, cl. 3)The Supreme Court has long recognized that the commerce clause  
encompasses an implicit or "dormant" limitation on the authority of the States to enact  
legislation affecting interstate commerce. Healy, 491 U.S. at 326 n.1; Hughes v.  
Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 326 and n. 2 (1979). because the Act restricts online  
communications occurring entirely outside the State of Georgia. See Healy v. Beer  
Institute, 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989) (reaffirming that the "'Commerce Clause . . .  
precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of  
the State's borders'") (quoting Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 642-43 (1982)).   
  
1. The Act Regulates Commerce Occurring Wholly Outside the Borders of the State of  
Georgia   
  
The Georgia Act's venue provision authorizes prosecutions in any Georgia county "from  
which, to which, or through which any use of a computer or computer network was  
made." O.C.G.A. 16-9-94(4) (1996). Viewed in context, this means the Act's restrictions  
extend to a wide range of communications that occur entirely outside this State.   
  
First, the Act restricts virtually all online communications that take place around the  
world in public discussion groups and chat rooms on the Internet, commercial online  
services and many BBSs, because public messages posted to these public fora from  
anywhere in the world can be accessed by users in Georgia. Steele Aff. 26. If, for  
example, a member of plaintiff EFF in California posts a message to an Internet  
discussion group using a pseudonym, that message may be accessed and read by a reader  
in Georgia. The posting of this message in California, therefore, may subject the  
California author to prosecution in Georgia under the Act. Moreover, online technology  
provides no means for the poster to determine whether anyone from Georgia will actually  
read his message. Thus, to avoid the risk of prosecution, the author of the message must  
refrain from using a pseudonym when he posts to the discussion group -- regardless of  
whether anyone in Georgia ever actually reads any of his messages.   
  
Second, the Act affects direct communications between persons entirely outside of  
Georgia. That is because any message sent over the Internet can travel any number of  
different paths to get to its destination. The sender of a message cannot control the route  
it takes, and any message sent over the Internet may pass through the wires of some  
county in Georgia. Steele Aff. 17. For example, if plaintiff Jonathan Wallace, who resides  
in New York, uses his pseudonym to send an e-mail message to a California resident, his  
message could travel through the state of Georgia and place him at risk of prosecution  
under the Act. Thus, a nonresident user like plaintiff Wallace cannot use a pseudonym in  
any online messages sent over the Internet without exposing himself to a risk of  
prosecution under the Act -- even if his messages are sent to other nonresidents of  
Georgia.   
  
Third, the Act affects the ability of any online user, regardless of whether they reside in  
Georgia, to access the World Wide Web anonymously. It is, for all practical purposes,  
impossible to determine with specificity the geographic location of the vast majority of  
sites on the World Wide Web. Every web site is identified only by an address: e.g., the  
Safer Sex Page is located at http://www.safersex.org; EFF's web site is located at  
http://www.eff.org; one of plaintiff Riley's web sites is located at  
http://www.worship.com; and plaintiff EFGA's web site is located at  
http://www.efga.org. Nothing in these addresses reveals the geographic location of the  
sites, two of which are maintained in Georgia and two of which are maintained outside  
this state. Troyer Aff. 1; Steele Aff. 2-4; Riley Aff. 2&4A; Costner Aff. 8. Thus, if a  
member of EFF who resides in California accesses any web site like these anonymously,  
he places himself at risk of prosecution under the Act if the web site he accesses turns out  
to be located in Georgia. To avoid the risk, he must refrain from anonymous access to any  
web page on the World Wide Web, regardless of whether any web site he actually visits  
is located in Georgia.   
  
Finally, the Act affects the ability of any online user to publish a web page on the Web,  
regardless of whether the web site he publishes is located in Georgia. There is no way for  
a web publisher to prevent Internet users from Georgia from accessing web sites  
published on the Internet. Thus, any web publisher anywhere in the world -- including all  
of the nonresident web publishers who are plaintiffs in this case -- must comply with the  
restrictions imposed by the Georgia statute, or risk prosecution under the Act.   
  
2. The Act Is Therefore Per Se Invalid as a Direct Regulation of Interstate Commerce   
  
Where, like the Georgia Act, a state statute directly regulates interstate commerce, the  
Supreme Court has generally "struck down the statute without further inquiry." Brown- 
Forman Distiller's Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573, 579 (1986); see  
also Healy, 491 U.S. at 336; Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 643 (1982); Baldwin v.  
G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 521 (1935). That is the appropriate result in this case,  
because the statute's broad venue provision makes clear that it applies even to interstate  
communications that simply pass through Georgia, and the law has the practical effect of  
regulating a substantial amount of activity occurring entirely outside the State.   
  
3. Alternatively, The Act Is Invalid Because the Burdens It Imposes Upon Interstate  
Commerce Exceed Any Local Benefit   
  
Even if the statute were not a per se violation of the Commerce Clause, however, the law  
would still be an invalid state regulation because the burdens it imposes upon interstate  
commerce clearly exceed any local benefits. Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 579; Pike v.  
Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). As set forth above, the Georgia Act affects  
a wide range of out-of-state and protected communications which Georgia clearly has no  
legitimate interest in regulating. Moreover, the Act's restrictions create a risk of  
inconsistent state regulations. If each of the fifty states imposed its own different  
regulations on the use of trade names, logos, etc. over computer networks, every web site  
operator would be subject to conflicting standards because a web site is accessible from  
any state in the nation. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of Am., 481 U.S. 69, 88 (1987);  
Healy, 491 U.S. at 339-40. The practical effect of the combination of fifty different  
conflicting state laws regulating the Internet would "create just the kind of competing and  
interlocking local economic regulation that the Commerce Clause was meant to  
preclude." Healy, 491 U.S. at 337.   
  
Arguably, therefore, the dormant Commerce Clause precludes the entire field of online  
communications from state regulation because "lack of national uniformity would impede  
the flow of interstate goods." Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 128  
(1978); Wabash St. L & P. Ry. Co. v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886) (railroad rates exempt  
from state regulation); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945) (length of  
train cars exempt from state regulation). In any case, Georgia's attempt to regulate this  
interstate (and international) telecommunications system is an invalid exercise of State  
power.   
  
II. A SUBSTANTIAL THREAT OF IRREPARABLE INJURY EXISTS IF THE  
INJUNCTION IS NOT GRANTED   
  
Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the Act's deprivation of their due process  
rights and rights of free expression, association and privacy. As the Supreme Court has  
stated, "The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,  
unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)  
(affirming order directing district court to enter preliminary injunctive relief where "First  
Amendment interests were either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief  
was sought"). See also Reno, 929 F.Supp. at 851 ("Subjecting speakers to criminal  
penalties for speech that is constitutionally protected in itself raises the spectre of  
irreparable harm.").   
  
As set forth above, plaintiffs all use the online medium to transmit data using  
pseudonyms or using trade names or logos in ways that fall within the vague and  
overbroad sweep of the Act. The Act's passage has already led some of the plaintiffs to  
self- censor their speech, and forces all plaintiffs to place themselves in jeopardy of  
criminal prosecution as the price of exercising their constitutional rights. Thus, the statute  
"unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury" under the controlling law. E.g., Elrod, 427  
U.S. at 373.   
  
III. THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS WEIGHS IN PLAINTIFFS' FAVOR   
  
If the Act is not enjoined, plaintiffs, their members, and other online users will be forced  
to choose between censoring their own protected expression over computer networks or  
placing themselves at the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of this vague  
law according to the whim of local prosecutors, police and other enforcement authorities.  
The protected speech at issue includes material with substantial educational, political,  
medical, artistic and social value. Some of the speech that has already been self-censored  
-- the information that plaintiff AIDS Survival Project intended to publish on its planned  
web page -- could literally save the lives of those who are or may be affected by this  
disease. By contrast, defendants could suffer no injury as a result of an injunction barring  
enforcement of this unconstitutional law.   
  
IV. A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WOULD PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST   
  
Finally, for all the reasons set forth above, the entry of a preliminary injunction would  
promote, not disserve, the public interest. As the court observed in Reno, "[n]o long  
string of citations is necessary to find that the public interest weighs in favor of having  
access to a free flow of constitutionally protected speech." 929 F. Supp. at 851 (Sloviter,  
Chief Circuit Judge); see Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458  
(1994).   
  
CONCLUSION  
  
For the foregoing reasons plaintiffs urge the Court to grant their Motion for Preliminary  
Injunction.

By:  Representative Parsons of the 40th 
 
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED 
 
AN ACT 
 
To amend Article 6 of Chapter 9 of Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, 
known as the "Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act," so as to provide that it shall 
be unlawful for any person or organization knowingly to transmit certain misleading data 
through a computer or telephone network for the purpose of setting up, maintaining, 
operating, or exchanging data with an electronic mailbox, home page, or any other 
electronic information storage bank; to provide for a penalty; to provide that civil actions 
are allowed; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.  
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:  
 
SECTION 1. 
 
Article 6 of Chapter 9 of Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, known as 
the "Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act," is amended by adding, following Code 
Section 16-9-93, a new Code Section 16-9-93.1 to read as follows:  
 
"16-9-93.1. 
 
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, any organization, or any representative of any 
organization knowingly to transmit any data through a computer network or over the 
transmission facilities or through the network facilities of a local telephone network for 
the purpose of setting up, maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with an  electronic 
mailbox, home page, or any other electronic  information storage bank or point of access 
to electronic information if such data uses any individual name, trade name, registered 
trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol to falsely identify the 
person, organization, or representative transmitting such data or which would falsely state 
or imply that such person, organization, or representative has permission or is legally 
authorized to use such trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or 
copyrighted symbol for such purpose when such permission or authorization has not been 
obtained; provided, however, that no telecommunications company or Internet access 
provider shall violate this Code section solely as a result of carrying or transmitting such 
data for its customers.  
 
(b) Any person violating subsection (a) of this Code section shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor.  
 
(c) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to limit an aggrieved party's right to 
pursue a civil action for equitable or monetary relief, or both, for actions which violate 
this Code section."  
 
SECTION 2. 
 
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a member of the General Assembly from using

<P>America Online filed suit June 14, 1996 against Cyber Promotions, who allegedly 
advertised an "AOL CLASSIFIED CO-OP SERVICE" and used bogus "aol.com" e-mail 
addresses to create the false impression that they were affiliated with AOL. AOL claims 
that Cyber Promotions began to deluge "customers with millions of unsolicited 
commercial e-mail messages, infuriating AOL members, resulting in member 
cancellations and imposing increased hardware and software expense on AOL." When 
AOL took steps to prevent Cyber from continuing this course of conduct, Cyber initiated 
litigation, claiming that it had a First Amendment right to conduct its business by means 
of AOL's proprietary online service. </P>

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA

v. 
 
CYBER PROMOTIONS, INC., 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
Civ. Action No. 96-462

INFRINGEMENT, SERVICE MARK AND TRADE NAME DILUTION, FALSE 
DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN, FALSE ADVERTISING, UNFAIR COMPETITION, 
MISAPPROPRIATION, CONVERSION, UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND 
VIOLATIONS OF THE VIRGINIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, THE 
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT, THE COMPUTER FRAUD 
AND ABUSE ACT, AND THE VIRGINIA COMPUTER CRIMES ACT 
JURISDICTION  
 
1. This is an action for service mark and trade name infringement, service mark and trade 
name dilution, false designation of origin, false advertising, violation of the Virginia 
Consumer Protection Act, other acts of unfair competition, misappropriation, conversion 
and unjust enrichment; and for violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and the Virginia Computer Crimes Act arising under 
the statutes of the United States (Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1051 et. seq., 
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, and 18 U.S.C. Secs. 2701 et. seq.), the statutory law of the State of 
Virginia (Va. Code Secs. 18.2-152.2 et. seq., and Secs. 59.1-196 et seq.), and the 
common law.  
 
2. This court has jurisdiction over the subject matter under Sec. 39 of the Trademark Act 
of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1121; the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1331, 1332, 1338, and 
1367; and the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction. The amount in controversy exceeds 
the sum or value of $50,000, exclusive of interest or costs, and is between citizens of 
different states. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 
1391(b) in that a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims 
occurred in and a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated in 
this judicial district.  
 
 
THE PARTIES 
 
3. Plaintiff America Online, Inc. ("AOL"), is a corporation organized and existing under 
the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 8619 Westwood 
Center Drive, Vienna, Virginia 22181.  
 
4. Upon information and belief, Defendant Cyber Promotions, Inc. ("Cyber") is a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, with its principal place of business at 1255 Passmore Street, 1st Floor, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111. Cyber is doing business in and has caused tortious 
injury in the Commonwealth of Virginia within this judicial district.  
 
 
THE INTERNET 
 
5. The acts complained of herein were committed by Cyber through use of the Internet. 
Often called the"Information Superhighway", the Internet is a complex communications 
network that links private and public computer networks, systems and individuals. It 
consists of computers and computer databases connected primarily through telephone 
lines, fiber optic cables and high speed dedicated leased lines. Some of the components of 
the Internet are owned by governmental organizations. However, AOL is a proprietary, 
content based online service. It owns computers and other devices which enable its 
customers to obtain various services including Internet access services.  
 
6. In many ways, the Internet resembles our highway transportation system. The phone 
lines are similar to highways over which goods are transferred from one location to 
another and the computer domain sites such as those operated by AOL are similar to 
privately owned warehouses in which goods are stored and from which they are 
disseminated to various destinations.  
 
7. The Internet has become one of the most significant technological creations of this 
century occupying a position that is potentially more important than telephones or 
televisions among communications media. Once connected to the Internet, users can 
obtain vast amounts of digitized data, including texts, audio, graphics and videos from 
sources ranging from the archives of large government and academic institutions to any 
of the Internet's millions of individual users.  
 
8. Among the economic benefits provided by the Internet are new techniques for 
marketing and selling goods and services. Many responsible businesses such as AOL 
have invested vast sums of money in the computers and communications systems needed 
to facilitate such transactions. AOL and others seek to recoup their investment by 
charging fees to those who wish to gain access to their systems. Unfortunately, the 
Internet also has provided irresistible opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and 
corporations, such as Cyber and its founder. Instead of investing in its own equipment, 
Cyber has used the systems of others to gain access to the Internet and to use it as a tool 
to perpetrate fraud, to misappropriate intellectual property, to engage in unfair 
competition, to invade the privacy of others, and to reap where it has not sown.  
 
 
FACTS PERTAINING TO CYBER'S ACTS OF UNFAIR COMPETITION  
 
9. AOL is the owner of numerous trademarks, service marks, and trade names, including 
the well known trade names and service marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL and 
"aol.com". The name and mark AOL is often used as a short hand expression for the mark 
AMERICA ONLINE. Similarly, the trade name, mark and domain name "aol.com" is 
widely recognized as a short hand expression for AMERICA ONLINE.  
 
10. Long prior to the acts complained of herein, and at least as early as 1989, AOL 
adopted and began using the names and marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL, and 
"aol.com" in connection with a variety of online computer services. Since that time, AOL 
has used these names and marks continuously and extensively in interstate commerce and 
in the Commonwealth of Virginia, in connection with the advertising and sale of online 
and Internet access services.  
 
11. AOL's exclusive right to use the service marks and trade names AMERICA ONLINE 
and AOL is evidenced by the fact that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has 
issued federal registrations for these marks: Registration No. 1,618,148, issued October 
16, 1990, and Registration No. 1,977,731 issued June 4, 1996, respectively. Both of these 
registrations are in full force and effect, unrevoked, and uncancelled and the 1990 
registration is incontestable. In addition, the registrations provide prima facie and 
conclusive evidence of the validity and subsistence of the marks; AOL's ownership of and 
exclusive right to use the marks in commerce without restriction or limitation; and 
constructive notice of AOL's ownership pursuant to Sections 7, 22 and 33 of the 
Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1057, 1072 and 1115. Copies of the registrations 
are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  
 
12. AOL has invested substantial sums of money in developing and marketing the world's 
largest and most successful computer online network, which provides online access to a 
wide variety of information and services. AOL customers may use their personal 
computers to gain access to numerous publications including current magazines, 
newspapers, and reference works. In addition, AOL's online service contains material 
relating to such topics as entertainment, news, sports, finance, computers, weather, travel, 
education, games, and software. Using their AOL accounts, subscribers may make 
purchases of a wide variety of products and services, secure travel reservations, place 
classified ads, meet new people, and communicate by electronic mail ("e-mail") with 
AOL subscribers and other persons with Internet addresses residing throughout the world.  
 
13. At present there are more than 6,000,000 subscribers to AOL's online service. each of 
which is authorized to use the AOL system for sending and receiving e-mail so long as 
they abide by the Terms of Service and Rules of the Road promulgated by AOL.  
 
14. The names and marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL and "aol.com" have been and 
continue to be widely publicized through substantial advertising in the State of Virginia 
and throughout the United States. Many millions of dollars have been spent in connection 
with such advertising which has been disseminated through network and cable television 
programs, radio broadcasts, and in print media including newspapers and periodicals. 
Sales of services under the names and marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL and "aol.com" 
have amounted to many millions of dollars. As a result, the general public has come to 
associate these names and marks with services of a high and uniform quality.  
 
15. Because of said substantial advertising expenditures and sales, AOL's names and 
marks have become well-known and famous among members of the purchasing public as 
distinctive indicators of the services offered by AOL.  
 
16. Notwithstanding AOL's prior use of and rights in its names and marks AMERICA 
ONLINE, AOL and "aol.com", Cyber has begun advertising and selling electronic 
advertising services through the Internet, within this judicial district and in interstate 
commerce under the names and marks AOL and "aol.com". In promoting its services, 
Cyber has falsely represented that it is affiliated with, sponsored by, approved by or 
endorsed by AOL. Among other things Cyber has transmitted messages containing 
claims such as "Our brand new...AOL CLASSIFIED CO-OP SERVICE!" These 
advertisements have been circulated by Cyber with a deliberate intent to deceive 
customers into believing that Cyber's services are sponsored, approved, endorsed or 
affiliated with AOL. Cyber has also included in its advertisements fraudulent Internet 
addresses containing AOL's well known service mark and domain name "aol.com". A 
sample advertisement used by Cyber is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  
 
17. Cyber's use of names and marks similar to those owned by AOL, for services 
identical to those offered by AOL or its related companies, is likely to cause and has 
caused confusion among prospective purchasers.  
 
18. Upon learning of Cyber's use of a confusingly similar name and mark, AOL contacted 
Cyber and demanded that it discontinue such use.  
 
19. Cyber refused to comply with AOL's demand and continued to offer and sell 
electronic advertising services under the names and marks AOL and "aol.com". Thus, 
Cyber traded on AOL's goodwill in a manner calculated to deceive and cause confusion 
among prospective purchasers.  
 
20. Cyber has engaged in said infringing use despite having full knowledge of AOL's 
prior rights in its name and mark. Thus, Cyber has acted unlawfully, with a willful and 
deliberate intent to cause confusion among the purchasing public and to injure AOL.  
 
 
FACTS PERTAINING TO CYBER'S ACTS OF MISAPPROPRIATION, 
CONVERSION AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND VIOLATIONS OF THE 
ELECTRONIC PRIVACY ACT, THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT, AND 
THE VIRGINIA COMPUTER CRIMES ACT  
 
21. AOL's e-mail system was created solely for the benefit of AOL customers who pay 
prescribed fees and who agree to adhere to AOL's Terms of Service. The e-mail system is 
operated through dedicated computers known as servers which store and route e-mail 
messages for AOL's customers. All AOL customers are given a unique AOL address so 
that they can send and receive on their personal computers both AOL e-mail and Internet 
e-mail. These addresses consist of a name selected by the customer and AOL's service 
mark and domain designation "aol.com", (e.g., "VWXYZ@aol.com"). Only AOL 
customers are allowed to use the "aol.com" mark and domain name as a part of their 
address.  
 
22. Because AOL provides access to the Internet, AOL customers may communicate by 
e-mail with any other person having an Internet address. However, persons using the 
Internet do not have access to AOL's proprietary online system unless they first agree to 
establish an AOL account and abide by AOL's Terms of Service.  
 
23. Any mail that is sent through the Internet, or through AOL's e-mail system, to an 
AOL address will be received by AOL's mail server. When AOL's mail server receives 
such e-mail, it automatically attempts to route it to the AOL subscriber for whom it is 
intended. If e-mail bears an incorrect AOL address (because no such addressee ever 
existed, or because the addressee is no longer an AOL subscriber), the mail is bounced 
back to the sender's return address. If the sender's address is not valid, the mail is routed 
to a server known as the "postmaster workstation". This server performs a wide variety of 
functions vital to the efficient operation of the AOL system. Among other things, it 
enables the AOL system to interface with the Internet so e-mail can be sent and received.  
 
24. The AOL mail server and postmaster workstation have a finite capacity designed to 
accommodate the demands imposed by AOL's customers. They are not designed to 
accommodate, and they are vulnerable to disruption by, indiscriminate mass mailings 
from irresponsible Internet pirates such as Cyber.  
 
25. AOL's Terms of Service and Rules of the Road, and the Internet protocols and 
courses of dealing which are incorporated therein, impose restrictions on the manner in 
which AOL customers and others may use AOL's e-mail system. Among the types of 
conduct prohibited by the Terms of Service (and the acceptable use policies of the 
Internet) is the sending of unsolicited commercial advertisements. This electronic junk 
mail is often referred to pejoratively as "spam". It is prohibited because it constitutes an 
invasion of privacy. In addition, it impairs the efficiency and viability of both the Internet 
as a whole and online services, such as AOL, by overloading communication conduits.  
 
26. Cyber has converted AOL's computer equipment for its own purposes by using it 
without authorization to send its commercial messages. Cyber holds itself out as being 
able to disseminate advertisements for a fee to hundreds of thousands of Internet users. 
Cyber charges advertisers a fee and then includes messages concerning their products and 
services in indiscriminate mass mailings sent to the e-mail addresses which Cyber has 
compiled.  
 
27. On information and belief, most of Cyber's mass mailings go to AOL customers. 
These advertisements are voluminous and they eat up valuable online time for which 
customers are billed. Many of AOL's customers have complained to AOL about the junk 
e-mail sent by Cyber and have asked AOL to take action to cause Cyber to desist from its 
activities.  
 
28. Some of the advertisements sent to AOL customers by Cyber are adult oriented and of 
a highly salacious nature. These materials are offensive to many AOL customers 
particularly those with children.  
 
29. Cyber never requested or obtained any authorization from AOL to engage in this 
conduct nor has it compensated AOL in any manner for the use of AOL's equipment to 
route the millions of unsolicited messages which Cyber has sent.  
 
30. AOL would never have granted approval, even if Cyber had requested it, since 
Cyber's conduct violates AOL's Rules of the Road which are incorporated in the Terms of 
Service.  
 
31. Cyber and or its President Sanford Wallace formerly were subscribers of AOL who 
agreed to abide by AOL's Terms of Service. However, their right to use the AOL system 
was terminated because of flagrant and intentional violations of the Terms of Service. 
Following termination, Cyber has continued to gain access to the AOL system by 
engaging the services of other Internet Service Providers ("ISPs"). Most such providers 
have policies which prohibited the mailing of "spam" and Cyber has attempted to conceal 
its activities from them.  
 
32. Although Cyber and its owner are fully aware of the damage to others caused by the 
mass mailing of"spam", Cyber has recklessly continued to engage in the dissemination of 
such electronic mailings. Indeed it has boasted that it sends over 700,000 messages per 
day.  
 
33. Among the Internet addresses of persons to whom Cyber directs its unwanted 
solicitations are those of at least 650,000 AOL customers. Intent only on reaping the 
maximum commercial advantage from its activities, Cyber has made no effort to 
determine the validity of the addresses. As a result a substantial quantity are invalid. 
Ordinarily, such mailings would be directed back to the ISP whose system was used by 
Cyber. To avoid detection, however, Cyber uses forged return mailing addresses or 
domain names on its mailings. By continually changing its mailing address to avoid 
detection, Cyber has attempted to evade AOL's security systems which are designed to 
keep communication lines and server space open for AOL's customers. On numerous 
occasions, Cyber has managed to gain unauthorized access to AOL's system to obtain 
addresses of AOL subscribers and to bombard them with unwanted mailings.  
 
34. The forged return e-mail addresses used by Cyber have contained AOL's mark and 
domain name "aol.com". Because Cyber has used such return addresses on its mailings, 
and because many of its mailings have been directed to invalid addresses, mass quantities 
of its communications have been dumped into and automatically stored by AOL's 
computer equipment. Cyber's conduct has damaged AOL and its e-mail system by 
overloading this equipment and by causing it to become incapacitated on multiple 
occasions. AOL has incurred substantial expenses in repairing the damage caused by 
Cyber's malicious conduct. The correctly addressed mail sent by Cyber also has 
overloaded and jeopardized the efficient operation of AOL's e-mail system. Although 
AOL's customers pay for the e-mail service offered by AOL, Cyber has paid nothing for 
the use of AOL's system to disseminate its unsolicited commercial messages.  
 
35. Upon learning of the volume of junk e-mail that Cyber was sending, many of its ISPs 
have terminated Cyber's account and have precluded it from obtaining access to their 
systems. On information and belief, however, Cyber has found new ISPs through which it 
continues sending its e-mail solicitations through AOL's system to AOL customers.  
 
36. AOL has received numerous complaints from customers who have received Cyber's 
mailings. Many of these customers have been deceived by Cyber's use of infringing 
marks and forged return addresses and they have been led to believe that AOL is the 
source of the mailings or that AOL has approved them. This confusion has damaged 
AOL's reputation and goodwill and its relationship with its customers.  
 
 
COUNT I 
SERVICE MARK INFRINGEMENT UNDER THE STATUTORY LAW OF THE 
UNITED STATES  
 
37. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts of service mark infringement within the meaning of Section 32(1) of the 
Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1114(1). Paragraphs 1 through 36 of this 
complaint are incorporated by reference as a part of this count.  
 
38. Cyber has used and is using the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in connection 
with the advertising and selling of electronic advertising services in such a manner as to 
create a likelihood of confusion among prospective purchasers, thereby inducing 
purchasers and others to believe, contrary to fact, that the goods or services sold by Cyber 
are rendered, sponsored, or otherwise approved by, or connected with AOL, which acts of 
Cyber have damaged, impaired and diluted that part of AOL's goodwill symbolized by 
the well known names and marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL and "aol.com" to AOL's 
immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
39. Cyber's use of the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in the manner alleged 
constitutes service mark infringement within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 11 14(1).  
 
40. Cyber had actual knowledge of AOL's rights in the service marks AMERICA 
ONLINE and AOL when it began using the name and marks complained of herein. Thus, 
Cyber has willfully and deliberately infringed AOL's rights.  
 
41. Cyber's acts of infringement have caused AOL irreparable injury, loss of reputation 
and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue these acts of 
infringement to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT II 
SERVICE MARK DILUTION UNDER THE STATUTORY LAWS OF THE UNITED 
STATES  
 
42. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts constituting service mark dilution in violation of Section 43(c) of the 
Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(c). Paragraphs 1 through 41 of this 
complaint are incorporated by reference as a part of this count.  
 
43. Cyber has made commercial use of the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" with the 
willful intent to trade on AOL's reputation or to cause dilution of the famous marks 
AMERICA ONLINE, AOL, and "aol.com".  
 
44. Cyber's use of the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" began long after AOL's 
marks had become well known and famous.  
 
45. Cyber's use of the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" causes dilution of the 
distinctive quality of AOL's famous marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL, and "'aol.com".  
 
46. Cyber's use of the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" lessens the capacity of 
AOL's famous marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL and "aol.com" to identify and 
distinguish AOL's goods and services.  
 
47. Cyber's activities complained of herein constitute service mark dilution within the 
meaning of Section 43(c) of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1125(c).  
 
48. Cyber's conduct has caused AOL irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary 
damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue to willfully dilute AOL's 
famous marks to the immediate and irreparable damage of AOL.  
 
 
COUNT III 
UNFAIR COMPETITION THROUGH FALSE DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN AND 
FALSE ADVERTISING IN VIOLATION OF THE STATUTORY LAW OF THE 
UNITED STATES  
 
49. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts of unfair competition through the use of false designations of origin and 
false advertising in violation of Section 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1125(a). Paragraphs 1 through 48 of this complaint are incorporated by reference as 
part of this count.  
 
50. Cyber has used and is using the names and marks AOL and "aol.com", and Cyber has 
made and is making false express or implied representations that its services originate 
with or are endorsed by AOL, in connection with the advertising and selling of electronic 
advertising services in such a manner as to create a likelihood of confusion among 
prospective purchasers, thereby inducing purchasers and others to believe, contrary to 
fact, that the goods or services sold by Cyber are rendered, sponsored, or otherwise 
approved by, or connected with AOL, which acts of Cyber have damaged, impaired and 
diluted that part of AOL's goodwill symbolized by its names and marks to AOL's 
immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
51. Cyber's use of trade names and marks that are confusingly similar to those used by 
AOL in connection with the advertising and sale of its goods or services constitutes use 
of a false designation of origin, and Cyber's express or implied representations that its 
services originate with or are endorsed by AOL constitute a use of false descriptions or 
representations of fact, within the meaning of Section 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 
1946, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).  
 
52. Cyber's use of trade names and marks confusingly similar to those of AOL constitutes 
unfair competition entitling AOL to remedies afforded pursuant to Section 43(a) of the 
Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).  
 
53. Cyber's acts of false designation of origin and false advertising have caused AOL 
irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this 
court, Cyber will continue the acts of unfair competition complained of herein to AOL's 
immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT IV 
FRAUDULENT ACTS OR PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSUMER 
PROTECTION ACT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA  
 
54. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in fraudulent acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Protection Act of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia, Va. Code Secs. 59.1-1-198. Paragraphs 1 through 53 of this 
complaint are incorporated by reference as a part of this count.  
 
55. Cyber has used and is using the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in connection 
with the advertising and selling of electronic advertising services in such a manner as to 
misrepresent its goods or services as those of AOL; to misrepresent the source, 
sponsorship, approval, or certification of its goods or services; to misrepresent itself as 
having an affiliation, connection or association with AOL; to misrepresent the geographic 
origin of its goods or services; to misrepresent that its goods or services have certain 
quantities, characteristics, ingredients, uses or benefits; to misrepresent that its goods or 
services are of a particular standard, quality, grade, style or model; and to use other 
deceptions, fraud, false pretenses, false promises or misrepresentations in connection with 
consumer transactions, which acts of Cyber have damaged, impaired and diluted that part 
of AOL's goodwill symbolized by the service marks AMERICA ONLINE, AOL, and 
"aol.com" to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
56. Cyber's use of the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in the manner alleged 
constitutes deceptive trade practices of a type proscribed by Va. Code Secs. 59.1-1-198.  
 
57. Cyber had actual knowledge of AOL's rights in the service mark AOL at the time it 
decided to use the names and marks complained of herein. Thus, Cyber willfully and 
deliberately infringed AOL's rights in the mark AOL.  
 
58. Cyber's unfair business practices are of a recurring nature and harmful to the 
consumers and the public at large.  
 
59. Cyber's unfair and deceptive business practices have caused AOL irreparable injury, 
loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will 
continue these deliberate acts of infringement and deceit and will continue misleading 
consumers and to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT V 
UNFAIR COMPETITION UNDER THE COMMON LAW OF THE STATE OF 
VIRGINIA  
 
60. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts constituting unfair competition under the common law of the State of 
Virginia. Paragraphs 1 through 59 of this complaint are incorporated by reference as a 
part of this count.  
 
61. Cyber has used and is using the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in connection 
with the advertising and selling of electronic advertising services in an unlawful, unfair 
and fraudulent manner so as to create a likelihood of confusion among prospective 
purchasers as to the source of its goods and services which acts have damaged, impaired, 
and diluted the goodwill symbolized by AOL's name and mark to its immediate and 
irreparable damage.  
 
62. The aforesaid acts of Cyber constitute unfair competition under the common law of 
Virginia.  
 
63. Cyber's acts of unfair competition have caused AOL irreparable injury, loss of 
reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue 
said acts of unfair competition to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.

OF VIRGINIA  
 
64. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts of service mark infringement in violation of the common law of the State 
of Virginia. Paragraphs 1 through 63 of this complaint are incorporated by reference as a

65. Cyber has used and is using the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in connection

create a likelihood of confusion among prospective purchasers, thereby inducing 
purchasers and others to believe, contrary to fact, that the goods and services sold by 
Cyber are rendered, sponsored, or otherwise approved by, or connected with AOL, which 
acts of Cyber have damaged, impaired and diluted that part of AOL's goodwill 
symbolized by the marks owned by AOL, to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
66. The nature, probable tendency and effect of Cyber's use of confusingly similar names 
and marks in the manner alleged is to enable Cyber to deceive the public by passing off 
its goods and services as being rendered, sponsored, or otherwise approved by or 
connected with AOL.  
 
67. Cyber's use of names and marks confusingly similar to those used by AOL in 
connection with the advertising and selling of electronic advertising services, is likely to 
cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or origin of Cyber's goods or 
services and constitutes infringement of AOL's service marks under the common law of 
the State of Virginia.  
 
68. Cyber's acts of infringement have caused AOL irreparable injury, loss of reputation 
and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue these acts of 
infringement thereby deceiving the public and causing AOL immediate and irreparable 
damage.  
 
 
COUNT VII 
TRADE NAME INFRINGEMENT UNDER THE COMMON LAW OF THE STATE 
OF VIRGINIA  
 
69. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts of trade name infringement under the common law of the State of 
Virginia. Paragraphs 1 through 68 of this complaint are incorporated by reference as a 
part of this count.  
 
70. Cyber has used and is using the names and marks AOL and "aol.com" in connection 
with the advertising and selling of electronic advertising services in such a manner as to 
create a likelihood of confusion among prospective purchasers, thereby inducing 
purchasers and others to believe, contrary to fact, that the goods or services sold by Cyber 
are rendered, sponsored, or otherwise approved by, or connected with AOL, which acts 
have damaged, impaired and diluted that part of AOL's goodwill symbolized by its trade 
names AMERICA ONLINE, AOL and "aol.com", to AOL's immediate and irreparable 
damage.  
 
71. The nature, probable tendency and effect of Cyber's use of confusingly similar names 
and marks in the manner alleged is to enable Cyber to deceive the public by passing off 
its goods or services as being rendered, sponsored, or otherwise approved by or connected 
with AOL.  
 
72. Cyber's use of names and marks similar to the trade names AMERICA ONLINE, 
AOL and "aol.com" in the advertising and sale of goods or services, is likely to cause 
confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or origin of Cyber's goods or services. 
Said conduct constitutes infringement of AOL's trade names under the common law of 
the State of Virginia.  
 
73. Cyber's acts of trade name infringement have caused AOL irreparable injury, loss of 
reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue 
these acts of infringement thereby deceiving the public and causing AOL immediate and 
irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT VIII 
MISAPPROPRIATION IN VIOLATION OF THE COMMON LAW OF VIRGINIA  
 
74. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts of common law misappropriation. Paragraphs 1 through 73 of this 
complaint are incorporated by reference as a part of this count.  
 
75. Cyber without authorization or at the very least exceeding any authorization has used 
AOL's proprietary e-mail system to transmit unsolicited promotional and advertising 
material to AOL's customers.  
 
76. Cyber's unauthorized transmissions of unsolicited material, from which Cyber profits 
to the detriment of AOL, constitute the unfair and unlawful misappropriation of 
extremely valuable commercial property owned by AOL.  
 
77. Cyber's parasitic use of AOL's system has seriously taxed the storage and 
transmission capacity of AOL's mail server and has forced AOL to devote significant 
resources to manage the unauthorized, unsolicited and disruptive message traffic 
generated by Cyber.  
 
78. By clogging AOL's mail server with its unsolicited promotional message traffic, 
Cyber is directly competing with AOL and it is interfering with the use of AOL's 
proprietary e-mail system by legitimate users.  
 
79. Cyber's unlawful and inequitable activities damage and dilute the commercial value 
of the e-mail services currently offered by AOL to its customers, and inequitably 
misappropriate the equipment, skill, expenditures and labors of AOL for Cyber's 
commercial advantage.  
 
80. The foregoing activities of Cyber constitute misappropriation of AOL's commercial 
property, in violation of the common law of the State of Virginia.  
 
81. Cyber's misappropriation of AOL's commercial property has caused and continues to 
cause AOL to suffer irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless 
enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue these acts of misappropriation thereby causing 
AOL immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT IX

engaged in acts of conversion in violation of the common law of the State of Virginia. 
Paragraphs 1 through 81 of this complaint are incorporated by reference as a part of this 
count.  
 
83. The computers, computer networks and computer services that comprise AOL's e-
mail system are the personal property of AOL.  
 
84. Cyber without authorization, or at the very least exceeding any authorization, has 
intentionally used AOL's e-mail system for Cyber's own commercial benefit. Due to the 
volume of its unsolicited messages Cyber has used AOL's e-mail system in such a 
manner and extent as to exercise dominion over said property or, in the alternative, in 
such a manner and extent as to deprive AOL and its customers of the legitimate use of 
this proprietary and commercially valuable system.  
 
85. The foregoing activities of Cyber constitute conversion of AOL's property in violation 
of the common law of the State of Virginia.  
 
86. Cyber's conversion of AOL's property has caused and continues to cause AOL to 
suffer irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by 
this court, Cyber will continue these acts of conversion thereby causing AOL immediate 
and irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT X 
UNJUST ENRICHMENT ENTITLING AOL TO QUASI CONTRACT RELIEF 
UNDER THE COMMON LAW OF VIRGINIA  
 
87.As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is

e-mail to AOL customers.  
 
90. As a result of Cyber's conduct, Cyber has been unjustly enriched.  
 
91. Cyber's unjust enrichment through the unauthorized use of AOL's property and 
services has caused and continues to cause AOL to suffer irreparable injury, loss of 
reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this court, Cyber will continue 
deriving unjust enrichment thereby causing AOL immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
92. Cyber's unjust enrichment creates a contract implied by law between Cyber and AOL, 
entitling AOL to equitable relief, money judgment and other restitution for the losses 
sustained by AOL and the benefits conferred upon Cyber through its unauthorized use of 
AOL's property and services.  
 
 
COUNT XI 
VIOLATION OF THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT  
 
93. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and is 
engaged in acts constituting a violation of the Electronic Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. 
Sec. 2701 et. seq. Paragraphs I through 92 of this complaint are incorporated by reference 
as a part of this count.  
 
94. AOL owns computer systems through which electronic communication services are 
provided to customers for a fee.  
 
95. Upon information and belief, Cyber through means of a computer used in interstate 
commerce, intentionally obtained access to AOL's facilities by transmitting into AOL's 
system excessive amounts of unsolicited e-mail directed to AOL's customers at their 
respective AOL addresses. Cyber's access to AOL's system occurred without AOL's 
authorization. Cyber's acts complained of herein were done knowingly and with the 
specific intent of obtaining access so that Defendant could distribute for profit, on an 
unsolicited basis, the promotional material of its clients.  
 
96. Cyber's intentional and unauthorized access to AOL's system has caused damage to 
the computers, computer systems, networks, information, data and programs of AOL's 
computer servers and such damage, moreover, has been so extensive in nature as to 
prevent the authorized access to AOL's system by AOL's own customers and personnel 
thereby causing injury to AOL.  
 
97. Defendant's acts complained of herein violate Chapter 121 of The Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2701 et. seq.  
 
98. Cyber's violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act have caused AOL 
irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this 
court, Cyber will continue these violations to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.

Sec. 1030 et. seq. Paragraphs 1 through 98 of this complaint are incorporated by reference 
as a part of this count.  
 
100. AOL maintains one or more computers as defined in Sec. 1030(e)of the Computer

knowingly and willfully caused, through the means of a computer used in interstate 
commerce, the transmission of one or more programs, information, codes or commands

of a substantial and unjustified risk, that its transmissions would damage, or cause 
damage to, a computer, computer system, network, information, data or program of 
AOL's computer facilities.  
 
102. Defendant's willful transmission of one or more programs, information, codes or 
commands related to the unsolicited e-mail transmissions to AOL's computer facilities, in 
fact caused damage to the computer, computer systems, networks, information, data and 
programs which comprise said facilities and furthermore caused the withholding and 
denial of use of the computers, computer services, systems, networks information, data 
and programs of AOL's computer facilities, thereby causing injury to AOL.  
 
103. The foregoing acts and conduct of the Defendant have caused, and if not enjoined 
will continue to cause, loss or damage to one or more other persons of a value 
aggregating $1,000 or more during any one year period.  
 
104. Defendant's acts complained of herein violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030 et. seq.  
 
105. Cyber's violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act have caused AOL 
irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this 
court, Cyber will continue these violations to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
 
COUNT XIII 
VIOLATIONS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPUTER CRIMES ACT  
 
106. As a separate cause of action and ground for relief, AOL alleges that Cyber has and 
is engaged in acts constituting violations of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, Va. Code 
Sec. 18.2-152.2 et seq. Paragraphs 1 through 105 of this complaint are incorporated by 
reference as a part of this count.  
 
107. AOL maintains one or more computers, as that term is defined in Va. Code Sec. 
18.2- 152.2, through which electronic mailings are received, stored and disseminated

the "property" of AOL as that term is defined in Va. Code Sec. 18.2-152.2.  
 
108. Defendant, without authorization or at the very least exceeding any authorization, 
knowingly, intentionally and willfully caused, through the use of a computer or computer 
network, the malfunction of"AOL's computers".

intentionally through the use of a computer or computer network used AOL's computers, 
computer networks, or computer services in a such a manner and extent as to exercise 
dominion over such property or, in the alternative, in such a manner and extent as to 
deprive AOL of the use of this property thereby in each instance converting AOL's 
property for Defendant's own commercial use.  
 
111. The foregoing acts caused damages to AOL's computer systems and furthermore 
caused the withholding and denial of use of the computers, computer services, systems, 
networks information, data and programs of AOL's computer facilities, thereby causing 
injury to AOL.  
 
112. Defendant's conduct complained of herein above violates the Virginia Computer 
Crimes Act, Va. Code Sec. 18.2-152.3 and Sec. 18.2-152.4.  
 
113. Cyber's violations of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act have caused AOL 
irreparable injury, loss of reputation and pecuniary damages. Unless enjoined by this 
court, Cyber will continue these violations to AOL's immediate and irreparable damage.  
 
WHEREFORE, AOL prays for judgment against Cyber as follows:  
 
 
(1) Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1116, and the law of the state of Virginia, that Cyber and

<P>On Sept. 27, 1996 America Online filed this appeal to an injunction preventing the 
online service from blocking "junk" e-mail from Cyber Promotions to AOL members. 
America Online alleges that Cyber Promotions began to deluge in late 1995 "AOL and its 
customers with millions of unsolicited commercial e-mail messages, infuriating AOL 
members, resulting in member cancellations and imposing increased hardware and 
software expense on AOL." When AOL took steps to prevent Cyber from continuing this 
course of conduct, Cyber initiated this litigation, claiming that it had a First Amendment 
right to conduct its business by means of AOL's proprietary online service.</P>

STATEMENT OF SUBJECT MATTER AND APPELLATE JURISDICTION  
 
Subject matter jurisdiction for this matter in the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania is based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 
1332. Appellant, American Online, Inc. ("AOL"), and appellee, Cyber Promotions, Inc. 
("Cyber"), are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy, exclusive of 
interest and costs, exceeds $50,000. Jurisdiction in the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Third Circuit is based on 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1), which provides that a party may 
take an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order granting an injunction. On 
September 5, 1996, the lower court entered an Order granting an injunction in favor of 
Cyber and against AOL. AOL filed its notice of appeal of the Order on September 12, 
1996.  
 
 
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW  
 
The following issues are raised in this appeal.  
 
1. Whether the district court's order compels AOL to disseminate Cyber's advertisements 
in violation of the First Amendment.  
 
2. Whether the district court erred in concluding that Cyber proved that it was entitled to 
a preliminary injunction against AOL to last from September 5, 1996 through the trial of 
the action.  
 
3. Whether the preliminary injunction should be vacated because the district court did 
not: (a) hold a hearing in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 65; (b), issue findings of fact 
and conclusions of law in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); (c), provide AOL with 
an opportunity to respond to Cyber's contentions or affidavit before issuing an injunction 
of indefinite duration; or (d), require that Cyber post security in a meaningful amount as 
required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  
 
See the attached order entered on September 5, 1996, by the Honorable Charles R. 
Weiner; the docket entries (JA000005-11) reflecting the timing, lack of hearing and 
procedural posture of proceedings in the lower court; the declaration of counsel for AOL 
noting in part the timing issue, (JA000445-448, Paras. 3-5); the memoranda of Cyber and 
AOL filed on August 30, 1996, (JA000354-397 and JA000398-453), on the procedural 
posture; and the letter of counsel for AOL to Judge Weiner noting in part the injunction 
versus TRO procedural posture, (JA000461-462), before the injunction was entered.  
 
 
STATEMENT OF THE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
 
This court reviews the district court's granting of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of 
discretion, an obvious error in applying the law or a serious mistake in considering the 
proof. Merchant & Evans. Inc. v. Roosevelt Building Prods. Co., 963 F.2d 628, 633 (3d 
Cir. 1992). The lower court's underlying factual determinations are reviewed for clear 
error and its rulings on questions of law are reviewed de novo. Acierno v. New Castle 
Co., 40 F.3d 645, 652 (3d Cir. 1994).  
 
Where a record contains an insufficient basis for determining the legal and factual 
grounds for issuing an injunction, the appellate court must vacate the injunction.

1984).  
 
 
STATEMENT OF RELATED CASES 
 
There are no related cases of which AOL is aware that are currently pending before or 
about to be presented to this Court or any other state or federal court, or that have 
previously been before this Court.  
 
 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
AOL operates a private online computer service which has more than six million 
members. (JA000409, Knowles Decl. Paras. 1-2.) AOL has invested millions of dollars in 
its equipment, reputation, software, advertising, and e-mail system. (JA000236, 
O'Donnell Decl. Para. 4.) One of the most popular services provided by AOL is the 
ability to send and receive e-mail through equipment owned and maintained by AOL. 
(JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) Beginning in late 1995, Cyber began deluging 
AOL and its customers with millions of unsolicited commercial e-mail messages, 
infuriating AOL members, resulting in member cancellations and imposing increased 
hardware and software expense on AOL. (JA000238, 241-242, O'Donnell Decl. Paras. 
14, 23, 27-28; JA000410, Knowles Decl. Paras. 4, 6; and JA000414, Ryan Decl. Paras. 4-
5.) AOL has suffered, and continues to suffer, lost customers, substantial damage, cost, 
and hardship as a result of Cyber's activities. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 28.) 
When AOL took steps to prevent Cyber from continuing this course of conduct, Cyber 
initiated this litigation, claiming that it had a First Amendment right to conduct its 
business by means of AOL's proprietary online service.  
 
Cyber is a six-employee company, (JA000372, at Para. 13), that charges as little as 
$79.00 to add a person's advertisement to its bulk e-mail string messages and repeat its 
bulk mailings two to four times each day, seven days a week. (JA000410, Knowles Decl. 
Paras. 5-6; JA000441; and JA000447, Schiller Decl. Paras. 12-13.) Some of these bulk e-
mail transmissions include advertisements for adult videos, aphrodisiacs, and get-rich-
quick schemes, and they reach indiscriminately children and their parents -- potentially 
anyone with an e-mail box. (JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 15; and JA000410, 
Knowles Decl. Para. 6.) Cyber typically seeds millions of messages containing its 
unsolicited advertisements several times a day to more than 900,000 AOL subscribers. 
(JA000368, Wallace Decl. Para. 4; and JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 5.)  
 
Although the analogy has no basis in fact, law, the nature of the ownership at issue, or the 
character of the actors, Cyber itself nonetheless likes to analogize its dissemination of its 
bulk commercial e-mail to bulk junk mail sent through the United States postal system. 
Even if one ignored arguendo the stark differences of constitutional significance, the 
remaining obvious distinctions make all too clear that Cyber's activities would still have 
to be considered significantly more pernicious in several critical respects: As a 
preliminary matter, the sender of mail through the postal service, whether first class or 
otherwise, pays the postage. Cyber does not bear the cost of transmission (or the 
"postage"), but the recipients and AOL do; the e-mail boxes rapidly fill up and become 
unavailable for real mail as a result of Cyber's bulk e-mail, while postal recipients' mail 
boxes generally do not; recipients of Cyber's mail must incur some online charges in 
ascertaining what the mail is, while postal recipients do not; and the equipment of AOL 
can become damaged by the Cyber junk e-mail, while the postal service generally cannot. 
Moreover, all e-mail, regardless of intent or nature, is essentially treated the same by the 
Internet and AOL's computers; that is, it is all like first-class mail.1/ For reasons such as 
these, AOL and its customers strongly objected to Cyber's unwanted intrusions, cost, and 
impact, and AOL accordingly took reasonable steps to protect its proprietary system. 
Because AOL receives hundreds of complaints per day from its customers objecting to 
Cyber's unsolicited e-mail, threatening to cancel service, and, in some cases, threatening 
to sue AOL if the e-mail does not stop, AOL programmed its system to reject e-mail 
emanating from Servint, an Internet service provider ("ISP") currently used by Cyber to 
send the e-mail. (JA000410, Knowles Decl. Paras. 6, 8.) AOL did not obtain an order 
from a court in exercising its right to block Servint.  
 
On August 30, 1996, Cyber made an oral motion with the district court for a temporary 
restraining order/preliminary injunction, which asserted Cyber's "right" to conduct its 
business on AOL's property -- despite the fact that Cyber has refused to pay for this right. 
(JA000354-397.) On four hours' notice, the lower court required simultaneous briefs to be 
filed by the parties. Without a hearing, the lower court granted Cyber's motion and on 
September 5, entered an order "temporarily restrain[ing]" AOL, "until the time of trial," 
from blocking Cyber's e-mail to AOL members "who wish to receive the mail and from 
interfering in any manner with Cyber's business relationships with its Internet Service 
Providers." By virtue of the order, AOL was constrained to remove its block of Servint 
and Cyber's bulk e-mail, and, even though Cyber had engineered a way to circumvent 
AOL's block even before the lower court entered its order, AOL was left essentially 
powerless to prevent Cyber or its ISPs from their indiscriminate mass mailings under the 
cloak of an official court order. A copy of the lower court's order is attached at the end of 
AOL's brief. The lower court did not render any findings of fact or conclusions of law in 
connection with the order.  
 
AOL has appealed the lower court's order granting the injunction, and Cyber has agreed 
to AOL's request that this Court hear the motion on an expedited basis.  
 
 
STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS 
 
AOL is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Its 
principal place of business is in Vienna, Virginia. (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 3.) 
At great cost and expense, AOL has developed the world's largest and most successful 
proprietary, content-based, computer online service. (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
4.) The number of members or customers who have established accounts with AOL has 
grown rapidly, and, currently, AOL has more than 6 million customers. (JA000236, 
O'Donnell Decl. Para. 5.) Any person having access to a computer, a modem and a 
telephone line can subscribe to AOL's service, provided they are willing to adhere to 
AOL's "Terms of Service" and "Rules of the Road." (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
6.) (Copies of these terms and rules are at JA000244-262.) Additional factual information 
on the Internet, the nature and scope of the services provided by online companies, such 
as AOL, and the absence of government activity in the area are reviewed in two recent 
decisions issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania (June 11, 1996) and the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York (July 29, 1996). See ACLU v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824 (E.D. Pa. 
1996); Shea v. Reno, 930 F. Supp. 916 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  
 
AOL is just one of many online services providing access to the Internet, though AOL is 
the largest in terms of members, investment in assets, and revenue. "National commercial 
'on-line services' -- such as America Online, Compu-Serve, Prodigy, and Microsoft 
Network -- allow subscribers to gain access to the Internet while providing extensive 
content within their own proprietary networks." Shea, 930 F. Supp. at 926. Online 
services such as AOL "offer nationwide computer networks (so that subscribers can dial 
into a local telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well-organized 
content with their own proprietary networks.... The major commercial online services 
have almost twelve million individual subscribers across the United States." ACLU, 929 
F. Supp. at 833. AOL's online system is comprised of a complex network of computers 
and extensive databases. (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 7.) For a monthly fee, 
customers may obtain access to these databases, which contain textual and graphic 
information on such topics as current events, news, personal finance, entertainment, 
computing, weather, travel, education and sports. (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 7.) 
AOL customers also have access to a variety of online periodicals, reference works and 
computer software. (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 7.) They may participate in online 
clubs, which provide information relating to hobbies, and chat rooms which allow 
customers to interact with persons having similar interests. (JA000236, O'Donnell Decl. 
Para. 7.) Another popular feature of the AOL service is a "KIDS ONLY" area which 
contains educational materials, games and other items of interest to children. (JA000236, 
O'Donnell Decl. Para. 7.) AOL even offers its subscribers "parental control options free 
of charge" for accessing Internet material. Shea, 930 F. Supp. at 932. Customers may also 
enter an online marketplace where they may obtain information concerning products of 
companies who pay AOL a fee for the right to advertise there. (JA000236, O'Donnell 
Decl. Para. 7.) (A copy of the AOL "Main Menu" screen, which identifies many of these 
online services, is at JA000263-264.)  
 
Among the valuable services provided to AOL customers is a proprietary e-mail system 
which allows them to communicate with each other by means of their personal 
computers. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) AOL's e-mail system was created solely 
for the benefit of AOL customers, who pay prescribed fees and who agree to adhere to 
AOL's Terms of Service. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) The e-mail system is 
operated through dedicated computers known as servers, which store and route e-mail 
messages for AOL's customers. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) All AOL 
customers are given a unique AOL address so that they can send and receive e-mail. 
(JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) These addresses consist of a name selected by the 
customer and AOL's service mark and domain designation "aol.com," (e.g., 
"JohnDoe@aol.com"). (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) Only AOL customers are 
allowed to use the "aol.com" mark and domain name as a part of their address. 
(JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 8.) Any AOL customer who does not wish to abide by 
AOL's Terms of Service is free to establish an e-mail address through another service or 
an Internet service provider, with the only difference in e-mail address being that such 
address will not include "aol.com" and the e-mail will not use AOL's resources.  
 
Because AOL provides access to the Internet, AOL customers may communicate by e-
mail with any other person having an Internet address. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
9.) However, persons using the Internet do not have access to AOL's proprietary online 
content unless they first agree to establish an AOL account and abide by AOL's Terms of 
Service. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 9.)  
 
The Internet has become one of the most significant technological creations of this 
century, occupying a position which is potentially more important than telephones or 
televisions among communications media. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 10.) Once 
connected to the Internet, users can obtain vast amounts of digitized data from sources 
such as the archives of large governmental and academic institutions and the web pages 
of the Internet's millions of individual users. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 10.) 
Many businesses and educational institutions have invested vast sums of money in 
acquiring and running the sophisticated computer and communications equipment 
required to make the Internet operational. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 11.) Access 
to this equipment is leased by providers to persons who, in most cases, would not have 
the means or inclination to acquire their own systems. (JA000237, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
11); ACLU, 929 F. Supp. at 833.  
 
A number of legitimate businesses have established their own web pages on the Internet. 
(JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 12.) These serve as a source of information concerning 
such businesses and their products or services. (JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 12.) 
Accordingly, the web has become the chief method on the Internet used by businesses to 
advertise their products and services, as it is a mechanism known by Internet users as a 
source of information on businesses and does not impose cost on the recipient who does 
not wish to see the information. Unfortunately, the Internet has also provided 
opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and corporations who use it as a tool to 
perpetrate fraud, to misappropriate intellectual property, to engage in unfair competition, 
and to invade privacy. (JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 12.)  
 
Cyber has elected to use AOL's computer equipment for its own purposes by using it 
without authorization to send its commercial e-mail messages in bulk to millions of 
recipients, with no advance warning or knowledge that the recipient wishes to receive the 
information, and at cost solely to others. (JA000238, O'Donnell Decl.Para. 13.) Cyber 
holds itself out as being able to disseminate advertisements for a fee to millions of 
Internet users.  
 
(JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 13.) The number of recipients of Cyber's e-mail 
messages is increasing daily. (JA000414, Ryan Decl. Para. 4.) Since just the Spring of 
this year, the volume of Cyber's commercial e-mail has greatly increased with each 
mailing. (JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 5.) Cyber charges advertisers a nominal fee and 
then includes strings of messages concerning their products and services in indiscriminate 
mass mailings sent to the e-mail addresses which Cyber has compiled. (JA000238, 
O'Donnell Decl. Paras. 13-14.) One mailing can include 15 to 20 pages of strung-together 
advertisements directed to 900,000 AOL mailboxes. (JA000368, Wallace Decl. Para. 4; 
and JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 5.) Multiply this by four times a day, seven days a 
week, and the scope of the problem to AOL becomes self-evident.  
 
The majority of Cyber's mass mailings go to AOL customers. (JA000238, O'Donnell 
Decl. Para. 14.) Indeed, Cyber has acquired the e-mail addresses of hundreds of 
thousands of AOL customers, perhaps millions by now, and, some months ago, Cyber 
began sending large amounts of unsolicited commercial advertisements via e-mail to 
them. (A sample of one such advertisement is at JA000265-268.) These advertisements 
are voluminous, and they eat up valuable online time for which customers are billed and 
AOL resources are expended. (JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 14.) AOL receives 
hundreds of daily complaints from its customers concerning Cyber's conduct. (JA000238, 
O'Donnell Decl. Para. 14; and JA000414, Ryan Decl. Para. 5.) The complaints relate to 
the volume, nature, content and cost of the bulk mail, as well as the out-and-out 
frustration by customers over their inability to remove themselves from Cyber's mailing 
lists notwithstanding repeated attempts by phone or e-mail, even after carefully following 
the directions Cyber provides purportedly for that very purpose. (JA000414, Ryan Decl. 
Para. 5.) (Samples of such complaints are at JA000269-271.)  
 
Some of the advertisements sent to AOL customers by Cyber are marked for adults only 
and are of a salacious nature. (JA000238, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 15.) These materials are 
offensive to many AOL customers. Such advertisements indiscriminately land in the e-
mail box of 12-year olds as well as their parents and teachers. (Samples of such Cyber 
advertisements are at JA000272-274.)  
 
Cyber never requested any authorization from AOL or its customers to engage in this 
conduct, nor has it compensated AOL or its customers in any manner for the use of 
AOL's equipment to route the millions of unsolicited messages which it has sent or for 
the cost, inconvenience, and at times embarrassment to customers caused by the e-mail. 
(JA000239, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 16.) AOL would never have granted approval even if 
Cyber had requested permission since Cyber's conduct damages AOL and its relations 
with its customers with each mailing and violates AOL's Rules of the Road which are 
incorporated in the Terms of Service. (JA000239, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 17.) Paragraph C 
of these rules contains the following prohibitions concerning online conduct:  
 
 
C.  Online Conduct. 
 
(a) Any conduct by you that in AOL Inc.'s discretion restricts or inhibits any other 
Member from using or enjoying AOL will not be permitted . . . You may not post or use 
AOL to:  
 
(1) harass, threaten, embarrass or cause distress, unwanted attention or discomfort upon 
another Member or user of AOL or other person, or entity,  
 
(2) post or transmit sexually explicit images or other content which is deemed by AOL 
Inc. to be offensive . . .  
 
(8) post or transmit any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials, or other forms of 
solicitation to other Members, individuals or entities, except in those areas (e.g. the 
classified areas) that are designated for such a purpose . . . (viii) Advertising, Solicitation 
and Name Harvesting. You may not use AOL to send unsolicited advertising, 
promotional material, or other forms of solicitation to other Members except in those 
specified areas that are designated for such a purpose (e.g., the classified area) unless you 
receive the express permission of the Member. You may not use AOL to collect or 
"harvest" screen names of other Members without the express prior permission of the 
Member. AOL Inc. reserves the right to block or filter mass e-mail solicitations on or 
through AOL.  
 
 
(JA000239, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 17.) 
 
Cyber has violated each of these rules. (JA000239, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 13.) Upon 
discovering these violations, AOL contacted Cyber and demanded that it discontinue its 
activities. (A copy of a cease and desist letter dated January 26, 1996, which was sent by 
AOL to Cyber, is at JA000275-276.) Cyber knew or should have known of AOL's Terms 
of Service, since Cyber's President, Sanford Wallace, is a former AOL customer who 
once agreed to abide by them. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 19.) However, his right 
to use the AOL system was terminated because of flagrant and intentional violations of 
the Terms of Service. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 19.) Notwithstanding its 
knowledge of AOL's rules and its receipt of the cease and desist, Cyber has refused to 
comply with AOL's demand. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 20.) Indeed, it has 
escalated its activities and continues to escalate its use of AOL's equipment to 
disseminate unsolicited e-mail advertisements, with an exponential increase in the 
volume of bulk e-mail since the beginning of this year. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
20.)  
 
AOL's prohibition against the dissemination of unsolicited commercial e-mail is dictated 
by a number of considerations. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 21.) AOL has neither 
the means nor the obligation to assist businesses such as Cyber in the dissemination of 
huge quantities of unsolicited e-mail. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 21.) AOL owns 
the equipment used in its business, and it has the right to charge a fee to those who desire 
to gain access to its system. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 21.) If Cyber were 
permitted to amass profits by using AOL's system free of charge, others would quickly 
follow suit. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl.Para. 21.) AOL's e-mail system would soon be 
overloaded to the point that it would no longer be usable by paying AOL customers. 
(JA000240, O'Donnell Decl.Para. 21.) More important, Cyber's solicitations are strongly 
disliked by AOL's members who mistakenly believe that AOL is not doing everything 
possible to stop Cyber and often cancel or threaten to cancel their AOL subscriptions over 
their anger with Cyber's bulk e-mail. (JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 6.)  
 
Any e-mail that is sent to an AOL address is received and processed by AOL's mail 
server equipment. (JA000240, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 22.) This equipment automatically 
attempts to route such e-mail to the AOL subscriber for whom it is intended. (JA000240, 
O'Donnell Decl. Para. 22.) If e-mail bears an incorrect AOL address (because no such 
addressee ever existed or because the addressee is no longer an AOL subscriber), the mail 
is bounced back to the sender's address. (JA000240-241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 22.) If the 
sender's address is not valid, the mail is routed to a server known as the "postmaster 
workstation." (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 22.) AOL's e-mail equipment has a finite 
capacity which is designed to accommodate the demands imposed by AOL's customers. 
(JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 23.) Notwithstanding AOL's substantial and 
continuing investment in hardware, software and personnel, AOL remains vulnerable to 
disruption by indiscriminate, mass mailings. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 23.) The 
volume of mix-addressed or undeliverable e-mail sent from Cyber to or through AOL is 
tremendous and results in substantial cost and damage to AOL apart from and beyond 
that engendered by the e-mail that actually reaches -- and infuriates -- AOL members. 
(JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 23.) In fact, the volume of mix-addressed junk e-mail 
sent by Cyber is so large that on several occasions it has disabled equipment owned by 
AOL. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 23.) AOL has had to spend hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on new equipment already to accommodate Cyber's mailings while 
keeping its system operational for the e-mail its customers do want to receive. 
(JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 23; and JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 7.)  
 
It is obvious that Cyber made no effort to determine the validity of the e-mail addresses it 
collected before using them. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 24.) Indeed, a substantial 
quantity was invalid, since much of the e-mail was addressed to mail boxes that originally 
belonged to individuals whose accounts had been terminated or who had changed their 
addresses. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 24.) Ordinarily, such mailings would be 
returned to the ISP whose system Cyber used to send them. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. 
Para. 24.) To avoid detection, however, Cyber has used forged return mailing addresses 
or domain names on its mailings. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 24.) The use of a 
forged or intentionally incorrect "return path" or return address means that undeliverable 
mail that is supposed to get returned to Cyber through its ISP instead gets routed to an 
incorrect ISP with which Cyber has no dealings, usually an e-mail box of a known 
opponent of Cyber's way of doing business. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 24.) By 
continually changing its mailing address to avoid detection, Cyber has attempted to evade 
AOL's security systems, which are designed to keep communication lines and server 
space open for AOL's customers only. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 24.)  
 
Over the last year, Cyber has gained access to the AOL system by using the services of 
several ISPs. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 25.) Like AOL, most such providers 
have policies which prohibit the mailing of unsolicited commercial advertisements. 
(JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 25.) Notwithstanding these policies, Cyber has 
continued sending its junk e-mail in bulk, always overcoming attempts to block it, the 
loss of ISPs, criticism in Internet Web pages set up exclusively to complain about Cyber, 
and attempts in the courts to stop the damage Cyber causes. (JA000241, O'Donnell Decl. 
Para. 24-26.)  
 
AOL has received hundreds of daily complaints from customers who have received 
Cyber's mailings. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 27.) While some of Cyber's e-mail 
messages contain a provision purportedly allowing recipients to request that their names 
be deleted from mailing lists, customers complain that they are still receiving material 
from Cyber even after they make such requests, sometimes repeatedly, by e-mail and 
phone. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 27.) (Samples of complaints from AOL 
customers demonstrating the confusion caused by Cyber are at JA000277-284.)  
 
At times, Cyber has used forged return addresses containing AOL's mark "aol.com." 
(JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 28.) Because these advertisements did not correctly 
identify Cyber's ISP, mailings bearing the forged return addresses have been routed in 
mass quantities into AOL's postmaster workstation. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
28.) A forged return address is no more than an incorrect return address placed on the e-
mail message to hide the identity of the sender and/or its ISP, prevent the return of 
undeliverable messages, make it difficult or impossible for recipients to reply, and/or 
prevent the recipient from attempting to retaliate to offensive or objectionable e-mail. 
Undeliverable e-mail is trapped in AOL's computers. Cyber's conduct has harmed AOL 
and its e-mail system by overloading the workstation and by causing it to become 
damaged on multiple occasions for hours at a time. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
28.) This not only has prevented AOL from using its own equipment, but it has caused 
continuing hardware and software problems as well. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 
28.)  
 
Cyber has implicitly acknowledged the wrongfulness of its conduct by agreeing to the 
entry of a preliminary injunction prohibiting it from using a forged aol.com return 
address in its e-mail. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 29.) The stipulated injunction 
was signed by the lower court on April 11, 1996, and it was entered in the action filed by 
Cyber in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on April 29, 
1996. (JA000242, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 29.) (A copy of the preliminary injunction 
entered in the Virginia action is at JA000285-288.) Notwithstanding the entry of the 
preliminary injunction, Cyber has continued to use invalid return addresses. (JA000242, 
O'Donnell Decl. Para. 30.) (A sample of one such mailing which was sent after entry of 
the preliminary injunction is at JA000289-292.)  
 
The use of a forged AOL domain name enables Cyber to avoid having to handle the large 
volume of incorrectly addressed mail which would otherwise be returned to Cyber's 
server in the normal course and under Internet protocol. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. 
Para. 31.) In addition, it allows Cyber to avoid the large volume of complaints from 
people who do not wish to receive such mail. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 31.) By 
contrast, AOL personnel have been obliged to spend valuable time in fielding these 
complaints and in repairing the damage to AOL equipment and software caused by 
Cyber's activities. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 31.) Upon discovering the correct 
return addresses for many of the mix-addressed e-mail advertisements which had clogged 
AOL's system, AOL programmed its computers to automatically correct the addresses 
and return the e-mail to its source. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 32.) On information 
and belief, after learning that the returned e-mail had been sent by Cyber, some of Cyber's 
ISPs terminated Cyber's account. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 32.) Any such 
termination resulted from the conduct of Cyber in using forged return addresses on its e-
mail. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 33.) By insuring that the mix-addressed e-mail 
was returned to the proper source, AOL was merely following established Internet 
protocols. (JA000243, O'Donnell Decl. Para. 33.)  
 
By making unauthorized use of AOL's e-mail system, Cyber has caused incalculable 
damage to AOL's goodwill and its relationships with paying customers. (JA000410, 
Knowles Decl. Para. 6.) AOL customers have to pay for the online time associated with 
downloading or viewing Cyber's commercial messages. (JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 
6.) Moreover, AOL customers find the receipt of junk mail offensive. (JA000410, 
Knowles Decl. Para. 6.) Cyber's activities, referred to in Internet parlance as "spamming," 
result in hundreds of complaints per day to AOL. (JA000414, Ryan Decl. Para. 4.) (Just a 
small sampling of these complaints is at JA000416-444.)  
 
Against this picture of substantial damage to AOL is the stark fact that Cyber is 
judgment-proof. Cyber; its owner, Mr. Wallace; and Cyber's predecessor, Promo 
Enterprises, all commingle funds on a daily basis. (JA000446, Schiller Decl. Para. 6.) 
Cyber has no audited or reviewed financial statements. (JA000446, Schiller Decl. Para. 
6.) Mr. Wallace and his wife take and disburse funds from Cyber at will. (JA000446, 
Schiller Decl. Para. 4.) Mr. Wallace pays his personal expenses -- such as wedding 
deposits -- from Cyber funds. (JA000446, Schiller Decl. Para. 4.)  
 
Whenever possible, AOL attempts to block users who could damage its system or who 
violate its Terms of Service or Internet protocols, such as Cyber, from gaining access to 
its system. (JA000411, Knowles Decl. Para. 8.) Cyber has evaded AOL's blocking 
attempts in the past by using forged return mail addresses and by switching from one ISP 
to another in rapid succession. (JA000411, Knowles Decl. Para. 8.) Recently, AOL 
learned through independent sources of information that Cyber was using Servint, Inc., an 
ISP in Virginia, to send its e-mail. (JA000411, Knowles Decl. Para. 8.) AOL forwarded 
formal objections to Servint and advised it that it was violating Internet protocols and 
damaging AOL by allowing Cyber to continue to send millions of e-mail messages a day 
to AOL subscribers and through AOL's computers. (JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 5.) 
However, Servint has continued to allow Cyber to send massive quantities of e-mail in 
bulk. (JA000411, Knowles Decl. Para. 8.) Since AOL has no contractual or other 
relationship with Servint or Cyber, it has no obligation to accept e-mail sent to it from 
Servint or Cyber. (JA000411, Knowles Decl. Para. 8.) Therefore, AOL programmed its 
system to reject e-mail emanating from Servint. (JA000411, Knowles Decl. Para. 8.) In 
response, Cyber asked the lower court for a temporary restraining order and preliminary 
injunction forcing AOL to accept e-mail from Servint. On four hours' notice, the lower 
court required simultaneous briefs to be filed. Without a hearing, the lower court granted 
Cyber's request and issued an order "temporarily restrain[ing]" AOL, "until the time of 
trial," from blocking Cyber's e-mail to AOL members "who wish to receive the mail and 
from interfering in any manner with Cyber's business relationships with its Internet 
Service Providers."2/ A copy of the lower court's order is attached at the end of AOL's 
brief.  
 
 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
 
Before granting a motion for preliminary injunction, the district court had to find that 
Cyber had proved:  
 
(1) The likelihood that Cyber would prevail on the merits at a final hearing;  
 
(2) That Cyber would be irreparably injured by AOL's decision not to support Cyber's 
business;  
 
(3) That the injury to Cyber would outweigh any injury or cost imposed on AOL if the 
preliminary injunction were issued; and  
 
(4) The public interest would be served by requiring AOL to distribute Cyber's 
unsolicited messages.  
 
S&R Corp. v. Jiffy Lube Int'l., Inc., 968 F.2d 371, 374 (3d Cir. 1992). Further, "[a]ll four 
factors should favor preliminary relief before the injunction will issue." Id. The lower 
court was also required to comply with the procedural requirements of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure.  
 
Cyber has no constitutional, statutory or other legal rights to compel AOL to place its 
network or equipment at Cyber's disposal. AOL was clearly exercising its rights when it 
took steps to prevent Cyber from flooding AOL's members' home computers with 
unwanted commercial advertisements. AOL was and is a proprietary online company that 
has invested substantial sums in its own equipment, name, software and reputation. It 
does not act with any government assistance, does not function as, with or like a 
government, and does not perform a public function. There are, nevertheless, important 
First Amendment rights of AOL under attack by virtue of the lower court's order entered 
on September 5, 1996. The preliminary injunction not only restrains AOL from 
exercising its First Amendment rights, but also rests on the implicit assumption that the 
Constitution compels AOL to transmit or distribute Cyber's commercial messages -- free 
of charge. Cyber now contends that AOL has forfeited its constitutional rights because it 
did not obtain an injunction barring Cyber from engaging in its wrongful conduct earlier. 
(Cyber Mem. at 16-17.)3/ This argument misses the point entirely: it is not the mere fact 
that Cyber has sent e-mail that constitutes the First Amendment violation, but that there is 
now a court order compelling AOL to distribute and support speech with which it does 
not agree. And it is this issue that is before this Court on appeal.  
 
In substantial part, the same First Amendment considerations soundly undermine Cyber's 
contention that it could establish the first element that must be met before preliminary 
injunctive relief can be granted -- the likelihood that Cyber would prevail at a final 
hearing on any claim that it had the right to use AOL's property to barrage AOL members 
with unsolicited junk e-mail on a repeated, daily basis. Since Cyber had no legal right to 
force AOL to disseminate Cyber's unwanted commercial bulk e-mail in derogation of 
AOL's First Amendment rights, Cyber's claim on the merits is not likely to prevail. No 
other Cyber claim on the merits is supported in any manner by admissible evidence on 
the record.  
 
As for the second factor, Cyber's alleged irreparable harm, the only record evidence 
addressing the issue suggests that at best, Cyber will lose some money if it cannot 
trespass on AOL's computer network for the next few months or until the conclusion of 
the trial, apparently whichever comes later. Cyber will continue to earn substantial 
revenue selling millions of advertisements and sending them to hundreds of thousands of 
recipients who are not part of AOL's network. Indeed, over half of Cyber's revenue for 
the first seven months of this year did not even derive from its bulk e-mail advertising. 
(JA000447, Schiller Decl. Para. 10.) And Cyber now even admits that it can continue to 
overcome AOL's blocking attempts, characterizing its moves as a "cat and mouse game." 
(Cyber Mem. at 18.)  
 
The third factor, AOL's tremendous, undisputed irreparable harm to both its First 
Amendment rights and its precious good will and reputation, weighs heavily in favor of 
lifting the injunction. It is hornbook law that "loss of First Amendment freedoms, for 
even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Elrod v. 
Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S. Ct. 2673, 2690 (1976); Shea 930 F. Supp. at 935; ACLU, 929 
F. Supp. at 851. The daily beating to which AOL and its members is being subjected 
cannot and will not be remedied by any ultimate award or finding in its favor months 
from now, whenever the trial, possibly to be postponed, is completed.  
 
Finally, the public interest is clearly not served by Cyber's daily, unauthorized trampling 
of AOL's First Amendment rights and disregard of the interests of AOL's customers.  
 
The lower court has granted Cyber license to utilize AOL's property in order to bombard 
AOL members with millions of unsolicited commercial advertisements that cost AOL 
members money to review and delete, and that cost AOL incalculable damage in the form 
of tarnished good will and reputation and lost First Amendment freedoms. The four 
factors that the lower court was required to have reviewed before ordering such a drastic 
remedy all weigh strongly against the issuance of the injunction in the first place and 
when considered now by this Court, should compel that the order be vacated 
immediately.  
 
Finally, the lower court's order granting the injunction is also procedurally fatally 
defective in several respects. The order was entered without a hearing; is unsupported by 
findings of fact and conclusions of law; followed no notice to AOL that a multi-month 
injunction was at issue; was briefed on only four-hours notice, and failed to include even 
an opportunity for AOL to respond to Cyber's briefing, let alone cross-examine Cyber's 
one witness in a hearing.4/ For these procedural reasons alone, the order should also be 
vacated.  
 
 
ARGUMENT 
 
A. The Lower Court's Order Compels AOL to Carry Cyber's Speech in Violation of 
AOL's First Amendment Rights,  
 
The expansive language of the Court's September 5 order, constitutes a serious and 
fundamental abridgment of AOL's constitutional rights. The terms of that order compel 
AOL not only to sponsor Cyber's unsolicited commercial messages, but also to bear the 
cost of distributing those messages. In addition, since many of Cyber's messages contain 
explicit adult content, AOL is being forced to engage in conduct that is offensive and 
insulting to many of its paid members, many of whom allow their children to use AOL 
and to maintain mail boxes on AOL. It has become a daily occurrence for AOL to receive 
customer complaints and account cancellations by customers specifically stating that 
Cyber's advertisements are the reason for the complaints and cancellations. "Compelled 
access like that ordered in this case both penalizes the expression of particular points of 
view and forces speakers to alter their speech to conform with an agenda they did not 
set." Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public Utils. Comm'n of California, 475 U.S. 1, 106 S. 
Ct. 903, 908 (plurality opinion), reh'g denied, 975 U.S. 1133, 106 S. Ct. 1667 (1986). 
Under Supreme Court jurisprudence, the district court's order cannot survive 
constitutional scrutiny.  
 
At issue in Pacific Gas was an order of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 
that a utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, allow the consumer group, Toward Utility 
Rate Normalization (TURN), to use the "extra space" in the billing envelopes -- deemed 
by PUC to be the property of the ratepayers -- which Pacific Gas distributed to its 
customers. Id. at 5, 106 S. Ct. at 906. The so-called "extra space" consisted of the space 
or weight left in the utility's billing envelopes before additional postage would have been 
required. Accordingly, use of that "extra space" or weight would be free in the sense that 
it would not impose a postage cost on the utility.5/ TURN had requested that PUC 
prohibit Pacific Gas from using its envelopes to disseminate political editorials contained 
in its newsletter, and in a compromise effort, PUC ordered that TURN could use the 
"extra space" four times a year for two years. Id at 5-6, 106 S. Ct. at 906.  
 
The Supreme Court held that the utility's newsletter was protected under the First 
Amendment, id. at 8-9, 106 S. Ct. at 907-08, and although PUC had acknowledged this 
protection, it erred in finding no violation of Pacific Gas' constitutional rights, reasoning 
(erroneously) that the mere fact that the utility could still deliver its newsletter during 
those months in which TURN was not using the envelopes eliminated any constitutional 
violation. Id. at 9, 106 S. Ct. at 908. Consequently, the Supreme Court reversed PUC's 
order.  
 
The Court noted the penal nature of PUC's actions, holding that " [c]ompelled access like 
that ordered in this case both penalizes the expression of particular points of view and 
forces speakers to alter their speech to conform with an agenda they do not set." Id. at 
909, 106 S. Ct. at 908. The Court reviewed its prior treatment in the area of compelled 
access, id (citing, inter alia, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 258, 
94 S. Ct. 2831 (1974); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, S. Ct. 1428 (1977); PruneYard 
Shopping Ctr. v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 100 S. Ct. 2035 (1980); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. 
Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U.S. 376, 93 S. Ct. 2553 (1973) (Stewart, J., dissenting)), 
emphasizing that ""'[t]he essential thrust of the First Amendment is to prohibit improper 
restraints on the voluntary public expression of ideas .... There is necessarily ... a 
concomitant freedom not to speak publicly, one which serves the same ultimate end as 
freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect,'"" Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 11, 106 S. Ct. at 
909 (citing, inter alia, Harper & Row Publishers. Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 
559, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 2230, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985)) (emphasis in original). For example, 
the Court had previously invalidated the right-of-reply statute in Tornillo for its 
interference with the newspaper's "editorial control and judgment" to remain silent when 
it wanted to. Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258, 94 S. Ct. at 2840 (cited in Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 
10, 106 S. Ct. at 908-09).  
 
PUC's order limited access to those who disagreed with the views expressed by Pacific 
Gas in its newsletter and who opposed Pacific Gas in proceedings before PUC. Id., at 13, 
106 S. Ct. at 910. The "one-sidedness" of the order, the Court held, "reduc[ed] the free 
flow of information and ideas that the First Amendment seeks to promote." Id at 13-14, 
106 S. Ct. at 910. While acknowledging that Pacific Gas did not "have the right to be free 
from vigorous debate," the Court held that the utility did have the "right to be free from 
government restrictions that abridge its own rights in order to 'enhance the relative voice' 
of its opponents." Id. at 14, 106 S. Ct. at 910 (citing Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 49 & 
n.55, 96 S. Ct. 612, 639 & n.55 (1976)).  
 
The Court also noted that PUC's order unconstitutionally required Pacific Gas to affiliate 
with speech with which it might disagree, thus either giving the appearance that Pacific 
Gas agreed with the views of TURN or unfairly compelling Pacific Gas to respond. Id. at 
15, 106 S. Ct. at 911. The Court admonished:  
 
 
That kind of forced response is antithetical to the free discussion that the First 
Amendment seeks to foster.... For corporations as for individuals, the choice to speak 
includes within it the choice of what not to say. And we have held that speech does not 
lose its protection because of the corporate identity of the speaker.  
 
 
Id. at 16, 106 S. Ct. at 911-12 (citations and footnote omitted). Recalling that in Wooley 
v. Maynard the Court had prohibited New Hampshire from requiring its citizens to "'use 
their private property [their license plates] as a mobile billboard' for the State's 
ideological message," the Court in Pacific Gas censured PUC for its order that Pacific 
Gas use its property -- the envelopes, the bills and newsletter -- "as a vehicle for 
spreading a message with which it disagrees." 475 U.S. at 17, 106 S. Ct. at 912. 
Consequently, the Court vacated PUC's order as an impermissible burden because it 
forced Pacific Gas to affiliate with the views of others and selected speakers for their 
viewpoints. I.d. at 20, 106 S. Ct. at 914.  
 
Pacific Gas guides this Court's analysis of the First Amendment issues here. In this case, 
the First Amendment implications are even more compelling because AOL is not a public 
utility, but is instead a proprietary, private online network; and because the speech the 
district court's order compels AOL to carry consists of commercial advertisements, and 
not the political editorials at issue in Pacific Gas. As the Pacific Gas Court held, AOL has 
the constitutional "freedom not to speak publicly," 475 U.S. at 11, 106 S. Ct. at 909, and 
the district court's order requiring AOL to allow Cyber access to its network in effect 
"reduc[es] the free flow of information and ideas that the First Amendment seeks to 
promote," ii at 13-14, 106 S. Ct. at 910. The constitution not only protects AOL's voice 
but its "choice of what not to say" on its privately-owned network. This protection is 
guaranteed against the type of restraint imposed by the district court, whose order has the 
continuing, impermissible effect to "'enhance the relative voice' of its opponent[]," Cyber, 
at AOL's expense, see Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 14, 106 S. Ct. at 910. "indeed this general 
rule, that the speaker has the right to tailor the speech, applies not only to expressions of 
value, opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the speaker would rather 
avoid.... Nor is the rule's benefit restricted to the press, being enjoyed by business 
corporations generally and by ordinary people engaged in unsophisticated expression as 
well as by professional publishers." See Hurley v. Irish-American Gay. Lesbian and 
Bisexual Group of Boston, 115 S. Ct. 2338, 2347-48 (1995) (First Amendment was 
violated by state court's interpretation of public accommodation law to require private 
organization to admit parade group expressing message with which organizers disagreed). 
The reasoning of Hurley and Pacific Gas controls:  
 
 
Since all speech inherently involves choices of 'what to say and what to leave unsaid,' 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. I, 11, 106 S. Ct. 
903, 909, 89 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original), one important 
manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also 
decide 'what not to say.' Id. at 16, 106 S. Ct. at 912.  
 
 
Hurley, 115 S. Ct. at 2347 (emphasis in original); see also Great Rivers Coop. of 
Southeast Iowa v. Farmland Indus., Inc., 59 F.3d 764, 766 (8th Cir. 1995) ("Requiring 
publication of a rebuttal is a form of enforced speech, which is rarely, if ever, 
appropriate.").  
 
Indeed, as the Hurley Court noted: 
 
 
a private speaker does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining 
multifarious voices, or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message as the 
exclusive subject matter of the speech. Nor, under our precedent, does First Amendment 
protection require a speaker to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the 
communication.  
 
 
Hurley, 115 S. Ct. at 2345. The state court's interpretation of the public accommodation 
law in Hurley to require the private parade organizers to allow the gay group to march 
unfairly compelled the organizers to "alter the message" of the parade by including a 
message of which the organizers disapproved. Such a disagreement "does not legitimize 
use of the Commonwealth's power" under the First Amendment.  Id. at 2351.  
 
In its memorandum dated September 18, 1996, in opposition to AOL's request for a stay 
in the district court, Cyber attempts to distinguish Pacific Gas and Hurley on one and 
only one ground -- that AOL is not being compelled to place any advertising on its closed 
commercial system or put Cyber's bulk e-mail ads on pop-up screens viewed by AOL 
customers every time they log on to AOL, but that instead "AOL is merely providing a 
conduit . . . to its membership...." (Cyber Mem. at 14.) This is a distinction without a 
difference. Cyber is essentially contending that because the lower court's order compels 
AOL to disseminate unwanted messages in only one manner, it is in essence less 
unconstitutional than if it compelled AOL to disseminate the unwanted advertising in 
other manners as well. The order is impermissible even if it could be theoretically 
broadened to make it even more unconstitutional. In Pacific Gas, the PUC's order was 
struck down even though it was the result of an effort at compromise and even though it 
compelled unwanted speech just four times a year, not six or twelve times. Significantly, 
Cyber concedes that the order compels AOL to use its resources to disseminate Cyber's 
mail by being "a conduit." The envelope at issue in Pacific Gas just four times a year was 
also a mere "conduit," but this was more than enough to fail constitutional muster. The 
same must be true here.6/  
 
Cyber makes one other contention in opposing AOL's constitutional argument. Cyber 
contends that AOL somehow waived its First Amendment rights by not seeking a court 
injunction many months ago. This misses the point entirely that the abridgment of AOL's 
rights does not result merely from Cyber's attempts to send unwanted bulk e-mail, but 
instead from the court order compelling AOL to be Cyber's conduit and to disseminate 
against its will Cyber's information. The impermissible state action is, of course, the 
order, just as it was the PUC order in Pacific Gas that was at issue in that case.7/  
 
Although AOL operates through a different medium than does the cable television 
operator, this court should likewise scrutinize for First Amendment implications the 
district court's Order which "affects communication of information and ideas." Cf. 
Midwest Video Corp. v. F.C.C., 571 F.2d 1025 (8th Cir. 1978), aff'd on other grounds, 
440 U.S. 689, 995 S. Ct. 1435 (1979); ACLU v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824, 872 (E.D. Pa. 
1996) (Dalzell, J.) ("The Internet is a new medium of mass communication. As such, the 
Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence compels us to consider the special 
qualities of this new medium in determining whether the [Communications Decency Act 
of 1996 at issue] is a constitutional exercise of governmental power.")  
 
The order directly impedes AOL's ability to publish that information and those ideas of 
its own selection and improperly makes paramount the interests of Cyber, over those of 
AOL, in distributing its speech. Under Pacific Gas and Hurley, this is clearly an error of 
constitutional magnitude. The right to speak "does not include every individual's right to 
be given the possibility of an audience by government fiat, or to speak in a non-public 
forum." Midwest Video, 571 F.2d at 1054. Restrictions on the freedom to speak are even 
more limited in a private forum, such as on AOL's network. Yet, the district court failed 
to acknowledge this, and by requiring AOL to hold open its doors to allow access to 
Cyber and its bulk advertising, the lower court, like the FCC, silenced AOL's First 
Amendment rights.  
 
The district court has completely ignored AOL's prerogative, as a private commercial 
online service, to select its own members, determine what speech may occur on its 
network and retain the option to reject unauthorized junk e-mails distributed en masse. 
The "exercise of editorial control and judgment" by AOL in this case deserves no less 
protection than that provided to other private communication entities. See, e.g., Miami 
Herald Publ. Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S. Ct. 2831, 2840 (1974) ("It has yet 
to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process [the exercise of 
editorial control and judgment] can be exercised consistent with First Amendment 
guarantees of a free press"); cf. Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 303 94 
S. Ct. 2714, 2718 (1974) (plurality opinion) (no First Amendment violation where city 
refused to allow certain advertising because, "[i]n much the same way that a newspaper 
or periodical, or even a radio or television station, need not accept every proffer of 
advertising from the general public," the city was free to reject the appellant's 
advertisements).  
 
That Cyber's messages constitute commercial speech, and indeed advertisements (some 
of which contain adult content) that most of AOL's subscribers find offensive, heightens 
even more the urgency of the issue. See, e.g., Pacific Gas, 106 S. Ct. at 908; Hurley, 115 
S. Ct. at 2347-48. Such First Amendment freedoms, upheld consistently by the United 
States Supreme Court, are clearly violated by the lower court's order. Because AOL is not 
a state actor, it cannot be subject to the demands of the First Amendment. Hudgens, 
supra. AOL is a privately owned company running a private online e-mail system. AOL 
is neither a government agency or entity, nor a company town. It owns no public 
property; performs no governmental or municipal services, functions or powers; and 
exercises no governmental or municipal powers. (JA000233, Boe Decl. Para. 4.) The 
mere fact that users of the Internet are able to send e-mail to AOL's subscribers, 
(JA000233, Boe Decl. Para. 5), is completely insufficient under the law to render AOL's 
online system a public forum, because "property does [not] lose its private character 
merely because the public is generally invited to use it for designated purposes." Lloyd 
Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.S. 551, 569, 92 S. Ct. 2219, 2229 (1972); see also Greer v. Spock, 
424 U.S. 828, 836, 96 S. Ct. 1211, 1216 (1976) (even if property is government owned or 
operated, a public forum is not created just because "members of the public are permitted 
freely to visit" there). Because the AOL online system is private property, involving no 
government intervention or entanglement, AOL may properly select those users with 
whom it chooses to do business. Under the Constitution, AOL may also refuse 
communication access to its private property to uninvited individuals or entities.  
 
Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that "an uninvited guest may [not] exercise general 
rights of free speech on property privately owned." Lloyd Corp., 407 U.S. at 568, 92 S. 
Ct. at 2228. A speaker's rights under the First Amendment are the "weakest" where the 
property at issue is privately owned. Armes v. City of Philadelphia, 706 F. Supp. 1156, 
1164 (E.D. Pa. 1989), aff'd,, 897 F.2d 520 (3d Cir. 1990). The First Amendment 
guarantees no absolute right to trespass, and a private property owner has the fundamental 
right to exclude others. Id. Even in the context of a government activity/public forum case 
where the scrutiny and test are far more stringent than here, the Supreme Court has 
analyzed the mailbox issue -- an analogous situation, Cyber would no doubt claim -- in 
reasoning that makes clear that Cyber has no First Amendment right at issue here, but 
AOL does. See United States Postal Serv. v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Ass'ns, 453 
U.S. 57, 101 S. Ct. 2676 (1981). In Council of Greenburgh, the Court rejected a First 
Amendment attack of a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1725, which prohibited the deposit 
of mail by the sender directly into a letterbox without the payment of postage, even 
though the Postal Service was not being used even to deliver the unstamped mail. There, 
the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Postal Service's threatened 
enforcement of the statute following the plaintiffs' continual placement of unstamped 
notices and pamphlets in the mailboxes of private homes. 453 U.S. at 116, 101 S. Ct. at 
267879. The plaintiffs contended that the First Amendment protected their activity. 14. at 
126-27, 101 S. Ct. at 2684.[8/]  
 
In reviewing the constitutionality of the statute, the Court explained that simply because a 
letterbox is part of the Postal Service's nationwide system for the delivery and receipt of 
mail, it does not metamorphose into a First Amendment-protected "public forum. " Id. at 
128, 101 S. Ct. at 2684-85. In using the Postal Service, customers agree to follow the 
rules of the Postal Service in exchange for the Postal Service's agreement to deliver and 
retrieve the customer's mail. L. The Court then rejected the argument that a First 
Amendment right attached to the plaintiffs' deposit of notices and flyers in such a 
letterbox because it was "more efficient" to do so, and analogized the letterbox to a 
military base, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 96 S. Ct. 1211 (1976), a jail or prison, 
Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 87 S. Ct. 242 (1966), and advertising space in rapid 
transit vehicles owned by a city --Lehman, supra -- properties access to which the Court 
had previously held was not constitutionally guaranteed simply because they are 
government-owned or controlled. Id. Moreover, there was no support in history or the 
Constitution to warrant classifying the letterbox as a public forum. Like the private 
property owner, the Court held, the government could also exercise its powers to protect 
the property it controlled for its legally devoted uses. Id.; 9 see also Adderley, supra, 
(same).  
 
 
B. Cyber Cannot Meet Its Substantial Burden of Proving Likelihood of Success on the 
Merits at Trial.  
 
1. The Order Unconstitutionally Infringes AOL's First Amendment Rights.  
 
The same authorities that compel the conclusion that the lower court's order 
impermissibly compels AOL to carry Cyber's speech in violation AOL's First 
Amendment rights also undermine completely the contention by Cyber that it met or can 
meet its substantial burden of proving likelihood of success on the merits at trial. For the 
same policies, reasons and principals articulated by the Supreme Court in Pacific Gas and 
Hurley, Cyber will not meet its high burden.  
 
Because the Supreme Court precedent clearly permits AOL to refuse Cyber's speech, 
Cyber has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, and the preliminary 
injunction should be vacated.10/  
 
 
2. Cyber Has No First Amendment or Statutory Right to Send Bulk E-Mail Advertising 
to AOL Subscribers Via AOL's E-Mail System.  
 
As the owner and operator of its proprietary network, AOL has the right and authority to 
establish conditions for sending advertisements to its users, and to protect its users and its 
own system from unwanted bulk e-mail advertisements. This right to limit advertising on 
its network flows from AOL's status as the operator of a private commercial online 
service. Indeed, in the absence of a constitutional or statutory requirement that 
commercial online services carry advertisements of third parties, AOL, like other 
property owners, is free to determine what speech may occur on its property -- in this case 
its network. For this reason, AOL may enforce the Terms of Service Agreement its users 
have entered into, and may impose similar conditions upon others who choose to use its 
network.  
 
 
a. Cyber Has No First Amendment Right to Force its Advertising on AOL Because 
AOL's Block Is Not State Action.  
 
It is hornbook law that "the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only 
against abridgment by government, federal or state." Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 
513 ( 1976). Absent state action, "the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no 
part to play" where a private property owner limits expression. Id. at 521; Cable 
Investments. Inc. v. Wooley, 867 F.2d 151, 161-62 (3d Cir. 1989) (cable company has no 
First Amendment right to provide service to tenants in private apartment complex). 
Cyber's state action claim presupposes that there is a First Amendment right to be 
protected, and this is not true when it comes to Cyber's conduct at issue. There is no basis 
for a claim that Cyber is engaging in protected First Amendment activity, or that its bulk 
advertisements would justify constitutional protection in any event. In short, no Cyber 
First Amendment right is being infringed in the first place. But even if Cyber were 
arguendo to be considered to have some First Amendment right at issue, it still could not 
enforce such a putative right against AOL.  
 
AOL is plainly not a state actor. AOL is a private company whose stock was publicly 
traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. (JA000232, Boe Decl.Para. 2.)11/ It operates a 
private network distinct from the Internet containing unique content, as well as offering 
users unusually simple access to the Internet. (JA000232, Boe Decl. Para. 2.) Private 
companies compete with AOL in this business, but the government is not even a 
competitor, much less the exclusive provider of the service. (JA000232, Boe Decl. Para. 
2.) Furthermore, the government has no involvement in the management of AOL, or in 
AOL's business decisions, including the establishment of the company's prohibition 
against unauthorized e-mail advertising. (JA000232, Boe Decl. Para. 2.)  
 
Cyber's amended complaint offers no support for the notion that AOL or its e-mail 
system are somehow state actors. It merely asserts that the Internet "was at one time used 
primarily by governmental and academic institutions as a possible means of 
communication if conventional communication means were rendered inactive," 
(JA000102, Am. Compl. Para. 14), while explicitly conceding, by stating that no one 
owns the Internet, that the government is not the owner. The Complaint alleges no further 
facts supporting state action. Cyber's only other contention on AOL's alleged status as a 
state actor is that AOL has "jointly participated with the government" by "ultimately 
seeking a court order" in the litigation through a trial. (Cyber Mem. at 12-13.) This 
misses the critical point that the injunction, and this appeal, have absolutely nothing to do 
with AOL's defenses and claims below, but instead relate solely to the court order 
obtained by Cyber, not AOL, compelling the dissemination of unwanted speech by AOL. 
It is Cyber, not AOL, that obtained the court order (or government participation) central 
to both the injunction and the appeal.  
 
In its initial stages, the Internet was an experiment of Advanced Research Project Agency 
("ARPA") called ARPANET and linking computers and networks of belonging to the 
military, defense contractors and the, labs at universities. ACLU, 929 F. Supp. at 83 1; 
Shea 930 F. Supp. at 925-26. Through time, researchers around the world gained direct 
access to the "supercomputers" at labs and universities, and ARPANET eventually 
became the "Internet," after being linked with networks similar to ARPANET. ACLU, 
929 F. Supp at 831-32; see also Shea, 930 F. Supp. at 926. No single entity -- academic, 
corporate, governmental, or non-profit -administers the Internet. It exists and functions as 
a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and 
computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to 
exchange communications and information with other computers (which in turn exchange 
communications and information with still other computers). There is no centralized 
storage location, control point, or communications channel for the Internet, and it would 
not be technically feasible for a single entity to control all of the information conveyed on 
the Internet.  
 
"[C]onstitutional standards are invoked only when it can be said that the [government] is 
responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains." Blum v. Yaretsky, 
457 U.S. 991, 1004, 102 S. Ct. 2777, 2786 (1982) (emphasis in original). As the Third 
Circuit explained in Groman v. Township of Manalpan:  
 
 
A private action is not converted into one under color of state law merely by some 
tenuous connection to state action. The issue is . . . whether the action taken can be fairly 
attributed to the state itself. Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 351, 955 
S. Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). As the Supreme Court has stated, "we ask 
whether the State provided a mantle of authority that enhanced the power of the harm-
causing individual actor." NCAA v. Tarkanian, 488 U.S. 179, 192, 109 S. Ct. 454, 462, 
102 L.Ed.2d 469 (1988).  
 
 
47 F.3d 628, 638-39 (3d Cir. 1995). 
 
The Third Circuit analyzes state action questions through three discrete tests used in 
various Supreme Court state action decisions. These are:  
 
 
(1) Does the private entity exercise powers that are traditionally the exclusive prerogative 
of the state.  
 
(2) Has the private entity acted with the help of or in concert with state officials. [and]  
 
(3) Has the state so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private 
entity that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.  
 
 
Sullivan v. Barnett, 913 F. Supp. 895, 899 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (summarizing Mark v. 
Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (3d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 165 
(1995)). AOL is clearly not a state actor under any of these standards.  
 
The exclusive government function standard "is limited, reaching only those activities 
that have been 'traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State.'" Groman, 47 F.3d at 
640 (quoting Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 842 (1982)) (emphasis in original). 
As this Court recently noted, "[t]he [Supreme] Court . . . [has] rarely found that plaintiffs 
had met that rigorous standard." Mark, 51 F.3d at 1142. Receiving government support or 
performing a public function are insufficient to make an entity a state actor. Groman, 47 
F.3d at 640. Even heavily regulated utilities with at least partial monopoly statue,12/ 
private government-funded schools providing special education of maladjusted high 
school students,13/ or private contractors providing school bus transportation for public 
school students14/ have been held not to be engaged in an "exclusive" government 
function. Mark, 51 F.3d at 1142. Proprietary network services, including e-mail, are not 
even a government function, and come nowhere near satisfying the exclusive government 
function test.  
 
Nor does the amended complaint allege that AOL "'acted with the help of or in concert 
with state officials.'" Id. (quoting McKeesport Hosp. v. Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Educ., 24 F.3d 519, 524 (3d Cir. 1994)). It is undisputed that AOL's 
policy with regard to unauthorized e-mail was its own; not the government's.15/ And 
there has been no evidence offered in the lower court to suggest that AOL has received 
any government support in its dispute with Cyber, in any way, shape or form. Nor could 
there be such evidence. since the only conduct at issue and complained of by Cyber is 
AOL's, not the government's, and indeed AOL's attempt to rid itself of Cyber by self-help 
has been the frequent subject of Cyber complaints and criticisms. (JA000021, Cyber's 
Complaint Para. 38 and JA000107, Amended Complaint Para. 38.) As noted above, the 
only government participation in the form of a court order was that obtained by Cyber, 
not AOL. In any event, even if Cyber could, arguendo, point to alleged government 
assistance, and it cannot, there has never been a credible claim from Cyber that the level 
of such government activity would ever rise to the level constitutionally required by this 
Court of "coercive power" or "such significant encouragement . . . that the choice must in 
law be deemed that of the State." Boyle, 925 F.2d at 76.  
 
Finally, AOL is not a state actor under the joint participation test. The test applies to 
"situations in which '[t]he State has so far insinuated itself into a position of 
interdependence with . . . [the acting party] that it must be recognized as a joint 
participant in the challenged activity.'" Mark, 51 F.3d at 1142 (quoting Burton v. 
Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 725 (1961)); see also Groman, 47 F.3d at 628 
("[T]he interdependence between the state and private actor must be pronounced before 
the law will transform the private actor into a state actor."). There are no record facts that 
in no way support a theory that the government was a joint participant in AOL's policy 
regarding unauthorized e-mail communications or its response to them. Indeed, the 
amended complaint fails even to mention the government once amid its lengthy 
allegations about the conduct giving rise to its injury. (JA000105-110, Am. Compl. at 
Paras. 31-55.) Because Cyber does not allege, and has obviously failed to prove, that the 
"Government can or does exert any influence over" AOL's policies with respect to 
unauthorized e-mail, this theory too is entirely inapposite. See San Francisco Arts & 
Athletics v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522, 547 n.29, 107 S. Ct. 2971 n.29 (1987) 
(no government action where federal government did not control the allegedly 
discriminatory actions of the U.S. Olympic Committee); Groman, 47 F.3d at 642 (finding 
that government-funded rescue squad did not act under color of state law because it "did 
not have its professional decisions dictated or guided by the State.").16/  
 
For all these reasons, AOL is not a state actor, and Cyber has no First Amendment right 
to send unauthorized bulk e-mail advertisements to e-mail addresses on AOL's 
network.17/  
 
 
b. Cyber Has No Statutory Right to Advertise on AOL's System.  
 
Cyber also has no statutory right to send bulk e-mail to and through AOL's system. 
Congress has declined to make proprietary network service providers and Internet service 
providers common carriers subject to regulation under Title II of the Telecommunications 
Act. Indeed, in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress expressly stated that "It is 
the policy of the United States . . . to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market 
that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by 
Federal and State regulation." 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230(b) & (b)(2) (emphasis added).18/ This 
statement is consistent with FCC treatment of proprietary network providers and Internet 
service providers as enhanced services exempt from common carrier regulation under 47 
C.F.R. Sec. 64.702(a). Thus, neither proprietary network service providers. such as AOL, 
nor Internet service providers are under a regulatory or statutory obligation to offer 
carriage to individuals or entities that wish to send e-mail over their systems.  
 
In fact, far from imposing common carrier obligations on proprietary network and 
Internet service providers, Congress gave these providers immunity from civil liability 
under state and federal law for restricting access to harassing or objectionable content. 
This grant of immunity applies broadly to "any action voluntarily taken in good faith to 
restrict access to or availability of material that the provider . . . considers to be . . . 
harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally 
protected." 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230(c)(2)(A).[19/] Plainly, therefore, AOL is under no 
statutory obligation to carry Cyber's unauthorized, bulk e-mails.  
 
 
B. Cyber Failed to Meet its Burden of Proof of Irreparable Harm Without the Injunction.  
 
Before the district court, Cyber did not prove that it would suffer irreparable harm if AOL 
refuses to permit it to continue to bombard AOL with e-mail. At most, Cyber alleged that 
the injunction was necessary to prevent Cyber from losing money before trial. It is well 
settled that " [e]conomic loss does not constitute irreparable harm." Acierno v. New 
Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994). In order to warrant a preliminary 
injunction, "the injury created by a failure to issue the requested injunction 'must be of a 
peculiar nature, so that compensation in money cannot atone for it.'" Id. (citation 
omitted). Moreover, "more than a risk of irreparable harm must be demonstrated. The 
requisite for injunctive relief has been characterized as a 'clear showing of immediate 
irreparable injury.'" Continental Group, Inc. v. Amoco Chems. Corp., 614 F.2d 351, 358 
(3d Cir. 1980) (citation omitted).  
 
Here, even if Cyber could prove that it would be likely to succeed on the merits -- which 
it plainly has not and cannot -- its claim for injunctive relief should have been rejected 
because Cyber did not (and cannot) show that AOL's conduct will cause it irreparable 
harm. As an initial matter, according to a recent profit and loss statement produced by 
Cyber, (JA000449-452), more than half of Cyber's revenues this year have been derived 
from activities that do not involve the dissemination of junk e-mail. Moreover, according 
to Mr. Wallace's testimony at his deposition, Cyber's mailing list includes the addresses 
of more that 300,000 people who are not AOL customers. And, according to Mr. 
Wallace, this number of non-AOL addresses is increasing daily. Cyber's ability to send its 
e-mail to these hundreds of thousands of people is not affected at all by AOL's refusal to 
receive Cyber's e-mail. At best, therefore, Cyber might show that its inability to send e-
mail to AOL's customers will cost it some money. It cannot credibly contend that AOL's 
conduct will cause it harm that could not be compensated by money damages. Cyber has 
never contended that AOL does not have the revenue or resources to pay a judgment if, 
arguendo, Cyber could even obtain one against it.  
 
Cyber has recently contended that although it is capable of circumventing AOL's attempts 
to block it from sending block commercial e-mail to AOL members, it still has a right to 
the injunction so that it is not "forced into a losing cat and mouse game in which AOL 
blocks the mail from one site, Cyber must then scramble to find a way to get out its mail 
from another site. only to find that AOL will then block the new site." (Cyber Mem. at 
18.) Cyber concedes, then, that even AOL's persistent efforts at blocking it at most 
prolong what Cyber characterizes as a "game." This is not a game. It has cost, damage, 
inconvenience and burden to AOL and its members. But the mere fact that Cyber admits 
that it can circumvent the block, even while expending resources to do so, betrays the fact 
that AOL's block could not possibly have imposed irreparable harm on Cyber, and its 
statements to the court below to the contrary were, to be most generous, premature and 
over-stated. Therefore, Cyber cannot prove that AOL's conduct will cause it harm "'of a 
peculiar nature, so that compensation in money cannot atone for it ....'" Acierno, 40 F.3d 
at 653 (citations omitted).  
 
 
C. AOL Suffers Tremendous Harm Each Day the Injunction Remains in Force.  
 
As discussed above, AOL's important First Amendment freedoms have been blatantly 
undermined as a result of the lower court's order forcing AOL to publish Cyber's get-rich-
quick schemes, miracle diet come-ons, adult videos, and other unsolicited commercial 
advertisements. This is per se irreparable harm, which in itself renders erroneous the 
lower court's apparent conclusion that the harm to AOL is somehow less compelling than 
the alleged harm Cyber claims would result without the injunction. The United States 
Supreme Court put it succinctly: "The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even 
minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Elrod v. Burns, 
427 U.S. 347, 96 S. Ct. 2673, 2690 (1976) (emphasis added); see also Shea, 930 F. Supp. 
at 935 (same; construing Communications Decency Act section making criminal the 
sending or displaying of certain sexual material); ACLU, 929 F. Supp. at 851 (same).  
 
In addition to the continuing abridgment of AOL's constitutional rights, AOL suffers (on 
a daily basis, millions of messages at a time) tremendous damage to its good will and 
reputation. Good will and reputation are precious commodities whose importance cannot 
be overstated and, importantly, damage to which is difficult, if not impossible, to restore. 
Moreover, because the facts developed thus far indicate that Cyber may very well be 
judgment- proof, any later award of money damages against Cyber would be 
meaningless. This problem is further compounded by the lower court's failure to require 
Cyber -- a company that admits to substantial revenue, numerous non-AOL customers, 
the ability to overcome any AOL block of Cyber's e-mail through its self-described "cat 
and mouse games", and even some cash on hand -- to post a meaningful bond. With each 
passing day, AOL suffers incalculable damage to its good will and reputation and 
ongoing abridgment of its First Amendment freedoms. On the facts and the law, this 
criterion for the grant of injunctive relief, the extent to which the party bound by the 
proposed injunction will be harmed, clearly weighs heavily in favor of lifting the 
injunction.  
 
 
D. The Public Interest Clearly Favors Lifting the Injunction.  
 
Cyber cannot show that granting its motion for a preliminary injunction would be in the 
public interest. Abridging First Amendment rights and forcing AOL and millions of its 
customers to be subjected, on a daily basis, to unwanted advertisements for aphrodisiacs, 
"Dream Girls" adult videos, and get-rich-quick schemes is hardly in the public 
interest.20/  
 
Cyber's very recent attempt to trivialize the public policy impact of the lower court's 
order on AOL by characterizing it simply as an "opt on/opt off" issue is overly simplistic 
and disingenuous. First, the lower court's order fails to define who bears the burden of 
determining the few AOL customers who allegedly "wish" to receive the bulk e-mail, but 
given the way the computer hardware and software work, AOL does not have the 
technical ability to make the cut for Cyber. Second, even if AOL had the hypothetical 
technical capability, no doubt Cyber would interpret the vague order differently than 
AOL and further litigation would result. Although the scope of the lower court's order is 
imprecise, the implications of AOL's action that could later be adjudicated a mix-step in 
violation of the order by the lower court are enormous. Third, not even the "opt off" 
procedure Cyber touts actually works. The complaints from the many who repeatedly 
attempt to opt out and still get barraged by Cyber are legion. (JA000416-444.) Fourth, not 
even the so-called opt off procedure can eliminate or even lessen the tremendous 
hardware and software expense and damage occasioned by Cyber's mass of 
undeliverables, which use up precious AOL resources regardless of whether they can 
ultimately be returned to Cyber.  
 
And finally, as a constitutional matter, Cyber has no First Amendment right to force AOL 
by court order to impose an opt out task on its proprietary system's customers. This would 
impose a costly and time-consuming burden on both AOL and its customers, with 
nonexistent or de minimis probative value in any event. It does not follow that just 
because AOL states that its opt out procedure works that it does work. In fact, it does not. 
(JA000410, Knowles Decl. Para. 6.) The opt out procedure would necessitate the use of 
AOL resources for free to Cyber at least once for each AOL member. The old "one free 
bite" rule from dog bite cases, see, e.g., Deardorff v. Burger, 414 Pa. Super. 45, 606 A.2d 
489, alloc. denied, 532 Pa. 655, 615 A.2d 1312 (1992), does not apply here. And even if a 
member did not affirmatively respond or attempt to respond to the putative opt out offer, 
that does not mean that the member actually desires to receive the bulk e-mail, 
relentlessly, every day. It is likely to mean that the customer is simply switching to an 
AOL competitor rather than fight on his or her own with Cyber. Accordingly, the public 
interest factor, too, weighs against granting Cyber a preliminary injunction.  
 
 
E. In any Event, for Procedural Reasons Alone, the Lower Court's September 5 Order 
Should be Immediately Vacated.  
 
As discussed above, the four factors that the lower court was required to consider in 
determining whether to enter a preliminary injunction against AOL all weigh strongly in 
favor of denying the injunction request. Therefore, the injunction should be immediately 
vacated, and the record set straight that AOL's ability to adopt and enforce its owns 
policies and procedures for the use of its own proprietary computer network shall remain 
unhindered by the lower court pending a full trial on the merits. Just as significantly, 
however, because of the manner in which the lower court heard and ruled upon Cyber's 
injunction request, the order entering the injunction is procedurally defective, which in 
itself compels that the order be promptly set aside.  
 
Except in the most unusual cases, Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
requires the Court to conduct a hearing on an application for a preliminary injunction. See 
1 lA Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2947 (2d ed. 1995). A 
district court should decline to hold a hearing and decide a motion for a preliminary 
injunction on affidavits and documentary evidence only when the facts are undisputed 
and the relevant factual issues are resolved. See Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 910 
F.2d 1172, 1175-76 (3d Cir. 1990). Here, on Friday, August 30, after giving AOL less 
than an hour's notice that it intended to seek injunctive relief, Cyber made its motion for a 
temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction orally during a telephone 
conference with the Court between approximately 10:30 and 11:00 a.m. The Court then 
ordered that the parties submit briefs and affidavits on the motion before the end of the 
day. Moreover, AOL never had the opportunity to respond to any arguments made by 
Cyber or to contest the self-serving, one-sided affidavit of Cyber Promotion's President, 
Sanford Wallace, even though Cyber had the burden of proof on all elements for 
extraordinary injunctive relief. On approximately four hours' notice, simultaneous briefs 
were required to be filed and served. The trial judge announced that he would rule before 
the close of the day that very same day. On Tuesday, September 3, when an order had not 
yet been received. AOL's counsel called the lower court's chambers and inquired whether 
the Court would like to receive additional evidence before deciding the motion. The 
Court declined, advised that it would issue an order that day or the next, and instead 
granted the preliminary injunction. without a hearing and without live testimony, shortly 
thereafter.  
 
"Rule 52(a) requires that in granting or refusing a preliminary injunction the court must 
set out the findings of fact and conclusions of law constituting the grounds for its action." 
11A Wright, et al., supra Sec. 2949 (emphasis added). As stated by this Court, "[t]he 
language of the Rule is mandatory." Bradley, 910 F.2d at 1178 (emphasis added). Where, 
as here, the trial court has entered a preliminary injunction without setting forth findings 
of facts and conclusions of law, the order entered on the motion should be vacated. Id.; 
see also Professional Plan Examiners of New Jersey, Inc., et al. v. Joseph A. Lefante, et 
al., 750 F.2d 282, 289 (3d Cir. 1984) (a one-page order stating the four elements that 
must be proved for injunctive relief and stating that the plaintiffs met them is "inadequate 
to support a preliminary injunction;" therefore, the order entering the injunction was 
vacated for failure to set forth adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law); Newark 
Stereotypers' Union No. 18 v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., 353 F.2d 510 (3d Cir. 1965) 
and Bateman v. Ford Motor Co., 310 F.2d 805 (3d. Cir. 1962).  
 
Although the order contains the words "temporarily restrain," which might otherwise 
suggest that it was a temporary restraining order and not a preliminary injunction, the 
order clearly is an injunction. It has the effect of an injunction. It lasts for at least two and 
one-half months, and possibly substantially longer. The lower court provided no hearing, 
and did not set forth findings of fact or conclusions of law as mandated by Rule 52(a). As 
stated by this Court in Sims v. Greene, 160 F.2d 512 (3d Cir. 1947):  
 
 
When a restraining order, purporting to be temporary is continued for a substantial length 
of time past the period prescribed by Section 381 of 28 U.S.C.A. without the consent of 
the party against which it issued and without the safeguards prescribed by Rule 65(b) it 
ceases to be a "temporary restraining order" within the purview of that section and 
become a preliminary injunction which cannot be maintained unless the court issuing it 
sets out the findings of fact and the conclusions of law which constitute the grounds for 
its action as required by Rule 52(a).  
 
 
Id. at 517; see also Samson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 86, 94 S.C. Ct. 937, 951 (1974) ("a 
temporary restraining order continued beyond the time permissible under Rule 65 must 
be treated as a preliminary injunction, and must conform to the standards applicable to 
preliminary injunctions").  
 
The affidavits and briefs filed in the court below reveal that there are clearly numerous 
disputed issues of material fact. Nevertheless, the lower court entered a sweeping 
preliminary injunction without conducting a hearing. AOL never had the opportunity to 
respond to Cyber's brief or to cross-examine the sole witness relied upon by Cyber in its 
request for an injunction. Until the lower court issued its ruling enjoining AOL for 
months from protecting its computer network, AOL did not even know that the lower 
court had decided to treat the oral motion from Cyber as a preliminary injunction request, 
and not a request for a mere 10-day temporary restraining order. Further, the court issued 
no findings of fact or conclusions of law in support of its order granting the injunction.  
 
Finally, the notions now raised by Cyber that the lower court can even now cure its 
procedural failures and that AOL is required to have sought reconsideration fly in the face 
of the applicable rules (Cyber Mem. at 1-2, 7), would have potentially dire ramifications 
in practice, and are just plain wrong. Regarding Cyber's claim that belated findings and 
conclusions are appropriate, this very issue was addressed by the court in Chemlawn 
Servs. Corp. v. GNC Pumps, Inc., 823 F.2d 515 (Fed. Cir. 1987). There, the district court 
granted a preliminary injunction without issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
Four days later, the party burdened by the injunction filed a notice of appeal. Later, the 
district court issued "findings of fact and conclusions of law purportedly supporting its" 
prior preliminary injunction. 823 F.2d at 516. The court of appeals held that the district 
court's after-the-fact findings and conclusions failed to remedy the procedural defect:  
 
 
that the District Court eventually and belatedly entered findings of fact and conclusions 
of law on February 3, 1987, did not cure the defect of failing to do so at the time the 
preliminary injunction first issued and cannot effectively legitimate that injunction.  
 
 
Id. The court further held that because the case was on appeal, the district court had no 
jurisdiction over the matter, and therefore, its belated findings and conclusions had no 
effect:  
 
 
the District Court's delay in entering its finding of fact and conclusions of law is defective 
for another reason. By delaying until February 3, 1987, the court attempted to act at a 
time when it no longer had jurisdiction over the case because GNC had already filed a 
notice of appeal to this court.... In this instance, the District Court clearly lost the 
jurisdiction on November 18, 1986 when GNC filed a notice of appeal to this court. It 
could not properly issue findings of fact on or after that date and this court cannot 
properly consider them.  
 
 
Id. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals vacated the preliminary injunction.21/ Likewise, 
any attempt by the lower court in this case to legitimate the injunction by entering post-
appeal findings and conclusions would be error, and cannot prevent the injunction from 
being vacated.  
 
The lower court had no hearing and afforded AOL no opportunity to cross- examine the 
author of the sole evidence on the injunction from Cyber. AOL did not even see a form of 
proposed order, let alone any findings of fact or conclusions of law after the fact. Each 
day that the Cyber motion was pending was the day the parties were told an order would 
be issued, but never that it would be an injunction in force until trial. To suggest, as 
Cyber has now done, (Cyber Mem. at 7), that the lower court can now file findings and 
conclusions makes a mockery of Rule 52 and disregards the substantial efforts undertaken 
on the appeal and appellate briefing already. If Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(a) 
and 65 have any meaning at all, Cyber's contention that they can be ignored and belatedly 
paid lip service to must be summarily rejected.  
 
As for Cyber's contention that AOL had to or should have sought "clarification" after the 
fact, this too is neither supported by the appellate or civil rules, nor of any significance 
given the extremely broad wording of the order. The "clarification" contention is merely 
another name for stating that AOL should have sought reconsideration. This is not a 
prerequisite to appeal, and in a constitutional infringement case, it would be especially 
inappropriate. The second prohibition in the order -- precluding AOL from "interfering in 
any manner with Cyber's business relationships with its Internet Service Providers" -- 
essentially straightjacketed AOL from exercising its business judgment in dealings with 
third parties that have the capacity to do substantial, costly damage to AOL. This was 
entered against AOL without so much as a single ISP offering on admissible statement 
against AOL and in support of Cyber, let alone AOL having the right to cross-examine 
the ISP in a hearing of any type.  
 
These are important, fundamental defects relating directly to the extraordinary injunctive 
relief at issue, and the lower court's failure to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure renders the Order entering the injunction patently defective.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, America Online, Inc. respectfully requests that this Court 
vacate the lower court's injunction entered September 5, 1996.  
 
Respectfully submitted,

ENDNOTES 
 
1/ Cyber's activities have also been compared to the conduct of a telemarketer. This 
analogy too must fail for many of the same reasons. Furthermore, a more apt analogy 
would be to a telemarketer who calls collect while depriving the recipient of the ability to 
reject the call or the charges.  
 
2/ Given the oral nature of the request, by telephone, from counsel for Cyber to the court 
below, the hurried nature of the briefing, and the lack of even a proposed form of order 
below in accordance with Eastern District Local Rule 7.1 (a) or a request from Cyber for 
a hearing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, it was not at all clear whether Cyber was requesting a 
TRO or a preliminary injunction. Moreover, it is not uncommon for a party who wants 
immediate injunctive relief to fashion the request as a motion for a TRO "and" a 
preliminary injunction. In any event, AOL did not expect the lower court to treat the oral 
request, four-hour briefs, and hastily prepared declarations before the holiday weekend as 
the equivalent of an injunction hearing, as noted by counsel for AOL in a letter to the 
lower court before the order was entered. (JA000461-462.) Indeed, when the lower court 
directed the filing of the briefs and declarations, it announced that given the shortness of 
time, "ballpark" figures and calculations on damages would be adequate. It also promised 
to provide a quick ruling that very same day.  
 
3/ Cyber filed on September 18, 1996 in the district court and in this court a 
memorandum opposing AOL's request for a stay of the order in the district court. That 
memorandum is referred to in this brief as "Cyber Mem. at _."  
 
4/ Cyber's recent contentions -- again, in its September 18th district court memorandum -- 
that there was the equivalent of a hearing, that AOL should seek "clarification" or 
reconsideration, and that now the trial judge simply should enter findings and conclusions 
conveniently just provided by Cyber -- ignore the facts, timing, briefs, and letters that 
indisputably show the real sequence of events, would make a mockery of the 
requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Appellate Rules of Civil 
Procedure, and the local rules of both the district court and court of appeals, and would 
impose procedural obstacles to appeal that simply fail to exist anywhere other than in 
Cyber's briefing.  
 
5/ Conversely, in the Cyber/AOL situation, there is no "extra space" because all e-mail 
uses computer hardware and software resources of AOL, (JA000237-238, O'Donnell 
Decl. Paras. 11 and 14), and AOL subscribers pay for their use, or use up "free time" they 
would otherwise use for desired activities by virtue of Cyber's substantial mailings. So, 
the cost to AOL and its subscribers with every bulk e-mail transmission is both 
pecuniary, as well as constitutional, and hence even stronger than in Pacific Gas.  
 
6/ Cf., Midwest Video Corp. v. F.C.C., 571 F.2d 1025 (8th Cir. 1978), aff'd on other 
grounds, 440 U.S. 689, 99 S. Ct. 1435 (1979). There, in the different context of a cable 
company, the Eighth Circuit reiterated the basic principle that the First Amendment does 
not guarantee every person a right to speak in every situation: "Every individual's right to 
speak, precious and paramount as it is, does not include every individual's right to be 
given the possibility of an audience by government fiat, or to speak in a non-public 
forum, like a newspaper, a magazine, or on the Senate floor." Id. at 1054.  
 
7/ Cyber also seems to argue in passing that AOL's appeal rights were compromised 
because AOL waited "eight days" before pursuing the appeal. First, AOL acted well 
within its rights in responding to the injunction, initially phrased in terms of a TRO but 
obviously intended by the lower court to be in force for several months, after carefully 
considering its rights under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and engaging in 
discussions at the highest corporate level. Second, the Appellate Rules clearly provide 
that an appeal filed a week or so after an injunction is entered is timely. Third, AOL was 
not required to seek reconsideration before taking what it considered to be the most direct 
route of constitutional redress. And, in any event, the appeal was taken on the morning of 
the seventh day after the lower court's order was entered (not the eighth day) and, in view 
of the briefing required, the preparation of motions deemed to be appropriate in both 
courts, and the importance of the issues, as expeditiously as possible under the 
circumstances.  
 
8/ In dicta, the Court recognized that if plaintiffs wanted to use the mails to distribute 
their notices, they would have to pay the proper postage, just as all other Postal Service 
patrons must do to use the mails. Id at 127, 101 S. Ct. at 2684.  
 
9/ In a footnote, the Court rejected, as lacking support and too "sweeping," a dissenting 
justice's proposition that an instrumentality like a mailbox becomes a public forum 
because it "'is used for the communication of information and ideas'" and is then subject 
to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. Council of Greenburgh, 101 S. Ct. at 
2685 n.6. Indeed, just because the army base cafeteria bulletin board was "'specifically 
used for the communication of information and ideas'" did not any more transform the 
bulletin board into a public forum than the street corners and parking lots on a military 
base held not to be public fora. Id., (citing Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 96 S. Ct. 1211 
(1976))  
 
10/ Another recent contention of Cyber (Cyber Mem. at 10) -- that success on the merits 
is demonstrated by its tortious interference claim -- is not backed by a single reference to 
proof on the record. This is not surprising, as any first-hand, admissible evidence of 
AOL's alleged impermissible interference with ISP's would have to come from either the 
third-party ISP's or AOL itself, if it arguendo existed, and Cyber has not provided a single 
affidavit, deposition excerpt, sworn statement or admission in support of these claims, let 
alone enough to support an injunction.  
 
11/ Indeed, it is now a matter of public record that as of September 16, 1996, AOL 
switched to the Big Board, and is now publicly trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 
12/ See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 95 S. Ct. 449 (1975) 
(privately owned and operated electric utility holding certificate of public convenience 
not state actor).  
 
13/ Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 842. 
 
14/ Black v. Indiana Area Sch. Dist., 985 F.2d 707, 710-11 (3d Cir. 1993).  
 
15/ Before the Mark decision, the Third Circuit on occasion described this test as the 
"nexus approach," rather than the "in concert approach" referred to in Mark. See Groman, 
47 F.3d at 639; Boyle v. Governor's Veterans Outreach & Assistance Ctr., 925 F.2d 71, 
76 (3d Cir. 1991). The result of the "nexus appoach"[sic] is no different, because the test 
is satisfied "only when [the State] has exercised coercive power or has provided such 
significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed 
that of the State." Boyle, 925 F.2d at 76 (quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1004).  
 
16/ Here again, even extensive government support and/or regulation and performance of 
a public function -- if they existed, which they do not -- would not make AOL a state 
actor. Id  
 
17/ Any contention that AOL is a state actor because the Federal Networking Council 
"jointly established" the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ("IANA"), which assigns 
Internet addresses and domain names, should be rejected. This argument fails to establish 
state action because, even assuming that IANA were a governmental entity (which it is 
not), its assigning Internet addresses and domain names to AOL and AOL's customers is 
a "wholly neutral and ministerial act" and it is completely unrelated to AOL's policies 
regarding unauthorized bulk e-mail advertising. See Robison v. Canterbury Village, Inc., 
848 F.2d 424, 428 (3d Cir. 1988). Cyber has never ever alleged, let alone introduced 
evidence in support of, the notion that the assignment of Internet addresses or domain 
names to AOL has anything to do with this case or AOL's alleged conduct at issue.  
 
18/ Congress has defined the term "interactive computer service" broadly to encompass 
the activities of Internet and proprietary network providers. See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230(e)(2).  
 
19/ There are also statutes that define as a crime the knowing transmission of data 
electronically in a manner that falsely identifies, inter alia the person transmitting such 
data. See, e.g., Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act, Ga. Code Sec. 16-9-93.1 (July 
I, 1996). Cyber has stipulated to an injunction against itself for just such activity. 
(JA000092-94.) Plainly, then, far from being authorized by statute, Cyber's conduct is, at 
least in part, arguably criminal.  
 
20/ Cyber's latest, post-hoc contention that its bulk transmissions constitute "newsletters," 
(JA000139), because it now intends to add a line or two of non-advertising to each multi-
page transmission is unsupported by the record evidence, does not change the fact that 
AOL still is not a state actor, regardless of the message content, and ignores the fact that 
AOL and its customers suffer just as much regardless of whether Cyber adds a line of 
self-serving text to its transmissions. Ironically, the timing makes the conclusion 
inescapable that this is nothing more than a transparent attempt to cloak pure commercial 
speech in alleged non-commercial clothing, sparse and tattered though it may be.  
 
21/ The two cases cited by Cyber in support of its erroneous contention that the lower 
court may at this late date issue findings and conclusions in support of the preliminary 
injunction are distinguishable. In United States v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 320 F.2d 509 (3d 
Cir. 1963), the Third Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction supported by findings of fact 
and conclusions of law issued after the injunction but before the case had been appealed. 
Of course, any findings or conclusions by the lower court in this case would be after the 
appeal. Regarding Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 59 S. Ct. 725 (1939), Cyber is correct that 
the lower court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were not entered until after the 
injunction was issued and before the hearing on the appeal. However, unlike the instant 
case, the appellant in that case did not raise an objection to the lack of findings and 
conclusions until after the court rendered them: "[N]o assignment of error was made on 
account of the fact that the findings were out of time. " L. at 78, 69 S. Ct. at 732. Instead, 
appellant waited until after the lower court rendered its findings and conclusions before 
first raising an objection.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION
and NBA PROPERTIES, INC.,

Plaintiffs,

v.

AMERICA ONLINE, INC. and SPORTS TEAM
ANALYSIS and TRACKING SYSTEMS, INC.
d/b/a STATS, INC.

Defendants.

Civil Action No.


COMPLAINT

Plaintiffs, the National Basketball Association ("NBA") and NBA 
Properties, Inc. ("NBA Properties"), collectively referred to as the 
"NBA Parties" or the "NBA," by their attorneys named below, for their 
Complaint against defendants America online, Inc. ("AOL") and 
Sports Team Analysis and Tracking Systems, Inc., d/b/a Stats, Inc. 
("Stats, Inc.") allege: 


NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is an action for misappropriation of plaintiffs' proprietary data 
under state law. Defendants' violations of plaintiffs' rights arise out of 
an on-line service provided by defendants that enables AOL customers 
to receive contemporaneous play-by-play accounts and descriptions of, 
and information relating to, all NBA basketball games while the games 
are in progress. Defendant Stats, Inc. supplies the data feed for, 
produces, and is responsible for the content of this on-line service 
(hereinafter the "Stats, Inc./AOL Service"). 

2. The Stats, Inc./AOL Service, which has not been licensed or 
otherwise authorized in any way by the NBA Parties, amounts to a 
flagrant taking of the essence of the NBA's most valuable property -- 
real-time NBA game information. Accordingly, plaintiffs seek 
injunctive relief, an accounting, and damages by reason of defendants' 
conduct which constitutes the misappropriation of real-time data, 
accounts and descriptions of live NBA games in violation of the New 
York common law of misappropriation. 


JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims under 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1332 in that the parties are citizens of different states and the 
matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000 exclusive of 
interest and costs. 

4. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1391(a) 
because, upon information and belief, defendants reside or do business 
in this district and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the 
claim occurred here. 


PARTIES

5. Plaintiff NBA is a joint venture, comprised of 29 member teams 
located in the United States and Canada, that operates a professional 
basketball league. The NBA is responsible for the annual production, 
organization and presentation (in arenas and through various forms of 
media) of an entertainment product -- pre-season, regular season and 
playoff basketball games involving its member teams ("NBA games") 
-- in the highly competitive entertainment marketplace. The NBA 
maintains its principal place of business at 645 Fifth Avenue, New 
York, New York. 

6. Plaintiff NBA Properties is a corporation organized and existing 
under the laws of the State of New York, having its principal place of 
business at 645 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. NBA Properties 
is owned equally by each of the 29 members of the NBA and is 
engaged throughout the world in marketing and promoting NBA 
games and in licensing the commercial use of game data from NBA 
games, NBA-related statistics and information, and other intellectual 
property of the NBA and its member teams (collectively, "NBA 
Intellectual Property"). 

7. Upon information and belief, defendant America Online, Inc. is a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of 
Delaware, having its principal place of business at 8619 Westwood 
Center Drive, Vienna, Virginia 22182-2285. America Online, Inc. 
operates an online computer service providing a wide range of 
information, including basketball related information, to its over 6 
million subscribers worldwide. 

8. Defendant Stats, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under 
the laws of the State of Missouri, having its principal place of business 
in Skokie, Illinois and maintains a place of business in this district. 
Stats, Inc. is engaged, among other things, in the business of obtaining 
and assembling accounts of and information concerning sporting 
events and publishing and distributing such accounts and information 
in various media. 


STATEMENT OF FACTS

The NBA Parties And The Transmission Of NBA Games 

9. NBA games are among the most successful and popular forms of 
entertainment in the United States and throughout the world. The 
essence of the entertainment is the real-time dissemination of data 
from ongoing games. Such realtime data is an extremely valuable asset 
of the NBA Parties. 

10. The enormous popularity of NBA games is attributable to the 
expenditures of large sums of money by the NBA Parties and their 
continuous efforts in creating, planning, organizing, developing, 
selecting, arranging, coordinating, regulating, marketing and 
promoting NBA games. 

11. The public's interest in and the entertainment value of each NBA 
game results from, among other things, the talent and skill of the 
players and coaches employed by each member team of the NBA and 
the format, timing, rules and other external limitations adopted and 
enforced by the NBA in connection with the production of NBA 
games. The NBA selects the teams that will oppose each other and the 
venue at which each game is played, and creates rules for, among other 
things, scoring, fouls, number of periods, free throws and possession 
of the ball. During each NBA game, the NBA, through its referees, 
enforces theses rules. 

12. The NBA Parties arrange for the authorized, organized, orderly, 
accurate, useful and timely distribution and dissemination of accounts 
and descriptions of, and information regarding, NBA games as they 
occur. The limitations imposed by the NBA Parties on the 
dissemination of game data preserve, and are intended to preserve, the 
value of the NBA's proprietary interest in this information. 

13. Only bona fide media representatives who have obtained a 
credential from the NBA or a member team and other official licensees 
of the NBA are permitted to distribute and disseminate real-time 
accounts, descriptions, and information concerning NBA games, 
subject to a variety of terms and conditions established by the NBA 
Parties. 

14. In addition, each year NBA Entertainment ("NBAE"), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of NBA Properties, enters into written license 
agreements with hundreds of television and radio stations and 
networks throughout the United States and Canada authorizing, subject 
to specific limitations, the use by such stations and networks of 
"highlights" from NBA games in news and sports news programming. 
Among the many restrictions to which television stations and networks 
agree to adhere is a requirement prohibiting the display or transmission 
of any highlight from the second half of an NBA game until that game 
has concluded. NBA Properties monitors closely station and network 
compliance with the terms of the "highlights" license. 

15. The NBA Parties' control over NBA games, and over the real-time 
accounts and descriptions thereof, and information relating thereto, 
constitutes one of the primary reasons for the high quality and 
resulting entertainment value, popularity and commercial success of 
NBA games. 

16. The NBA Parties limit access to NBA games. Fans purchasing 
game tickets and media representatives attending games pursuant to 
official credentials are subject to a variety of contractual conditions. 
Among other explicit restrictions, fans and media representatives may 
not distribute or transmit, by any means, continuing descriptions of 
NBA games in progress, unless expressly permitted to do so by the 
NBA Parties. 

17. The NBA Parties promote and distribute NBA games in a variety 
of media. The NBA Parties' licensing activities currently include the 
licensing of live, contemporaneous or taped-delayed broadcasts and 
other transmissions of NBA games through broadcast television, cable 
television, direct broadcast satellite, FM and AM frequency radio, 
"800" numbers, pager devices, interactive computer on-line services 
and other forms of electronic media. 

18. The NBA Parties' licensing activities also include the licensing and 
distribution of NBA game-related statistics and information and other 
NBA Intellectual Property through numerous forms of media, 
including printed and electronic publishing, television, radio, 
telephone, pager devices, interactive computer on-line services, 
computer CD-ROM devices, and other forms of electronic media. 

19. The NBA Parties license NBA games and NBA Intellectual 
Property only to carefully selected licensees. The high quality of the 
products and services provided by these licensees is essential to 
maintaining the goodwill associated with the NBA Parties. The 
licenses granted by the NBA Parties are of enormous commercial 
value and include the following: an exclusive license granted to NBC 
for national over-the-air or "free" television distribution of NBA 
games; an exclusive license granted to Turner Broadcasting for 
national cable television distribution of NBA games; an exclusive 
license granted to the ESPN Radio Network for national radio rights; 
and an exclusive license granted to Starwave and ESPN Sports Zone 
for certain rights with respect to the audio distribution of NBA games 
and the use of certain Intellectual Property over the "world wide web" 
on the Internet. 

20. The NBA games achieve the apex of their value while they are in 
progress. Roughly 80% of the NBA's revenues are derived from the 
promotion of NBA games in progress. 


The Stats, Inc./AOL Service

21. Upon information and belief, AOL is providing an on-line service 
that disseminates and distributes continuing accounts and descriptions 
of, and NBA game-related information concerning, NBA games as 
they occur. The goal and focus of the service is to provide real-time 
information about the games to AOL's subscribers. 

22. The Stats, Inc./AOL Service is not authorized, licensed, sponsored 
or endorsed by the NBA Parties. 

23. Upon information and belief, AOL obtains its data from defendant 
Stats, Inc. which obtains and assembles accounts of and information 
concerning sporting events, including NBA games. 

24. AOL's information provider Stats, Inc., beginning on or about late 
Spring 1994, contacted plaintiff NBA Properties about becoming an 
NBA licensee for collecting and transmitting NBA-related information 
and statistics. Stats, Inc. continued these negotiations with NBA 
Properties until January 1996. NBA Properties neither licensed Stats, 
Inc. nor otherwise granted permission to Stats, Inc. to collect and/or 
transmit NBA game-related information or to provide such data to 
AOL. 

25. Upon information and belief, while it was continuing such 
negotiations with the NBA to become a licensee, Stats, Inc., without 
disclosing its actions to the NBA, proceeded to negotiate with AOL 
and enter into an agreement to provide the data feed for the Stats, 
Inc./AOL Service with respect to NBA basketball games to be 
disseminated to AOL subscribers. 

26. On January 16, 1996, AOL commenced dissemination of the Stats, 
Inc./AOL Service without authorization from the NBA Parties. Neither 
Stats, Inc. nor AOL ever disclosed to the NBA their plans to establish 
this site before its operations commenced. 

27. The Stats, Inc./AOL Service is an entertainment product. 
Subscribers who access the Stats, Inc./AOL Service encounter various 
informational screen displays. These screen displays are jointly 
designed by AOL and Stats, Inc. with respect to their appearance and 
organization. These screens have described the data available as 
"Today's games at a glance. Updated as they happen;" and "The 
scoreboard has up-to-date line scores with box scores up-dated every 
minute." 

28. AOL has placed advertisements on its "welcome screen" for the 
basketball service, advising subscribers that the service provides live 
data from NBA games. 

29. The information provided by AOL includes scores, time 
remaining, foul shots, and other key statistics of ongoing NBA games 
provided on a real-time basis while the NBA games are in progress. 
Information is updated between every 15 seconds and one minute. 

30. Upon information and belief, since its launch, the AOL site has 
been accessed hundreds of thousands if not millions of times. 

31. On February 2, 1996, the NBA Parties sent a demand letter to AOL 
requesting that it cease and desist further dissemination of the Stats, 
Inc./AOL Service. By letter dated March 7, 1996, AOL's attorneys 
responded, falsely asserting that the Stats, Inc./AOL Service only 
updated every 10 to 15 minutes and amounted to no more than typical 
journalistic coverage of NBA games. 

32. On March 5, 1996, the NBA Parties sued Stats, Inc. in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 96 Civ. 
1615 (LAP) alleging, among other things, that Stats, Inc.'s collection 
and distribution of real-time NBA data while games are in progress 
constituted misappropriation of the NBA Parties' property in violation 
of state common law, including that of New York (the "Prior Action"). 

33. In an opinion dated July 19, 1996, the Court found in the Prior 
Action that Stats, Inc.'s collection and real-time provision to Motorola, 
Inc. of NBA games data less comprehensive than that being provided 
by Stats, Inc. to AOL constituted misappropriation of the essence of 
the NBA's most valuable property. 

34. Despite these findings in the Prior Action, Stats, Inc. continues to 
supply, and AOL continues to distribute via the Stats, Inc./AOL 
Service, real-time NBA games data. 


CLAIM FOR RELIEF
STATE LAW UNFAIR COMPETITION BY MISAPPROPRIATION 

35. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully set 
forth herein. 

36. Upon information and belief, since some time in or about mid-
January, 1996, the Stats, Inc./AOL Service has provided continuously-
updated real-time information relating to all NBA games to AOL's 
Subscribers while the games are in progress -- all without the consent 
or authority of the NBA Parties. 

37. The Stats, Inc./AOL Service competes directly with existing 
commercial products and services provided by the NBA Parties and 
their authorized licensees and interferes with the NBA's potential to 
exploit real-time NBA games scores, information and statistics. 

38. Defendants' unlawful and inequitable activities in providing an on-
line service that disseminates real-time data from ongoing NBA 
games, damages and dilutes the commercial value of the NBA's 
business and inequitably and illegally misappropriates the skill, 
expenditures and labors of the NBA Parties and their licensees for the 
commercial advantage of defendant. 

39. Defendants' aforesaid activities, specifically the providing of the 
Stats, Inc./AOL Service, constitutes unfair competition and 
misappropriation of plaintiffs' commercial property, in violation of the 
law of the State of New York as well as that of other states. 

40. Defendants' unfair competition and misappropriation of plaintiffs' 
commercial property has caused and continues to cause plaintiffs to 
suffer irreparable injury and damage, which injuries and damages are 
not capable of precise monetary determination or adequate remedy at 
law and, unless restrained, will cause further irreparable injury and 
damage to plaintiffs. 

WHEREFORE, plaintiffs demand judgment as follows: 

1. Permanently enjoining defendants, their employees, agents, 
licensees, attorneys, successors, affiliates, subsidiaries and assigns, and 
all those in active concert and participation with any of them from: 

(a) Broadcasting, distributing or transmitting, by the aforesaid Stats, 
Inc./AOL Service or through any form of electronic or other media 
now known or hereafter developed, real-time data, play-by-play 
descriptions or accounts of any NBA game in progress; 

(b) Misappropriating plaintiffs' valuable commercial property in the 
NBA games, including any scores, statistics and/or other information 
or real-time accounts of any NBA games while in progress; 

(c) Engaging in any other activity constituting unfair competition by 
any misappropriation of plaintiffs' valuable commercial property 
relating to NBA games and NBA Intellectual Property; 

(d) Assisting, aiding or abetting any other person or business entity in 
engaging in or performing any of the activities referred to in 
subparagraphs (a) through (c) above. 

2. Awarding plaintiffs such damages as it has sustained or will sustain 
by reason of defendants' misappropriation of its commercial property, 
together with all profits, gains, and advantages derived by defendants 
from such conduct. 

3. Awarding plaintiffs their costs and disbursements incurred in this 
action, including reasonable attorneys' fees. 

4. Awarding plaintiffs interest, including prejudgment interest, on the 
foregoing sums. 

5. Awarding plaintiffs such other and further relief as the Court may 
deem just and proper.

<H2>U.S. v. Microsoft and Related Documents</H2>


<p><a href=wsjletter.html>Netscape Letter to Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition</a><br>
Netscape attorney Gary Reback sent this letter to The Wall Street
Journal's online edition in connection with Netscape's ongoing
conflict with Microsoft. Netscape alleges that Microsoft is using
anticompetitive tactics against the developers of the most popular
World Wide Web browser software, Netscape Navigator, in violation of a 1995 consent decree reached between Microsoft and the Justice Department.<p>

<p><a href=netcomplain.html>Netscape Calls For Justice Department Investigation</a><br>
Netscape Communications claims Microsoft is violating its
antitrust agreement with the government and wants the Justice
Department to investigate. In this letter, Netscape says Microsoft is
using its dominance in personal computer operating systems to
influence computer makers, Internet service companies and others
into giving Microsoft's Internet software prominence over
competitors like Netscape. For instance, Netscape claims Microsoft
is charging less money for its Windows 95 operating system to PC
makers who agree to make other Web browser programs less
accessible to computer users. Both companies recently released new versions of their products. Microsoft charged Netscape's letter was timed around the rollouts because its browser is catching up to Netscape's in technical features.<p>

<p><a href=mswar.html> War of Words Between Netscape and Microsoft</a><br>
The Web war between Netscape Communications and Microsoft is getting nasty. Netscape has accused rival Microsoft of abusing monopolist powers in the industry and wants the Justice Department to investigate. The accusations came in response to a letter from a top Microsoft lawyer demanding that Netscape stop making claims about its price advantage over Microsoft. Netscape also insists that a new Microsoft license, which limits the number of users who can connect to the workstation version of Microsoft's new Windows NT operating system to 10, allows Microsoft to position its more expensive NT Server as the product to be used by multiple users. <p>


<P><a href=msnsued.html> Caldera v. Microsoft</a><br>
On July 23, 1996, Caldera, Inc. filed this antitrust suit against
Microsoft, alleging that the computer software company monopolizes
the DOS market; practices exclusive dealing; and tortiously interferes with economic relations. Caldera bought a line of computers products called DR DOS from the Novell Corporation, and alleges that Microsoft practices severely limit the product line's market share.<p>

<P><A HREF="dojmemo.html">DOJ Response to Microsoft Attempt to Quash Subpoena</A><BR>
In investigating Microsoft Corp for alleged antitrust violations related to bundling its online software with Windows 95, the Department of Justice issued several Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) requesting documents from the software giant.

<P><A HREF="victory.html">Microsoft: Appeals Court Victory</A><BR>
Microsoft triumphed in a five-year battle over federal antitrust charges when an appeals court ordered a federal trial court to approve the company's negotiated settlement with the Justice Department. The three-judge appellate 
panel also removed U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin from the case, finding he had overstepped his authority in ruling against the settlement in February. This is the June 16, 1995 ruling.</P>

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
 
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA 
 
RELIGIOUS TECHNOLOGY CENTER, a California non-profit 
corporation; and BRIDGE PUBLICATIONS, INC., a California 
non-profit corporation, Plaintiffs,  
 
v. 
 
NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES, INC., a 
Delaware corporation; DENNIS ERLICH, an individual; and TOM 
KLEMESRUD, an individual, dba CLEARWOOD DATA 
SERVICES, Defendants.  
 
NO. C-95-20091 RMW 
 
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT NETCOM'S MOTION FOR 
SUMMARY JUDGMENT; DENYING DEFENDANT 
KLEMESRUD'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE 
PLEADINGS; AND DENYING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR 
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AGAINST NETCOM AND 
KLEMESRUD  
 
This case concerns an issue of first impression regarding 
intellectual property rights in cyberspace.[n1] Specifically, this 
order addresses whether the operator of a computer bulletin board 
service ("BBS"), and the large Internet[n2] access provider that 
allows that BBS to reach the Internet, should be liable for 
copyright infringement committed by a subscriber of the BBS.  
 
Plaintiffs Religious Technology Center ("RTC") and Bridge 
Publications, Inc. ("BPI") hold copyrights in the unpublished and 
published works of L. Ron Hubbard, the late founder of the Church 
of Scientology ("the Church"). Defendant Dennis Erlich 
("Erlich")[n3] is a former minister of Scientology turned vocal 
critic of the Church, whose pulpit is now the Usenet 
newsgroup[n4] alt.religion.scientology ("a.r.s."), an on-line forum 
for discussion and criticism of Scientology. Plaintiffs maintain that 
Erlich infringed their copyrights when he posted portions of their 
works on a.r.s. Erlich gained his access to the Internet through 
defendant Thomas Klemesrud's ("Klemesrud's") BBS 
"support.com." Klemesrud is the operator of the BBS, which is run 
out of his home and has approximately 500 paying users. 
Klemesrud's BBS is not directly linked to the Internet, but gains its 
connection through the facilities of defendant Netcom On-Line 
Communications, Inc. ("Netcom"), one of the largest providers of 
Internet access in the United States.  
 
After failing to convince Erlich to stop his postings, plaintiffs 
contacted defendants Klemesrud and Netcom. Klemesrud 
responded to plaintiffs' demands that Erlich be kept off his system 
by asking plaintiffs to prove that they owned the copyrights to the 
works posted by Erlich. However, plaintiffs refused Klemesrud's 
request as unreasonable. Netcom similarly refused plaintiffs' 
request that Erlich not be allowed to gain access to the Internet 
through its system. Netcom contended that it would be impossible 
to prescreen Erlich's postings and that to kick Erlich off the 
Internet meant kicking off the hundreds of users of Klemesrud's 
BBS. Consequently, plaintiffs named Klemesrud and Netcom in 
their suit against Erlich, although only on the copyright 
infringement claims.[n5]  
 
On June 23, 1995, this court heard the parties' arguments on eight 
motions, three of which relate to Netcom and Klemesrud and are 
discussed in this order: (1) Netcom's motion for summary 
judgment; (2) Klemesrud's motion for judgment on the 
pleadings;[n6] and (3) plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary 
injunction against Netcom and Klemesrud. For the reasons set 
forth below, the court grants in part and denies in part Netcom's 
motion for summary judgment and Klemesrud's motion for 
judgment on the pleadings and denies plaintiffs' motion for a 
preliminary injunction.  
 
I. NETCOM'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF 
NONINFRINGEMENT   
 
A. Summary Judgment Standards 
 
Because the court is looking beyond the pleadings in examining 
this motion, it will be treated as a motion for summary judgment 
rather than a motion to dismiss. Grove v. Mead School District, 
753 F.2d 1528, 1532(9thCir. 1985). Summary judgment is proper 
when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that 
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 56(c). There is a "genuine" issue of material fact only when 
there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable juror could find 
for the party opposing the motion. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. 
Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986). Entry of summary judgment is 
mandated against a party if, after adequate time for discovery and 
upon motion, the party fails to make a showing sufficient to 
establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, 
and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. 
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett~ 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The court, 
however, must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the 
nonmoving parties, including questions of credibility and of the 
weight to be accorded particular evidence. Masson v. New Yorker 
Magazine. Inc.. 501 U.S. 496, 520 (1991).   
 
B. Copyright Infringement 
 
To establish a claim of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must 
demonstrate (1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) "copying"' 
of protectable expression by the defendant. Baxter v. MCA. Inc., 
812 F.2d 421, 423 (9th Cir.), cert. denied. 484 U.S. 954 (1987). 
Infringement occurs when a defendant violates one of the exclusive 
rights of the copyright holder. 17 U.S.C. Section 501(a). These 
rights include the right to reproduce the copyrighted work, the right 
to prepare derivative works, the right to distribute copies to the 
public, and the right to publicly display the work. 17 U.S.C. 
Sections 106(1)-(3) & (5). The court has already determined that 
plaintiffs have established that they own the copyrights to all of the 
Exhibit A and B works, except item 4 of Exhibit A.[n8] The court 
also found plaintiffs likely to succeed on their claim that defendant 
Erlich copied the Exhibit A and B works and was not entitled to a 
fair use defense. Plaintiffs argue that, although Netcom was not 
itself the source of any of the infringing materials on its system, it 
nonetheless should be liable for infringement, either directly, 
contributorily, or vicariously.9 Netcom disputes these theories of 
infringement and further argues that it is entitled to its own fair use 
defense.   
 
1. Direct Infringement  
 
Infringement consists of the unauthorized exercise of one of the 
exclusive rights of the copyright holder delineated in section 106. 
17 U.S.C. Section 501. Direct infringement does not require intent 
or any particular state of mind,'ø although willfulness is relevant to 
the award of statutory damages. 17 U.S.C. Section 504(c).   
 
Many of the facts pertaining to this motion are undisputed. The 
court will address the relevant facts to determine whether a theory 
of direct infringement can be supported based on Netcom's alleged 
reproduction of plaintiffs' works. The court will look at one 
controlling Ninth Circuit decision addressing copying in the 
context of computers and two district court opinions addressing the 
liability of BBS operators for the infringing activities of 
subscribers. The court will additionally examine whether Netcom 
is liable for infringing plaintiffs' exclusive rights to publicly 
distribute and display their works.  
 
a. Undisputed Facts  
 
The parties do not dispute the basic processes that occur when 
Erlich posts his allegedly infringing messages to a.r.s. Erlich 
connects to Klemesrud's BBS using a telephone and a modem. 
Erlich then transmits his messages to Klemesrud's computer, where 
they are automatically briefly stored. According to a prearranged 
pattern established by Netcom's software, Erlich's initial act of 
posting a message to the Usenet results in the automatic copying of 
Erlich's message from Klemesrud's computer onto Netcom's 
computer and onto other computers on the Usenet. In order to ease 
transmission and for the convenience of Usenet users, Usenet 
servers maintain postings from newsgroups for a short period of 
time eleven days for Netcom's system and three days for 
Klemesrud's system. Once on Netcom's computers, messages are 
available to Netcom's customers and Usenet neighbors, who may 
then download the messages to their own computers. Netcom's 
local server makes available its postings to a group of Usenet 
servers, which do the same for other servers until all Usenet sites 
worldwide have obtained access to the postings, which takes a 
matter of hours. Francis Decl. Paragraph 5.  
 
Unlike some other large on-line service providers, such as 
CompuServe, America Online, and Prodigy, Netcom does not 
create or control the content of the information available to its 
subscribers. It also does not monitor messages as they are posted. It 
has, however, suspended the accounts of subscribers who violated 
its terms and conditions, such as where they had commercial 
software in their posted files. Netcom admits that, although not 
currently configured to do this, it may be possible to reprogram its 
system to screen postings containing particular words or coming 
from particular individuals. Netcom, however, took no action after 
it was told by plaintiffs that Erlich had posted messages through 
Netcom's system that violated plaintiffs' copyrights, instead 
claiming that it could not shut out Erlich without shutting out all of 
the users of Klemesrud's BBS.   
 
b. Creation of Fixed Copies 
 
The Ninth Circuit addressed the question of what constitutes 
infringement in the context of storage of digital information in a 
computer's random access memory ("RAM"). MAI Systems Corp, 
v. Peak Computer, Inc.., 991 F.2d 511, 518 (9th Cir. 1993). In Mai, 
the Ninth Circuit upheld a Ending of copyright infringement where 
a repair person. who was not authorized to use the computer 
owner's licensed operating system software, turned on the 
computer, thus loading the operating system into RAM for long 
enough to check an "error log." Id at 518-19. Copyright protection 
subsists in original works of authorship "fixed in any tangible 
medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which 
they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, 
either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." 17 U.S.C. 
Section 102 (emphasis added). A work is "fixed" when its 
"embodiment in a copy perceived, reproduced, or otherwise 
communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." Id 
Section 101. MAI established that the loading of data from a 
storage device into RAM constitutes copying because that data 
stays in RAM long enough for it to be perceived. MAI Systems, 
991 F.2d at518.   
 
In the present case, there is no question after "that "copies" were 
created, as Erlich's act of sending a message to a.r.s. caused 
reproductions of portions of plaintiffs' works on both Klemesrud's 
and Netcom's storage devices. Even though the messages remained 
on their systems for at most eleven days, they were sufficiently 
"fixed" to constitute recognizable copies under the Copyright Act. 
See Information Infrastructure Task Force, Intellectual Property 
and the National Information Infrastructure: The Report of the 
Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights 66 (1995) ("IITF 
Report").   
 
c. Is Netcom Directly Liable for Making the Copies?   
 
Accepting that copies were made, Netcom argues that Erlich, and 
not Netcom, is directly liable for the copying. MAI did not address 
the question raised in this case: whether possessors of computers 
are liable for incidental copies automatically made on their 
computers using their software as part of a process initiated by a 
third party. Netcom correctly distinguishes MAI on the ground that 
Netcom did not take any affirmative action that directly resulted in 
copying plaintiffs' works other than by installing and maintaining a 
system whereby software automatically forwards messages 
received from subscribers onto the Usenet, and temporarily stores 
copies on its system. Netcom's actions, to the extent that they 
created a copy of plaintiffs' works, were necessary to having a 
working system for transmitting Usenet postings to and from the 
Internet. Unlike the defendants in MAI, neither Netcom nor 
Klemesrud initiated the copying. The defendants in MAI turned on 
their customers' computers thereby creating temporary copies of 
the operating system, whereas Netcom' s and Klemesrud's systems 
can operate without any human intervention. Thus, unlike MAI, 
the mere fact that Netcom's system incidentally makes temporary 
copies of plaintiffs' works does not mean  
 
Netcom has caused the copying.[n11] The court believes that 
Netcom's act of designing or implementing a system that 
automatically and uniformly creates temporary copies of all data 
sent through it is not unlike that of the owner of a copying machine 
who lets the public make copies with it.[n12] Although some of the 
people using the machine may directly infringe copyrights, courts 
analyze the machine owner's liability under the rubric of 
contributory infringement, not direct infringement. See. e.g., RCA 
Records v. All-Fast System, Inc., 594 F. Supp. 335 (S.D.N.Y. 
1984); 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, NIMMER ON 
COPYRIGHT Section 12.04[A][2][b], at 12-78 to -79 (1995) 
(''NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT"); Elkin-Koren, supra, at 363 
(arguing that "contributory infringement is more appropriate for 
dealing with BBS liability, first, because it focuses attention on the 
BBS-users relationship and the way imposing liability on BBS 
operators may shape this relationship, and second because it better 
addresses the complexity of the relationship between BBS 
operators and subscribers"). Plaintiffs' theory would create many 
separate acts of infringement and, carried to its natural extreme, 
would lead to unreasonable liability. It is not difficult to conclude 
that Erlich infringes by copying a protected work onto his 
computer and by posting a message to a newsgroup. However, 
plaintiffs' theory further implicates a Usenet server that carries 
Erlich's message to other servers regardless of whether that server 
acts without any human intervention beyond the initial setting up 
of the system. It would also result in liability for every single 
Usenet server in the worldwide link of computers transmitting 
Erlich's message to every other computer. These parties, who are 
liable under plaintiffs' theory, do no more than operate or 
implement a system that is essential if Usenet messages are to be 
widely distributed. There is no need to construe the Act to make all 
of these parties infringers. Although copyright is a strict liability 
statute, there should still be some element of volition or causation 
which is lacking where a defendant's system is merely used to 
create a copy by a third party.  
 
Plaintiffs point out that the infringing copies resided for eleven 
days on Netcom's computer and were sent out from it onto the 
"Information Superhighway." However, under plaintiffs' theory, 
any storage of a copy that occurs in the process of sending a 
message to the Usenet is an infringement. While it is possible that 
less "damage" would have been done if Netcom had heeded 
plaintiffs' warnings and acted to prevent Erlich's message from 
being forwarded,[n13] this is not relevant to its direct liability for 
copying. The same argument is true of Klemesrud and any Usenet 
server. Whether a defendant makes a direct copy that constitutes 
infringement cannot depend on whether it received a warning to 
delete the message. See D.C. Comics. Inc. v. Mini Gift, 912 F.2d 
29, 35 (2d Cir. 1990). This distinction may be relevant to 
contributory infringement, however, where knowledge is an 
element. See infra part I.B.2.a. The court will now consider two 
district court opinions that have addressed the liability of BBS 
operators for infringing files uploaded by subscribers.  
 
d. Playboy Case  
Playboy Enterprises. Inc. v. Frena involved a suit against the 
operator of a small BBS whose system contained files of erotic 
pictures. 839 F. Supp. 1552, 1534 (M.D. Fla 1993). A subscriber of 
the defendant's BBS had uploaded files containing digitized 
pictures copied from the plaintiff's copyrighted magazine, which 
files remained on the BBS for other subscribers to download. Id. 
The court did not conclude, as plaintiffs suggest in this case, that 
the BBS is itself liable for the unauthorized reproduction of 
plaintiffs' work; instead, the court concluded that the BBS operator 
was liable for violating the plaintiff's right to publicly distribute 
and display copies of its work. Id at 1556-57.  
 
 
In support of their argument that Netcom is directly liable for 
copying plaintiffs' works, plaintiffs cite to the court's conclusion 
that "[t]here is no dispute that [the BBS operator] supplied a 
product containing unauthorized copies of a copyrighted work. It 
does not matter that [the BBS operator] claims he did not make the 
copies [him]self." D at 1556. It is clear from the context of this 
discussion[n14] that the Playboy court was looking only at the 
exclusive right to distribute copies to the public, where liability 
exists regardless of whether the defendant makes copies. Here, 
however, plaintiffs do not argue that Netcom is liable for its public 
distribution of copies. Instead, they claim that Netcom is liable 
because its computers in fact made copies. Therefore, the above-
quoted language has no bearing on the issue of direct liability for 
unauthorized reproductions. Notwithstanding Playboy's holding 
that a BBS operator may be directly liable for distributing or 
displaying to the public copies of protected works,[n15] this court 
holds that the storage on a defendant's system of infringing copies 
and retransmission to other servers is not a direct infringement by 
the BBS operator of the exclusive right to reproduce the work 
where such copies are uploaded by an infringing user. Playboy 
does not hold otherwise.[n16]   
 
e. Sega Case 
 
A court in this district addressed the issue of whether a BBS 
operator is liable for copyright infringement where it solicited 
subscribers to upload files containing copyrighted materials to the 
BBS that were available for others to download. Sega Enterprises 
Ltd. v. MAPHIA, 857 F. Supp. 679, 683 (N.D. Cal. 1994). The 
defendant's "MAPHIA" BBS contained copies of plaintiff Sega's 
video game programs that were uploaded by users. Id. at 683. The 
defendant solicited the uploading of such programs and received 
consideration for the right to download files. IL Access was given 
for a fee or to those purchasing the defendant's hardware device 
that allowed Sega video game cartridges to be copied. Id at 683-84. 
The court granted a preliminary injunction against the defendant, 
finding that plaintiffs had shown a prima facie case of direct and 
contributory infringement. Id at 687. The court found that copies 
were made by unknown users of the BBS when files were 
uploaded and downloaded. Id. Further, the court found that the 
defendant's I knowledge of the infringing activities, 
encouragement, direction and provision of the facilities through his 
operation of the BBS constituted contributory infringement, even 
though the defendant did not know exactly when files were 
uploaded or downloaded. Id. at 686-87.  
 
This court is not convinced that Sega provides support for a finding 
of direct infringement where copies are made on a defendant's BBS 
by users who upload files. Although there is some language in 
Sega regarding direct infringement, it is entirely conclusory:  
 
Sega has established a prima facie case of direct copyright 
infringement under 17 U.S.C. Section 501. Sega has established 
that unauthorized copies of its games are made when such games 
are uploaded to the MAPHIA bulletin board, here with the 
knowledge of Defendant Scherman. These games are thereby 
placed on the storage media of the electronic bulletin board by 
unknown users. Id. at 686 (emphasis added). The court's reference 
to the "knowledge of Defendant" indicates that the court was 
focusing on contributory infringement, as knowledge is not an 
element of direct infringement. Perhaps, Sega's references to direct 
infringement and that "copies . . . are made" are to the direct 
liability of the "unknown users," as there can be no contributory 
infringement by a defendant without direct infringement by 
another. See 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT Section 
12.04[A][3][a], at 12-89. Thus, the court finds that neither Playboy 
nor Sega requires finding Netcom liable for direct infringement of 
plaintiffs' exclusive right to reproduce their works.[n17]   
 
f. Public Distribution and Display? 
 
Plaintiffs allege that Netcom is directly liable for making copies of 
their works. See FAC 25. They also allege that Netcom violated 
their exclusive rights to publicly display copies of their works. 
FAC m 44, 51. There are no allegations that Netcom violated 
plaintiffs' exclusive right to publicly distribute their works. 
However, in their discussion of direct infringement, plaintiffs insist 
that Netcom is liable for "maintain[ing] copies of [Erlich's] 
messages on its server for eleven days for access by its subscribers 
and 'USENET neighbors"' and they compare this case to the 
Playboy case, which discussed the right of public distribution. 
Opp'n at 7. Plaintiffs also argued this theory of infringement at oral 
argument. Tr.[n18] 5:22. Because this could be an attempt to argue 
that Netcom has infringed plaintiffs' rights of public distribution 
and display, the court will address these arguments.  
 
Playboy concluded that the defendant infringed the plaintiff s 
exclusive rights to publicly ; distribute and display copies of its 
works. 839 F. Supp. at 1556-57. The court is not entirely 
convinced that the mere possession of a digital copy on a BBS that 
is accessible to some members of the public constitutes direct 
infringement by the BBS operator. Such a holding suffers from the 
same problem of causation as the reproduction argument. Only the 
subscriber should be liable for causing the distribution of plaintiffs' 
work, as the contributing actions of the BBS provider are 
automatic and indiscriminate. Erlich could have posted his 
messages through countless access providers and the outcome 
would be the same: anyone with access to Usenet newsgroups 
would be able to read his messages. There is no logical reason to 
draw a line around Netcom and Klemesrud and say that they are 
uniquely responsible for distributing Erlich's messages. Netcom is 
not even the first link in the chain of distribution-Erlich had no 
direct relationship with Netcom but dealt solely with Klemesrud's 
BBS, which used Netcom to gain its Internet access. Every Usenet 
server has a role in the distribution, so plaintiffs' argument would 
create unreasonable liability. Where the BBS merely stores and 
passes along all messages sent by its subscribers and others, the 
BBS should not be seen as causing these works to be publicly 
distributed or displayed.   
 
Even accepting the Playboy court's holding, the case is factually 
distinguishable. Unlike the BBS in that case, Netcom does not 
maintain an archive of files for its users. Thus, it cannot be said to 
be "suppl[ying] a product." In contrast to some of its larger 
competitors, Netcom does not create or control the content of the 
information available to its subscribers; it merely provides access 
to the Internet, whose content is controlled by no single entity. 
Although the Internet consists of many different computers 
networked together, some of which may contain infringing files, it 
does not make sense to hold the operator of each computer liable as 
an infringer merely because his or her computer is linked to a 
computer with an infringing file. It would be especially 
inappropriate to hold liable a service that acts more like a conduit, 
in other words, one that does not itself keep an archive of files for 
more than a short duration. Finding such a service liable would 
involve an unreasonably broad construction of public distribution 
and display rights. No purpose would be served by holding liable 
those who have no ability to control the information to which their 
subscribers have access, even though they might be in some sense 
helping to achieve the Internet's automatic "public distribution" 
and the users' "public" display of files.  
 
g. Conclusion  
 
The court is not persuaded by plaintiffs' argument that Netcom is 
directly liable for the copies that are made and stored on its 
computer. Where the infringing subscriber is clearly directly liable 
for the same act, it does not make sense to adopt a rule that could 
lead to the liability of countless parties whose role in the 
infringement is nothing more than setting up and operating a 
system that is necessary for the functioning of the Internet. Such a 
result is unnecessary as there is already a party directly liable for 
causing the copies to be made. Plaintiffs occasionally claim that 
they only seek to hold liable a party that refuses to delete 
infringing files after they have been warned. However, such 
liability cannot be based on a theory of direct infringement, where 
knowledge is irrelevant. The court does not find workable a theory 
of infringement that would hold the entire Internet liable for 
activities that cannot reasonably be deterred. Billions of bits of data 
flow through the Internet and are necessarily stored on servers 
throughout the network and it is thus practically impossible to 
screen out infringing bits from noninfringing bits. Because the 
court cannot see any meaningful distinction (without regard to 
knowledge) between what Netcom did and what every other 
Usenet server does, the court finds that Netcom cannot be held 
liable for direct infringement. Cf: IITF Report at 69 (noting 
uncertainty regarding whether BBS operator should be directly 
liable for reproduction or distribution of files uploaded by a 
subscriber).[n19]  
 
2. Contributory Infringement 
 
Netcom is not free from liability just because it did not directly 
infringe plaintiffs' works; it may still be liable as a contributory 
infringer. Although there is no statutory rule of liability for 
infringement committed by others,  
 
[t]he absence of such express language in the copyright statute 
does not preclude the imposition of liability for copyright 
infringement on certain parties who have not themselves engaged 
in the infringing activity. For vicarious liability is imposed in 
virtually all areas of the law, and the concept of contributory 
infringement is merely a species of the broader problem of 
identifying the circumstances in which it is just to hold one 
individual accountable for the actions of another. Sony Corp. v. 
Universal City Studios. Inc, 464 U.S. 417, 435 (1984) (footnote 
omitted). Liability for participation in the infringement will be 
established where the defendant, "with knowledge of the infringing 
activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing 
conduct of another." Gershwin Publishing Corp v Columbia Artists 
Management. Inc., 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971).   
 
a. Knowledge of Infringing Activity 
 
Plaintiffs insist that Netcom knew that Erlich was infringing their 
copyrights at least after receiving notice from plaintiffs' counsel 
indicating that Erlich had posted copies of their works onto a.r.s. 
through Netcom's system. Despite this knowledge, Netcom 
continued to allow Erlich to post messages to a.r.s. and left the 
allegedly infringing messages on its system so that Netcom's 
subscribers and other Usenet servers could access them. Netcom 
argues that it did not possess the necessary type of knowledge 
because (1) it did not know of Erlich's planned infringing activities 
when it agreed to lease its facilities to Klemesrud, (2) it did not 
know that Erlich would infringe prior to any of his postings, (3) it 
is unable to screen out infringing postings before they are made, 
and (4) its knowledge of the infringing nature of Erlich's postings 
was too equivocal given the difficulty in assessing whether the 
registrations were valid and whether Erlich's use was fair. The 
court will address these arguments in turn.  
 
Netcom cites cases holding that there is no contributory 
infringement by the lessors of premises that are later used for 
infringement unless the lessor had knowledge of the intended use 
at the time of the signing of the lease. See. e.g. Deutsch v. Arnold, 
98 F.2d 686, 688 (2d Cir. 1938).[n20] The contribution to the 
infringement by the defendant in Deutsch was merely to lease use 
of the premises to the infringer. Here, Netcom not only leases 
space but also serves as an access provider, which includes the 
storage and transmission of information necessary to facilitate 
Erlich' s postings to a.r.s. Unlike a landlord, Netcom retains some 
control over the use of its system. See infra part I.B.3.a. Thus, the 
relevant time frame for knowledge is not when Netcom entered 
into an agreement with Klemesrud. It should be when Netcom 
provided its services to allow Erlich to infringe plaintiffs' 
copyrights. Cf: Screen Gems-Columbia Music. Inc. v. Mark-Fi 
Records. Inc., 256 F. Supp. 399, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 1966) (analyzing 
knowledge at time that defendant rendered its particular service). It 
is undisputed that Netcom did not know that Erlich was infringing 
before it received notice from plaintiffs. Netcom points out that the 
alleged instances of infringement occurring on Netcom' s system 
all happened prior to December 29, 1994, the date on which 
Netcom first received notice of plaintiffs' infringement claim 
against Erlich. See Pisani Feb. 8, 1995 Decl., s 6 & Exs. (showing 
latest posting made on December 29, 1994); McShane Feb. 8, 1995 
Decl.; FAC m 36-38 & Ex. I. Thus, there is no question of fact as 
to whether Netcom knew or should have known of Erlich's 
infringing activities that occurred more than 11 days before receipt 
of the December 28, 1994 letter.  
 
However, the evidence reveals a question of fact as to whether 
Netcom knew or should have known that Erlich had infringed 
plaintiffs' copyrights following receipt of plaintiffs' letter. Because 
Netcom was arguably participating in Erlich's public distribution of 
plaintiffs' works, there is a genuine issue as to whether Netcom 
knew of any infringement by Erlich before it was too late to do 
anything about it. If plaintiffs can prove the knowledge element, 
Netcom will be liable for contributory infringement since its failure 
to simply cancel Erlich's infringing message and thereby stop an 
infringing copy from being distributed worldwide constitutes 
substantial participation in Erlich's public distribution of the 
message. Cf R.T. Nimmer, THE LAW OF COMPUTER 
TECHNOLOGY Paragraph 15.11 B, at S 15-42 (2d ed. 1994) 
(opining that "where information service is less directly involved 
in the enterprise of creating unauthorized copies, a finding of 
contributory infringement is not likely").  
 
Netcom argues that its knowledge after receiving notice of Erlich's 
alleged infringing activities was too equivocal given the difficulty 
in assessing whether registrations are valid and whether use is fair. 
Although a mere unsupported allegation of infringement by a 
copyright owner may not automatically put a defendant on notice 
of infringing activity, Netcom's position that liability must be 
unequivocal is unsupportable. While perhaps the typical infringing 
activities of BBSs will involve copying software, where BBS 
operators are better equipped to judge infringement, the fact that 
this involves written works should not distinguish it. Where works 
contain copyright notices within them, as here, it is difficult to 
argue that a defendant did not know that the works were 
copyrighted. To require proof of valid registrations would be 
impractical and would perhaps take too long to verify, making it 
impossible for a copyright holder to protect his or her works in 
some cases, as works are automatically deleted less than two weeks 
after they are posted. The court is more persuaded by the argument 
that it is beyond the ability of a BBS operator to quickly and fairly 
determine when a use is not infringement where there is at least a 
colorable claim of fair use. Where a BBS operator cannot 
reasonably verify a claim of infringement, either because of a 
possible fair use defense, the lack of copyright notices on the 
copies, or the copyright holder's failure to provide the necessary 
documentation to show that there is a likely infringement, the 
operator' s lack of knowledge will be found reasonable and there 
will be no liability for contributory infringement for allowing the 
continued distribution of the works on its system.  
 
Since Netcom was given notice of an infringement claim before 
Erlich had completed his infringing activity, there may be a 
question of fact as to whether Netcom knew or should have known 
that such activities were infringing. Given the context of a dispute 
between a former minister and a church he is criticizing, Netcom 
may be able to show that its lack of knowledge that Erlich was 
infringing was reasonable. However, Netcom admits that it did not 
even look at the postings once given notice and that had it looked 
at the copyright notice and statements regarding authorship, it 
would have triggered an investigation into whether there was 
infringement. Kobrin June 7, 1995 Decl., Ex. H, Hoffman Depo. 
At 125-128. These facts are sufficient to raise a question as to 
Netcom's knowledge-once it received a letter from plaintiffs on 
December 29, 1994.[n21]  
 
b. Substantial Participation  
 
Where a defendant has knowledge of the primary infringer's 
infringing activities, it will be liable if it "induces, causes or 
materially contributes to the infringing conduct of" the primary 
infringer. Gershwin Publishing, 443 F.2d at 1162. Such 
participation must be substantial. Apple Computer. Inc v. 
Microsoft Corp., 821 F. Supp. 616, 625 (N.D. Cal. 1993), aff'd, 35 
F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994); Demetriades v. Kaufmann, 690 F. Supp. 
289, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  
 
Providing a service that allows for the automatic distribution of all 
Usenet postings, infringing and noninfringing, goes well beyond 
renting a premises to an infringer. See Fonovisa Inc. v. Cherry 
Auction. Inc., 847 F. Supp. 1492, 1496 (E.D. Cal. 1994) (finding 
that renting space at swap meet to known bootleggers not 
"substantial participation" in the infringers' activities). It is more 
akin to the radio stations that were found liable for rebroadcasting 
an infringing broadcast. See. e.g., Select Theatres Corp. v. Ronzoni 
Macaroni Corp, 59 U.S.P.Q. 288, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 1943). . Netcom 
allows Erlich's infringing messages to remain on its system and be 
further distributed to other Usenet servers worldwide. It does not 
completely relinquish control over how its system is used, unlike a 
landlord. Thus, it is fair, assuming Netcom is able to take simple 
measures to prevent further damage to plaintiffs' copyrighted 
works, to hold Netcom liable for contributory infringement where 
Netcom has knowledge of Erlich's infringing postings yet 
continues to aid in the accomplishment of Erlich's purpose of 
publicly distributing the postings. Accordingly, plaintiffs do raise a 
genuine issue of material fact as to their theory of contributory 
infringement as to the postings made after Netcom was on notice 
of plaintiffs' infringement claim.  
 
3. Vicarious Liability 
 
Even if plaintiffs cannot prove that Netcom is contributorily liable 
for its participation in the infringing activity, it may still seek to 
prove vicarious infringement based on Netcom' s relationship to 
Erlich. A defendant is liable for vicarious liability for the actions of 
a primary infringer where the defendant (1) has the right and 
ability to control the infringer's acts and (2) receives a direct 
financial benefit from the infringement. See Shapiro. Bernstein & 
Co. v. H.L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304, 306 (2d Cir. 1963). Unlike 
contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of 
vicarious liability. 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT Section 
12.04[A][1], at 12-70.  
 
a. Right and Ability To Control 
 
The first element of vicarious liability will be met if plaintiffs can 
show that Netcom has the right and ability to supervise the conduct 
of its subscribers. Netcom argues that it does not have the right to 
control its users' postings before they occur. Plaintiffs dispute this 
and argue that Netcom's terms and conditions, to which its 
subscribers[n22] must agree, specify that Netcom reserves the right 
to take remedial action against subscribers. See. e.g., Francis Depo. 
at 124-126. Plaintiffs argue that under "netiquette," the informal 
rules and customs that have developed on the Internet, violation of 
copyrights by a user is unacceptable and the access provider has a 
duty take measures to prevent this; where the immediate service 
provider fails, the next service provider up the transmission stream 
must act. See Castleman Decl. m 3243. Further evidence of 
Netcom's right to restrict infringing activity is its prohibition of 
copyright infringement and its requirement that its subscribers 
indemnify it for any damage to third parties. See Kobrin May 5, 
1995 Decl., Ex. G. Plaintiffs have thus raised a question of fact as 
to Netcom's right to control Erlich's use of its services.  
 
Netcom argues that it could not possibly screen messages before 
they are posted given the speed and volume of the data that goes 
through its system. Netcom further argues that it has never 
exercised control over the content of its users' postings. Plaintiffs' 
expert opines otherwise, stating that with an easy software 
modification Netcom could identify postings that contain particular 
words or come from particular individuals. Castleman Decl. m 39-
43; see also Francis Depo. at 262-63; Hoffman Depo. at 173-74, 
178.[n23] Plaintiffs further dispute Netcom's claim that it could not 
limit Erlich's access to Usenet without kicking off all 500 
subscribers of Klemesrud's BBS. As evidence that Netcom has in 
fact exercised its ability to police its users' conduct, plaintiffs cite 
evidence that Netcom has acted to suspend subscribers' accounts 
on over one thousand occasions. See Ex. J (listing suspensions of 
subscribers by Netcom for commercial advertising, posting 
obscene materials, and off-topic postings). Further evidence shows 
that Netcom can delete specific postings. & Tr. 9:16. Whether such 
sanctions occurred before or after the abusive conduct is not 
material to whether Netcom can exercise control. The court thus 
finds that plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of fact as to 
whether Netcom has the right and ability to exercise control over 
the activities of its subscribers, and of Erlich in particular.  
 
b. Direct Financial Benefit  
 
Plaintiffs must further prove that Netcom receives a direct financial 
benefit from the infringing activities of its users. For example, a 
landlord who has the right and ability to supervise the tenant's 
activities is vicariously liable for the infringements of the tenant 
where the rental amount is proportional to the proceeds of the 
tenant's sales. Shapiro. Bernstein, 316 F.2d at 306. However, where 
a defendant rents space or services on a fixed rental fee that does 
not depend on the nature of the activity of the lessee, courts usually 
find no vicarious liability because there is no direct financial 
benefit from the infringement. See. e.g., Roy Export Co. v. 
Trustees of Columbia University, 344 F. Supp. 1350, 1353 
(S.D.N.Y. 1972) (finding no vicarious liability of university 
because no financial benefit from allowing screening of bootlegged 
films); Fonovisa, 847 F. Supp. at 1496 (finding swap meet 
operators did not financially benefit from fixed fee); see also Kelly 
Tickle, Comment, The Vicarious Liability of Electronic Bulletin 
Board Operators for the Copyright Infringement Occurring on 
Their Bulletin Boards, 80 IOWA L. REV. 391, 415 (1995) 
(arguing that BBS operators "lease cyberspace" and should thus be 
treated like landlords, who are not liable for infringement that 
occurs on their premises).  
 
Plaintiffs argue that courts will find a financial benefit despite 
fixed fees. In Polygram International Publishing. Inc. v. 
Nevada/TIG. Inc., 855 F Supp. 1314, 1330-33 (D. Mass. 1994), the 
court found a trade show organizer vicariously liable for the 
infringing performance of an exhibitor because, although the 
infringement did not affect the fixed rental fee received by the 
organizers, the organizers benefitted from the performances, which 
helped make the show a financial success. Sat see Artists Music. 
Inc. v. Reed Publishing, Inc., 31 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1623, 1994 WL 
191643, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (finding no vicarious liability for 
trade show organizers where revenues not increased because of 
infringing music performed by exhibitors). Plaintiffs cite two other 
cases where, despite fixed fees, defendants received financial 
benefits from allowing groups to perform infringing works over the 
radio without having to get an ASCAP license, which minimized 
the defendants' expenses. See Boz Scaggs Music v. KND Corp, 
491 F Supp. 980, 913 (D. Conn. 1980); Realsongs v. Gulf 
Broadcasting Corp., 824 F. Supp. 89, 92 (M.D. La 1993). 
Plaintiffs' cases are factually distinguishable. Plaintiffs cannot 
provide any evidence of a direct financial benefit received by 
Netcom from Erlich's infringing postings. Unlike Shapiro. 
Bernstein, and like Fonovisa, Netcom receives a fixed fee. There is 
no evidence that infringement by Erlich, or any other user of 
;Netcom's services, in any way enhances the value of Netcom's 
services to subscribers or attracts new subscribers. Plaintiffs argue, 
however, that Netcom somehow derives a benefit from its 
purported "policy of refusing to take enforcement actions against 
its subscribers and others who transmit infringing messages over 
its computer networks." Opp'n at 18. Plaintiffs point to Netcom's 
advertisements that, compared to competitors like CompuServe 
and America Online, Netcom provides easy, regulation-free 
Internet access. Plaintiffs assert that Netcom's policy attracts 
copyright infringers to its system, resulting in a direct financial 
benefit. The court is not convinced that such an argument, if true, 
would constitute a direct financial benefit to Netcom from Erlich's 
'infringing activities. See Fonovisa 847 F. Supp. at 1496 (finding 
no direct financial benefit despite 'argument that lessees included 
many vendors selling counterfeit goods and that clientele sought 
t"bargain basement prices"). Further, plaintiffs' argument is not 
supported by probative evidence. The only "evidence" plaintiffs 
cite for their supposition is the declaration of their counsel, Elliot 
Abelson, who states that [o]n April 7, 1995, in a conversation 
regarding Netcom's position related to this case, Randolf Rice, 
attorney for Netcom, informed me that Netcom's executives are 
happy about the publicity it is receiving in the press as a result of 
this case. Mr. Rice also told me that Netcom was concerned that it 
would lose business if it took action against Erlich or Klemesrud in 
connection with Erlich's infringements. Abelson Decl. Paragraph 2. 
Netcom objects to this declaration as hearsay and as inadmissible 
evidence of statements made in compromise negotiations. Fed. R. 
Ev. 801, 408. Whether or not this declaration is admissible, it does 
not support plaintiffs' argument that Netcom either has a policy of 
not enforcing violations of copyright laws by its subscribers or, 
assuming such a policy exists, that Netcom's policy directly 
financially benefits Netcom, such as by attracting new subscribers. 
Because plaintiffs have failed to raise a question of fact on this 
vital element, their claim of vicarious liability fails. See Roy 
Exports 344 F. Supp. at 1353.  
 
4. First Amendment Argument 
 
Netcom argues that plaintiffs' theory of liability contravenes the 
first amendment, as it would chill the use of the Internet because 
every access provider or user would be subject to liability when a 
user posts an infringing work to a Usenet newsgroup. While the 
court agrees that an overbroad injunction might implicate the First 
Amendment, see In re Capital Cities/ABC. Inc, 918 F.2d 140, 144 
(11 th Cir. 1990),[n24] imposing liability for infringement where it 
is otherwise appropriate does not necessarily raise a First 
Amendment issue. The copyright concepts of the idea/expression 
dichotomy and the fair use defense balance the important First 
Amendment rights with the constitutional authority for 
"promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts," U.S. 
CONST. art. I, Section 8, cl. 8; 1 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT 
Section l.1O[B], at 1-71 to -83. Netcom argues that liability here 
would force Usenet servers to perform the impossible-screening all 
the information that comes through their systems. However, the 
court is not convinced that Usenet servers are directly liable for 
causing a copy to be made, and absent evidence of knowledge and 
participation or control and direct profit, they will not be 
contributorily or vicariously liable. If Usenet servers were 
responsible for screening all messages coming through their 
systems, this could have a serious chilling effect on what some say 
may turn out to be the best public forum for free speech yet 
devised. a Jerry Berman & Daniel J. Weitzner, Abundance and 
User Control: Renewing the Democratic Heart of the First 
Amendment in the Age of Interactive Media, 104 YALE L. J. 
1619, 1624 (1995) (praising decentralized networks for opening 
access to all with no entity stifling independent sources of speech); 
Rose, supra at 4.[n25] Finally, Netcom admits that its First 
Amendment argument is merely a consideration in the fair use 
argument, which the court will now address. See Reply at 24.  
 
5. Fair Use Defense 
 
Assuming plaintiffs can prove a violation of one of the exclusive 
rights guaranteed in section 106, there is no infringement if the 
defendant's use is fair under section 108. The proper focus here is 
on whether Netcom's actions qualify as fair use, not on whether 
Erlich himself engaged in fair use; the court has already found that 
Erlich was not likely entitled to his own fair use defense, as his 
postings contained large portions of plaintiffs' published and 
unpublished works quoted verbatim with little added commentary.  
 
Although the author has the exclusive rights to reproduce, publicly 
distribute, and publicly display a copyrighted work under section 
106, these rights are limited by the defense of "fair use." 17 U.S.C. 
Section 107. The defense "permits and requires courts to avoid 
rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it 
would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to 
foster." Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. Inc., 114 S. Ct. 1164, 1170 
(1994) (citation omitted). Congress has set out four nonexclusive 
factors to be considered in determining the availability of the fair 
use defense:  
 
( I ) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such 
use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational 
purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;  
 
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to 
the copyrighted work as a whole; and  
 
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of 
the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. Section 107. The fair use doctrine 
calls for a case-by-case analysis. Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1170. All 
of the factors "are to be explored, and the results weighed together, 
in light of the purposes of copyright." Id at 1170-71.  
 
a. First Factor: Purpose and Character of the Use   
 
The first statutory factor looks to the purpose and character of the 
defendant's use. Netcom's use of plaintiffs' works is to carry out its 
commercial function as an Internet access provider. Such a use, 
regardless of the underlying uses made by Netcom's subscribers, is 
clearly commercial. Netcom's use, though commercial, also 
benefits the public in allowing for the functioning of the Internet 
and the dissemination of other creative works, a goal of the 
Copyright Act. See Sega v. Accolade 977 F.2d 1510, 1523 (9th 
Cir. 1992) (holding that intermediate copying to accomplish 
reverse engineering of software fair use despite commercial nature 
of activity; considering public benefit of use). The Campbell Court 
emphasized that a commercial use does not dictate against a 
finding of fair use, as most of the uses listed in the statute are 
"generally conducted for profit in this country." 114 S. Ct. at 1174. 
Although Netcom gains financially from its distribution of 
messages to the Internet, its financial incentive is unrelated to the 
infringing activity and the defendant receives no direct financial 
benefit from the acts of infringement. Therefore, the commercial 
nature of the defendant's activity should not be dispositive. 
Moreover, there is no easy way for a defendant like Netcom to 
secure a license for carrying ever,v possible type of copyrighted 
work onto the Internet. Thus, it should not be seen as "profit[ing] 
from the exploitation of the copyrighted work without paying the 
customary prices." Harper & Row. Publishers. Inc. v. Nation 
Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 562 (1985). It is undisputed that, unlike 
the defendants in Playboy and Sega, Netcom does not directly gain 
anything from the content of the information available to its 
subscribers on the Internet. See supra part I.B.3.b. Because it does 
not itself provide the files or solicit infringing works, its purpose is 
different from that of the defendants in Playboy and Sega Because 
Netcom's use of copyrighted materials served a completely 
different function than that of the plaintiffs, this factor weighs in 
Netcom's favor, see Hustler Magazine. Inc. v. Moral Majority. Inc.. 
606 F. Supp. 1526, 1535 (C.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 796 F.2d 1148 
(9th Cir. 1986), notwithstanding the otherwise commercial nature 
of Netcom's use.  
 
b. Second Factor: Nature of the Copyrighted Work   
 
The second factor focuses on two different aspects of the 
copyrighted work: whether it is published or unpublished and 
whether it is informational or creative.[n26] Plaintiffs rely on the 
fact that some of the works transmitted by Netcom were 
unpublished and some were arguably highly creative and original. 
However, because Netcom's use of the works was merely to 
facilitate their posting to the Usenet, which is an entirely different 
purpose than plaintiffs' use (or, for that matter, Erlich's use), the 
precise nature of those works is not important to the fair use 
determination. a Campbell, 114 S. Ct. at 1175 (finding creative 
nature of work copied irrelevant where copying for purposes of 
parody); Hustler Magazine. 606 F. Supp. at 1537; 3 NIMMER ON 
COPYRIGHT Section 13.05[A][2][a], at 13177 ("It is sometimes 
necessary, in calibrating the fair use defense, to advert to the 
defendant's usage simultaneously with the nature of the plaintiff's 
work.").  
 
c. Third Factor: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used   
 
The third factor concerns both the percentage of the original work 
that was copied and whether that portion constitutes the "heart" of 
the copyrighted work. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65. 
Generally, no more of a work may be copied than is necessary for 
the particular use. See Supermarket of Homes v. San Fernando 
Valley Board of Realtors 786 F.2d 1400, 1409 (9th Cir. 1986). The 
copying of an entire work will ordinarily militate against a finding 
of fair use, although this is not a per se rule. Sony, 464 U.S. at 449-
450.  
 
Plaintiffs have shown that Erlich's postings copied substantial 
amounts of the originals or, in some cases, the entire works. 
Netcom, of course, made available to the Usenet exactly what was 
posted by Erlich. As the court found in Sony, the mere fact that all 
of a work is copied is not determinative of the fair use question, 
where such total copying is essential given the purpose of the 
copying. Id (allowing total copying in context of time-shifting 
copyrighted television shows by home viewers). For example, 
where total copying was necessary to carry out the defendants' 
beneficial purpose of reverse engineering software to get at the 
ideas found in the source code, the court found fair use. Sega v. 
Accolade, 977 F.2d at 1526-27. Here, Netcom copied no more of 
plaintiffs' works than necessarily.v to function as a Usenet server. 
Like the defendant in Sega v. Accolade, Netcom had no practical 
alternative way to carry out its socially useful purpose; a Usenet 
server must copy all files, since the prescreening of postings for 
potential copyright infringement is not feasible. 977 F.2d at 1526. 
Accordingly, this factor should not defeat an otherwise valid 
defense.  
 
d. Fourth Factor: Effect of the Use upon the Potential Market for 
the Work   
 
The fourth and final statutory factor concerns "the extent of market 
harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer" and 
"'whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged 
in by the defendant . . . would result in a substantially adverse 
impact on the potential market' for the original." Campbell, 114 S. 
Ct. at 1177 (quoting 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT Section 13.05 
[A][4]) (remanding for consideration of this factor). Although the 
results of all four factors must be weighed together, id at 1171, the 
fourth factor is the most important consideration, 3 NIMMER ON 
COPYRIGHT Section 13.05[A][4], at 13-188 to -189 (citing 
Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566), 13-207 (observing that fourth 
factor explains results in recent Supreme Court cases).  
 
Netcom argues that there is no evidence that making accessible 
plaintiffs' works, which consist of religious scriptures and policy 
letters, will harm the market for these works by preventing 
someone from participating in the Scientology religion because 
they can view the works on the Internet instead. Further, Netcom 
notes that the relevant question is whether the postings fulfill the 
demand of an individual who seeks to follow the religion's 
teachings, and not whether they suppress the desire of an 
individual who is affected by the criticism posted by Erlich. 
Netcom argues that the court must focus on the "normal market" 
for the copyrighted work, which in this case is through a 
Scientology-based organization. Plaintiffs respond that the 
Internet's extremely widespread distribution-where more than 25 
million people worldwide have access-multiplies the effects of 
market substitution. In support of its motion for a preliminary 
injunction against Erlich, plaintiffs submitted declarations 
regarding the potential effect of making the Church's secret 
scriptures available over the Internet. Plaintiffs point out that, 
although the Church currently faces no competition, groups in the 
past have used stolen copies of the Church's scriptures in charging 
for Scientology-like religious training. See. e.g., Bridge 
Publications. Inc. v. Vien, 827 F. Supp. 629, 633-34 (S.D. Cal. 
1993); Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim, 796 F.2d 
1076, 1078-79 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1103 (1987). 
This evidence raises a genuine issue as to the possibility that 
Erlich's postings, made available over the Internet by Netcom, 
could hurt the market for plaintiffs' works.  
 
e. Equitable Balancing  
 
In balancing the various factors, the court finds that there is a 
question of fact as to whether there is a valid fair use defense. 
Netcom has not justified its copying plaintiffs' works to the extent 
necessary to establish entitlement to summary judgment in light of 
evidence that it knew that Erlich's use was infringing and had the 
ability to prevent its further distribution. While copying all or most 
of a work will often preclude fair use, courts have recognized the 
fair use defense where the purpose of the use is beneficial to 
society, complete copying is necessary given the type of use, the 
purpose of the use is completely different than the purpose of the 
original, and there is no evidence that the use will significantly 
harm the market for the original. This case is distinguishable from 
those cases recognizing fair use despite total copying. In Sony, the 
home viewers' use was not commercial and the viewers were 
allowed to watch the entire shows for free. In Sega v. Accolade, 
the complete copying was necessitated to access the unprotectable 
idea in the original. Here, plaintiffs never gave either Edich or 
Netcom permission to view or copy their works. Netcom's use has 
some commercial aspects. Further, Netcom's copying is not for the 
purpose of getting to the unprotected idea behind plaintiffs' works. 
Although plaintiffs may ultimately lose on their infringement 
claims if, among other things, they cannot prove that posting their 
copyrighted works will harm the market for these works, see 
Religious Technology Center v. Lerma, F. Supp., No. 95-1107-A, 
slip op. at 10 (E.D. Va. August 30, 1995) (finding fair use defense 
exists where no separate market for works because Scientologists 
cannot effectively use them without the Church's supervision); 
Religious Technology Center v. F.A.C.T.Net. Inc., No. 95-B-2143, 
slip op. at 11-14 (D. Colo. September 15, 1995) (finding no 
showing of a potential effect on the market for plaintiffs' works), 
fair use presents a factual question on which plaintiffs have at least 
raised a genuine issue of fact. Accordingly, the court does not find 
that Netcom's use was fair as a matter of law.   
 
C. Conclusion 
 
The court finds that plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of fact 
regarding whether Netcom should have known that Erlich was 
infringing their copyrights after receiving a letter from plaintiffs, 
whether Netcom substantially participated in the infringement, and 
whether Netcom has a valid fair use defense. Accordingly, Netcom 
is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim of 
contributory copyright infringement. However, plaintiffs' claims of 
direct and vicarious infringement fail.  
 
II. KLEMESRUD'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE 
PLEADINGS   
 
A. Standards for Judgment on the Pleadings   
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 12(C) is directed at the legal sufficiency of a 
part's allegations. A judgment on the pleadings is proper when 
there are no issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled 
to judgment as a matter of law. General Conference Corp. v. 
Seventh Day Adventist Church, 887 F.2d 228, 230 (9th Cir. 1989), 
=, denied, 493 U.S. 1079 (1990); Hal Roach Studios v. Rich~d 
Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1550 (9th Cir. 1990). In ruling on a 
motion for judgment on the pleadings, district courts must accept 
all material allegations of fact alleged in the complaint as true, and 
resolve all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. The court 
need not accept as true conclusory allegations or legal 
characterizations. Western Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 
624 (9th Cir. 1981). Materials submitted with the complaint may 
be considered. Hal Roach Studios, 896 F 2d at 1555. All 
affirmative defenses must clearly appear on the face of the 
complaint. McCalden v. California Library Ass'n, 955 F.2d 1214, 
1219 (9th Cir. 1990).   
 
B. Copyright Infringement 
 
1. Direct Infringement 
 
First, plaintiffs allege that Klemesrud directly infringed their 
copyrights by "reproduc[ing] and publish[ing] plaintiffs' works. 
FAC Paragraph 35. The complaint alleges that "Erlich . . . caused 
copies of [plaintiffs' works] to be published, without authorization, 
on the BBS computer maintained by Klemesrud" and that 
"Klemesrud's BBS computer, after receiving and storing for some 
period of time the copies of the Works sent to it from Erlich, 
created additional copies of the works and sent these copies to 
Netcom's computer." FAC Paragraph 34. The allegations against 
Klemesrud fail for the same reason the court found that Netcom 
was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the direct 
infringement claim. There are no allegations that Klemesrud took 
any affirmative steps to cause the copies to be made. The 
allegations, in fact, merely say that "Erlich . . . caused" the copies 
to be made and that Klemesrud's computer, not Klemesrud himself, 
created additional copies. There are no allegations in the complaint 
to overcome the missing volitional or causal elements necessary to 
hold a BBS operator directly liable for copying that is automatic 
and caused by a subscriber. See supra part I.B. I .  
 
2. Contributory Infringement 
 
Second, the complaint alleges that Klemesrud is contributorily 
liable. FAC 1135- It further alleges that plaintiffs repeatedly 
objected to Klemesrud's actions and informed him that Erlich's 
(and his) actions constituted infringement. FAC Paragraph 36. A 
letter attached to the complaint indicates that such notice was first 
sent to Klemesrud on December 30, 1994. FAC, Ex. I. Despite the 
warnings, Klemesrud allegedly refused to assist plaintiffs in 
compelling Erlich to stop his postings and refused to stop 
receiving, copying, transmitting and publishing the postings. FAC 
Paragraph 38. To state a claim for contributory infringement, 
plaintiffs must allege that Klemesrud knew or should have known 
of Erlich's infringing actions at the time they occurred and yet 
substantially participated by "induc[ing], caus[ing] or materially 
contribut[ing] to the infringing conduct" of Erlich. Gershwin, 443 
F.2d at 1162. For the reasons discussed in connection with 
Netcom's motion, the court finds plaintiffs' pleadings sufficient to 
raise an issue of contributory infringement.  
 
3. Vicarious Liability 
 
The third theory of liability argued by plaintiffs, vicarious liability, 
is not specifically mentioned in the complaint. Nonetheless, this 
theory fails as a matter of law because there are insufficient factual 
allegations to support it. Plaintiffs must show that Klemesrud had 
the right and ability to control Erlich's activities and that 
Klemesrud had a direct financial interest in Erlich's infringement. 
Shapiro. Bernstein, 316 F.2d at 306. A letter from Klemesrud to 
plaintiffs' counsel states that Klemesrud would comply with 
plaintiffs' request to take actions against Erlich by deleting the 
infringing postings from his BBS if plaintiffs mailed him the 
original copyrighted work and he found that they matched the 
allegedly infringing posting. FAC, Ex. J. Plaintiffs argue that this 
letter indicates Klemesrud's ability and right to control Erlich's 
activities on his BBS. The court finds that this letter, construed in 
the light most favorable to plaintiffs, raises a question as to 
whether plaintiffs can show that Klemesrud, in the operation of his 
BBS, could control Erlich's activities, such as by deleting 
infringing postings. However, plaintiffs' failure to allege a financial 
benefit is fatal to their claim for vicarious liability.  
 
The complaint alleges that Klemesrud is in the business of 
operating a BBS for subscribers for a fee. The complaint does not 
say how the fee is collected, but there are no allegations that 
Klemesrud's fee, or any other direct financial benefit received by 
Klemesrud, varies in any way with the content of Erlich's postings. 
Nothing in or attached to the complaint states that Klemesrud in 
any way profits from allowing Erlich to infringe copyrights. 
Plaintiffs are given 30 days leave in which to amend to cure this 
pleadings deficiency if they can do so in good faith.  
 
III. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AGAINST NETCOM AND 
KLEMESRUD   
 
A. Legal Standards for a Preliminary Injunction   
 
A party seeking a preliminary injunction may establish its 
entitlement to equitable relief by showing either (1) a combination 
of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable 
injury, or (2) serious questions as to these matters and the balance 
of hardships tipping sharply in the movant's favor. First Brands 
Corp. v. Fred Meyer. Inc., 809 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir. 1987). 
These two tests are not separate, but represent a "continuum" of 
equitable discretion whereby the greater the relative hardship to the 
moving party, the less probability of success need be shown. 
Regents of University of California v. American Broadcasting 
Cos., 747 F.2d 511, 515 (9th Cir. 1984). The primary purpose of a 
preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial 
on the merits. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. 
National Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1980).   
 
B. Likelihood of Success 
 
The court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing 
a likelihood of success on the merits as to either Netcom or 
Klemesrud. The only viable theory of infringement is contributory 
infringement, and there is little evidence that Netcom or 
Klemesrud knew or should have known that Erlich was engaged in 
copyright infringement of plaintiffs' works and was not entitled to 
a fair use defense, especially as they did not receive notice of the 
alleged infringement until after all but one of the postings were 
completed. Further, their participation in the infringement was not 
substantial. Accordingly, plaintiffs will not likely prevail on their 
claims.   
 
C. Irreparable Injury 
 
The court will presume irreparable harm for the copyright claim 
where plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claims 
of infringement. Johnson Controls. Inc. v. Phoenix Control 
Systems. Inc., 886 F.2d 1173, 1174 (9th Cir. 1989). Here, however, 
plaintiffs have not made an adequate showing of likelihood of 
success. More importantly, plaintiffs have not shown that the 
current preliminary injunction prohibiting Erlich from infringing 
plaintiffs' copyrights will not be sufficient to avoid any harm to 
plaintiffs' intellectual property rights.   
 
D. First Amendment Concerns 
 
There is a strong presumption against any injunction that could act 
as a "prior restraint" on free speech, citing CBS. Inc. v. Davis, 114 
S. Ct. 912, 913-14 (1994) (Justice Blackmun, as Circuit Justice, 
staying a preliminary injunction prohibiting CBS from airing 
footage of inside of meat packing plant). Because plaintiffs seek 
injunctive relief that is broader than necessary to prevent Erlich 
from committing copyright infringement, there is a valid First 
Amendment question raised here. Netcom and Klemesrud play a 
vital role in the speech of their users. Requiring them to prescreen 
postings for possible infringement would chill their users' speech. z 
In re Capital Cities/ABC. Inc, 918 F.2d at 144.   
 
E. Conclusion 
 
Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of 
their copyright claims nor irreparable harm absent an injunction 
against defendants Netcom and Klemesrud. Accordingly, plaintiffs 
are not entitled to a preliminary injunction.  
 
IV. ORDER  
 
The court denies Netcom's motion for summary judgment and 
Klemesrud's motion for judgment on the pleadings, as a triable 
issue of fact exists on the claim of contributory infringement. The 
court also gives plaintiffs 30 days leave in which to amend to state 
a claim for vicarious liability against defendant Klemesrud, if they 
can do so in good faith. Plaintiffs' application for a preliminary 
injunction against defendants Netcom and Klemesrud is denied.  
 
The parties shall appear for a case management conference at 
10:30 a.m. on Friday, January 1-9, 1996. The deadline for 
completing required disclosures is January 5, 1996. The joint case 
management conference statement must be filed by January 12, 
1996.

1 Cyberspace is a popular term for the world of electronic 
communications over computer networks. See Trotter Hardy, The 
Proper Legal Regime for "Cyberspace, " 55 U. Pitt. L. REV. 993, 
994 (1994).  
 
2 "The Internet today is a worldwide entity whose nature cannot be 
easily or simply defined. From a technical definition, the Internet is 
the 'set of all interconnected IP networks'-the collection of several 
thousand local, regional, and global computer networks 
interconnected in real time via the TCP/IP Internetworking 
Protocol suite." Daniel P. Dern, The Internet Guide for New Users 
16 (1994). One article described the Internet as a collection of 
thousands of local, regional, and global Internet Protocol networks. 
What it means in practical terms is that millions of computers in 
schools, universities, corporations, and other organizations are tied 
together via telephone lines. The Internet enables users to share 
files, search for information, send electronic mail, and log onto 
remote computers. But it isn't a program or even a particular 
computer resource. It remains only a means to link computer users 
together.  
 
Unlike on-line computer services such as CompuServe and 
America On Line, no one runs the Internet....  
 
No one pays for the Internet because the network itself doesn't 
exist as a separate entity. Instead various universities and 
organizations pay for the dedicated lines linking their computers. 
Individual users may pay an Internet provider for access to the 
Internet via its server.

3 Issues of Erlich's liability were addressed in this court's order of 
September 22, 1995. That order concludes in part that a 
preliminary injunction against Erlich is warranted because 
plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their copyright 
infringement claims against him. Plaintiffs likely own valid 
copyrights in Hubbard's published and unpublished works and 
Erlich's near-verbatim copying of substantial portions of plaintiffs' 
works was not likely a fair use. To the extent that Netcom and 
Klemesrud argue that plaintiffs' copyrights are invalid and that 
Netcom and Klemesrud are not liable because Erlich had a valid 
fair use defense, the court previously rejected these arguments and 
will not reconsider them here.  
 
4 The Usenet has been described as a worldwide community of 
electronic BBSs that is closely associated with the Internet and 
with the Internet community. Paragraph The messages in Usenet 
are organized into thousands of topical groups, or "Newsgroups" 
.... Paragraph As a Usenet user, you read and contribute ("post") to 
your local Usenet site. Each Usenet site distributes its users' 
postings to other Usenet sites based on various implicit and explicit 
configuration settings, and in turn receives postings from other 
sites. Usenet traffic typically consists of as much as 30 to 50 
Mbytes of messages per day. Paragraph Usenet is read and 
contributed to on a daily basis by a total population of millions of 
people.... Paragraph There is no specific network that is the Usenet. 
Usenet traffic flows over a wide range of networks, including the 
Internet and dial-up phone links.  
 
Dern, supra, at 196-97. 
 
5 The First Amended Complaint ("FAC") contains three claims: 
(1) copyright infringement of BPI'S published literary works 
against all defendants; (2) copyright infringement of RTC's 
unpublished confidential works against all defendants; and (3) 
misappropriation of RTC'S trade secrets against defendant Erlich 
only.  
 
6 Klemesrud alternatively filed a motion for summary judgment, 
which will not be considered at this struck those portions of the 
motion that referred to matters outside of the pleadings.  
 
7 In this context, "copying" is "shorthand for the infringement of 
any of the copyright owner's five exclusive rights." S.O.S., Inc. v. 
Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081, 1085 n.3 (9th Cir. 1989).   
 
8 The court has under submission plaintiffs' request to expand the 
preliminary injunction against Erlich.  
 
9 Plaintiffs have argued at times during this litigation that Netcom 
should only be required to respond after being given notice, which 
is only relevant to contributory infringement. Nevertheless, the 
court will address all three theories of infringement liability.  
 
10 The strict liability for copyright infringement is in contrast to 
another area of liability affecting online service providers: 
defamation. Recent decisions have held that where a BBS 
exercised little control over the content of the material on its 
service, it was more like a "distributor" than a "republisher" and 
was thus only liable for defamation on its system where it knew or 
should have known of the defamatory statements. Cubby,Inc. v. 
CompuServe. Inc., 776 F. Supp. 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). By s 
contrast, a New York state court judge found that Prodigy was a 
publisher because it held itself out to be controlling the content of 
its services and because it used software to automatically prescreen 
messages that were offensive or in bad taste. Stratton Oakmont, 
Inc, v. Prodigy Services Co., THE RECORDER, June 1, 1995, at 7 
(excerpting May 24, 1995 Order Granting Partial Summary 
Judgment to Plaintiffs).  
 
11 One commentator addressed the difficulty in translating 
copyright concepts, including the public/private dichotomy, to the 
digitized environment. See Niva Elkin-Koren, Copyright Law and 
Social Dialogue on the Information Superhighway: The Case 
Against Copyright Liability of Bulletin Board Operators, 13 
CARDOZO ARTS & ENT. L.J. 346, 390 (1993). This 
commentator noted that one way to characterize a BBS operation is 
that it "provides subscribers with access and services. AS such, 
BBS operators do not create copies, and do not transfer them in 
any way. Users post the copies on the BBS, which other users can 
then read or download." Id at 356.  
 
12 Netcom compares itself to a common carrier that merely acts as 
a passive conduit for information. In a sense, a Usenet server that 
forwards all messages acts like a common carrier, passively 
retransmitting every message that gets sent through it. Netcom 
would seem no more liable than the phone company for carrying 
an infringing facsimile transmission or storing an infringing audio 
recording on its voice mail. AS Netcom's counsel argued, holding 
such a server liable would be like holding the owner of the 
highway, or at least the operator of a toll booth, liable for the 
criminal activities that occur on its roads. Since other similar 
carriers of information are not liable for infringement, there is 
some basis for exempting Internet access providers from liability 
for infringement by their users. The IITF Report concluded that 
"[i]f an entity provided only the wires and conduits-such as the 
telephone company, it would have a good argument for an 
exemption if it was truly in the same position as a common carrier 
and could not control who or what was on its system." IITF Report 
at 122. Here, perhaps, the analogy is not completely appropriate as 
Netcom does more than just "provide the wire and conduits." 
Further, Internet providers are not natural monopolies that are 
bound to carry all the traffic that one wishes to pass through them, 
as with the usual common carrier. a - at 122 n.392 (citing Federal 
Communications Commission v. MidwestVideo Corp., 440 U.S. 
689, 701 (1979)). Section 111 of the Copyright Act codifies the 
exemption for passive carriers who are otherwise liable for a 
secondary transmission. 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, 
Nimmer on Copyright Section 12.04[B][3], at 12-99 (1995). 
However, the carrier must not have any direct or indirect control 
over the content or selection of the primary transmission. Id; 17 
U.S.C. Section 111(a)(3). Cf, infra, part I.B.3.a. In any event, 
common carriers are granted statutory exemptions for liability that 
might otherwise exist. Here, Netcom does not fall under this 
statutory exemption, and thus faces the usual strict liability scheme 
that exists for copyright. Whether a new exemption should be 
carved out for online service providers is to be resolved by 
Congress, not the courts. Compare Comment, "Online Service 
Providers and Copyright Law: The Need for Change," I 
SYRACUSE J. LEGIS. & POL'Y 197, 202 (1 995) (citing 
recommendations of online service providers for amending the 
Copyright Act to create Liability only where a "provider has 'actual 
knowledge that a work that is being or has been transmitted onto, 
or stored on, its system is infringing,' and has the 'ability and 
authority' to stop the transmission, and has, after a reasonable 
amount of time, allowed the infringing activity to continue'") with 
IITF Report at 122 (recommending that Congress not exempt 
service providers from strict liability for direct infringements).   
 
13 The court notes, however, that stopping the distribution of 
information once it is on the Internet is not easy The decentralized 
network was designed so that if one link in the chain be closed off, 
the information will be dynamically rerouted through another link. 
This was meant to allow the system to be used for communication 
after a catastrophic event that shuts down part of it. Francis Decl. 
Paragraph 4.  
 
14 The paragraph in Playboy containing the quotation begins with 
a description of the right of public distribution. Id Further, the 
above quoted language is followed by a citation to a discussion of 
the right of public distribution in Jay Dratler, Jr., 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW: COMMERCIAL, 
CREATIVE AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY Section 6.01[3], at 
6-15 (1991). This treatise states that "the distribution right may be 
decisive, if, for example, a distributor supplies products containing 
unauthorized copies of a copyrighted work but has not made the 
copies itself." Id. (citing to Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Arctic 
International, Inc., 685 F.2d 870, 876 (3d Cir. 1982)). In any event, 
the Williams holding regarding public distribution was dicta, as the 
court found that the defendant had also made copies. Id.  
 
15 Given the ambiguity in plaintiffs' reference to a violation of the 
right to 'publish" and to Playboy, it is possible that plaintiffs are 
also claiming that Netcom infringed their exclusive right to 
publicly distribute their works. The court will address this 
argument infra.  
 
16 The court further notes that Playboy has been much criticized. 
See, e.g., L. Rose, NETLAW 91-92 (1995). The finding of direct 
infringement was perhaps influenced by the fact that there was 
some evidence that defendants in fact knew of the infringing nature 
of the works, which were digitized photographs labeled "Playboy" 
and "Playmate."  
 
17 To the extent that Sega holds that BBS operators are directly 
liable for copyright infringement when users upload infringing 
works to their systems, this court respectfully disagrees with the 
court's holding for the reasons discussed above. Further, such a 
holding was dicta, as there was evidence that the supporting the 
contributory infringement theory. Id. at 683.  
 
18 References to "Tr." are to the reporter's transcript of the June 
23, 1995 hearing on these motions.  
 
19 Despite that uncertainty, the IITF Report recommends a strict 
liability paradigm for BBS operators See IITF Report at 122-24. It 
recommends that Congress not exempt on-line service providers 
from strict liability because this would prematurely deprive the 
system of an incentive to get providers to reduce the damage to 
copyright holders by reducing the chances that users will infringe 
by educating them, requiring indemnification, purchasing 
insurance, and, where efficient, developing technological solutions 
to screening out infringement. Denying strict liability in many 
cases would leave copyright owners without an adequate remedy 
since direct infringers may act anonymously or pseudonymously or 
may not have the resources to pay a judgment. Id.; see also Hardy, 
supra.  
 
20 Adopting such a rule would relieve a BBS of liability for failing 
to take steps to remove infringing works from its system even after 
being handed a court's order finding infringement. This would be 
undesirable and is inconsistent with Netcom's counsel's admission 
that Netcom would have an obligation to act in such circumstances. 
Tr. 35:25; see also Tr. 42:18-42:20.  
 
21 The court does not see the relevance of plaintiffs' argument that 
Netcom's failure to investigate their claims of infringement or take 
actions against Erlich was a departure from Netcom's normal 
procedure. A policy and practice of acting to stop postings where 
there is inadequate knowledge of infringement in no way creates a 
higher standard of care under the Copyright Act as to subsequent 
claims of user infringement.  
 
22 In this case, Netcom is even further removed from Erlich's 
activities. Erlich was in a contractual relationship only with 
Klemesrud. Netcom thus dealt directly only with Klemesrud. 
However, it is not crucial that Erlich does not obtain access 
directly through Netcom. The issue is Netcom's right and ability to 
control the use of its system, which it can do indirectly by 
controlling Klemesrud's use.  
 
23 However, plaintiffs submit no evidence indicating Netcom, or 
anyone, could design software that could determine whether a 
posting is infringing.  
 
24 For example, plaintiffs' demand that the court order Netcom to 
terminate Klemesrud's BBS's access to the Internet, thus depriving 
all 500 of his subscribers, would be overbroad, as it would 
unnecessarily keep hundreds of users, against whom there are no 
allegations of copyright infringement, from accessing a means of 
speech. The overbroadness is even more evident if, as plaintiffs 
contend, there is a way to restrict only Erlich's access to a.r.s.  
 
25 Netcom additionally argues that plaintiffs' theory of liability 
would have a chilling effect on users, who would be liable for 
merely browsing infringing works. Browsing technically causes an 
infringing copy of the digital information to be made in the screen 
memory. MAI holds that such a copy is fixed even when 
information is temporarily placed in RAM, such as the screen 
RAM. The temporary copying involved in browsing is only 
necessary because humans cannot otherwise perceive digital 
information. It is the functional equivalent of reading, which does 
not implicate the copyright laws and may be done by anyone in a 
library without the permission of the copyright owner. However, it 
can be argued that the effects of digital browsing are different 
because millions can browse a single copy of a work in r 
cyberspace, while only one can read a library's copy at a time.  
 
Absent a commercial or profit-depriving use, digital browsing is 
probably a fair use; there could hardly be a market for licensing the 
temporary copying of digital works onto computer screens to allow 
browsing. Unless such a use is commercial, such as where 
someone reads a copyrighted work online and therefore decides not 
to purchase a copy from the copyright owner, fair use is likely. 
Until reading a work online becomes as easy and convenient as 
reading a paperback, copyright owners do not have c much to fear 
from digital browsing and there will not likely be much market 
effect.  
 
Additionally, unless a user has reason to know, such as from the 
title of a message, that the message contains copyrighted materials, 
the browser will be protected by the innocent infringer doctrine, 
which allows the court to award no damages in appropriate 
circumstances. In any event, users should hardly worry about a 
finding of direct infringement; it seems highly unlikely from a 
practical matter that a copyright owner could prove such 
infringement or would want to sue such an individual.   
 
26 A recent report noted that a third aspect of the nature of the 
work may be relevant: whether it is in digital or analog form. IITF 
Report at 78. Although the copyright laws were developed before 
digital works existed, they have certainly evolved to include such 
works, and this court can see no reason why works should deserve 
less protection because they are in digital form, especially were, as 
here, they were not put in such form by plaintiffs.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

JOE SHEA, on behalf of
THE AMERICAN REPORTER,

Plaintiff,

v.

JANET M. RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE  UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA,

Defendant.

96 Civ. 0976 (DLC)

(Submitted: June 13, 1996
Decided: July 29, 1996)

Before: CABRANES, Circuiit Judge,*  SAND ** and COTE,.***.
District Judges. The plaintiff, an editor, publisher, and part-owner of
a newspaper distributed exclusively through electronic means, brings
this First Amendment challenge to Section 223(d) of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 ("CDA") criminalizing the use
of interactive computer services to display "patently offensive"
sexually explicit material such that it is available to persons under the
age of eighteen. The plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction barring
application of the section. The three-judge panel, appointed pursuant

court concluded that most content providers' ability to comply with

depends on the actions of third parties, such as software

unconstitutional as an overbroad prohibition on constitutionally
protected indecent speech between adults. RANDALL J. BOE,

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

JOSE A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge:

We address here the constitutionality of a provision of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 ("CDA") with an undeniably
worthy goal: to limit the exposure of children to sexually explicit,
though not legally obscene, materials available "on line"-that is,
capable of being displayed and "accesses" by increasingly common
interactive computer services. 47 U.S.C. Section 223(d), as added
by the CDA on February 8, 1996, criminalizes the use of an
interactive computer service to display, in a manner available to
persons under eighteen, sexually explicit material that is "patently
offensive" by contemporary community standards. Plaintiff Joe
Shea, the editor, publisher, and part-owner of a newspaper
distributed solely by electronic means, filed this action on February
8, 1996, claiming thee Section 223(d) is (1) void for vagueness, in
that it fails to give ordinary citizens sufficient notice of what conduct
will subject them to prosecution or criminal liability; and (2)
substantially overbroad, in that it targets a broader category of speech
than necessary to achieve the government's goal and constitutes a ban
on certain constitutionally protected speech between adults.

As editor of an on-line newspaper, the plaintiff is one of a growing
number of citizens who employ an array of widely accessible and
constantly evolving media technologies to gather and disseminate
information and ideas. In passing the CDA, Congress explicitly
recognized that these technologies foster "ewe diversity of political
discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad
avenues for intellectual activity." Pub. L. No. 104-104, Section
509(a)(3), 110 Stat. 56, 138 (1996) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
Section 230(a)(3)). The range of tools and forums available for users
of interactive computer services is astounding: with access to the web
of computer networks known as the Internet, a scholar can contact a
distant computer and make use of its capabilities; a researcher can
peruse the card catalogs of libraries across the globe; users around
the world can debate politics, sports, music, and literature. However
trivial some of their uses might seem, emerging media technologies
quite simply offer an unprecedented number of individual citizens an
opportunity to speak and to be heard-at very little cost-by audiences
around the world. In that sense, we are encountering a
communications medium unlike any we have ever known.

In an attempt to limit the availability of certain materials in interactive
computer services, Congress enacted a statute of unprecedented
sweep: the new Section 223(d) purports to regulate not only how
commercial purveyors of obscene or pornographic materials may
advertise and sell their products on line, but also how private
individuals who choose to exchange certain constitutionally protected
communications with one another can do so. The question presented
is whether our Constitution tolerates this level of governmental
intrusion into how adults speak to one another.

We conclude, first, that the plaintiff has not sustained his burden of
demonstrating a likelihood of success on his claim that Section
223(d) is unconstitutionally vague. The definition of material
regulated by this section is a familiar one, repeatedly upheld against
vagueness challenges in a line of jurisprudence concerning television
and radio broadcasting, cable programming, and commercial
telephone services. We do, however, conclude that the plaintiff has
demonstrated a likelihood of success on his overbreadth claim, that
Section 223(d) would serve as a ban on constitutionally protected
indecent communication between adults. The Government concedes
that strict scrutiny is appropriately applied to this claim and that
Section 223(d) would, on its own, act as an unconstitutional total ban
on indecent communication, protected and unprotected alike, but
argues that two affirmative defenses set out in Section 223(e)(5)
serve to shield adults engaging in constitutionally protected indecent
communication from criminal liability.

The evidentiary record in this case compels the conclusion that, given
the current state of technology, most adult content providers wishing
to engage in constitutionally protected indecent speech will be unable
to avail themselves of these affirmative defenses. Only a limited
subset of on-line content providers, commercial providers on the
World Wide Web, can avail themselves of the defense set out in
Section 223(e)(5)(B), leaving both noncommercial providers of Web
content and content providers using all other modes of online
communication unprotected. The evidence further demonstrates that
content providers' ability to comply with the terms of the second
defense-the so called good-faith defense depends on the actions of
third parties, such as software manufacturers, whose cooperation is
not required under the CDA or otherwise mandated. There is no
feasible means, with our current technology, for someone to provide
indecent content on line with

any certainty that even his best efforts at shielding the material from
minors will be "effective," as the language of the good-faith defense
requires.

Because neither of the affirmative defenses set out in Section
223(e)(5) can, with our current technology, effectively protect adult
content providers wishing to engage in constitutionally protected
indecent communication, we reach the inescapable conclusion that
Section 223(d) will serve to chill protected speech. We therefore find
that the plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the
merits of his claim that Section 223(d) is unconstitutionally
overbroad.

We are mindful of our obligation to construe a federal statute to avoid
constitutional problems if it is possible to do so, but we are equally
mindful of the limits of the judicial power under our Constitution and
we decline the Government's invitation to perform radical surgery on
a statute dealing with a difficult problem in a rapidly changing area of
technology; in sum, we respectfully decline the invitation to legislate
from the bench.

In setting aside the challenged provisions, we do not question the
legitimacy of the government's interest in safeguarding children from
exposure to certain materials available on line nor suggest that other
legislation on another day, carefully tailored to technological realities,
may not pass constitutional muster. We also do not consider, nor
attempt to delineate, the range of circumstances, if any, in which
Congress could now or in the future constitutionally impose content-
based restrictions upon communications in the developing medium
we explore here.

I. BACKGROUND

Plaintiff Joe Shea is the editor-in-chief, pare-owner, and publisher of
the American Reporter, a daily newspaper distributed solely by
electronic means. On February 8, 1996, following the signing of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat.
56, the American Reporter published an editorial, (Complaint, Ex. 1)
criticizing Title V of the Act, known as the Communications Decency
Act of 1996 ("CDA"). The editorial contained language arguably
falling within the scope of a provision of the CDA criminalizing the
transmission or display of certain content in a manner available to
minors:

Whoever-

(1)in interstate or foreign communications knowingly-

(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a specific person
or persons under 18 years of age, or

(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a manner
available to a person under 18 years of age, any comment, request,
suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in
context, depicts or describes, in Berms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or
excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such
service placed the call or initiated the communication; . . .

shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not
more than two years, or both. Pub. L. No. 104-104, Section
502(2)(d), 106 Steel at 133 (eo be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section
223(d)). Also on February 8, the plaintiff filed this action on behalf
of the American Reporter, seeking a declaration that 47 U.S.C.
Section 223(d) is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. On
February 17, the plaintiff moved for preliminary injunctive relief to
prevent the Department of Justice from enforcing the provision in
question.

Pursuant to Section 561(c) of the Telecommunications Act and 28
U.S.C. Section 2284, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit designated this three-judge district
court to consider the plaintiff's facial challenge to the constitutionality
of Section 223(d). The Court heard opening arguments on April 3,
1996. Because the plaintiff's facial challenge to Section 223(d) raised
the question of whether Internet users can, under current technology,
meet the requirements for certain defenses provided for in the Act,
the Court concluded that an evidentiary hearing would be
appropriate. In light of the pendency of consolidated proceedings for
preliminary injunctive relief before a three judge court in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania raising, among ocher claims, a facial
challenge to Section 223(d), see Complaint, American Civil Liberties
Union v. Reno, No. 96-963 (E.D. Pa. filed Feb. 8, 1996);
Complaint, American Library Ass'n v. US. Dep't of Justice, No. 96-
1458 (E.D. Pa. filed Feb. 27, 1996) (collectively "the Philadelphia
litigation"), the Court directed the parties to consider methods of
easing the fact-finding process by entering into a range of stipulations
regarding the current state of technology and incorporating relevant
portions of the record in the Philadelphia litigation. The Court
received additional demonstrative and testimonial evidence on April
29, April 30, and May 6, and heard closing arguments on June 3,
1996. Following supplemental briefing by the parties, the plaintiff's
motion for preliminary injunctive relief was submitted for decision on
June 13, 1996.

On June 11, 1996, the three-judge court in the Philadelphia litigation
concluded, inter alia, that the provision of the CDA here challenged
by the plaintiff does not withstand constitutional scrutiny. American
Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, No. Civ. A. 9

963, 1996 WL 311865, at *27 (E.D. Pa. June 11, 1996)
("ACLU/ALA"). All three judges agreed that the CDA is substantially
overbroad, in that it effectively forces many Internet users
(specifically, non-commercial, not-for-profit entities and "even many
commercial organizations") to forgo constitutionally protected speech
or risk criminal prosecution. Id. at .32-*33 (Slovieer, C.J.); id. ae
.37 (Budkwaleer, J.); id. ae *49 0)alzell, J.). Additionally, two of
the judges conduded ehat Section 223(d)'s definition of covered
speech is unconstitutionally vague. Id. at *36 (Sloviter, CJ.); id. at
*37 (Buckwalter, J.). The decision in the Philadelphia litigation does
not preclude this Court from deciding the issues presented, /FN1 to
which we now turn.

II. FINDINGS OF FACT

We enter the following findings of fact, many of which are
undisputed, the subject of stipulations by the parties, or submitted by
the defendant and adopted by us, pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Although we here consider a so-
called facial challenge to a statute, we deemed it appropriate and
necessary in the unusual circumstances presented here, and a
reasonable exercise of our discretion, tO establish a basic record of
the facts regarding the new and evolving communications media that
is the subject of this legislation.

Section 223(d) targets the use of an "interactive computer service" to
send or display patently offensive materials. Although Section 223
itself contains no definition of that Berm, the definition applicable to
the new 47 U.S.C. 6 230--also added by the CDA-make clear that
the term encompasses means of making "content"2 available to
multiple users both on the vast web of linked networks popularly
known as "the Internet" and on ocher information systems (such as
electronic bulletin boards maintained by educational institutions or
nonprofit organizations) not physically linked to the Internet. See
Pub. L. No. 104-104, Section 509(e)(2), 110 Stat. at 139 (to be
codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 230(e)(2)). We draw upon the
stipulations of the parties and the testimony adduced at the three-day
evidentiary hearing to describe: (1) the nature of the medium targeted
by Section 223(d), focusing in part on the degree of control that
those who transmit content have over who will receive it; (2) the
availability of certain categories of potentially objectionable material
on line; (3) the development of software and labeling standards
enabling parents to limit their children's exposure to objectionable
on-line content; and (4) the potential for tagging and verification
procedures that content providers can use in an effort to shield
minors from sexually explicit content that they provide.3 As we do
so, we unavoidably-and with apologies to all others with a similar
aversion to "cyberspeak"-adopt some of the terminology that has
developed in conjunction with this technology. We endeavor, to the
extent possible, to avoid the jargon of this field, and to define our
terms wherever possible, for the sake of the clarity of this record and
this opinion, as well as for the benefit of any reader required to
review our work.

A. The Development of the Internet

Although "the Internet" now formally describes a collection of more
than 50,000 networks linking some nine million hose computers in
ninety countries, it has existed for nearly three decades on a much
smaller scale. What we now refer to as the Internet grew out of an
experimental project of the Department of Defense's Advanced
Research Projects Administration ("ARPA") designed to provide
researchers with direct access to supercomputers at a few key
laboratories and to facilitate the reliable transmission of vital
communications. (Declaration of William J. Hoffman ("Hoffman
Decl."), Ex. 4, at 11-12) ARPA supplied funds to link computers
operated by the military, defense contractors, and universities
conducting defense-related research through dedicated phone lines,
creating a "network" known as ARPANet. (Parties' Stipulations in
Preparation for Preliminary Injunction Hearing ("Joint Stip.") Paras.
6-7; Hoffman Decl., Ex. 3, at 3; id. Ex. 4, at 11) Programs on the
linked computers implemented a technical scheme known as "packet-
switching," through which a message from one computer to another
would be subdivided into smaller, separately addressed pieces of
data, known as "packets," sent independently to the message's
destination and reassembled upon arrival. (Joint Stip. 19) Each
computer on the network was in turn linked to several other
computers, creating any number of routes that a communication from
one computer could follow to reach its destination. If part of the
network were damaged, a portion of the message could be re-routed
automatically over any other path to its ultimate destination, a
characteristic of the network intended initially to preserve its
operability in the event of enemy attack. (Id. 11 7-8; Hoffman Decl.,
Ex. 3, at 3; id, Ex. 4, at 12)

Having successfully implemented a system for the reliable transfer of
information over a computer network, ARPA began to support the
development of communications protocols for transferring data
between different types of computer networks. Universities, research
facilities, and commercial entities began to develop and link together
their own networks implementing these protocols; these networks
included a high-speed "backbone" network known as NSFNet,
sponsored by the National Science Foundation, smaller regional
networks, and, eventually, large commercial networks run by
organizations such as Sprint, IBM, and Performance Systems
International (commonly known as "PSI"). (Hoffman Decl., Ex. 3,
at 3; id Ex. 4, at 13-14) As faster networks developed, most network
traffic shifted away from ARPANet, which formally ceased
operations in 1990. (Id Ex. 3, at 3) What we know as "the Internet"
today is the series of linked, overlapping networks that gradually
supplanted ARPANet. Because the Internet links together
independent networks that mercy use the same data transfer
protocols, it cannot be said that any single entity or group of entities
controls, or can control, the content made publicly available on the
Internet or limits, or can limit, the ability of others to access public
content. Rather, the resources available to one with Internet access
are located on individual computers around the world. (Joint Stip.
Para.11)

It is estimated that as many as forty million individuals have access to
the information and cools of the Internet, and that figure is expected
to grow to 200 million by the year 1999. (Id 1 3) Access to the
Internet can take any one of several forms. First, many educational
institutions, businesses, libraries, and individual communities
maintain a computer network linked directly to the Internet and issue
account numbers and passwords enabling users to gain access to the
network directly or by modem.4 (Id 1112-14) Second, "Internet
service providers," generally commercial entities charging a monthly
fee, offer modem access to computers or networks linked directly to
the Internal (Id. 116) Third, national commercial "on-line services"-
such as America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, and Microsoft
Network-allow subscribers to gain access to the Internet while
providing extensive content within their own proprietary networks.
(Id Para. 17) Finally, organizations and businesses can offer access
to electronic bulletin-board systems-which, like national on-line
services, provide certain proprietary content; some bulletin-board
systems in turn offer users links to the Internet. (Id. 1 18)

B. Categories of Internet Use

For our purposes, there are two loose and overlapping categories of
Internet use. First, an individual who has secured access to the
Internet can correspond or exchange views with one or many other
Internet users. Second, a user can locate and retrieve information
available on ocher computers. We explore these categories in greater
detail below. As will become clear, distinctions in how Internet
content is transmitted affect the degree of control that providers of
content have over who will be able to gain access to their
communications;5 we will return to the legal significance of these
distinctions at a later juncture. For any communication to take place
over the Internet, two pieces of software,6 adhering to the same
communications protocol, are required. A user must have access to
certain kinds of "client" software, which enables his computer to
communicate with and make requests of remote computers where
information is stored; these remote computers muse be running
"server" software, which provides information in response to
requests by client software. (Declaration of Dr. Dan R. Olsen, Jr.
("Olsen Decl."), 11 1314)7

1. Communicating with Other Internet Users

Perhaps the most widely used Internet service is electronic mail, or
"e-mail." Using any one of dozens of available "mailers"-client
software capable of reading and writing e-mail-a user is able to
address and transmit a message to one or more specific individuals.
Joint Stip. 121) A user can also "subscribe" to an electronic mailing
list on a topic of interest; the user receives a copy of messages posted
by ocher subscribers and, in Burn, can pose messages for
forwarding to the full mailing rise. Once a mailing list is established,
it is typically maintained using a "mail exploder"-a program such ;
"listserv" running on the server on which the list resides-that
automatically (i.e., without human intervention) responds to a user's
request to be added eo or removed from the list of subscribers and
retransmits messages posted by a subscriber to others on the mailing
list. (Id. 122) Some mailing lists are "closed": a user's request to join
the list requires the approval of an individual who maintains the list.
(Id.) Mailing lists (both open and dosed) may also be "moderated":
all messages posted to the list are forwarded to a moderator, who
approves certain messages and retransmits them to subscribers. (Id)
An individual sending a message that will be retransmitted by a mail
exploder program has no way of knowing the e-mail addresses of
other subscribers. (Olsen Decl. 1 19; Testimony of Gordon C.
Galligher, Jr., Tr. at 181) Even if the user could obtain an e-mail
address for each subscriber to a particular list, those addresses alone
would provide no authoritative information about subscribers. There
is no directory that identifies persons using a certain e-mail address.
In addition, a user can avoid disclosing his true e-mail address by
developing an e-mail "alias" or by using an "anonymous remailer"-a
server that purges identifying information from a communication
before forwarding it to its destination. (Defendant's Response to
Plaintiff's Request for Admissions ("Defendant's Adm.") No. 22;
Galligher Test. at 173)

Internet users may also transmit or receive "articles. posted daily to
thousands of discussion groups, arranged by subject matter and
known as "newsgroups," available through an electronic bulletin-
board system known as "Usenet." When a user with access to a
Usenet server-that is, a computer participating in the Usenet system-
poses an article to a particular newsgroup, the server automatically
forwards the article to adjacent Usenet servers, which in turn forward
it to ocher servers, until the article is available on all Usenet sites that
furnish access to the newsgroup in question. (Joint Stip. Para. 23)
Once a message reaches a particular Usenet site, it is temporarily
stored there so that individual users-running client software, known
as a "newsreader," capable of sorting articles according to header
information identifying the newsgroup to which the article was
posted-can review and respond tO the message. (Id.; Hoffman Decl.,
Ex. 4, at 129) Some Usenet newsgroups are moderated; messages to
the newsgroup are forwarded to an individual who selects those
appropriate for distribution. (Joint Stip. Para. 23) Because Usenet
articles are distributed to (and made available on) multiple servers,
one who posts an article to a newsgroup has no way of knowing
who will choose to retrieve it, whether or not the newsgroup is
moderated. (Galligher Test., Tr. at 170, 174-75) There is no
newsgroup equivalent of a "closed" mailing list: access to a particular
newsgroup can only be limited by restricting the number of servers
participating in the newsgroup. (Testimony of Clay Shirky, Tr. at
251)

The Internet also offers opportunities for multiple users to interact in
real time. Using a program called "Talk," two users can exchange
messages while they are both on line; a message typed on one user's
computer will appear almost immediately on the other's screen. (Joint
Stip. Para. 25) Servers running so called "chat" software, such as
Internet Relay Chat ("IRC"), permit multiple users to converse by
selecting one of many discussion "channels" active at any time.
Commercial on-line services such as America Online, CompuServe,
Prodigy, and the Microsoft Network offer their own chat systems for
their members. (Id 126) Having joined a channel, the user can see
and read messages transmitted by ocher users, each identified by a
name the user selects upon joining the channel. (Id. 125) Individual
participates in IRC discussions know ocher participants only by the
names they choose upon entering the discussion; users can participate
anonymously by using a pseudonym.

2. Locating and Retrieving Information on the Internet

Individuals with Internet access can take advantage of a number of
tools for locating and retrieving information and resources stored on
remote computers. One who wishes to make certain articles, files, or
software available to other users will set up a server, adhering to
certain communications protocols, capable of retrieving and
presenting scored information in response to a request from client
software using the same communications protocol. (Olsen Decl.
1113, 16; Galligher Test., Tr. at 131)

a. File Transfer Protocol ("FTP")

One type of software implements a set of conventions for copying
files from a hose computer known as "file-transfer protocol"
("FTP"). With appropriate client software, a user with an account on
the host computer can contact the server, view a directory of available
files, and copy one or more of chose files to his own computer. In
addition to making files available to users with accounts, thousands
of content providers also make files available for "anonymous"
retrieval by users who do not possess an account on the host
computer.' (Hoffman Decl., Ex. 3, at 1-2, 5; id Ex. 4, at 187; Joint
Stip. at 29) A content provider who makes files available for retrieval
by anonymous PIP has no way of discerning who gains access to the
files.

b. "Gopher" Servers

A second type of server software capable of making available the
resources of a host computer is known as a "gopher" program. (Joint
Stip. 130, Hoffman Decl., Ex. 3, at 5) A gopher server presents
information in a set of menus, enabling a user who gains access to
the server to select a series of increasingly narrow menu items before
locating a desired file that can be displayed on or copied to the user's
computer.9 (Galligher Test., Tr. at 122; Hoffman Decl., Ex. 3, at 5)
A content provider who maintains a gopher server ordinarily has no
way of knowing who will gain access to the information made
available.

c. The World Wide Web

The third and perhaps best known method of locating and accessing
information on the Internet is by exploring the World Wide Web.
Documents available on the Web are not collected in any central
location; rather, they are scored on servers around the world running
Web server software.( Joint Stip. Paras. 31, 38, 40) To gain access
to the content available on the Web, a user must have a Web
"browser"-client software, such as Netscape Navigator, Mosaic, or
Internet Explorer, capable of displaying documents formatted in
"hypertext markup language" ("HTML"), the standard Web
formatting language. (Galligher Test., Tr. at 125; Joint Stip. 1131,
43) Each document has an address, known as a Uniform Resource
Locator ("URL"), identifying, among other things, the server on
which it resides; most documents also contain "links"-highlighted
text or images that, when selected by the user, permit him to view
another, related Web document. Joint Stip. 134) Because Web
servers are linked to the Internet through a common communications
protocol, known as hypertext transfer protocol ("HTTP"), a user can
move seamlessly between documents, regardless of their location;
when a user viewing a document located on one server selects a link
to a document located elsewhere, the browser will automatically
contact the second server and display the document. (Joint Stip.
Paras. 34, 37) Some types of Web client software also permit users
to gain access to resources available on FTP and gopher sites.

A number of "search engines"-such as Yahoo, Magellan, Alta Vista,
WebCrawler, and Lycos-are available to help users navigate the
World Wide Web./fn10 For example, the service Yahoo maintains a
directory of documents available on various Web servers. A user can
gain access to Yahoo's server and type a string of characters as a
search request. Yahoo returns a list of documents whose entries in
the Yahoo directory match the search string and organizes the list of
documents by category. (Galligher Test., Tr. at 134; Plaintiffs Ex. 3)
Search engines make use of software capable of automatically
contacting various Web sites and extracting relevant information.
Some search engines, such as Alta Vista, score the information in a
database and return it in response to a user request. Others, such as
Yahoo, employ a group of individuals to determine whether and how
a site should be categorized in the Yahoo directory. (Galligher
Testimony, Tr. at 137; Supplemental Declaration of William J.
Hoffman (aHoffman Supp. Decl.") Ex. A, at 39-42 (Testimony of
Donna L. Hoffman in ACLU/ALA))

As the growth in Internet use and the wide availability of tools and
resources to chose with access to the Internet suggest, the Internet
presents extremely low entry barriers to chose who wish to convey
Internet content or gain access to it. In particular, a user wishing to
communicate through e-mail, newsgroups, or Internet Relay Chat
need only have access to a computer with appropriate software and a
connection tO the Internet, usually available for a low monthly fee.
The user then in a sense becomes a public "speaker," able to convey
content, at relatively low cost, tO users around the world to whom it
may be of interest. Those who possess more sophisticated equipment
and greater technical expertise can make content available on the
Internet for retrieval by others known or unknown) by running a
server supporting anonymous FTP, a gopher server, or a Web
server. Yet content providers need not necessarily run their own
servers or have the programming expertise to construct their own
sites; they can lease space on a Web server from another or create a
"home page" through an on-line commercial service.

The ease of entry of many speakers sets interactive computer systems
apart from any ocher more traditional communications medium that
Congress has attempted to regulate in the past. With one-way media
such as radio ant television broadcasting or cable programming, a
user is merely a listener or viewer; in the CDA, Congress sought to
target "interactive" computer systems through which a listener or
viewer, by definition, has the power to become a speaker. The
relative ease of speaker entry and the relative parity.

among speakers accounts for the unprecedented and virtually
unlimited opportunities for political discourse, cultural development,
and intellectual activity that Congress found to characterize emerging
communication technologies.

In seeking to describe the range of tools and opportunities for
Internet users to "speak," we recognize that the categories we
delineate are far from clean and the technology is far from static.
Indeed, by all indications, the way that we conceptualize various
media that we have traditionally viewed as distinct-such as cable
television, telephones, and computer networks-will change
dramatically as these media "converge" into common forms of
communication. See Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications

cable television connections) (Hoffman Supp. Decl., Ex. C, at 3-4.).
Of course, our findings of fact are necessarily time-bound. We can
only determine whether the statutory provision at issue here, in light
of the technology available during the pendency of this case,
comports with the First Amendment.

Sexually Explicit Content on the Internet

It is undisputed that there exists some content on the Internet that is-
to use the Government's phrase-"sexually explicit." "Defendant's
Memorandum of Law, filed March 19, 1996, at 11) The term
"sexually explicit" is descriptive rather than legal and does not appear
in the statutory provision at issue, but the Government employs it as
a shorthand to describe Internet content depicting "sexual or
excretory activities or organs"-possibly though not necessarily in a
patently offensive way. Defendant's Supplemental Memorandum of
Law ("Defendant's Supp. Memo."), filed June 7, 1996, at 9) That is,
the Government does not contend that all sexually explicit material is
"patently offensive" and therefore within the scope of the CDA, but
claims that there is certainly content available on the Internet that is
both sexually explicit and patently offensive.

The testimony and demonstration of one of the Government's expert
witnesses, Howard Schmidt, Director of the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations, amply confirmed the availability of sexually
explicit material on line. Nevertheless, there is no persuasive
evidence in the record to suggest, much less prove, that sexually
explicit material easily "assaults" an unknowing user-as in other
media, most notably television and radio-or that any substantial
proportion of Internet content is sexually explicit.

1. Ease of Access to Sexually Explicit Content

The Government urges us to conclude that an Internet user can easily
stumble upon sexually explicit material. (Defendant's Post-Hearing
Memorandum of Law ("Defendant's Post-Hearing Memo"), filed
May 28, 1996, at 31-32) It is important to begin with the general
observation that, with the exception of e-mail, no content appears on
a user's screen without the user having first taken some affirmative
step. One wishing to read articles posted to a newsgroup must
connect to a Usenet server and select the relevant group. To retrieve a
file through anonymous FTP or access a gopher server, the user
must search for or know the address of a particular server. To gain
access to content on the World Wide Web, a user must know the
URL of a relevant site or type a keyword into one of several available
search engines.

Schmidt's demonstration focused mainly on the availability of
sexually explicit content on the World Wide Web. In the absence of
any screening software or filter, a user determined to view a site
containing sexually explicit material can certainly do so, either by
typing a known URL or by searching for key words. One sexually
explicit site may, in turn, contain "links" to other such sites.
(Defendant's Exs. 13, 16, 17, 26, 29, 32; Schmidt Test., Tr. at 401-
02) While ordinarily a user must affirmatively seek sexually explicit
material to view it, on occasion a search not intended to retrieve
sexually explicit material may retrieve a link to a sexually explicit site.
For example, Schmidt's searches of "Sleeping Beauty," "Babe," and
"Little Women. produced a handful of links to sexually explicit sites.
(Defendant's Exs. 15, 18, 27, 31, 38) This demonstration revealed
the inevitable imprecision of search engines-a broad search will
almost always return some irrelevant results. In the vase majority of
cases, the character of a sexually explicit site will be clear from the
entry or link that a search engine returns. Nevertheless, there is
potential for occasional accidental viewing of sexually explicit
material. For example, if a user were to view entries in a
WebCrawler search using that program's standard format as preset
by the

manufacturer, he would see no summary of the sites' contents.
(Defendant's Ex. 18; Shirky Test., Tr. at 237-38) One of Schmidt's
searches of "Sleeping Beauty" returned an entry offering a link to a
site containing sexually explicit material; the entry (when viewed
apart from other entries on the same page with similar addresses)
gave little indication of the site's contents. (Defendant's Ex. 15;
Shirky Test., Tr. at 238) It is difficult to know how often accidental
viewing can occur, but there is no basis in the record for concluding
that a user not seeking out sexually explicit material on the Internet
will encounter it with any particular frequency.

2. The Availability of Sexually Explicit Content

Although Schmidt's demonstration focused on the World Wide Web,
sexually explicit content is available on the Internet through almost
any form of Internet communication. Yet there is no evidence that
sexually explicit content constitutes a substantial-or even significant-
portion of available Internet content. While it is difficult to ascertain
with any certainty how many sexually explicit sites are accessible
through the Internet, the president of a manufacturer of software
designed to block access to sites containing sexually explicit material
testified in the Philadelphia litigation that there are approximately
5,000 to 8,000 such sites, with the higher estimate reflecting the
inclusion of multiple pages (each with a unique URL) attached to a
single site. (Stipulated Portions of Record in ACLU/ALA
("Stipulated Record"), Ex. M, at 139-40 Testimony of Ann W.
Duvall in ACLU/ALA)) The record also suggests that there are at
least thirty-seven million unique URLs. (Galligher Test. at 144)
Accordingly, even if there were twice as many unique pages on the
Internet containing sexually explicit materials as this undisputed
testimony suggests, the percentage of Internet addresses providing
sexually explicit content would be well less than one tenth of one
percent of such addresses.

It is not disputed that some of the sexually explicit materials that the
CDA attempts to keep away from minors originates abroad. This is
not surprising inasmuch as forty percent of all host computers are
located outside the United States. Joint Stip. Para. 3) Although only
a tentative approximation is possible, the record suggests that as
much as thirty percent of the sexually explicit material currently
available on the Internet originates in foreign countries. (Stipulated
Record, Ex. L, 141; id Ex. M, at 161-62 (Duvall Test.))

D. The Development of Blocking Tools and Labeling Schemes

As the Internet has become accessible to more households, several
commercial on-line services and software companies have developed
features and packages designed to enable parents to limit children's
exposure to potentially inappropriate Internet material. For example,
America Online, Prodigy, and Microsoft Network, which permit
their subscribers to obtain access to Internet material, offer parental
control options free of charge to their members. (Joint Stip. 167)
America Online, for example, allows parents eo establish a separate
account for their children limited to the service's own proprietary
content. (Id.) In addition, at lease one type of screening software,
SurfWatch, has a feature allowing parents to block access to all
Internet sites except for chose that parents choose tO make available
to their children (Stipulated Record, Ex. M, at 131 (Duvall Test.))

The Government offered testimony and a demonstration regarding
SurfWatch (configured to act as a screening tool, rather than to block
all Internet access) and a second type of screening software, Cyber
Patrol. SurfWatch and Cyber Patrol maintain lists of sites known to
contain sexually explicit material; when operating while a user
attempts to retrieve Internet material, access tO sites identified on
their programs will be blocked. In addition, the programs block
access to sites whose URLs contain particular character patterns or
words, such as "xxx" or "sex," and block any searches including
those character patterns or words.

Because of the constant change in the number and location of Internet
sites, both SurfWatch and Cyber Patrol offer regular subscription or
update services. But even where a parent has properly installed
screening software and the software is operational (and configured to
block access to certain sites rather than to the entire Internet), it is
possible to retrieve some sexually explicit material. The
Government's witness was able to run searches using "Babe" and
"Little Women" as key words with screening software running in the
background. As with searches performed in the absence of screening
software, the searches returned links to sexually explicit materials.
Some of the links were not blocked by the screening cool. In
addition, the Government's witness obtained access to sexually
explicit material by directly entering URLs obtained from earlier
searches conducted without blocking software in the background.
The record also shows that blocking software is not widely owned
by or used in households with access to the Internet: nearly seventy
percent of SurfWatch's 1,500 subscribers are schools rather than
individual households. (Id. at 163-65)

Other efforts to assist parents in filtering and screening material that
their children can view on the Internet are under way. The World
Wide Web Consortium ("W3C") has launched the Platform for
Internet Content Selection ("PICS") to develop technical standards
for attaching electronic ratings to Internet addresses. (Joint Stip.
1147-49; Stipulated Record, Ex. J., at 1; id Ex. G, at 2-3
"Declaration of Albert Vezza in ACLU/ALA)) When the system is
fully implemented, PICS-compatible client software (including
browsers, newsgroup readers, and mail readers); Internet service
providers; and commercial on-line services will be able to detect
PICS tags and block content based on how a parent has configured
the software. (Joint Stip. 148; Stipulated Record, Ex. G., at 3 (Vezza
Ded.)) PICS will thus enable parenes to design from an array of
categories blocking criteria that suit the parents' values or needs. The
PICS program envisages both rating by content providers and rating
by third parties. Joint Stip. 148) The vast majority of Internet sites
currently remain unrated. Nevertheless, Microsystems Software, Inc.
(which manufactures Cyber Patrol) introduced a PICS ratings server
in February 1996. (Id 154) Cyber Patrol is itself now PICS-
compatible; it can screen out material based on its PICS tag. (Id.) In
addition, Microsoft released the first PICS-compatible Web browser,
Internet Explorer 3.0, on May 28, 1996. The browser allows parents
to block children's access to all unrated Internet sites and to specify
appropriate levels of violence or nudity at rated sites. (Hoffman
Supp. Decl., Ex. C, at 1-3)

In addition to PICS tags, the Government's expert witness, Dr. Dan
Olsen, testified thee content providers wishing to transmit or make
available material potentially falling within the scope of the CDA
could develop a general practice of inserting a "Tag" or "label"-a
string of characters, such as "-L18" (for "not less than 18 years")-
into the address or name of a particular site so as to clearly identify
the site as unsuitable for minors. To transmit or gain access to
Internet content, a user must specify a textual name: one cannot send
e-mail without an e-mail address or the name of a mailing list; post an
article to a newsgroup without specifying the name of the group;
participate in the Internet Relay Chat without specifying a "channel";
or access a file without its address. (Olsen Decl. Paras. 22-26)
Accordingly, content providers using all significant modes of Internet
communication could use a tag to identify their content as "covered"
content. For example, when a sender transmits an e-mail message,
the message is accompanied by the sender's address, which contains
a "user name" identifying a particular user and a "domain name"
assigned to a computer or set of computers." (Olsen Decl. Paras. 25,
60) If the string -L18 were added to the domain name, all e-mail
originating from that site-regardless of the particular user who
transmitted it-would be identified as containing material falling within
the scope of the CDA.'2 In the alternative, a particular user name-
rather than a domain name-could contain the "-L18" tag; only e-mail
originating under that user name would be tagged.'3 Finally, a tag
could be placed in a textual subject line, so as to identify only
particular messages (rather than all e-mail sent under a certain user
name or from a certain computer) as containing content potentially
within the scope of the CDA. (Id Paras. 60-62)

Similarly, a tag such as "-L18" could be added to the name of a
newsgroup; an individual user wishing to post an article potentially
falling within the scope of the CDA to a newsgroup that does not as a
general matter contain such material could insert a tag in the subject
line accompanying the article. (Id Paras. 64-65) A tag could also be
placed in the name of an IRC channel.

Turning to means of making files available for retrieval or viewing by
remote users-using an FTP, gopher, or Web server-content providers
could insert a specific tag such as "-L18" in a domain name or site
name. Thus, as the Government's expert witness testified, an owner
of a Web site named "www.cyberporn.com" could rename the site
"www-L18.cyberporn.com". (Id 151) If a site only contained
specific files falling within the scope of the CDA, a content provider
could identify those files by adding a tag to the name of the directory
in which the file resides or to the file name itself. That is, a file
identified with the address "http://www.adult.com/picture1.html/"
could be renamed "http://www.adult.com/picture1-L18.html/"; in the
alternative, a content provider could place all covered files within a
specific directory, such as "http://www.adult.com/pictures-L18/."
(Id.Paragraphs 51-54) A content provider who did not wish to tag an
entire file available on a Web server as unsuitable for minors could
place a tag within the HTML source code of the file, thus identifying
a particular section as subject to the CDA. (Id Paragraph 58) In any
of these approaches, tagging content is, in a technical sense, a trivial
act. (Id Paragraphs 59, 62; Stipulated Record, Ex. B, at 56
(Testimony of Scott O. Bradner in ACLU/ALA))

There is an alternative means to shield minors from sexually explicit
content available uniquely to content providers on the World Wide
Web: verification of a user's "adulthood" before allowing him access
to a site. A content provider operating a Web server can create and
display an electronic form to retrieve information from a user visiting
the Web site; after processing the information by using a program
such as a Common Gateway Interface ("cgi") script, the server could
grant or deny access to the site. (Shirley Decl. 121) Not all content
providers who make material available on the Web, however, can use
programs such as cgi scripts; for example, commercial on-line
services such as America Online and CompuServe provide
subscribers with the opportunity to post content by configuring their
own Web pages but do not permit subscribers to use cgi scripts.
(Olsen Test., Tr. at 345) For Web content providers who lack access
to cgi scripts, there is no means of age verification.

Although some Web providers can query the user of a site for a credit
card number, the cost of verification is significant, ranging from
sixty cents per transaction tO more than a dollar per transaction. (Id.
at 341-42) To take advantage of adult access code or adult
identification code verification, a content provider would either have
to establish and maintain a registration and verification system (or
hire someone else tO do so) and issue access codes tO users-after
verifying their ages-or associate with one of several adult verification
services, such as Adult Check, Adult Verification System, First
Virtual, Validate, or VeriSign. (Olsen Decl. 186 8: Ex. I; Schmidt
Test., Tr. at 203-14; Defendant's Exs. 6, 7, 8 86 9) Although neither
of the Government's expert witnesses had any firsthand familiarity
with adult verification services, advertising materials suggest that an
adult can obtain an identification number from a particular service and
access any site registered with the service. For example, a user can
register with Adult Check for an annual fee of $9.95; when the user
attempts to access any site registered with Adult Check, the user is
prompted to enter an Adult Check identification number that is
checked against the service's database. (Defendant's Ex. 6, at 1) If
the number is valid, the user is automatically admitted to the site.
(Id.) Although most verification services do not charge content
providers to register their sites (Id Exs. 6-8), at least one service does
impose a fee on site owners registered with it. (Id Ex. 9, at 1)

Having explored various means of Internet communication, the
availability and accessibility of sexually explicit content, the
development of blocking software and rating schemes designed to
enable parents tO shield their children from inappropriate material,
and the potential for tagging and verification procedures that content
providers can themselves employ in an effort to shield minors from
sexually explicit content that they provide, we turn to the
governmental regulation in question.

III. DISCUSSION

47 U.S.C. Section 223(d), as added by the CDA, targets persons
who send or display material that, "in context, depicts or describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs." The language of
Section 223(d) parallels the definition of "indecency" adopted by the
FCC in 1975 in the broadcast context, /FN14 see FCC v. Pacifica
Found., 56 F.C.C.2d 94, 98 (1975); an application of this definition
to a radio broadcast of the deliberately provocative George Carlin
"Filthy Words" monologue was upheld by the Supreme Court in
FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 751 (1978). Following
Pacifica, the FCC applied the indecency standard only narrowly-
taking no enforcement action unless material "involved the repeated
use, for shock value, of words similar or identical to those satirized
in the Carlin . . . monologue"-with the result that no broadcasts were
found actionable between 1975 and 1987. Action for Children's
Television u FCC (A CT-J, 852 F.2d 1332, 1338, 1336 (D.C. Cir.
1988) (quotation marks omitted). In 1987, however, the FCC, in
three rulings in the broadcast context, interpreted its indecency
standard more broadly, extending it beyond the particular language at
issue in Pacifica. See Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 2 F.C.C.R. 2705
(1987; Regents of the Universiry of California, 2 F.C.C.R. 2703
(1987); Pacifica Found., Inc., 2 F.C.C.R. 2698 (1987)./FN15 The
same standard was imported, by statute and by regulation, into other
contexts, and applies to commercial telephone messages, see Dial
Info. Servs. Cop. v. Thornburghf, 938 F.2d 1535, 1540-41 (2d
Cir.1991) (quoting Regulations Concerning Intecent
Communications by Telephone, 5 F.C.C.R. 4926, 4927 (1990)),
cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992), and cable programming, see 47
U.S.C. 532O; 47 C.F.R. Sections 76.701(g), 76.702 (1995);
Alliance for Communiry Media u FCC (-Alliance.), 56 F.3d 105,
129 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (in banc), aff'd in part and rrv'd in part sub
nom. Denver Area Consortium, 1996 WL 354027 (U.S. June 28,
1996).

The plaintiff claims principally that Section 223(d), as added by the
CDA, is unconstitutional on itS face because it is vague and
substantially overbroad. Where a plaintiff seeks to "stay government
action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory
scheme,. he must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits
of his claims and that he will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of
an injunction. Able u United States, 44 F.3t 128, 131 (2d Cir. 1995)
(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is well settled that
"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods
of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Elrod v.
Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion). Accordingly, a
finding of irreparable harm flows from a court's conclusion that a
governmental regulation has a chilling effect on free expression. We
examine the plaintiff's vagueness and overbreadth challenges in turn.

A. Vagueness

We consider first the plaintiff's claim that Section 223(t) is
unconstitutionally vague-that it fails to convey to persons of ordinary
intelligence reasonable notice of what conduct is prohibited and
creates a danger of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972). Where
a federal statute or regulation fails to supply a fair warning of what
will give rise to criminal liability, it violates the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment; where a statute or regulation purports to
limit freedom of expression, its vagueness will also "operate[] to
inhibit the exercise" of that freedom and violate the First Amendment.
Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

As previously noted, Section 223(d) essentially codifies the FCC
definition of indecency sustained in a particular factual context by the
Supreme Court in Pacifica. Although the Pacifica Court never
specifically addresses whether the FCC's definition was
unconstitutionally vague, the Court's conclusion that the broadcast at
issue in Pacifica was "indecent" and the fact that the Court quoted
elements of the FCC's indecency definition with approval, see 438
U.S. at 739, has been read to foreclose a vagueness challenge to the
FCC's definition for indecency in the broadcast medium. See ACT I,
852 F.2d at 1339-40 ("[I]f acceptance of the FCC's generic
definition of 'indecent' as capable of surviving a vagueness challenge
is not implicit in Pacifica, we have misunderstood Higher Authority
and welcome correction."); see also Action for Children's Television
v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C. Cir. 1991) ("ACT II"), cert
denied sub nom. Children's Legal Found. v. Action for Children's
Television, 503 U.S. 913 (1992); Action for Children's Television
v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654, 659 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (in banc) ("ACT III"),
cert. denied sub nom. Pacifica Found v. FCC, 116 S.Ct. 701
(1996). Relying on the reasoning of Pacifica and ACT I, the courts
of appeals have found vagueness challenges to analogous FCC
definitions reaching commercial telephone communications and cable
programming unavailing. See Dial Info. Servs., 938 F.2d at 1540-41
(indecent commercial telephone messages); Information Providers'
Coalition for the Defense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d
866, 874-76 (9th Cir. 1991) (same); Alliance, 56 F.3d at 129 (cable
programming). Most recently, the Alliance court's approach on this
question was affirmed by a plurality of the Supreme Court. Denver
Area Consortium, 1996 WL 354027, at *16-*17.

In light of Supreme Court and other precedent rejecting claims that
the language used by the FCC to define indecency is
unconstitutionally vague, we cannot conclude that the plaintiff has
demonstrated a likelihood of success on his claim that the
incorporation of a virtually identical verbal formula into Section
223(d) renders that statute fatally vague. The plaintiff appears to
concede that a challenge based solely on the "patently offensive"
language is foreclosed, but calls our attention to other purported
defects in the statutory language. First, the plaintiff contends that
assessment of a work's "context" in determining whether it is
"patently offensive" is highly unpredictable and subjective.
"Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law, filed Feb. 17, 1996, at 23)
Second, Section 223(d) requires content providers to judge what
content will and will not subject them to criminal liability by reference
to the "standards" of an unidentified or fictitious "community."
(Plaintiff's PostHearing Memorandum of Law ("Plaintiff's Post-
Hearing Memo"), filed May 21, 1996, at 37)

We conclude that neither argument supports a conclusion that Section
223(d) is unconstitutionally vague. In addition, we address briefly
the basis for our disagreement with the contrary conclusion reached
by two of the judges in the Philadelphia litigation.

We first address the inclusion in Section 223(d) of the phrase "in
context." While the FCC definition that has been applied to television
broadcasting since 1987-the subject of unsuccessful vagueness
challenges-has included this phrase, see Infinity Broadcasting Grp.,
2 F.C.C.R. at 2705, definitions employed by the FCC with respect
to other media have not explicitly included this phrase. See Dial Info.
Servs., 938 F.2d at 1540 (indecent commercial telephone messages);
Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 869 (same); Alliance,
56 F.3d at 105 (cable programming). Nevertheless, an assessment of
a work's context has always been a component of indecency analysis
regardless of the medium; the incorporation of the phrase "in context"
mercy follows the approach of Pacifica and later cases. See Pacifica,
438 U.S. at 744 (plurality opinion); id. at 750 (majority opinion);
Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876; cf. ACT I, 852
F.2d at 1340 (discussing relevance of social value of material as
factor in determining whether material is patently offensive); S.
CONG. REP. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 189 ("The gravamen of
the indecency concept is 'patent offensiveness.' Such a determination
cannot be made without a consideration of the context of the
description or depiction at issue."). We cannot see how importing
certain language that has been used by various courts considering
challenges to the definition of indecency renders the CDA
unconstitutionally vague.

The plaintiff's second point concerns the ability (or inability) of an
Internet content provider to assess what "community standards"
govern the transmission or display of patently offensive materials. A
communication posted by an individual in New York City to a
Usenet server and thereby made available to countless subscribers
around the world might indisputably fall outside the scope of what is
"indecent" by the standards of New York City, but might subject the
individual to criminal prosecution in other federal districts.
Nevertheless, in light of the fact that modern communications have
long transcended community borders, this problem is not a novel
one. Indeed, the definition of obscenity requires a publisher or
distributor of arguably obscene material to look to contemporary
community standards in various localities into which materials are
distributed. See, e.g., Sable Communications, 492 U.S. at 125-26
(concluding that failure to apply uniform national standard of
obscenity does not render statute unconstitutional; "If [the provider's]
audience is comprised of different communities with different local
standards, [the provider] ultimately bears the burden of complying
with the prohibition on obscene messages."); see also Miller, 413
U.S. at 24 (holding that factfinder's inquiry in obscenity context
focuses in part on whether "the average person, applying
contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken
as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).

The plaintiff attempts to distinguish past cases rejecting vagueness
challenges to indecency definitions incorporating "community
standards" language on two grounds. First, the plaintiff contends that
Internet content providers are less well equipped to assess
community indecency standards than those within the reach of
previous statutes and regulations governing indecency; while entities
engaging in the commercial traffic of pornographic materials (such as
obscene or indecent telephone messages) may have legal staff to
monitor FCC pronouncements on what is ant is not patently
offensive in communities across America, we are told, individuals
engaged in an exchange of ideas over the Internet do not. (Oral
Argument, June 3, 1996, Tr. at 24-25) Second, the plaintiff claims
that even if those who use other communications media can tailor
their messages to a particular community-as suggested by the
Supreme Court in Sable Communications-Internet content providers
simply cannot restrict the geographic area within which their
messages are received. (Plaintiff's Post-Hearing Memo. at 39)

We are not persuaded. The plaintiff has offered no authority for the
proposition that, so long as the providers of content targeted by a
statute are private individuals, Congress cannot constitutionally link
proscribed conduct to the community standards of various localities.
While it is true that congressional action has directly targeted
commercial dial-a-porn services, and restrictions on indecency in
radio and television broadcasting or cable programming mainly affect
for-profit enterprises, liability for violation of indecency restrictions
has not been tied to the ability of a content provider to marshal its
resources to explore various community indecency standards.
Distributors of allegedly obscene materials may also be subjected to
varying community standards; we know of no exemption for
individuals whose primary motive is non-economic. Due process
requires that a criminal statute "give the person of ordinary
intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so
that he may act accordingly," Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108; it does not
require "mathematical certainty," id at 110, or "'impossible
standards' of clarity," Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 361
(1983) (quoting United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).
We have no basis for concluding that Internet content providers are
any less capable than those subject to obscenity laws or other
indecency restrictions to acquire a general familiarity with the relevant
standards; indeed, one might conclude that a content provider's
contact with others around the country and around the world through
interactive computer services would cultivate a heightened awareness
of regional and cultural differences.

We turn to the plaintiff's claim that, even assuming a content
provider can discern the appropriate community standards, the
provider has no choice but to gear his message toward the least
tolerant community. More specifically, unlike a provider of obscene
or indecent telephone communications or cable programming, who
might be able to prevent a message from being transmitted to certain
geographical areas, an Internet content provider has no way of
identifying the receiving community. It follows that, to comply with
the CDA, a content provider must take steps to limit minors' access
to all material that would be considered patently offensive in any
community; only then could the content provider be sure that material
considered inappropriate under the standards of a particular
community is not available to minors in that community.

The problem that the plaintiff presents appears to raise questions of
overbreadth rather than vagueness. In light of our other conclusions
infra and in the absence of even a preliminary showing in this record
by either party regarding distinctions in community standards, we
decline to address whether any overbreadth in this respect is
"substantial."

As noted, two of the judges in the Philadelphia litigation concluded
that the provision of the CDA challenged by the plaintiff is
unconstitutionally vague. That conclusion rests in part on the fact that
the indecency definitions upheld in past cases defined indecency by
reference to community standards for a particular medium. For
example, the FCC definition of indecency upheld in Dial Info.
Servs., 938 F.2d at 1540, contained a reference to what is patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards "for
the telephone medium." See ACLU/ALA, 1996 WL 311865, at *42
(Buckwalter, J.). We can find no authority discussing the
significance of the definition's reference to the telephone medium or
of analogous references to the broadcast or cable media.16
Particularly in light of the fact that no court addressing an indecency
challenge has focuses on any of these references, it is unclear how
Pacifica and its progeny can be thought to require its existence, or
how the absence of a reference to the particular communications
medium targeted by the CDA renders the statute unconstitutionally
vague.

Finally, we address the slightly different argument raises by the same
two judges in the Philadelphia litigation-that the CDA is vague not
only because it fails to provide the requisite guidance to those seeking
to avoid criminal liability, but also because it leaves open the
possibility of arbitrary enforcement. This conclusion stems in part
from the Government's apparent representation in that case that the
challenged provisions of the CDA will be applied only to
"pornographic" material. We note that the Government has made no
such representation here, and dearly contemplates the application of
the CDA to material that is patently offensive although not necessarily
pornographic. While we are properly required to approach the
question of whether a criminal statute is vague with great skepticism
that prosecutorial good faith can cure an identified defect, see Baggett
v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 373-74 (1964) ("Well-intentioned
prosecutors and judicial safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a
vague law."), we are constrained to conclude that this statute is not
vague, and does not leave in the hands of prosecutors the sole
discretion to delineate its contours. Congress did not fashion the
"patently offensive" provision of Section 223(d) out of whole cloth.
To the extent that the FCC and courts have, in construing similarly
worded indecency provisions against the backdrop of the First
Amendment, previously drawn distinctions between serious
discussions of sexual issues and material in which sexuality is
portrayed in a purposefully offensive manner, Congress's choice of
language in Section 223(d) cabins prosecutorial discretion by
incorporating FCC and court rulings reflecting those distinctions.
Compare Letter to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 F.C.C.R. 610 (1991)
(dismissing indecency complaint regarding radio news story
including broadcast of wiretap in which John Gotti repeatedly used
an expletive; concluding that "the program segment, when considered
in context, was an integral part of a bona fide news story concerning
organized crime"); In re King Broadcasting Co., 5 F.C.C.R. 2971
(1990) (dismissing indecency complaint regarding broadcast of
program "Teen Sex, What About the Kids?"; concluding that
"[a]lthough the program dealt with sexual issues, the material
presented was clinical or instructional in nature and not presented in a
pandering, titillating or vulgar manner or in any way that we would
consider patently offensive.), with In re Sagittarius Broadcasting
Corp., 7 F.C.C.R. at 6874 (upholding finding of indecency with
respect to broadcast making "frequent, explicit, patently offensive
references to sexual intercourse, orgasm, masturbation, and other
sexual conduct, as well as to breasts, nudity, and male and female
genitalia"). Enforcement of Section 223(d) does not depend upon
prosecutorial whim, but upon prosecutorial fidelity to distinctions
that Congress sought, through codification of a definition of
indecency that has been authoritatively construed for a variety of
media in recent years, to incorporate into the CDA. See S. CONF.
REP. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 189 (1996).

In sum, we conclude that Section 223(d) is not unconstitutionally
vague.


B. Substantial Overbreadth

The plaintiff also claims that Section 223(d) is substantially
overbroad and therefore facially invalid. The doctrine of overbreadth
recognizes that an unconstitutional restriction of freedom of
expression may deter parties not before the court from engaging in
protected speech and thereby escape judicial review. See Broadrick
v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612-13 (1973); Gooding v. Wilson,
405 U.S. 518, 520-21 (1972). Accordingly, an overbreadth
challenge can be raised "with no requirement that the person making
the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by
a statute drawn with the requisite specificity." Dombrowski v.
Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486 (1965). That is, even if a statute could be
validly applied to the plaintiff and others, it may be so broad as to
inhibit the constitutionally protected speech of third parties not before
the Court. Invalidation of a statute on overbreadth grounds is "strong
medicine," and is inappropriate unless the overbreadth is substantial
and no limiting construction could be placed upon the challenged
statute. Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 613, 615; see also Forsyth County v.
Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 130 (1992) (noting that Court
has permitted overbreadth challenges "where [a statute] sweeps too
broadly, penalizing a substantial amount of speech that is
constitutionally protected"); New York State Club Ass'n v. City of
New York, 487 U.S. 1, 11, 14 (1988) (noting that an overbreadth
challenge is justified only if "a substantial number of instances exist
in which [the statute] cannot be applied constitutionally"); City of
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458 (1987) ("[In an overbreadth
challenge], a court's first task is to determine whether the enactment
reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct."
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Members of the City Counsel v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 801 (1984) (noting that an
overbreadth challenge will succeed only if there is "a realistic danger
that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First
Amendment protections of parties not before the Court").

Applying these principles, we must determine whether Section
223(d) unconstitutionally restricts freedom of expression, and, if so,
whether the statute criminalizes a category of protected speech that is
substantial in relation to the category that could legitimately be
proscribed. Section 223(d) constitutes a content-based regulation of
speech; in most contexts, such a regulation would be subject to the
strictest judicial scrutiny and therefore would be impermissible absent
a showing that the regulation is supported by a compelling interest
and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See Sable
Communications, 492 U.S. at 126. At oral argument, the
Government's counsel conceded that strict scrutiny analysis is
appropriate for purposes of this Court's adjudication of the plaintiff's
motion for preliminary injunctive relief; nonetheless, we pause to
consider this question in greater detail in light of the Supreme Court's
recent decision in Denver Area Consortium, 1996 WL 354027. There
a plurality of the Court assessed the constitutionality of statutory
provisions (1) granting cable operators the power to prohibit indecent
communications on "leased access channels"-i.e., channels reserved
under federal law for commercial lease by unaffiliated third parties;
(2) requiring cable operators to segregate and block indecent
programming if they decide to permit, rather than to prohibit, its
broadcast; and (3) granting cable operators the power to prohibit
indecent programming on "public access channels"-i.e., channels
reserved under local franchise agreements for public, educational, or
governmental purposes. Id at *5-*6. Recognizing that the Court's
First Amendment jurisprudence involved application of principles
tailored to different communications media, the plurality expressly
declined to adopt a definitive standard for evaluating content-based
regulation in the cable medium to apply in all future circumstances.
Id. at *10. Accordingly, the plurality did not evaluate the restrictions
on indecent cable broadcasts under a standard of "strict scrutiny," but
rather assessed whether the restrictions "properly addresse[d] an
extremely important problem, without imposing, in light of the
relevant interests, an unnecessarily great restriction on speech." Id. at
*11.

As the Denver Area Consortium plurality itself recognized, there was
little difference between the standard it applied and the strict scrutiny
approach that Justice Kennedy endorsed in his partial concurrence.
See id at *13. We have no doubt, however, that strict scrutiny should
apply here. The plurality's decision not to expressly apply strict
scrutiny in Denver Area Consortium depended in part on the
likelihood that children would be exposed to indecent cable
programming; reasoning that, like broadcast television or radio, cable
television is "uniquely pervasive" in homes and highly accessible to
children and that patently offensive material confronts the viewer
"with little or no prior warning," the plurality reasoned that Pacifica's
consideration of a limitation on indecent broadcasting was
persuasive. Id. at *12 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
plurality distinguished Sable Communications in part because it
"involved a communications medium, telephone service, that was
significantly less likely to expose children to "indecent] material, was
less intrusive, and allowed for significantly more control over what
comes into the home." Id at *14. As our findings of fact make clear,
it takes several affirmative steps for a user to gain access to material
through an interactive communications service. Indecent content on
the Internet ordinarily does not assault a user without warning: a
child cannot gain access to Internet content with the touch of a remote
control, and while accidental viewing of indecent content is possible,
there is no evidence in this record to suggest that it is likely.
Accordingly, we find strict scrutiny appropriate here.

In charging that Section 223(d) unconstitutionally restricts protected
expression, the plaintiff pursues two distinct arguments. First, the
plaintiff contends that Section 223(d) reaches a significant amount of
Internet content with serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value, and that the government cannot demonstrate any compelling
interest in restricting the availability of such material on the Internal
Second, the plaintiff claims that Section 223(d) (considered together
with certain affirmative defenses to criminal liability set forth in
Section 223(e)(5)) is not narrowly tailored, in that it fails to preserve
for adults the ability to engage in certain constitutionally protected
communications-effectively acting as a total ban on indecent
communications by interactive computer systems.

We find it necessary to address only the second of these claims.
Entirely independently of the question of whether matter of serious
value is chilled by the CDA, the statute constitutes an overly broad
restraint on protected communication between and among adults. Of
course, the statute would be even more constitutionally defective if it
encompassed work of serious value that the government has no
compelling interest in regulating. In light of our finding on the
plaintiff's second overbreadth claim, however, it is unnecessary to
resolve the question of whether he has demonstrated a likelihood of
success on his claim that the CDA would proscribe a substantial body
of work that is of serious value but that is not harmful to minors and
therefore not in the government's compelling interest to regulate.
Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 615.

It is also unnecessary, given our holding on the plaintiff's second
overbreadth claim, to decide whether the potential ineffectiveness of
the CDA in eradicating the problem of minors' having access to
sexually explicit material on the Internet renders the statute
constitutionally defective. Because the CDA only regulates content
providers within the United States, while perhaps as much as thirty
percent of the sexually explicit material on the Internet originates
abroad, see supra p. 26, the CDA will not reach a significant
percentage of the sexually explicit material currently available.
Considering, as we hold below with respect to the plaintiff's second
overbreadth claim, that the CDA can be expected to chill the First
Amendment rights of adults to engage in the kind of expression that
is subject to the CDA's criminal penalties, the apparent
ineffectiveness of the CDA underscores our holding today that the
Government has failed to demonstrate that the CDA does not
"unnecessarily interfer[e] with First Amendment freedoms." Sable
Communications, 492 U.S. at 126 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Even if it were established that the statute is to some limited
extent effective in protecting minors from sexually explicit material
on line, and that nothing short of a total ban on indecent
communication could be as effective, it is not obvious that the
benefits thus achieved would outweigh the burden, described below,
imposed on the First Amendment rights of adults. As our Court of
Appeals has repeatedly stated, "[T]he State may not regulate at all if it
turns out that even the least restrictive means of regulation is still
unreasonable when its limitations on freedom of speech are balanced
against the benefits gained from those limitations." Carlin
Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 837 F.2d 546, 555 (2d Cir.)
(internal quotation marks omitted), cert; denied, 488 U.S. 924
(1988).

We turn now to the plaintiff's second overbreadth claim, analytically
distinct from the first, that the CDA acts as a ban on certain
constitutionally protected communications between adults. For
purposes of our discussion of this claim, we will assume that the
government has a compelling interest in restricting minors' access to
all (or virtually all) "patently offensive" material-that is, that all such
material is found to be harmful to minors. The question is whether
the challenged provision of the CDA is a "narrowly drawn
regulations designed to serve [the government's] interest[] without
unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms." Sable
Communications, 492 U.S. at 126 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The plaintiff claims that the statute fails to safeguard for
adults the means of engaging in constitutionally protected
communications through interactive computer services.

The Government concedes that Section 223(d), standing alone, is not
constitutionally defensible. (Oral Argument, June 3, 1996, Tr. at 69-
71) As discussed in greater detail in our factual findings, and as the
Government concedes, for the vast majority of applications and
services available on the Internet, a user has no way of
communicating or making available patently offensive content with
certainty that the content will not reach a person under eighteen years
of age. (See Findings of Fact, supra; Oral Argument, June 3, 1996,
Tr. at 69) For example, an individual sending a message that will be
retransmitted by a mail exploder program has no way of knowing the
identity of other subscribers (even if he knows the e-mail address of
each subscriber). A content provider has no way of knowing who
will have access to an article posted to a Usenet newsgroup.
Individual participants in an Internet Relay Chat discussion know
other participants only by the names they choose upon entering the
discussion; users can participate anonymously by using a
pseudonym. A content provider who makes files available on an
anonymous FTP or on a gopher or Web server has no way of
knowing the identity of other participants who will have access to
those servers.

Because content providers using most forms of Internet
communication have no way of transmitting indecent content with
certainty that it will not reach a minor, the only way for a content
provider to comply with Section 223(d), standing alone, would be to
refrain from transmitting any indecent content. Because adults would
lack means of engaging in constitutionally protected indecent
communications over the Internet without fear of criminal liability,
the statute would unquestionably be unconstitutional. See Sable, 492
U.S. at 131 (holding that total ban on commercial indecent telephone
messages "has the invalid effect of limiting the content of adult
telephone conversations to that which is suitable for children to
hear").

Section 223(d), however, does not stand alone. In Section 223(e)(5),
Congress supplied two affirmative defenses to liability under the
CDA. First, Section 223(e)(5)(A) provides that it is a defense to a
prosecution under Section 223(d) that a person "has taken, in good
faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to [covered]
communication[s], which may involve any appropriate measures to
restrict minors from such communications, including any method
which is feasible under available technology." Second, Section
223(e)(5)(B) provides that it is a defense to a prosecution under
Section 223(d) that a person "has restricted access to [covered]
communication[s] by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit
account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number."
Accordingly, our inquiry is whether the statutory defenses adequately
ensure that would-be speakers can use the Internet to transmit
constitutionally protected communications to adults. The Government
concedes that it bears the burden of proving that Section 223(d),
taken together with the statutory defenses, preserves the ability of
adult Internet speakers to engage in constitutionally protected
indecent communications (Oral Argument, June 3, 1996, Tr. at 28-
29), see R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992)
(noting that content-based regulations are presumptively invalid);
only if adults can engage in such communications can the court
conclude that the relevant provisions of the CDA are narrowly
tailored to achieve the government's interest in restricting minors'
access to indecent material. We examine the Section 223(e)(5)
defenses in reverse order.


1. Verified Credit Card, Debit Account, Adult Access Code, or Adult
Identification Number

The Government does not claim that Section 223(e)(5)(B) serves as a
defense for content providers using all or even most forms of on-line
communication. If a content provider cannot discern who receives his
messages, there is no way for him to obtain verification of recipients'
ages. As previously noted, a speaker posting a message to a
newsgroup or to a list maintained by a mail exploder has no control
over who will receive the message; a user who joins an IRC
discussion channel cannot determine the identity of other participants,
beyond viewing a list of names. Because speakers wishing to use
these forms of communication have no way of identifying the
recipients of their messages, they simply cannot seek to obtain any
credit card or access code verification of a recipient's age. Similarly,
credit card or adult access verification is not available as a defense to
content providers who maintain FTP servers and wish to permit
"anonymous" access to files or who maintain gopher servers.17

As previously explained, evidence adduced at the three-day hearing
suggests that some form of verification is technologically feasible for
at least one mode of on-line communication relevant for our
purposes: the World Wide Web. See Findings of Fact, supra, pp.
31-32. Based on this evidence of record, it iS possible to conclude
that Section 223(e)(5)(B) serves as an adequate defense for at least
certain commercial providers of Web content-specifically, those who
primarily make Web content available for "purchase" or, put another
way, those who charge Web users to gain access to, and view, their
content. Many commercial content providers charge a fee to permit a
user to gun access to sexually explicit content, thus necessitating
credit card verification in any event. Nevertheless, we note that the
category of "commercial content providers" is itself somewhat
elusive, and it is not dear that all content providers who could be
termed "commercial" content providers could absorb the cost of
credit card verification. Consider, for example, a software developer
who makes a program available on line for users to download (that
is, copy to the hard drive of the user's computer) without charge, for
a short trial period, with the understanding that the user will remit a
registration fee if the user decides to retain the program after the trial
period. Although the software developer has a commercial purpose,
it is not clear that he could bear the economic burden of verifying the
credit cards of all those who access his software (as opposed to those
who ultimately enter into a licensing agreement).

Were Section 223(e)(5)(B) the only defense available to providers of
Internet content, the conclusion would be inescapable that the
provision challenged by the plaintiff reaches a substantial amount of
protected speech and is therefore constitutionally infirm. For
speakers using most Internet applications e-mail, newsgroups, chat
rooms-Section 223(e)(5)(B) is no defense at all; to avoid the threat of
CDA liability, they would simply have to refrain from engaging in
constitutionally protected speech. For non-commercial content
providers and possibly some commercial providers, credit card
verification or maintenance of a verification system would be
extremely costly. The Government urges that all Web content
providers-commercial and non-commercial alike-could associate with
"adult verification services." This argument ignores what is obvious
from examining the advertisements and informational literature in the
record regarding such services: these services are used in connection
with, and indeed gear their promotional materials toward, so called
"adult" sites offering pornographic images and users of such sites.
We have no doubt that it would be burdensome for some non-
commercial and commercial content providers wishing to make
available other types of material arguably falling within the scope of
the CDA, and for users wishing to retrieve such material, to associate
with "adult verification services."


2. Good Faith Defense

We turn, then, to Section 223(e)(5)(A), which provides a defense to
CDA liability for content providers who, "in good faith," take
"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances," including any steps "feasible under available
technology" to prevent minors' access to communications falling
within the scope of the CDA. The Conference Report accompanying
the CDA emphasizes that the term "effective" is to be given an's
common meaning and does not require an absolute 100% restriction
of access to be judged effective." S. CONF. REP. No. 230, 104th
Cong., 2d Sess. 190 (1996). Although the statute does not require
that a content provider take steps that are one-hundred percent
effective in restricting minors' access to indecent communications, it
is not disputed that Section 223(d) cannot stand unless there are
reasonably effective means of ensuring that covered communications
do not reach minors. (Oral Argument, June 3, 1996, Tr. at 69-71;
see supra p. 48) While the statute makes clear that a content provider
is permitted to do anything that is "feasible" under current technology
to restrict minors' access to covered communications, it does not by
itS terms allow content providers to escape liability if there is no
feasible and reasonably effective way of limiting minors' access to
those communications. Throughout this litigation, the Government
has attempted to identify certain steps-nowhere specifically set forth
in the CDA-that content providers could take that would, absent
extraordinary circumstances, constitute substantial evidence of a
Section 223(e)(5)(A) defense. On April 30, 1996, the Court directed
the Government to obtain clarification of the Department of Justice
position regarding the applicability of Section 223(e)(5)(A). On May
3, 1996, the Government filed a letter from John C. Keeney, Acting
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice ("Keeney Later"), stating in pertinent part:

Under present technology, non-commercial content providers can
take steps to list their site[s] in URL registries of covered sites,
register their site[s] with the marketplace of browsers and blocking
software (including listing an IP address), place their material in a
directory blocked by screening software, or take other similarly
effective affirmative steps to make their site[s] known to the world to
allow the site[s] to be blocked. Under present technology, it is the
position of the Department of Justice that, absent extraordinary
circumstances, such efforts would constitute substantial evidence that
a content provider had taken good faith, reasonable, effective, and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent
access by minors to the covered material. The same would be true for
tagging by content providers, coupled with evidence that the tag
would be screened by the marketplace of browsers and blocking
software.

(Emphasis supplies.) Following dosing arguments on June 3, 1996,
the Court ordered supplemental briefing by the Government focusing
in particular on the technological feasibility and the effectiveness of
some of the steps set forth in the Keeney Letter. We examine whether
content providers using various forms of Internet communication can
avail themselves of the good-faith defense set forth in Section
223(e)(5)(A)-that is, whether Section 223(e)(5)(A) enables them to
engage in constitutionally protected communications without fear of
criminal liability.18

We note at the outset that the Government has nowhere represented
that the articulation of the Department of Justice's position in the
Keeney Letter would prevent any United States Attorney from
arguing in a particular prosecution that any of the steps identifies in
the letter to not satisfy the requirements of Section 223(e)(5)(A). In
fact, it appears that in the Philadelphia litigation, where the
Government was granted leave to file the Keeney Letter, the
Government expressly conceded that the letter does not preclude a
United States Attorney from taking a contrary position in particular
litigation. See ACLU/ALA, 1996 WL 311865, at *58 n.20 (Dalzell,
J.). In addition, neither Section 223(e)(5)(A) itself nor the
Government's representations concerning that section can be read to
suggest that individuals taking the enumerated steps need not fear
prosecution (as distinct from ultimate criminal liability). Section
223(e)(5)(A) (like Section 223(e)(5)(B)) supplies a content provider
with an affirmative defense, to be invoked after a criminal
prosecution has been initiated and after the Government has
presented its case; the steps specified by the Government are said to
constitute "substantial evidence" of the affirmative defense. Because
Section 223(e)(5)(A) in no way shields a content provider from
prosecution, it cannot be said that the steps enumerated by the
Government eliminate any chilling effect that the "patently offensive.
provision otherwise would have.

Even if we were satisfied that the Department of Justice's position
regarding the scope of Section 223(e)(5)(A), as stated in the Keeney
Letter, could be uniformly implemented, that the Government would
not prosecute individuals who had taken the enumerated steps, and
that individual content providers' knowledge that they would not be
prosecuted would eliminate any chilling effect that the challenged
provision might otherwise have, we are unavoidably constrained to
conclude that Section 223(e)(5)(A) does not provide a safe harbor in
a substantial number of circumstances. We examine the particular
steps suggested by the Government.


a. Tagging

We look first to the concept of "tagging," the subject of extensive
testimony at the evidentiary hearing, as described above. See
Findings of Fact, supra, at pp. 28-30. As one of the Government's
expert witnesses testified, content providers wishing to transmit or
make available material that they believe to fall within the scope of the
CDA could identify the material as such by inserting a tell-tale "tag"
into a site's name or address.

Even assuming that content providers are able to distinguish
accurately between material subject to the CDA and material not
subject to the CDA, and assuming that any requirement that content
providers label constitutionally protected but patently offensive
communications would not lead a significant number of content
providers to refrain from transmitting such communications, the
tagging scheme suggested by the Government's expert still fails to
bring content providers within Section 223(e)(5)(A)'s safe harbor,
for several reasons. The simple act of inserting a tag in the address of
a domain, directory, or file; the name of a newsgroup or IRC
channel; the subject line of an e-mail message or newsgroup article;
or the source code of an HTML document, is completely ineffective
in preventing minors' access to patently offensive materials. For a
tagging scheme to be effective, the tag must be capable of being
detected by server software designed to make the materials available
or by client software used to request access to or to display such
materials. (Olsen Test., Tr. at 321-22) Indeed, the Government has
carefully avoided representing that tagging alone constitutes
"substantial evidence" that the content provider has used reasonable,
effective, and appropriate means for preventing minors' access to
constitutionally protected communications. Rather, the Department of
Justice has indicated that, absent unusual circumstances, evidence of
tagging, "coupled with evidence that the tag would be screened by
the marketplace of browsers and blocking software," would
constitute substantial evidence of compliance with Section
223(e)(5)(A). (Keeney Letter at 2 (emphasis supplied)) The evidence
adduced at the hearing, however, indicates that there is currently no
tag (such as "-L18") widely recognized as signaling that content falls
within the scope of the CDA. More important, the CDA imposes no
obligation on the manufacturers of browsers and blocking software
to configure their products to detect a particular tag; content
providers' ability to mount a tagging defense depends upon the
actions of these parties, whose cooperation is not required under the
Act.

Despite the lack of a recognized tag for CDA content, a content
provider could presumably insert into an address a label-such as
"sex" or "xxx"-designed to trigger blocking features (even in the
absence of a CDA tag agreed upon by the "marketplace of browsers
and blocking software" or prescribed by law). It is unclear that this
step would satisfy either the terms of the government's policy as
stated in the Keeney Letter or the plain language of the statute. The
terms of the Keeney Letter contemplate screening by the "marketplace
of browsers and blocking software." As the Government has
strenuously argued, blocking software is not in wide use today. S.
supra p. 27. Accordingly, even if content providers could offer
evidence that they "tagged" content within the reach of the CDA prior
to displaying it, and that available blocking software is configured to
detect the tag, it is difficult to see how their actions could be regarded
as "effective" means of preventing minors from gaining access to
materials.

At the hearing, the Government introduced no evidence that any
browser-that is, client software permitting a user to view materials
available on Web servers-is currently configured to detect and block
access to a directory or file containing a particular string of
characters. After the Court ordered the Government to file
supplemental materials regarding the Keeney Letter, the Government
submitted an article detailing the release of a Microsoft browser,
Internet Explorer 3.0, capable of screening content based on labels
compatible with PICS. (Supplemental Declaration of William J.
Hoffman, Ex. C; see supra p. 28) If a content provider were to tag a
file with a name incorporating a PICS label, a minor seeking access
to such a file on a system running this browser (appropriately set)
could not do so. (Id)

The Government also points to the fact that CompuServe and
Prodigy have linked their browsers to parental screening software
offered by Cyber Patrol Joint Stip. Paragraph 57) and that a browser
offered by InterGO Communications includes a PICS-compatible
screening feature. Yet there are numerous other browsers lacking any
screening features-including Netscape Navigator, which controls
some eighty percent of the browser marker. (Olsen Decl. Paragraph
101) A content provider simply could not show that a tag is screened
by the "marketplace of browsers" when only a handful of browsers
have screening capabilities. Even if it were possible to show that all
browsers with screening features would detect a label, the
Government has not suggested, much less proven, that browsers
with such screening features are in wide use. Without such a
showing, it is difficult to see how tagging could be "effective" within
the meaning of Section 223(e)(5)(A).

In sum, we fail to see how content providers attempting to carry a
Section 223(e)(5)(A) defense could do so by introducing evidence
that they had tagged materials within the scope of the CDA and that
browsers or blocking software in the "marketplace" can detect the
tags. Without a showing that a range of browsers and blocking
software capable of detecting the tag exist and are in wide use,
tagging cannot be thought reasonably "effective." If it is the
Government's position that a content provider need not show that the
relevant tag is widely screened-that is, screened by the "marketplace
of [available] browsers," not simply by a few browsers that may or
may not be in wide use-it is at odds with the statutory language,
which requires that content providers take effective means to prevent
minors' access to patently offensive materials. To put the matter
simply, unless and until blocking software is widely in place, or
unless and until those who produce and market browsers-on whom
Congress placed no obligations in the CDA-configure those browsers
to recognize particular labels, tagging to prevent minors' access to
material available on the Web cannot be "effective."

We note also that "browsers" are client software designed to obtain
access to material available on the World Wide Web. While some
permit the user to engage in other modes of Internet communication,
there is no evidence that those with screening features would restrict
access to, for example, tagged newsgroups, mailing lists, and chat
rooms. One of the Government's two expert witnesses testified that
client software enabling users to read e-mail and newsgroups, as
manufactured and distributed, is not configured to supply users with
options to detect particular labels or tags in newsgroup names, e-mail
addresses, or subject lines accompanying articles and messages.
(Olsen Test., Tr. at 331, 334) Such software can, however, be
reconfigured by a user to detect particular tags. (Id at 331) We doubt
that a content provider could rely on tagging, coupled with the fact
that e-mail and newsgroup readers can reconfigure their software to
detect certain tags, as evidence of reasonable and effective efforts to
prevent minors' access to materials falling within the scope of the
CDA. A content provider has no control over what client software a
user installs, how the user reconfigures that software, or whether a
minor can undo the reconfiguration. (Id at 333, 334) Thus, a content
provider has no way of ensuring that a message posted to a
newsgroup or a mailing list will not be available to persons under the
age of eighteen; to rely on the combination of tagging and client
software to come within the Section 223(e)(5)(A) defense, a content
provider would have to assume that third parties-namely, the users-
install and reconfigure software, and would risk criminal liability if
that dubious assumption proved incorrect.


b. Placing Content in Blocked Directories and Registering Content

Having concluded that the tagging scheme pressed by the
Government does not presently offer a substantial number of content
providers an affirmative defense to criminal liability under the CDA,
we turn to other steps identified in the Keeney Letter.

Those steps fall roughly into two categories. First, the Keeney Letter
suggests that steps taken by content providers to "place their material
in a directory blocked by screening software" will constitute
substantial evidence of compliance with Section 223(e)(5)(A).[19]
For example, a content provider can take steps to ensure that the site
is listed with a directory of sites containing "adult" material, such as a
section of the Internet Yellow Pages identifying adult materials
(Hoffman Decl., Ex. 6) or a section of an on-line directory system
such as Yahoo reserved for sexually explicit materials. The record
suggests that screening software such as SurfWatch is designed to
block sites listed in the Internet Yellow Pages under the category "X-
Rated Resources." (Stipulated Record, Ex. M, at 137-39 (Duvall
Test.); id. Ex. Q)

Second, the Keeney Letter suggests that steps taken by content
providers to "register their site[s] with the marketplace of browsers
and blocking software" will constitute substantial compliance with
Section 223(e)(5)(A). Attempting to lend substance to this language,
the Government notes that certain commercial on-line services,
Internet service providers, browsers, and blocking software will
block access to sites "registered" with their services. "Defendant's
Supp. Memo. at 34) Thus, the Government contends that, "absent
extraordinary circumstances," content providers who directly register
their sites with an unspecified number of such companies will have
satisfied Section 223(e)(5)(A). (Id)

Again, it appears that the Government's representation fails to help
any substantial number of content providers to enter the safe harbor
offered by Section 223(e)(5)(A). As previously noted, the
Government has offered no evidence, and does not contend, that the
products and services that offer to block site access cover even a
significant portion of the available market. If that portion were not
significant, site registration would accomplish little, and would
certainly not serve as an "effective" means to restrict the access of
minors to Internet content. Similarly, the effectiveness of securing a
listing in a directory containing sexually explicit sites depends upon
households' voluntary use of blocking software. The Government
strenuously argues-and we have found-that blocking software is not
widely used (Defendant's Post-Hearing Memo. at 54-55; see supra
p. 27), and content providers certainly cannot cause its greater use.

We note in passing two additional steps for compliance with Section
223(e)(5)(A) offered by the Government but not included in the
Keeney Letter. The Government suggests that those adults who wish
to exchange indecent communications can do so by confining those
communications to limited membership or limited access forums. For
example, an adult user could post indecent e-mail only to "closed"
mailing lists, whose subscribers could be "approved" based on age.
As previously noted, however, an e-mail address provides no
authoritative information about a subscriber, an individual managing
a "closed" mailing list would have to use some other means of
identifying subscribers' ages. The Government suggests none;
presumably, the list manager could obtain a credit card number from
each subscriber. Again, however, verification would be costly, and
not likely an option for a noncommercial content provider.

The Government also urges that content providers court post indecent
material to limited newsgroups. A newsgroup cannot be limited in the
same sense as a mailing list; communications are not transmitted from
a central server, but are passed among servers participating in the
Usenet system. Accordingly, a limited newsgroup is achieved by
restricting the number of servers on which posted articles appear.

Although the concept is not well developed in the record, it is clear
that the server or servers on which the newsgroup is available would
need the capacity to verify that any user requesting access to an article
is an adult. (Olsen Decl. Paragraphs 75-87 (describing concept of a
"verified server")) The Government's suggestion assumes that users
will possess the resources and expertise to establish and maintain a
server; although several individuals or entities could share a single
server, the record suggests that the cost of establishing a server is not
trivial-indeed, the price could range beyond three-thousand dollars.
(Galligher Test., Tr. at 182 (describing cost of maintaining mail
server))

In sum, there is no persuasive evidence that a substantial proportion
of Internet content providers can make available material potentially
within the scope of the CDA without fear of prosecution and criminal
liability. Leaving aside the fact that Section 223(e)(5) sets forth
affirmative defenses-and thus offers no assurance that a content
provider will not be prosecuted-the proffered defenses are
unavailable for numerous Internet content providers. The
Government suggests that content providers should "tag" their
material, but recognizes that the effectiveness of tagging depends
wholly on the actions of third parties-manufacturers of client
software-on whom the Act places no obligations whatsoever. The
Government also suggests that registration with the "marketplace of
browsing and blocking software" will constitute "substantial
evidence" of good faith, despite the face that the effectiveness of such
steps depends on the availability and use of services that offer to
block sites, browsers that have screening capabilities, or blocking
software. (See Defendant's Post-Hearing Memo. at 44-45) In the
absence of evidence that the marketplace actually offers a substantial
number of services and products with blocking capabilities-and,
indeed, in the face of evidence that households do not tend to use
existing parental control software, see supra p. 27-the Government's
position is untenable. We have no doubt that, under current
technology, the availability of a good-faith defense in Section
223(e)(5)(A) will not lessen the chill on protected expression created
by Section 223(d) of the CDA. (See Oral Argument, June 3, 1996,
Tr. at 18)

The Government urges thee we overlook the fact that the standards
and client software necessary to ensure that content providers can
enter Section 223(e)(5)(A)'s safe harbor are not currently in place,
and that we trust that standards and technology will evolve rapidly in
response to the CDA. The Government thus argues thee a defense to
criminal liability under a statute regulating constitutionally protected
speech is not now available but will be in shore order. We decline to
accept such an argument. We cannot uphold a statute against a First
Amendment challenge in the uncertain expectation that future
technology will remedy any constitutional infirmities. Even if we
could be certain thee technological advancement would rapidly render
the good-faith defense practicable, we necessarily decide questions of
law in the factual context of the world as we know it, mindful that
restrictions on First Amendment freedoms, "for even minimal
periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury."
Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373.

Section 223(e)(5)(A) offers the only possible defense for those who
wish to communicate by e-mail, newsgroups, or chat rooms or those
who choose to make files available by running an FTP or gopher
server. In addition, it offers the only defense for non-commercial-and
possibly some commercial-content providers of World Wide Web
material. The fact that Section 223(e)(5)(B) may offer a defense to
Web providers who primarily make content available for purchase
leads the Government to urge that, at a minimum, we uphold Section
223(d) as to commercial providers of Web content.20

We recognize that courts should attempt to limit a statute's scope
before resolving to declare it facially void. Two roads are available in
this respect; a court can strike a portion of a statutory provision,
leaving the remainder of the legislation intact, or it can leave the law's
language in place but assign to it a narrow meaning. However, the
circumstances here presented do not permit us either of these options
to save part, if not all, of the statute.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the "'elementary
principle that the same statute may be in part constitutional and in part
unconstitutional, and that if the parts are wholly independent of each
other, that which is constitutional may stand while that which is
unconstitutional will be rejected.'" Brockett v. Spokane Arcades,
Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 502 (1985) (quoting Allen v. Louisiana, 103
U.S. 80, 83-84 (1881)). Where it is possible to identify in the text of
a statute particular language that is unconstitutional, a court should
attempt to strike only that language, provided that the remainder of
the statute can function effectively without the excised portion and
that the resulting whole is consistent with the intent and design of
Congress. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684-85
(1986. Thus, for example, in Brockett, the Court reversed the
appellate court's facial invalidation of Washington's moral nuisance
statute, finding that the statute could survive a First Amendment
attack if, at worst, the word "lust" were struck from its definitional
section. 472 U.S. at 504-07; see also Alaska Airlines, Inc., 480
U.S. at 697 (striking down statute's legislative veto component
only).

The statute at issue in the instant case, however, nowhere
distinguishes between categories of content providers. Even if we
were to accept the Government's position that the statute could be
constitutionally applies to commercial providers of indecent material,
we are not in a position to excise particular statutory language in an
effort to salvage the provision, because we cannot identify a "wholly
independent" portion of the law that can be described as
constitutionally infirm.

Nor would it be appropriate for the Court to assign a narrow
construction to the statute's existing language. Although we
recognize that this is the proper approach in many instances, see,
e.g., National Advertising Co. v. City of Orange, 861 F.2d 246 (9th
Cir. 1988) (construing Orange City anti-billboard ordinance to apply
only to commercial billboards); Doyle v. Suffolk County, 786 F.2d
523 (2d Cir.) (saving New York law from invalidity under ADEA by
exempting individuals aged forty to seventy from its prohibition on
applicants over age twenty-nine), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 825 (1986),
there are limits on the extent to which the courts can salvage
legislation through limiting interpretation. A statutory provision must
be "easily susceptible of a narrowing construction." Erznoznik v.
City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216 (1975) (declining to
construe city ordinance narrowly to avoid First Amendment facial
invalidation); Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S.
383, 397 (1988) (dicta) (noting that "the statute must be 'readily
susceptible' to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to
conform it to constitutional requirements"). Otherwise, the courts
risk intrusion into the legislative sphere. See United States v.
National Treasury Employees Union, 115 S.Ct. 1003, 1019 (1995)
(declining to read nexus requirement into Ethics in Government Act,
noting its "obligation to avoid judicial legislation. and concluding,
"We cannot be sure that our attempt to redraft the statute . . . would
correctly identify the nexus Congress would have adopted....").

In the instant case, we would need to limit the statutory term "any
person" to mean "any commercial content provider," or, possibly,
"any commercial provider of Web content," or even "any commercial
purveyor of pornography on the World Wide Web. The statute is far
from "readily susceptible" to any such limitation. Rather, any such
interpretation would fly in the face of a dear congressional intent to
apply the statute's proscriptions to commercial and noncommercial
content providers alike. See S. CONF. REP. No. 230, 104th Cong.,
2d Sess. 191 (1996). The construction of the statute urged by the
Government here would require the court to substantially redraft the
statute-in effect, to usurp Congress's legislative functions. We
cannot accept the invitation to so reconfigure this statute and thus
engage in judicial legislation-the very "judicial legislation" that the
Supreme Court condemned in National Treasury Employees Union.

Nor does the statute at issue in the instant case lend itself to a gradual
narrowing through case-by-case adjudication along the lines of the
Supreme Court's approach in Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 601. In
Broadrick, the Court limited its holding to the parties before it in the
express expectation that subsequent cases would serve to define the
statute's proper scope. It did so, however, recognizing that the
potential range of the law's unconstitutional applications was not
"substantial . . . in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."
Id. at 616; see also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 773-74
(1982). In the instant case, the evidence suggests that the set of
content providers whose speech could be constitutionally proscribed
is in fact exceeded, perhaps even overshadowed, by the number of
users whose speech is constitutionally protected. Under these
circumstances, this Court may not leave to subsequent adjudication
the task of defining the potentially expansive set of users who should
be outside the statute's scope.


CONCLUSION

to summarize, we find as follows:

(1) The plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on his
claim that Section 223(d) is void as unconstitutionally vague.

(2) The plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the
merits of his second substantial overbreadth claim, that Section
223(d) serves as a ban on constitutionally protected indecent
communication between adults;

(a) The Government has conceded that Section 223(d), standing
alone, is unconstitutional as a total ban on protected indecent
communication between adults;

(b) Current technology provides no feasible means for most content
providers to avail themselves of the two affirmative defenses to
Section 223(d) set out in Section 223(e)(5).

Accordingly, the plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (filed
Feb. 17, 1996) is granted: the defendant is preliminarily enjoined,
until further order of this Court, from initiating any investigation or
prosecution under Section 223(d), to the extent that such
investigation or prosecution is based upon the alleged display or
transmission of indecent but not obscene material.

It is so ordered.

FN1: Following the Philadelphia decision, the Court ordered the
parties tO file letter briefs addressing the preclusive effect, if any, of
the Philadelphia court's findings of fact on this proceeding. "Under
the judicially developed doctrine of collateral estoppel, once a court
has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that
decision is conclusive in a subsequent suit based on a different cause
of action involving a party to the prior litigation."United States v.
Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 158 (1984). Although the doctrine can
apply where there is no mutuality of parties and can be used
offensively, id at 158-59, Mendoza makes dear that nonmutual
offensive collateral estoppel does not apply against the government,
at lease as to issues of law, id. at 162-63. Although courts have
observed that Mendoza leaves open the possibility that nonmutual
collateral estoppel may apply against the government with respect to
factual issues, see, e.g., Adkins v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 875 F.2d 137, 141 (7th Cir. 1989), we conclude that its
application is inappropriate here in light of the "avowedly tentative.
nature of the Philadelphia court's findings Lummus Co. v.
Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., 297 F.2d 80, 89 (2d Cir. 1961),
cert. denied, 368 U.S. 986 (1962); see ACLU/ALA, 1996 WL
311865, at *13 n.12 ("Because of the rapidity of developments in
this field, some of the technological facts we have found may become
partially obsolete by the time of publication of these [f]indings.").
Although many of our findings overlap with those made in
ACLU/ALA, we recognize that Internet technology is rapidly
evolving, and that evidence of new developments was added to the
record before us as late as June 7, 1996.

FN2: We use the term "content" to refer to any text, data, sound,
program, or visual image transmitted over or made available for
retrieval on an ineeractive computer service.


FN3: While Section 223(d) regulates more than the content of
Internet communications, we focus mainly on the range of tools and
services available to individuals with Internet access, recognizing that
the vast majority of content available through the use of an interactive
computer service is in fact available on the Internet.

FN4: A "modem" (a contraction of "modulator" and "demodulator")
is a device  that translates digital information into a signal for
transmission over a telephone line ("modulation") and eranslates a
signal received over a telephone line into digital information
("demodulation").

FN5 We use the eerm "coneene provider". to refer to any Internet
"speaker"-that is, a  user who eransmies or makes available any
coneent over the Ineerna. Although the term is not used in the
statutory provision at issue, "information coneent provider" is
elsewhere defined in the CDA as "any person or entity that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of
information provided ehrough the Ineerna or  any other interactive
computer service." Pub. L. No. 104-104, Sect. 509(e)(3), 110 Stat.
at  139 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 230(e)(3)). The phrase
serves as a reasonable  shorchand for the category of individuals
targeted by the CDA-persons who send or display Internet content.
See S. CONF. REP. No. 230, 104eh Cong., 2d Sess. 188 (1996)
(stating that 223(d)(1) applies to "content providers").

FN6 We use the eerm "software" to refer to the combination of
programs and  procedures that serve as instructions to the computer.
The term is often used in contrast with "hardware," which refers to a
computer system's physical elements.

FN7: The Court received direct testimony of the parties' experts on
technological issues (Dr. Olsen for the defendants and Clay Shirky
for the plaintiffs) by affidavit.

FN8: To locate files available for copying, a user can contact an
"Archie" server-a remote computer capable of searching directories
for file names containing a particular string of characters on FTP
servers permitting anonymous retrieval. (Hoffman Declaration, Ex.
4, at 180-90)

FN9: As with FTP servers, there are tools available for locating
menus or items containing a certain sering of characters: a "Veronica"
server is capable of searching menus on all gopher servers, while
"Jughead" is an aptly named tool for searching menus on only a
single server. (Galligher Testimony, Tr. ae 124; Hoffman Decl., Ex.
3, at 5; id Ex. 4, at 191-92)

FN10: Most of these services do not charge users for search requests
and are sustained primarily by advertising revenues. (Galligher Test.,
Tr. at 136-37.)

FN11: In the example jdoe@smith.com, "smith.com" would
constitute a domain name.

FN12: Following the example above, all e-mail would originate from
the domain smith-L18.com.

FN13: In the example above, material would originate from the
address jdoe-L18@smith.com.

FN14: The FCC's definition of "indecency" in turn has its roots in
the Supreme Court's obscenity jurisprudence. Under Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973), a work is legally obscene if it
"portray[s] sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. and, taken as
a whole, "appeal[s] to the prurient interest in sex" and lacks "serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.. Under the FCC's
indecency definition, a work need not appeal to the prurient interest
or lack serious value to be "indecent."See Denver Area Consortium,
1996 WL 354027, at *16 (plurality opinion). We note that Section
223(d) contains no reference to "indecent" speech, bue merely
imports the FCC's definition of indecency to define covered speech.
Section 223(a)(1)(B) of the CDA, not challenged by the plaintiff in
this litigation, uses the term "indecent." Like the parties in ehis case,
we use the trms "indecent" and "patently offensive. interchangeably.
The three judges in the Philadelphia litigation acceptd, for purpose of
adjudication of the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunctive relief,
that Section 223(a)(1)(B) and Section 223(d) cover the same contene,
despite Congress's use of the eerrn "indecent. in one provision and
the "patently offensive" description in the other. See ACLU/ALA,
1996 WL 311865, at *28 (Sloviter, C.J.), *40 (Buckwalter, J.), *48
(Dalzell, J.).

FN 15: In reviewing these rulings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit approved of the more expansive interpretation of the
indecency standard, see ACTI, 852 F.2d at 133840, but vacates
Regents of the Universitry of California and Pacifica Foundation,
Inc. on other grounds, see id at 1341.

FN16. Indeed, the statutory definition of indecency for the cable
medium, found not to be vague by a plurality of the Court in Denver
Area Consortium, makes no reference to the community standards
for the cable medium. 1996 WL 354027, at *16. Compare 47
U.S.C. Section 532(h) packing reference to standards for cable
medium) with 47 C.F.R. Section 76.701(g) (including reference to
standards for cable medium).

FN17. We note that an FTP server can be configured to verify a
password against a list of passwords issued to users maintaining an
account on the server before permitting access to certain files. A
provider opting for such a configuration, however, would not be able
to make files falling within the scope of the CDA broadly available to
"anonymous" adult users-ie, users without an account on the system.
Moreover, such a configuration is impracticable insofar as it requires
the maintenance of an extensive database of authorized user names
and passwords.

FN18. This inquiry is, of course, distinct from an inquiry into
whether the fact that Section 223(e)(5)(A) nowhere identifies any
specific steps that a content provider can take to enter its "safe
harbor" renders Section 223(d) unconstitutionally vague, because
individuals lack sufficient notice as to how to shield themselves from
criminal liability under the statute. The plaintiff does not press this
argument here.

FN19. The Keeney Letter also indicates that content providers can
take steps to ensure that their sites are listed "in URL registries of
covered sites." In response to the Court's request for supplemental
submissions, the Government appears to suggest that "registries" are
no different from "directories," and that a "covered" site is a site
blocked by screening software. (Defendant's Supplemental Post-
Hearing Memorandum of Law, at 1 n.1, 2) The steps by content
providers contemplated here are essentially identical to "plac[ing] . . .
material in a directory blocked by screening software." (See also
Olsen Testimony, Tr. at 447-48)

FN20. We note that in the ACLU/AL.A, the Government apparently
urged an even narrower approach-namely, that the Court uphold the
statute as to commercial purveyors of pornography. See
ACLU/ALA, 1996 WL 311865, at *33 (Sloviter, CJ.); cf. Oral
Argument, Shea v. Reno, June 3, 1996, Tr. at 74-75.

SERVING THE INTERNET

THE ORDER

On 11th April an historic hearing took place in the Queens Bench
Division of the Royal Courts of Justice, London, England. The
contrasting worlds of the sometimes archaic English Legal Process
and the modern phenomenon of the Internet met in the form of this
order:

"(1) The Plaintiff do have leave to serve the Writ herein outside the
jurisdiction of this Honourable Court

(2) The Plaintiff do have leave to serve notice of the Writ herein, and
to serve the Affidavit and this Order,... by E-Mail, at the number and
addresses stated on the Writ herein"

THE PROBLEM

The Application was an emergency one, as our media personality
client was faced with the prospect of the awesome power of the
Internet being used to disseminate defamatory material about them.
A series of E-Mail messages were received at our offices, which
contained the threats against our client, and set a short deadline
before they were to be carried out. An emergency application was
required to a Judge in Chambers (ie. in a Court where the public is
excluded).

The normal means of service provided no means of putting the
Defendant on immediate notice of the Injunction to ensure that he was
bound by it and liable for contempt of court if he breached it. He
was (we thought) in Europe, but only had post-marks on some
envelopes (also sent by the Defendant) to indicate which country.
We had no address, and the only fax line available appeared to be in a
different country from where the threats had been sent, and was
therefore of little use. The Defendant had however provided two E-
Mail addresses to enable us to communicate with him, which in the
circumstances were the obvious destination for the Injunction.

In summary, at that emergency first hearing we needed to obtain:

*    An Injunction to restrain the individual from carrying out his
threats;

*    Permission to serve the proceedings and that Injunction outside
the court's jurisdiction;

*    Leave of the Court dispensing with the normal requirement for
personal service;

*    Permission to serve that Injunction via the internet (which had so
far as we knew neither been sought nor obtained in an English
Court).

An ambitious prospect for a short emergency hearing, particularly
when aspects of our procedure are far from modern, for example
when Writs are issued in the Queen's Bench Division, they are
entered in leather-bound ledgers in copper-plate handwriting. Here
was an opportunity for the English legal system to show that it was
not only familiar with but could extend its jurisdiction into
cyberspace!

THE SOLUTION

In England the procedure in the Supreme Court is governed by a
series of practice rules contained in what is known by practitioners as
the "White Book". The citation for these Orders is normally in the
following form;  RSC (Rules of the Supreme Court) Order 1 Rule 1.

Leave to serve English legal proceedings outside the jurisdiction of
the English Courts is governed by RSC Order 11 Rule 1, which
provides that leave will be granted in (inter alia) the following
circumstances:-

1.  The Defendant is carrying out his unlawful activity within the
English jurisdiction;

2.  Damage was sustained by the Plaintiff within the jurisdiction;

3.  The Defendant is domiciled within the jurisdiction.

Since at least one of these provisions applied, that element of the
necessary relief from the Court presented no problem. Our difficulty
was one of communication ie putting our cyber Defendant on notice
of the Order to which he had become subject.

RSC Order 65 Rule 5 provides service of a document (not requiring
personal service) may be by Personal Service, Post, DX or Fax, or
(Rule 5(1)(d)); "in such other manner as the Court may direct".
However Order 65/1/2 stipulates that Court Orders such as
Injunctions "obedience to which may be enforced by committal..."
require personal service. This was impossible, not least because we
did not know where our defendant was.

It was therefore necessary to obtain an order for substituted service,
by virtue of RSC Order 65 Rule 4. As the rules make clear, this
should only be granted where the Court "is satisfied that a practical
impossibility of actual service exists, and that the method of
substituted service asked for by the Plaintiff is one which in all
reasonable probability, if not certainty, will be effective to bring
knowledge of the Writ or notice of the Writ (as the case may be) to
the Defendant".

Explaining our difficulty to the Court, we sought leave to utilise the
method of communication favoured by the Defendant; E-Mail.

In this case the only practical way to bring the Order to the notice of
our defendant was via the Internet into his P.C..

The Judge therefore showed imagination and pragmatism in granting
the Court Order, which was swiftly dispatched via the Net.

The Injunction had the deserved effect, the threats were withdrawn,
and the danger to the client thereby averted.

THE FUTURE

The Rules of the Supreme Court have for some time permitted
service of proceedings by fax (with certain specific safeguards).
There seems no reason in principle why the Internet/E-Mail should
not be used in the same way, since both also constitute the
communication of visual material by digital data.

One of the principle advantages of service by fax over DX (a system
of document exchange) and post is that the technology provides
proof of successful transmission, which is generally taken by the
Court to constitute proof of receipt by the intended recipient.

The Internet service provider which we used (PIPEX) provides a
command on transmission of the E-Mail permitting the sender to
know whether it has been received by the recipient; service provider.

PIPEX does however not permit the sender to know whether the E-
Mail has been received let alone read by the recipient. But the same
is true of a fax. The fact that it has been successfully transmitted is
no guarantee that the recipient has actually read it.

POSTSCRIPT

Our defendant considerately E-mailed a response to the Order,
thereby proving that he had received it! To enforce the Order (by an
application for committal etc.) the Court must be satisfied that he had
received it. The present technology does not (so far as we are aware)
permit E-Mail messages to have the complete "return/receipt" facility
that the internal E-Mail system in this firm allows, whereby the
sender can transmit the E-Mail with a demand that he is notified when
the E-Mail is read. Even if that technology did exist, it would be
open to the intended recipient to say that he was not the one who
viewed the E-Mail on his PC, although the Court may be very
reluctant to accept such evidence.

So far as the issue of enforcement is concerned, there are still issues
for the Court to address. There remains what are (for lawyers) a
fascinating series of unanswered questions, such as where
defamatory material is published, where threats are made, what is the
applicable national/international law so far as the Internet is
concerned etc.

The Internet may, in the midst of creating an array of interesting new
legal problems, also provided a solution to an old one. The existence
and value of the new technology has been recognised, and doubtless
other lawyers (some of whom have contacted us concerning this
Order) will seek to take advantage of our pioneering application.

The age of the cyber-lawyer has arrived, and the process has begun
of bringing the Internet within the legal constraints provided by the
civil law which apply to other forms of communication.

COMPLAINT FOR 
DECLARATORY AND 
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 
 
 
  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
 1. During much of this century the mass media, 
particularly radio and television, have been characterized 
by a limited number of speakers transmitting programming 
and information to essentially passive audiences. The 
communications medium of the twenty-first century -- the 
Internet and "cyberspace" generally -- is changing that, 
and will allow hundreds of millions of individuals to 
engage in interactive communication, on a national and 
global scale never before possible. The public square of 
the past -- with pamphleteering, soap boxes, and vigorous 
debate -- is being replaced by the Internet, which enables 
average citizens to participate in national discourse, 
publish a newspaper, distribute an electronic pamphlet to 
the world, and generally communicate to and with a broader 
audience than ever before possible. It also enables average 
citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world- wide 
range of information, while simultaneously protecting their 
privacy, because in this new medium individuals receive 
only the communications they affirmatively request. 
 
2. In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (to 
be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223) (the "Act"), Congress 
acknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinary 
advance in the availability of educational and 
informational resources to our citizens," and acknowledged 
that interactive computer services "offer users a great 
degree of control over the information that they receive." 
Congress therefore declared "[i]t is the policy of the 
United States . . . to promote the continued development of 
the Internet and other interactive computer services; [and] 
to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that 
presently exists for the Internet and other interactive 
computer services, unfettered by Federal or State 
regulation." Act Section 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 
Section 230). Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of 
the Act that were intended only to protect minors from 
communications deemed inappropriate for them will have the 
effect, perhaps unintended, of depriving adults of 
communications that are appropriate, and indisputably 
constitutionally protected, for them. Because of the way 
the Internet works, the Act's prohibition of communications 
that may be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for 
minors will effectively ban those same communications 
between adults, reducing the adult population in cyberspace 
to only what is appropriate for minors. The banned speech 
includes valuable works of literature and art, information 
about health and medical issues, and examples of popular 
culture. It also includes robust human discourse about 
politics, current events, and personal matters that may at 
times include harsh, provocative, or even vulgar language, 
all of which is constitutionally protected for adults. 
 
 3. Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individuals and 
entities from the computer and communications industries 
and the general public who are harmed by the Act. 
Plaintiffs include publishers and creators of content on 
the Internet; "online services," "Internet service 
providers," libraries, and others who provide access or 
connection to the Internet; and speakers, listeners, and 
users on the Internet. The Act's effective ban of a broad 
category of communication that is constitutionally 
protected for adults directly harms the First Amendment 
rights of plaintiffs, and of the tens of millions of adult 
speakers and listeners who are "online" and linked through 
this new communications medium. Plaintiffs also include 
parents, who seek to protect the rights of parents to 
decide what is appropriate for their children to receive 
through interactive computer communications. 
 
 4. The speech at issue in this case does not include 
obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech, speech 
intended to entice or lure minors into inappropriate 
activity, or other speech that lacks First Amendment 
protection even for adults. This complaint does not 
challenge governmental regulation of those categories of 
non-protected speech, and the relief sought herein will not 
affect the government's ability to prosecute the 
communication of those categories of speech, all of which 
are already prohibited by existing law. 
 
 5. The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section 502(2) 
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(d)), prohibits the 
"display" of material deemed "patently offensive" "in a 
manner available to a person under 18 years of age" 
(emphasis added). That provision is subject to certain 
defenses, which the sponsor of the Act and Congress 
apparently believed would enable speakers to restrict 
access by minors while simultaneously permitting access by 
adults. But those defenses, which were merely lifted from 
the "dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quite 
different medium of cyberspace. Because of the manner in 
which information is stored, transmitted, and received on 
the Internet, this provision has the (perhaps unintended) 
result of banning speech between adults that is suitable 
and constitutionally protected for adults. 
 
 6. The Act is also unconstitutional because there are 
alternative ways of protecting minors from material 
inappropriate for them that would not abridge the First 
Amendment rights of adults, and would be more effective in 
protecting minors than the mechanism Congress imposed. The 
speaker-based blocking required by the Act will not protect 
minors from access to words and images posted on the 
Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who are not 
effectively subject to prosecution under the Act, or even 
by domestic speakers who intentionally or inadvertently 
violate the Act. But user-based blocking technology enables 
parents and other users to block or screen whatever words 
or images they deem inappropriate, regardless of where 
posted, at little or no cost. For these reasons, every 
application of the Act unnecessarily and unconstitutionally 
abridges the First Amendment rights of adults, and does so 
even though there are less drastic alternatives that would 
be more protective of minors. 
 
 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

United States and presents a federal question within this 
Court's jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution

 FACTS 
 
 Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace 
 
 31. The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. It 
is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smaller 
groups of linked computer networks: a network of networks. 
This is best understood if one considers what a linked 
group of computers -- referred to here as a "network" -- 
is, and what it does. Small networks are now ubiquitous 
(and are often called "local area networks"). For example, 
in many United States Courthouses, computers are linked to 
each other for the purpose of exchanging files and messages 
(and to share equipment such as printers). These are 
networks. In the language of the Act, these networks would 
each be termed an "interactive computer service." 
 
 32. Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to 
other computers or networks (although the Act still 
directly applies to such closed local area networks). Many 
networks, however, are connected to other networks, which 
are in turn connected to other networks in a manner which 
permits each computer in any network to communicate with 
computers on any other network in the system. This global 
web of linked networks and computers is the Internet. 
 
 33. This amalgam of computers and computer networks -- 
some owned by governmental and public institutions, some 
owned by non-profit organizations, and some privately owned 
-- lacks any central control or supervision. The resulting 
whole is a decentralized, unrestricted global medium of 
communications -- or "cyberspace" -- that links 
individuals, institutions, corporations, and governments 
around the world. This communications medium allows any of 
the literally tens of millions of people with access to the 
Internet to exchange ideas, research, software, poetry, 
images, literature, sound, or simple electronic mail with 
others on the Internet. These communications can occur 
virtually instantaneously, and can be directed either to 
specific individuals, to a broader group of individuals 
interested in a particular subject, or to the world as a 
whole. 
 
 34. The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an 
experimental project of the Advanced Research Project 
Agency ("ARPA"). First called ARPANET, the network linked 
computers and computer networks owned by the military, 
defense contractors, and university laboratories conducting 
defense-related research. The network later allowed 
researchers across the country to access directly and to 
use extremely powerful supercomputers located at a few key 
universities and laboratories. As it evolved far beyond its 
research origins in the United States to encompass 
universities, corporations, and individuals around the 
world, the ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," 
and finally just the "Internet." 
 
 35. From its inception, the network was designed to be a 
decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant links 
between computers and computer networks, capable of rapidly 
transmitting communications without direct human 
involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to 
re-route communications if one or more individual links 
were damaged or otherwise unavailable. Among other goals, 
this redundant, self- healing system of linked computers 
was designed to allow vital research and communications to 
continue even if portions of the network were damaged. 
 
 36. To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately 
global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged the 
creation of multiple links to and from each computer (or 
computer network) on the network. Thus, a computer located 
in Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using 
dedicated telephone lines) to other computers in 
neighboring states or on the Eastern seaboard. Each of 
those computers would in turn be linked to numerous other 
computers, which themselves would be linked to other 
computers. 
 
 37. A communication sent over this redundant series of 
linked computers could travel any of dozens of routes to 
its destination. Thus, a message sent from a computer in 
Washington, D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, 
might first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia, and then 
be forwarded to a computer in Pittsburgh, and then to 
Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City, before finally 
reaching Palo Alto. If the message could not travel along 
that path (because of military attack, simple technical 
malfunction, or other reason), the message would 
automatically (without human intervention or even 
knowledge) be re-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to 
Richmond, and then to Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, 
Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and finally to Palo Alto. This 
type of transmission, and re-routing, would likely occur in 
a matter of seconds. 
 
 38. At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it 
subsequently ceased to exist), similar decentralized 
networks developed to link universities, research 
facilities, businesses, and individuals around the world. 
These other formal or loose networks included BITNET, 
CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. Eventually, each of these 
networks (many of which were overlapping) were themselves 
linked together, allowing users of any computers linked to 
any one of the networks to transmit communications to users 
of computers on other networks. It is this series of linked 
networks (themselves linking computers and computer 
networks) that is commonly known today as the Internet. 
 
 39. No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or 
non-profit -- controls, governs, or runs the Internet. It 
exists and functions solely as a result of the fact that 
hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers 
and computer networks independently decided to use a common 
data transfer protocol to exchange communications and 
information with other computers (which in turn exchange 
communications and information with still other computers). 
There is no centralized storage location, control point, or 
communications channel for the Internet, and it would be 
impossible for any single entity to regulate the 
information conveyed on the Internet. 
 
 40. The nature of the Internet is such that it is 
impossible to determine its size. However, it is 
indisputable that the Internet has experienced 
extraordinary growth in the past few years. In 1981, fewer 
than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 
1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers. By 
1993, however, over 1,000,000 computers were linked. Today, 
it is estimated that over 9,400,000 host computers 
worldwide are linked to the Internet, and this count does 
not include the tens of millions of personal computers used 
by individuals to access the Internet using modems (as 
detailed below). In all, reasonable estimates are that over 
40 million individuals around the world can and do access 
the enormously flexible communication medium of the 
Internet. That figure is expected to grow to 200 million 
Internet users by the year 1999. 
 
 How Individuals Access the Internet 
 
 41. Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to access 
cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular. In 
terms of physical access, there are two common methods to 
establish an actual link to the Internet. First, an 
individual can use a computer or computer terminal that is 
directly (and usually permanently) connected to a computer 
network that is itself directly or indirectly connected to 
the Internet. Second, an individual can use a "personal 
computer" with a "modem" to connect over a telephone line 
to a larger computer or computer network that is itself 
directly or indirectly connected to the Internet. As 
detailed below, both direct and modem connections are made 
available to individuals by a wide variety of academic, 
governmental, or commercial entities. 
 
 42. Students, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated 
with the vast majority of colleges and universities in the 
United States can access the Internet through their 
educational institutions. Such access is often via direct 
connection using computers located in campus libraries, 
offices, or computer centers, or may be through telephone 
access using a modem from a student's or professor's campus 
or off-campus location. Internet access is considered to be 
so important to the modern educational process that many 
colleges and universities install "ports" or outlets for 
direct network connections in each dormitory room or 
provide access via computers located in common areas in 
dormitories. Such access enables students and professors to 
use information and content provided by the college or 
university itself, and to use the vast amount of research 
resources and other information available on the Internet 
worldwide. 
 
 43. Similarly, Internet resources and access are 
sufficiently important to many corporations and other 
employers that those employers link their office computer 
networks to the Internet and provide employees with direct 
or modem access to the office network (and thus to the 
Internet). Such access is especially important, for 
example, to any corporation involved in scientific or 
medical research or manufacturing to enable corporate 
employees to exchange information and ideas with academic 
researchers in their fields. 
 
 44. Individuals who lack access to the Internet through 
their schools or employers still have a variety of ways 
they can access the Internet. Many communities across the 
country have established "free-nets" or community networks 
to provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet 
(and to provide local-oriented content and discussion 
groups). The first such community network, the Cleveland 
Free-Net Community Computer System, was established in 
1986, and free-nets now exist in scores of communities as 
diverse as Richmond, Virginia, Tallahassee, Florida, 
Seattle, Washington, and San Diego, California. Individuals 
typically can access free-nets at little or no cost via 
modem connection or by using computers available in 
community buildings. Free-nets are often operated by a 
local library, educational institution, or non-profit 
community group. 
 
 45. Individuals can also access the Internet through many 
local libraries. Libraries often offer patrons use of 
computers that are linked to the Internet. In addition, 
some libraries offer telephone modem access to the 
libraries' computers, which are themselves connected to the 
Internet. Increasingly, patrons are using library services 
and resources without ever physically entering the library 
itself. Such direct or modem access is typically provided 
by libraries at no cost to the individual user. 
 
 46. Individuals can also access the Internet by 
patronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer 
coffee shops," where customers -- while they drink their 
coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access 
the Internet. Such Internet access is typically provided by 
the shop for a small hourly fee. 
 
 47. Individuals can also access the Internet through 
commercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" 
that typically offer modem telephone access to a computer 
or computer network linked to the Internet. Many such 
providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial 
Internet Exchange Association -- are commercial entities 
offering Internet access for a modest monthly or hourly 
fee. Some Internet service providers, however, are 
non-profit organizations that offer free or very low cost 
access to the Internet. For example, the International 
Internet Association offers free modem access to the 
Internet upon request. Also, an increasing number of trade 
or other non-profit associations offer Internet access as 
a service to members. 
 
 48. Another simple and common way that individuals can 
access the Internet is through one of the major national 
commercial "online services" such as America Online, 
Apple's eWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or 
Prodigy. These online services offer nationwide computer 
networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local 
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and 
well organized content within their own proprietary 
computer networks. In addition to allowing access to the 
extensive content available within each online service, the 
services also allow subscribers to link to the much larger 
resources of the Internet. Full access to the online 
service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained 
for modest monthly or hourly fees. The major commercial 
online services have almost twelve million individual 
subscribers across the United States. 
 
 49. In addition to using the national commercial online 
services, individuals can also access the Internet using 
some (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in 
computer services, often called "bulletin board systems" or 
"BBSs." With an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and 
the cost of a telephone line, individuals, non-profit 
organizations, advocacy groups, and businesses can offer 
their own dial-in computer "bulletin board" service where 
friends, members, subscribers, or customers can exchange 
ideas and information. BBSs range from single computers 
with only one telephone line into the computer (allowing 
only one user at a time), to single computers with many 
telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple 
simultaneous users), to multiple linked computers each 
servicing multiple dial-in telephone lines (allowing 
multiple simultaneous users). Some (but not all) of these 
BBS systems offer direct or indirect links to the Internet. 
Some BBS systems charge individuals a nominal fee for 
access, while many others are free to the individual users. 
 
 
 50. Although commercial access to the Internet is growing 
rapidly, many individual users of the Internet -- such as 
college students and staff -- do not individually pay for 
access (except to the extent, for example, the cost of 
computer services is a component of college tuition). These 
and other Internet users can access the Internet without 
any requirement that they provide a credit card or other 
form of payment. 
 
 51. In part because the Internet is an unregulated 
"network of networks" with literally millions of access 
points and tens of millions of users, individual Internet 
users often do not have their own "username" or 
identification code that would indicate to others on the 
Internet the identity of the user. Many users access the 
Internet anonymously or through a method that would not 
allow for clear identification by a remote content 
provider. 
 
 Methods to Communicate over the Internet 
 
 52. Once an individual has access to the Internet, there 
are a wide variety of different methods of communication 
and information exchange over the network. These numerous 
methods of communication and information retrieval are 
constantly evolving and are therefore difficult to 
categorize concisely. The most common methods of 
communications on the Internet (as well as within the major 
online services) can be roughly grouped into six 
categories: one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"), 
one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"), distributed 
message databases (such as "USENET newsgroups"), real time 
communication (such as "Internet Relay Chat"), real time 
remote computer utilization (such as "telnet"), and remote 
information retrieval (such as "ftp," "gopher," and the 
"World Wide Web"). Most of these methods of communication 
can be used to transmit text, data, computer programs, 
sound, or visual images. 
 
 53. One-to-one messaging. The simplest method of 
communication on the Internet is via electronic mail, or 
"e- mail," the modern equivalent to a first class letter. 
An individual can address and transmit a message to one or 
more specific other individuals. E-mail on the Internet is 
not routed through any central control point, and can take 
numerous and varying paths to the recipients. Unlike postal 
mail, simple e- mail is not "sealed" or secure, and can be 
accessed or viewed on intermediate computers between the 
sender and recipient (unless the message is encrypted). 
 
 54. One-to-many messaging. The Internet also contains 
automatic mailing list services (such as "listserv") that 
allow simple and efficient communications about particular 
subjects of interest. For example, individuals can 
subscribe to a "listserv" mailing list on a particular 
topic of interest to them. The individual can submit 
messages on the topic to the listserv that are 
automatically forwarded (via e-mail) to anyone who has 
subscribed to the mailing list. A recipient of such a 
message can reply to the message and have the reply also 
distributed to everyone on the mailing list. This service 
provides the capability to keep abreast of developments or 
events in a particular subject area. Most listserv-type 
mailing lists automatically forward all incoming messages 
to all mailing list subscribers. There are thousands of 
such mailing list services on the Internet, collectively 
with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. 
 
 55. Distributed message databases. Similar in function to 
listservs -- but quite different in how communications are 
transmitted -- are distributed message databases such as 
"USENET newsgroups." Like listservs, newsgroups are open 
discussions and exchanges on particular topics. Users, 
however, need not subscribe to the discussion mailing list 
in advance, but can instead access the database at any 
time. An individual user can post a message to a newsgroup, 
and the message is then automatically forwarded to all 
other computers that furnish access to the newsgroups (but 
not to any individual users). The messages are temporarily 
stored on each receiving computer, where they are available 
for review and response. The messages are automatically and 
periodically purged from each system to make room for new 
messages. Responses to messages -- like the original 
messages -- are automatically distributed to all other 
computers receiving the newsgroup. There are newsgroups on 
more than fifteen thousand different subjects. In 1994, 
approximately 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups 
each day, and those messages were distributed to the 
approximately 190,000 computers or computer networks that 
participate in the USENET newsgroup system. Messages posted 
to newsgroups are not stored on or channelled through any 
central computer or location. 
 
 56. Real time communication. In addition to transmitting 
messages that can be later read or accessed, individuals on 
the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog -- in "real 
time" -- with other individuals on the Internet. In its 
simplest forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and 
"Internet Relay Chat" allows two or more individuals to 
type messages to each other that almost immediately appear 
on the other individuals' computer screens. In addition, 
commercial online services such as America Online, 
CompuServe, eWorld, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have 
their own "chat" systems allowing their members to 
converse. 
 
 57. Real time remote computer utilization. Another method 
to utilize information on the Internet is to access and 
control remote computers using "telnet." For example, using 
telnet, a researcher at a university would be able to 
utilize the computing power of a supercomputer located at 
a different university. A student can use telnet to connect 
to a remote library to access the library's online card 
catalog program. Or, individuals can link via telnet to a 
computer to interact directly and communicate with other 
users linked to the same computer. Accessing a computer via 
telnet occurs in "real time," and content and communication 
accessed via telnet is often created only at the time of 
the communication. 
 
 58. Remote information retrieval. The final major category 
of communication may be the most important and well known 
use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval of 
information located on remote computers. There are numerous 
methods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet. 
A simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to 
list the names of computer files available on a remote 
computer, and to transfer one or more of those files to an 
individual's local computer. Another approach uses a 
program and format named "gopher" to guide an individual's 
search through the resources available on a remote 
computer. A third approach, and fast becoming the most well 
known on the Internet, is the "World Wide Web." The Web 
utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language called hypertext 
markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the Web 
can display HTML documents containing text, images, and 
sound. Any HTML document can include links to other types 
of information or resources, so that while viewing an HTML 
document that, for example, describes resources available 
on the Internet, an individual can "click" using a computer 
mouse on the description of the resource and be immediately 
connected to the resource itself. Such "hyperlinks" allow 
information to be accessed and organized in very flexible 
ways, and allow individuals to locate and efficiently view 
related information even if the information is stored on 
numerous computers all around the world. 
 
 59. With the exception of point-to-point mail, no 
information flows through cyberspace to a particular 
individual unless the individual requests the information. 
Listservs, newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and 
the World Wide Web all require an affirmative request by 
the Internet user prior to the user receiving information 
over the Internet. Further- more, when a user makes such an 
affirmative request it is usually clear what type of 
content will be delivered. Thus, unlike radio or 
television, there is no significant risk that a user will 
be "assaulted" with unsolicited and undesired content. 
 
 60. The vast majority of transmissions of content from 
specific sites on the Internet are in response to 
electronic requests the user could not have anticipated 
more than a few seconds or moments before making the 
request. Because information is located on millions of 
computers around the world, with no central organization or 
control, a user cannot possibly know which computers might 
have useful information until starting a search. Instead, 
the user could access any of dozens of different search 
databases, obtain a list of sites that might be of 
interest, and then immediately link to one or more of the 
sites. Indeed, the very theory of "hyperlinks" and the 
hypertext markup language (HTML) (the foundation of the 
World Wide Web) is that the user can jump from site to site 
to site without ever needing to know where physically in 
the world the next site is located. Thus, there is no way 
for a user to pre-register with every computer that might 
contain useful content on a particular topic. Moreover, 
when an individual is researching a topic on the Internet, 
he or she might access dozens of newsgroups, telnet 
computers, and ftp, gopher, and Web sites around the world 
in a matter of minutes. If a researcher was required to 
request access from content providers prior to actually 
viewing the information (and prove to the provider that the 
researcher was not a minor), the Internet would be 
transformed from a dynamic and instantaneous content 
searching tool into a cumbersome, multi-step, much slower, 
and much less useful research tool. The vibrancy and 
immediacy that sparked the Internet's recent extraordinary 
expansion and development would be lost. 
 
 61. The inability to predict where on the Internet a user 
would want to access information is not limited to 
research, and applies equally to any attempt by a user to 
access information on the Internet when the individual does 
not know in advance the precise location of that 
information. There are millions of computers on the 
Internet that contain content, and it would be practically 
and economically impossible for the tens of millions of 
Internet users to pre-register with each of those millions 
of content sites, and equally impossible for those millions 
of content sites to maintain and instantaneously update 
lists of registered users. 
 
 62. For both the speaker and the listener, communications 
on the Internet bear virtually no similarity to 
communications on television and radio. With radio and 
television, the number of speakers is limited by the 
available spectrum, the ability to speak is limited by the 
high cost of speaking, and listeners are merely passive 
recipients of the communications. With the Internet, the 
number of speakers is boundless, anyone can speak for 
pennies a day (or for free at his or her public library), 
and listeners can respond and engage the speaker in an 
interactive and on-going dialogue. Furthermore, unlike 
television and radio, on the Internet viewers and listeners 
generally receive only the communications they 
affirmatively request, and are not a passive or "captive" 
audience. Moreover, unlike with television and radio, on 
the Internet a speaker can reach the entire world (at no 
additional cost) yet at the same time can direct his or her 
speech to individuals who share an interest in a particular 
subject. In the twenty-first century, the Internet -- if 
allowed to flourish unhindered by government censorship -- 
can revive the now-little- used public square and convert 
it into a global medium of communication and discourse. 
 
 Content on the Internet 
 
 63. The diversity of content on the Internet is as broad 
as the Internet itself. Content can be found on millions of 
computers worldwide, and ranges from academic research to 
art to humor to literature to medical information to music 
to news to virtually anything else. Moreover, at any one 
time, the Internet serves as the communication medium for 
literally tens of thousands of global conversations, 
political debates, and social dialogues. For example, on 
the Internet, one can view the full text of the Bible, all 
of the works of Shakespeare, and numerous other classic 
works of literature. One can browse through paintings from 
museums around the world, or view in close-up detail the 
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or see the latest 
photographs transmitted by the Jupiter space probe. One can 
even hear pieces of music or view clips of movies and 
videos over the Internet. 
 
 64. There is a significant amount of content on the 
Internet that could be considered "indecent" for minors in 
some communities in the United States, but which most 
people would consider to be extremely valuable and 
appropriate for adults, and which, in any event, is 
constitutionally protected for adults. Such content 
includes, for example, great works of art and literature 
(containing depictions and descriptions of nudes and sexual 
conduct), examples of modern popular culture (containing 
popular music, lyrics, movie images, or literature with 
sexual content), medical information (containing depictions 
and descriptions relating to child birth, sexually 
transmitted diseases, and sexually related medical 
conditions), and historical and scientific information 
(containing, for example, accounts of historic criminal 
trials or other historical, sociological, and 
anthropological works). Such content, and other content 
typically provided by non-commercial providers, is 
effectively banned by the Act. 
 
 65. The fear that some communities in the United States 
would conclude that this type of valuable material is 
"indecent" for minors is well founded. Communities across 
the country have banned or sought to ban classic works of 
literature, such as Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, As 
I Lay Dying by William Faulkner, The Adventures of 
Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, The Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, 
and I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, as 
"indecent" for minors. Even the American Heritage 
Dictionary and parts of the Bible have been attacked as 
being "indecent" for minors. All of these works (some of 
which are available in whole or in part on the Internet), 
and works with similar content, are effectively banned by 
the Act. 
 
 66. In addition to the above type of content that is 
banned by the Act, a tremendous amount of common human 
discourse is banned by the Act. In the course of 
conversations, discussions and debates, many citizens use 
language and imagery that in some communities would be 
viewed as "indecent" for minors. Vigorous and heated debate 
often occurs with harsh or vulgar words. Many people, and 
many speakers on the Internet, use in common discourse 
words that describe "sexual or excretory activities or 
organs" in terms that might be deemed to be "patently 
offensive" for minors. The use of vulgar words in a dialog 
with friends -- which would be perfectly legal over the 
telephone or in a letter or on a basketball court -- would 
be illegal under the Act if sent over the Internet. 
 
 67. There are many examples on the Internet of valuable 
content that can be displayed only subject to the threat of 
criminal liability and prosecution. 
 
 68. For example, a content provider would reasonably fear 
prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of 
written descriptions of sexual intercourse. 
 
 69. There are available on the Internet important works of 
literature that include descriptions of sexual intercourse. 
 
 
 70. Similarly, a content provider would reasonably fear 
prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of 
images of nude men and/or women. 
 
 71. There are available on the Internet numerous important 
works of art -- paintings, drawings and photographs by 
great masters and modern artists alike -- that depict nude 
men and/or women. An example of such a work of art is 
Manet's Olympia. 
 
 72. Similarly, content providers would reasonably fear 
prosecution under the Act for engaging in a vigorous online 
debate in which there is repeated use of the "seven dirty 
words" at issue in the decision in Federal Communications 
Commission v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). 
 
 73. There are on the Internet -- on a daily basis -- 
vigorous political, social, and other dialogues and debates 
that include unrestricted use of one or more of the "seven 
dirty words." 
 
 74. Similarly, a content provider would reasonably fear 
prosecution under the Act for the display on a World Wide 
Web "home page" of vulgar statements of the type at issue 
in Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971). 
 
 75. The Supreme Court has specifically held that the use 
of the vulgar statement in Cohen is protected expression, 
even when displayed in public areas when children are 
present. 
 
 76. Similarly, a content provider would reasonably fear 
prosecution under the Act for the display of a parody that 
makes explicit assertions about the "sexual or excretory 
activities or organs" of a well known public figure, as was 
at issue in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 
(1988). 
 
 77. The Supreme Court specifically held in Falwell that a 
parody that made explicit assertions about the "sexual or 
excretory activities or organs" of a well known public 
figure is protected expression. 
 
 78. Similarly, a content provider would reasonably fear 
prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of 
detailed information concerning birth control and the 
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
 
 79. The Supreme Court specifically held in Bolger v. 
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), that such 
communications are protected expression and can be mailed, 
unsolicited, into homes. 
 
 80. There is a tremendous amount of valuable content on 
the Internet that is constitutionally protected for adults, 
but is nevertheless subject to prosecution under the Act. 
 
 The Statutory Language At Issue 
 
 81. Signed into law on February 8, 1996, the 
Communications Decency Act criminalizes the display and 
distribution of constitutionally protected expressive 
material. 
 
 82. The Act contains two primary criminal provisions. 
Violation of either provision is a felony, punishable by as 
much as two years in prison and substantial fines. 
 
 83. Section 502(2) of the Act, to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 
Section 223(d), broadly prohibits knowingly using any 
"interactive computer service" to send to a specific person 
or persons under 18 years of age, or to "display," "in a 
manner available to" a person under 18, certain "patently 
offensive" communications. Section 502(2) provides, in 
pertinent part: (d) Whoever-- 
 
 (1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly-- 
 
(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a 
specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or 
 
(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a 
manner available to a person under 18 years of age, 
 
 any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or 
other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, 
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs, regardless of whether the user of such service 
placed the call or initiated the communication; or 
 
 (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility 
under such person's control to be used for an activity 
prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used 
for such activity, 
 
shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or 
imprisoned not more than two years, or both. 
 
Act Section 502(2). 
 
 84. "Interactive computer service" is defined as "any 
information service, system, or access software provider 
that provides or enables computer access by multiple users 
to a computer server, including specifically a service or 
system that provides access to the Internet and such 
systems operated or services offered by libraries or 
educational institutions." Act Section 502(2) (to be 
codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(h)(2)) referring to Act 
Section 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 
230(e)(2)). 
 
 85. The terms "patently offensive," "contemporary 
community standards," and "display" are nowhere defined in 
the Act. 
 
 86. Another section of the Act, Section 502(1), to be 
codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(a)(1)(B), prohibits and 
criminalizes the use of a "telecommunications device" 
knowingly to make or create and "initiate[] the 
transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, 
proposal, image, or other communication which is . . . 
indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication 
is under 18 years of age." Another provision of the same 
section makes it a crime to "knowingly permit[] any 
telecommunications facility under [a person's] control to 
be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with 
the intent that it be used for such activity." Act Section 
502(1) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(a)(2)). 
 
 87. "Telecommunications device" is defined to exclude an 
"interactive computer service." Act Section 502(2) (to be 
codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(h)(1)(B)). 
 
 88. The term "indecent" is not defined. 
 
 89. The Act establishes several defenses a defendant may 
assert in a criminal prosecution under the Act. First, no 
person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) 
solely for providing access or connection to or from a 
facility, system, or network not under that person's 
control, including transmission, downloading, intermediate 
storage, access software, or other related capabilities 
that are incidental to providing such access or connection 
that does not include the creation of the content of the 
communication. 
 
Act Section 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 
223(e)(1)). 
 
 90. The phrase "not under that person's control" is 
nowhere defined in the Act. 
 
 91. This defense is not available "to a person who is a 
conspirator with an entity actively involved in the 
creation or knowing distribution of communications that 
violate this section, or who knowingly advertises the 
availability of such communications." Id. (to be codified 
at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(e)(2)). Nor is this defense 
available to "a person who provides access or connection to 
a facility, system, or network engaged in the violation . 
codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(e)(3)). The level or 
nature of control is not defined. 
 
 92. In addition, the Act provides a defense to a criminal 
prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) for use 
of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if the 
defendant (A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, 
effective, and appropriate actions under the circumstances 
to restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication 
specified in such subsections, which may involve any 
appropriate measures to restrict minors from such 
communications, including any method which is feasible 
under available technology; or 
 
(B) has restricted access to such communication by 
requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, 
adult access code, or adult personal identification number. 
 
Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(e)(5)). 
Congress did not provide any details as to what might be 
considered a "good faith, reasonable, effective, and 
appropriate action[]." Congress did allow the Federal 
Communications Commission ("FCC") to promulgate nonbinding 
guidelines as to what might be an "appropriate action," but 
it now appears that even those guidelines will not be 
issued until sometime in 1997 at the earliest, and 
compliance with the guidelines will not insulate speakers 
from prosecution or conviction under the Act. 
 
 93. Congress made no findings in connection with enacting 
Section 502 of the Act. Congress made no findings as to its 
purpose or interest in criminalizing online communication 
of "indecent" or "patently offensive" materials to, or that 
would be available to, persons under age 18. In considering 
the Act, Congress made no inquiry into or findings 
regarding the extent to which such materials were available 
to persons under 18. Congress made no inquiry into or 
findings whether the means Congress chose to address 
whatever interest it had would substantially further that 
interest. Congress made no inquiry into or findings whether 
any less restrictive means would substantially further its 
interest. 
 
 94. In another section of the Act, however, Congress did 
make the following relevant findings: (1) The rapidly 
developing array of Internet and other interactive computer 
services available to individual Americans represent an 
extraordinary advance in the availability of educational 
and informational resources to our citizens. 
 
 (2) These services offer users a great degree of control 
over the information that they receive, as well as the 
potential for even greater control in the future as 
technology develops. 
 
 (3) The Internet and other interactive computer services 
offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, 
unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad 
avenues for intellectual activity. 
 
 (4) The Internet and other interactive computer services 
have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a 
minimum of government regulation. 
 
 (5) Increasingly Americans are relying on interactive 
media for a variety of political, educational, cultural, 
and entertainment services. 
 
Act Section 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 
230(a)) (emphasis added). 
 
 The Impact of the Act on the Internet 
 
 95. Because of the realities of the Internet, the Act 
effects a total ban on certain constitutionally protected 
speech to adults. The Act reduces discourse on major 
portions of the Internet to that which is appropriate for 
a young child. 
 
 96. Virtually all of the tens of millions of users of the 
Internet -- except those who at all times stand mute in the 
discourse that occurs on the Internet -- are content 
providers who are subject to the terms of the Act. An 
individual is a content provider subject to the Act if he 
sends a single e-mail, or participates in a listserv 
discussion, or contributes to a USENET newsgroup, or 
responds to a survey on the World Wide Web, or establishes 
a personal "home page" on the Web, or converses with a 
friend through a real time service, or simply places a file 
in a publicly available area of a computer or network. 
 
 97. In other words, virtually any use of the Internet 
makes someone a content provider subject to the criminal 
penalties of the Act. Commercial content providers -- who 
typically require a credit card for users' payment -- may 
be able to use the credit card defense allowed by the Act. 
But for non- commercial content providers, who are 
responsible for a major part of communications on the 
Internet, there is no practical way the speaker can control 
who can access the message. Thus, for the vast majority of 
speech on the Internet, it is impossible for the speaker to 
prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in a manner 
available" to a person under 18. Act Section 502(2). 
 
 98. Because of this impossibility, Section 502(2) of the 
Act effectively requires that almost all discourse on the 
Internet be at a level suitable for young children. This 
provision has the effect of a flat ban on an entire 
category of constitutionally protected speech between 
adults. 
 
 99. As used by millions of people daily, the primary 
methods to access information on the Internet do not permit 
individual or non-commercial content providers to control 
who on the Internet can access their content. From the 
perspective of the content provider, information that is 
publicly available on the Internet is available to all 
users of the Internet, even users who might be minors. 
 
 100. None of the major methods of accessing information -- 
including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups, chat 
lines, telnet, ftp, gopher, and the World Wide Web -- has 
the ability to track the millions of individuals who access 
the Internet and screen out those who are under eighteen 
years of age. Although password-required access to content 
is possible (and is used in some circumstances), a 
password-access system would effectively remove from public 
access an enormous volume of valuable content on the 
Internet, and would reduce the information available to 
adults on the Internet to only content deemed suitable for 
minors. 
 
 101. The vast majority of content providers on the 
Internet are individuals who post messages to newsgroups 
and listservs, and who create content on the World Wide 
Web. Those individual content providers could not possibly 
create and maintain a database of specific Internet users 
who request access to the content and who prove they are 18 
or older. Nor could individuals or other non-commercial 
content providers practically administer or economically 
afford an instantaneous credit card verification system. 
Such a requirement would effectively preclude any 
communications by those content providers that could be 
deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors. 
 
 102. Even larger organizations that provide content on the 
Internet cannot practically or economically track the 
millions of Internet users to determine whether those users 
are minors or adults. 
 
 103. Moreover, even if pre-registration by content users 
were practically or economically possible, the value of the 
content would be dramatically diminished because so few 
content users would anticipate the need to pre-register for 
a particular site. A huge percentage of Internet traffic is 
by users engaged in spontaneous and unpredictable research 
or searches for content, and a pre-registration requirement 
would effectively end this type of search. 
 
 104. As described above, the World Wide Web is a 
spontaneous and serendipitous communications medium, in 
which a user can jump from site to site to site depending 
on what content looks most useful or interesting, without 
any pre-registration or advance request. Requiring 
pre-registration for all sites that might contain content 
arguably covered by the Act (if such pre- registration were 
practically possible) would drastically reduce the 
usefulness of the World Wide Web. 
 
 105. For other methods of providing content on the 
Internet, it is flatly impossible for a content provider to 
control who can access the content. With USENET newsgroups, 
for example, once a content provider posts a message to a 
newsgroup, that message is automatically distributed to 
over 190,000 computers around the world, and the individual 
content provider has no ability whatsoever to control who 
is permitted to access the content on those 190,000 
computers. Under the Act, all content posted to USENET 
newsgroups must be reduced to a level appropriate for young 
children. Similarly, Internet mailing list services such as 
"listserv" also do not allow the speaker to control who 
receives the communication, and thus speech via a mailing 
list service would also be reduced to the level appropriate 
for young children. 
 
Ineffectiveness of the Act and Effectiveness of Alternative 
Means 
 
 106. The overwhelming majority of content on the Internet 
is non-sexual in nature, and is not even arguably 
"indecent" or "patently offensive," even for minors. 
However, a significant amount of the content on the 
Internet could arguably be deemed "indecent" or "patently 
offensive" for minors in some communities, and the Act bans 
or burdens all of that content. 
 
 107. Although imposing extreme burdens on the Internet, 
the Act will in fact have very little impact on the 
availability to persons under 18 of "indecent" or "patently 
offensive" images or communications on the Internet. At 
least in part because Congress held no hearings on the Act, 
did not collect information about how the Internet works, 
and only haphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, 
the Act does not accomplish or even significantly further 
the ostensible goal of limiting access by persons under 18 
to "indecent" or "patently offensive" images. There are at 
least two reasons why implementation of the Act will be 
highly ineffective as a limitation on such access. 
 
 108. First, a high percentage of sexual content on the 
Internet originates outside of the United States, and it is 
not possible to prevent that content from being "available" 
in the United States. To the extent the Act imposes any 
burdens on domestic commercial providers of such 
communications, those providers will have the option of 
moving their operations overseas. 
 
 109. Second, the existence of "anonymous remailers" means 
that any content -- indecent or otherwise -- can be placed 
onto the Internet anonymously, and the government would be 
unable to identify the content provider. Anonymous remailer 
systems -- which often are located overseas -- will 
automatically receive a communication and forward it to a 
destination after having removed all trace of the origin of 
the communication. 
 
 110. At bottom, therefore, the Act does little to limit 
the ability of commercial or non-commercial entities to 
provide "indecent" or "patently offensive" images on the 
Internet. 
 
 111. A critical difference between the Act's attempt to 
regulate indecency on the Internet and prior governmental 
attempts to regulate indecency (over radio, television, and 
telephone sex lines, for example) is that there are tens of 
millions of speakers on the Internet, with no bottleneck 
through which all of the speech must pass. 
 
 112. There are alternative means that are far more 
effective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or 
"patently offensive" communications. The only place where 
it is practically possible to screen out commercial 
indecency, non- commercial indecency, domestic indecency, 
overseas indecency, intentional indecency, inadvertent 
indecency, and anonymous indecency is in the computer that 
is attempting to receive the speech. 
 
 113. The government's legitimate interest in aiding 
parental control over the Internet material their children 
access may be served by several means that are both less 
restrictive and more effective than a blanket ban on 
"indecent" or "patently offensive" communications. Parents 
have control over their children's access to communications 
through interactive computer services. For example, parents 
can deny their child access to the computer; parents can 
supervise their child's use of interactive computer 
services; parents can decline to subscribe to interactive 
computer services until their child is older; parents can 
take advantage of the free screening and blocking options 
available at no extra charge from commercial online 
services; and parents can obtain software (some of it free, 
and most of it for a very modest cost) for their home 
computers to screen material they find objectionable. 
 
 114. Commercial online services such as America Online, 
CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offer 
technologies that allow parents to block their children's 
access to certain online forums and areas where children 
might be exposed to inappropriate content. These online 
services, for example, include a feature that allows 
parents to prevent their children from accessing 
interactive discussion forums (chat rooms). They also offer 
parents the ability to block access to all or portions of 
the Internet, including the World Wide Web and USENET 
newsgroups, based on keywords, subject matter, or specific 
newsgroups. These tools can be configured to block access 
to groups based on any keyword. 
 
 115. In addition, a variety of software providers have 
developed applications to use in conjunction with 
commercial online services, over and above the parental 
control features provided by commercial services, while 
others are designed specifically for direct access. 
SurfWatch, for example, allows parents to block their 
child's access to USENET newsgroups, World Wide Web, 
gopher, and ftp sites with sexually explicit content. When 
activated with a private password held only by a parent, 
SurfWatch completely prevents any user from accessing these 
areas. The service automatically updates the list of 
blocked sites, without any intervention required from the 
user. NET NANNY, another example, contains a dictionary in 
which the parent can enter the names of sites that contain 
sexually explicit or other material. Parents may also enter 
phrases which if transmitted or received will automatically 
disconnect the network. Among other things, the program 
also keeps a log of all activity that occurs on the 
computer, allowing parents to monitor their children's use 
of the computer. 
 
 116. Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and 
WEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to 
block specific sites from access by all users on the 
network, and to track and monitor use of the Internet. 
 
 117. Because the Internet is a global network with 
millions of users, speaker-based content restrictions 
cannot effectively control the availability of materials 
inappropriate for children. The only effective way to 
protect children from inappropriate material on the 
Internet is to encourage the continued development and 
deployment of user-based tools that empower parents to 
control their children's online activities based on the 
parents' views of what is appropriate for their children. 
The products described here, and others like them, provide 
parents these tools, and can do so without the need for 
criminalizing or banning the distribution to adults of 
constitutionally protected communications. 
 
 Speech of the Plaintiffs and the Impact of the Act 
 
 118. The plaintiffs (and the plaintiffs' members, 
subscribers, patrons, and customers) interact with and use 
the Internet, and cyberspace generally, in a wide variety 
of ways, and they are burdened by the Act in an equally 
wide variety of ways. Plaintiffs include content providers 
on the Internet, access providers to the Internet, and 
users of the content on the Internet. The Act burdens 
plaintiffs in all of these capacities. 
 
 119. Plaintiffs who are content providers (or whose 
members or customers are content providers) are expressly 
subject to the Act. Under the Act, anyone who speaks on the 
Internet is a content provider. These plaintiffs do not 
understand what standard for indecency should be used under 
the Act, how the standard applies to the plaintiffs' 
speech, or how numerous other provisions of the Act are to 
be understood and applied. These plaintiffs provide content 
that would likely or possibly be found to be indecent as to 
a young child in some communities. Accordingly, they are 
subject to prosecution under the Act. These plaintiffs will 
either self-censor their speech or will continue to speak 
under the threat of prosecution. 
 
 120. Plaintiffs who are, or whose members are, access 
providers (including "Internet service providers" or 
"ISPs") are expressly subject to the Act. As access 
providers these plaintiffs enable their customers and users 
to use plaintiffs' facilities to link to the Internet. 
Although the Act provides defenses for access providers, 
access providers reasonably fear that these defenses will 
not be construed and applied as broadly as Congress 
intended, and they therefore fear they may be directly 
subject to prosecution under the Act. These plaintiffs will 
continue to provide access under the threat of prosecution. 
 
 
 121. All plaintiffs (and their members and customers) are 
users of the Internet. These plaintiffs and other users 
have a right to engage in ordinary human discourse free 
from the threat of prosecution created by the Act. In 
particular, these plaintiffs and other users have a right 
to receive content that is criminalized under the Act. 
 
 122. Plaintiffs AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ("ALA") 
and 
FREEDOM TO READ FOUNDATION ("FTRF") sue on behalf of 
themselves, their members, who are libraries and librarians 
across the country, and their members' patrons. These 
libraries recognize that the Internet offers their patrons 
a unique opportunity to access information, and many 
libraries provide their patrons with facilities the patrons 
can use to access the Internet. Many libraries also have 
their own World Wide Web sites on the Internet. Thus, in 
addition to providing patrons with access to the Internet, 
where they can access information posted by third parties, 
libraries post their own material on the Internet. Many 
libraries post their card catalogues, post information 
about current events, sponsor chat groups, post textual 
information or art on the library Web site, or post 
licensed online versions of reference and other materials 
from their library collections. Patrons could, for example, 
access the Web site of a library anywhere in the country to 
peruse its card catalogue, review an encyclopedia 
reference, or check a definition in the dictionary. These 
libraries and librarians are injured by the Act. Because of 
fear of prosecution, they will be chilled from posting 
materials on the Internet that might be deemed "patently 
offensive" or "indecent" for minors by some communities. 
Given the global and unrestricted nature of the Internet, 
the lack of precision in the definition of "indecency," and 
the past attempts by some persons to ban literature and 
reference items from library collections, many of ALA's and 
FTRF's members may choose not to post a substantial amount 
of expressive material at all -- material that many adults 
might consider useful for themselves or their own children 
-- rather than risk prosecution for posting material that 
someone in some other part of the nation might deem 
"indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors. As a result 
of the Act, the library patrons ALA and FTRF members serve 
will be limited in the constitutionally protected 
information that would otherwise be available to them on 
the Internet. These plaintiffs (and their members) sue in 
their capacity as content providers, access providers, and 
users of the Internet, and on behalf of their patrons who 
are content providers and users of interactive computer 
services. 
 
 123. Plaintiffs AOL, COMPUSERVE, MSN, and PRODIGY sue 
on 
their own behalf and on behalf of their subscribers. As 
online service providers, these plaintiffs are content 
providers and access providers, and their customers are 
content providers and users of the Internet. These 
plaintiffs create content and make it available both to 
their customers and to the entire world of Internet users. 
They also allow their customers to create content on the 
Internet (including the creation of personal Web pages). As 
speakers, these plaintiffs and their customers are chilled 
by the Act in what they can say on the Internet and on 
their own online services. As access providers, these 
plaintiffs fear they may be at risk of prosecution under 
the Act for what others say. And as users, these plaintiffs 
and their customers are limited by the Act to the ability 
to access only content that is suitable for a young child. 
 
 124. Plaintiff MICROSOFT CORPORATION ("Microsoft") sues 
on 
its own behalf as a content provider, access software 
provider, and user of the Internet. Microsoft provides 
content on the Internet through MSN, on its own Web sites, 
and through postings, messages, and other contributions to 
the Internet. Microsoft's diverse content includes 
compilations of musical, artistic, literary and 
encyclopedic information, news and current events, and 
other content. Some of this content might be considered 
"indecent" or "patently offensive" in some community in the 
nation, exposing Microsoft to the risk of prosecution under 
the Act. As an access software provider, Microsoft sells or 
plans to sell software for accessing and exploring the 
Internet, for establishing and maintaining Internet servers 
and related services, and for creating Web sites and other 
Internet content. As users, Microsoft and its employees are 
chilled in what they can say and the frankness of their 
discussion in communications posted to or transmitted over 
the Internet, and are exposed to a risk of prosecution 
under the Act. Microsoft believes that the defenses 
provided in Section 502(2) of the Act are provided only to 
access providers, not to content providers and/or users, 
and that as to access providers, including access software 
providers, they are inadequate, incomplete, and expose 
Microsoft to potential prosecution under the Act. In 
addition, the chilling effect of the Act on other content 
providers and users of the Internet will damage Microsoft 
by reducing the market for access software, services 
software, and content- creation software. 
 
 125. Plaintiff APPLE COMPUTER, INC. ("Apple") sues on its 
own behalf as a content provider, access software provider 
and user of the Internet. Apple provides content on the 
Internet through eWorld, on its own Web sites, and through 
postings, messages and other contributions to the Internet. 
Because of the vagueness of the Act, Apple is uncertain 
whether some of this content might be considered "indecent" 
or "patently offensive" in some community in the nation, 
exposing Apple to the risk of prosecution under the Act. As 
users, Apple and its employees are chilled in what they can 
say and the frankness of their discussion in communications 
posted to or transmitted over the Internet, and are exposed 
to a risk of prosecution under the Act. In addition, the 
chilling effect of the Act on other content providers and 
users of the Internet will damage Apple by reducing the 
market for Internet software. 
 
 126. Plaintiff COMMERCIAL INTERNET EXCHANGE 
ASSOCIATION 
("CIX") sues on behalf of its member Internet service 
providers ("ISPs") and the customers of their members. CIX 
members typically serve as passive carriers who offer 
access or transmission, and related incidental 
capabilities, for the Internet transmissions of others; as 
such they are clearly covered by the defense of Section 
223(e)(1). However, because of ambiguity in this defense, 
CIX members who operate news servers that carry USENET 
content are uncertain whether they may be held liable for 
the content of others that resides temporarily on members' 
USENET news servers, and is accessed by users from such 
servers. In addition, many CIX members also assist content 
providers in establishing and operating Web sites. In this 
capacity CIX members will often be at risk of prosecution 
under the Act for what others say. Due to fear of 
prosecution, CIX members are chilled from assisting 
providers of valuable content that may be deemed indecent. 
Furthermore, CIX members have a strong interest in the 
continued growth of the Internet as a means of 
communication, and in their subscribers' rights to free 
expression over the Internet. The Act undermines both 
interests. 
 
 127. Plaintiff NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION 
SERVICES, INC. 
("NETCOM") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its 
subscribers. As a provider of Internet access and services, 
NETCOM is both a content provider and an access provider. 
NETCOM's individual subscribers create content on the 
Internet, such as through the posting of personal web 
pages, and make that content available both to their own 
customers and to the entire world of Internet users. As 
speakers, NETCOM and its subscribers are chilled in what 
they can say on the Internet and on their own Internet 
sites. As an access provider, NETCOM cannot control what 
others say, yet faces the risk of prosecution under the Act 
for the speech of others made available through its 
systems. As users of the Internet, NETCOM and its 
subscribers are limited by the Act to accessing and 
producing only content that is suitable for a young child. 
 
 128. Plaintiff OPNET, INC. ("OpNet") sues on its own 
behalf and on behalf of its subscribers. As a provider of 
Internet access and services to subscribers, OpNet faces 
uncertainty as to the applicability of the Act's defenses. 
OpNet also fears that it will be construed to have 
liability for content posted by third parties through its 
systems. 
 
 129. Plaintiff INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION 
("ISA") 
sues on behalf of its members, who include the major 
commercial online services, and other content providers, 
access providers, and users of the Internet. As with the 
online services, ISA's members risk prosecution for 
engaging in, or serving as a conduit for, constitutionally 
protected speech that might be deemed indecent. 
Accordingly, the Act will chill ISA members from exercising 
their First Amendment rights. 
 
 130. Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS 
("AAP") 
sues on behalf of its members, who are content providers 
on, and users of, the Internet. Although rooted in print 
publishing, AAP's members are very actively involved in the 
Internet. AAP's members create electronic products to 
accompany and supplement their printed books and journals; 
create custom educational material on the Internet, 
publishing on and to demand; communicate with authors and 
others, receiving manuscripts, and editing, typesetting, 
and designing books electronically; transmit finished 
product to licensed end-user customers; communicate with 
bookstores and other wholesale and retail accounts; and 
promote authors and titles online. Many of AAP's members 
have Web sites and provide content to the world on the 
Internet. Some of the content provided by AAP's members 
might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for 
minors in some communities (as most of the efforts to ban 
books in communities have been directed at books published 
by AAP's members). 
 
 131. Plaintiff AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER 
EDITORS 
("ASNE") sues on behalf of its members, who are editors of 
daily newspapers throughout the United States that, in 
addition to publications in print form, are now or soon 
will be published in electronic formats available to the 
public on the Internet or through online service providers. 
Historically, the First Amendment guarantee of "freedom of 
the press" has protected newspapers from government-imposed 
content restrictions which, like those in the Act, prohibit 
and punish the dissemination of materials considered 
"indecent" or "patently offensive" with respect to 
non-adult readers. By its terms, however, the Act can be 
applied to the press in the same manner that it can be 
applied to any other person. ASNE members, who make the 
editorial decisions regarding what content will be 
published in the daily editions of their newspapers, are 
concerned that the Act will require them to censor the 
online version of their print editions according to these 
vague and overbroad statutory standards, thereby 
restricting the content of the "electronic" edition of the 
daily newspaper in ways that the First Amendment does not 
tolerate with respect to the traditional hard-copy print 
edition. For this reason, ASNE believes the Act imposes an 
unprecedented but very real threat of unconstitutional 
press censorship which could throttle the Internet's 
potential to greatly enhance the diversity, availability, 
timeliness, quality, and utility of daily newspapers by 
creating a powerful disincentive for publication through 
the use of interactive media technologies. 
 
 132. Plaintiff NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 
("NAA") 
files this lawsuit on behalf of its members, a majority of 
which are daily newspapers in the United States. Approxi- 
mately 175 daily newspapers in North America are currently 
available on the Internet, via commercial online services 
or through local bulletin board services. As content 
providers, newspapers have utilized the Internet to provide 
electronic versions of their printed product. In fact, many 
newspapers provide archives of their print product online. 
As access providers, newspapers have established electronic 
forums for local communities to communicate and to conduct 
business. While the content in newspapers is considered 
neither indecent nor patently offensive when published on 
newsprint, it now may be when published electronically. The 
dual standard imposed by the Act will force newspapers to 
edit out content from publications offered on the Internet 
-- content that is constitutionally protected and not 
subject to challenge in printed form. In many cases, 
newspaper publishers will be forced to edit content 
contained in the archived electronic version of the 
newspaper already placed on the Internet long before the 
Act went into effect. Thus, the Act will seriously infringe 
upon the rights of NAA members to publish constitutionally 
protected news and information. 
 
 133. Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF PUBLISHERS, EDITORS 
AND 
WRITERS ("APEW") sues on behalf of its members, who write 
and publish in print and online. Members of APEW include 
the San Francisco Guardian, the largest and oldest 
independently owned alternative newsweekly in the United 
States; the Internet Press Guild, an unincorporated 
association of writers, authors and journalists who publish 
their works online; the California First Amendment 
Coalition, a nonprofit, public interest corporation whose 
membership comprises approximately 700 individuals and 
organizations, including most of California's daily 
newspapers, many weekly and student newspapers, 
broadcasters, law firms and others; and individual writers 
and editors including Jim Warren, a columnist and advocate 
for open government, and owner and editor of the listserv 
GovAccess; Professor David Farber of the University of 
Pennsylvania; John Quarterman, a columnist and Secretary of 
Matrix Information and Directory Services, Inc.; T. Bruce 
Tober, a freelance writer who researches and writes about 
the Internet for a variety of print and online 
publications; Stephanie Stefanac, Editor of MacWorld 
Online, a monthly trade publication for users of the 
Macintosh computer manufactured by Apple Computer Co.; and 
Rogier van Bakel, a Contributing Editor to Wired Magazine. 
The members of APEW face criminal prosecutions under the 
Act for the online publication of works which some 
communities might find "indecent" or "patently offensive." 
The vagueness of the Act leaves APEW members uncertain 
whether the publication of their works over the Internet 
would be a crime. 
 
 134. Plaintiff SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS 
sues on 
its own behalf and on behalf of its members. The Society's 
membership produces a tremendous volume of content made 
available over the Internet: news stories, special interest 
articles, columns, and opinion pieces, among many others. 
Each year brings a dramatic increase in the importance of 
electronic media as a venue for distributing the news and 
opinion pieces produced by professional journalists. The 
members of the Society fear that their right and ability, 
traditionally protected by the First Amendment, to engage 
in an unfettered marketplace of ideas and expression will 
be severely compromised by the Communications Decency Act. 
In addition, the Society operates a listserve called 
"SPJ-L," a forum among more than 1,000 Internet users (both 
Society members and non-members) from roughly 25 countries 
to discuss and debate primarily journalism-related issues. 
Though, or perhaps because, it typically addresses topics 
of the utmost seriousness and importance for journalists, 
the language used in messages posted on SPJ-L can be 
offensive, harsh, and vulgar. The Society does not edit 
these messages for content. By continuing to provide this 
forum for discussion and debate, the Society risks 
prosecution under the Act. Its members, whose writings and 
other speech would be protected by the First Amendment in 
the context of other media, will be chilled by the Act from 
engaging in constitutionally protected speech over the 
Internet. 
 
 135. Plaintiff HOTWIRED VENTURES LLC ("HotWired 
Ventures") 
sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its subscribers. 
HotWired Ventures operates an online magazine named 
Hotwired. Some of HotWired's editorial content might be 
considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in 
some communities. HotWired features articles containing 
facts about and opinions on popular culture. These articles 
sometimes contain vulgar language and references to, inter 
alia, sexual acts and sexual organs. One area of HotWired's 
editorial focus is cyberspace-related issues, including 
governmental attempts to censor and regulate the Internet. 
These articles sometimes employ vulgar language in 
expressing opinions about this topic, and may contain 
references to, and discussions of, examples of material 
that might be deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent" 
under the Act. In addition, HotWired operates a regular 
section called Piazza, an interactive discussion area where 
members can communicate with each other both through 
asynchronous postings called "threads" and in real time 
"chat rooms," sharing opinions and engaging in outspoken 
discourse which can involve vulgar language and may involve 
sexually explicit subject matter. Plaintiff WIRED VENTURES, 
LTD. ("Wired Ventures") sues on its own behalf and on 
behalf of its subscribers. Wired Ventures publishes Wired 
Magazine, a print publication. Like HotWired, Wired 
publishes articles and short fiction that sometimes contain 
vulgar language and references to sexual acts or sexual 
organs. Many articles published in Wired are also published 
online by HotWired. Thus, some articles that are perfectly 
legal for minors or adults in print form are nevertheless 
banned from the Internet. The Act creates the anomalous 
situation that a publication that is a leading commentator 
on issues and events online may not under the Act be able 
to publish online articles about the Internet that can be 
published in print. HotWired Ventures and Wired Ventures 
believe that the Act would severely infringe their right to 
publish constitutionally protected material and their 
readers' right to choose to read such material. 
 
 136. Plaintiff AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION 
("ABA") 
sues on behalf of its member bookstores (as content 
providers and users) and their patrons (as users of the 
Internet). Although ABA's members are not "adult 
bookstores," many of ABA's members sell materials that deal 
frankly with the subject of human sexuality. Some member 
bookstores have their own Web pages that discuss the 
content of books the stores sell. Most member bookstores 
use the Internet and electronic communications to obtain 
information and excerpts of books from publishers. ABA 
members' right to learn about, acquire, and distribute 
constitutionally protected materials, and their patrons' 
right to purchase such constitutionally protected 
materials, will be seriously infringed by the Act. 
 
 137. Plaintiff FAMILIES AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP 
("FAIC") is a national organization of parents dedicated to 
the proposition that they, not the government, should 
decide what their children should be able see or receive. 
FAIC sues on behalf of its members. As parents, FAIC's 
members are deprived of the opportunity to raise their 
children as they see fit. As users of the Internet, the Act 
violates FAIC's members' rights to receive material 
suitable for adults. 
 
 138. Plaintiff CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT 
COALITION 
("CIEC") sues on behalf of its members as content 
providers, access providers, and users of the Internet. In 
particular, CIEC and its members are injured because the 
Act deprives parents of the ability to determine the 
content their children, including older teenagers, should 
have access to on the Internet. 
 
 139. Notwithstanding the defenses set forth in the Act, 
and the fact that Congress expressly directed courts to 
construe those defenses broadly, plaintiffs reasonably fear 
prosecution under 47 U.S.C. Section 223(d)(1)(B), as 
enacted by Section 502(2), for knowingly permitting their 
services or computers to be used to display indecent 
material in a manner available to persons under age 18, or 
to transmit such material to specific persons under age 18. 
Unless and until the defendants or the Courts make clear 
that these defenses must be broadly construed, there is 
nothing to prevent an aggressive prosecutor, in a 
particularly intolerant community, from bringing a 
prosecution and urging that the defenses be construed more 
narrowly than plaintiffs believe Congress intended. 
 
 140. For these reasons, plaintiffs reasonably fear that 
the defense in 47 U.S.C. Section 223(e)(1) may not protect 
online service providers from criminal conviction for 
indecent expression by third parties when that expression 
is located on the providers' computers (such as when an 
individual computer user posts a vulgar message to an 
online discussion). Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the 
defense may apply only to the extent an online service acts 
as a mere conduit to enable its subscribers to gain access 
to another network. 
 
 141. The speech at issue in this case is fully protected 
by the First Amendment. "Indecent" speech or "patently 
offensive" communications, while considered by some to be 
offensive or sexually suggestive, are not obscene. Such 
speech can have serious literary, artistic, political or 
other merit, and thus has considerable value to adults and 
to society as a whole. 
 
 142. The Internet, and cyberspace generally, carries a 
significant amount of communications, images and text that 
might be deemed inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently 
offensive" for younger children (for example, in elementary 
school), but which would not, under the same community 
standards, be deemed inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently 
offensive" for older minors (for example, in high school or 
early college). The Act makes no distinction between these 
age groups, and would criminalize a university professor's 
distribution -- using the university's interactive computer 
service -- of "indecent" but classic works of literature to 
a 17-year-old freshman. 
 
 143. Dissemination of many of the same communications 
whose dissemination via interactive computer services is 
made criminal by the Act would not be unlawful if 
disseminated by traditional print media (e.g., newspaper or 
magazine) or by using the United States mail. Thus, many of 
the very same communications the Act makes it unlawful to 
make available to minors through interactive computer 
services can lawfully be made available through other 
media, and are, in fact, so available. 
 
 144. Any government regulation of "indecent" or "patently 
offensive" speech may withstand constitutional scrutiny 
only if it both serves a "compelling interest" and is "the 
least restrictive means" to advance that interest, and only 
if the benefit gained from the Act outweighs the loss of 
constitutionally protected rights. 
 
 145. The government has no legitimate, much less 
"compelling," interest in preventing adults from sending or 
receiving "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech. The 
government has no legitimate, much less "compelling," 
interest in preventing older children from sending or 
receiving speech that would only be deemed "indecent" or 
"patently offensive" if communicated to younger children. 
 
 
 146. One legitimate interest the government does have -- 
and the only interest articulated in the Act (Section 509, 
to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 230) -- is to assist 
parents in supervising their children's access to 
expressive materials. The Act does not, however, further 
that interest. Indeed, the Act interferes with that 
interest because parents who decide their children, whether 
7 or 17, should have access to some materials that some 
community might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive" for 
those children are prevented from exercising their parental 
judgment by the Act's blanket prohibition on all access by 
all persons under 18 to all such materials. 
 
 147. Even if the government had a legitimate interest, 
more broadly, in preventing interactive computer service 
access by all persons under 18 to communications that some 
community might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive" to 
them, the Act would not materially further that interest. 
Among other things, communications of foreign origin are 
freely accessible on the Internet, and the United States 
government has no means to prosecute foreign 
content-providers for violation of the Act, or to deter 
such postings. Furthermore, existing statutes and other 
provisions in the Act already prohibit the use of computers 
to disseminate obscenity, child pornography, harassing 
speech, enticing or luring minors into inappropriate 
activities, and other speech that is not protected even for 
adults. 
 
 148. Even if the Act could be viewed as substantially 
furthering a compelling governmental interest in protecting 
minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive" 
communications, it is not the least restrictive means of 
achieving that interest. The screening and blocking tools 
described above achieve that interest far more effectively 
than does the Act itself, and with no adverse impact on the 
constitutional rights of adults. Efforts by government to 
spur the further development of such tools would further 
the claimed governmental interest more directly and 
materially than does the Act. 
 
 149. Even if the Act could be viewed as the least 
restrictive means to further a compelling governmental 
interest in protecting minors from "indecent" or "patently 
offensive" communications, any benefit gained from the Act 
would be far outweighed by the loss of constitutionally 
protected rights of adults, because only some applications 
of the Act will in fact protect minors, but every 
application of the Act will punish or deter speech that is 
constitutionally protected for adults. 
 
 CAUSES OF ACTION 
 
 COUNT 1 
 
 150. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 151. With respect to constitutionally protected 
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or 
"patently offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in 
plain terms and practical effect, bans a substantial amount 
of speech by and to adults, including speech by and to 
plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, patrons 
and customers, in violation of the First Amendment of the 
United States Constitution. 
 
 COUNT 2 
 
 152. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 153. With respect to constitutionally protected 
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or 
"patently offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in 
plain terms and practical effect, unduly burdens and deters 
a substantial amount of speech by and to adults, including 
speech by and to plaintiffs, their members, and their 
subscribers, patrons, and customers, in violation of the 
First Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
 
 COUNT 3 
 
 154. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 155. Sections 502(1) and 502(2) of the Act unduly chill 
and compel self-censorship of constitutionally protected 
speech of plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, 
patrons, and customers, in violation of the First Amendment 
of the United States Constitution. 
 
 COUNT 4 
 
 156. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 157. Section 502(2) of the Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 223(d), 
is fatally overbroad. In particular, it bans, burdens, and 
criminalizes speech that is constitutionally protected for 
adults, and for older minors, restricting both adults and 
17 year-olds to communications appropriate for 7 year olds. 
And it bans, burdens, and criminalizes a much broader range 
of constitutionally protected expression than is 
constitutionally permissible. Accordingly, the provision 
violates the First Amendment. 
 
 COUNT 5 
 
 158. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 159. Any blocking system to be imposed by the content 
provider/speaker would require advance identification of 
those seeking access to a particular Web site, chat room, 
discussion group, or other online forum that might 
potentially contain communications that could be deemed 
"indecent" or "patently offensive" to persons under 18. See 
47 U.S.C. Section 223(e)(5)(B). A requirement of advance 
identification would make it impossible for users to engage 
in constitutionally protected anonymous speech on matters 
of public and private importance. For many users, such 
anonymity is critical to their participation in the speech. 
 
 
 160. For such users, the Act will require them to choose 
between anonymity and losing access to such communications. 
As a result, in many cases, their First Amendment rights to 
read and view constitutionally protected text and images 
will be infringed. 
 
 161. Section 502(2) accordingly violates the First 
Amendment. 
 
 COUNT 6 
 
 162. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 163. Plaintiffs are unable to determine with reasonable 
certainty which constitutionally protected expression 
Congress sought to proscribe in SectionSection 223(a)(1)(B) 
and (d). In particular, the terms "indecent" and "patently 
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards" 
are entirely subjective; as a matter of law depend on the 
context in which the communications arise; are undefined 
and undefinable in the cyberspace context; have entirely 
different meanings depending upon the age of the recipient 
even though the Act treats all minors of all ages the same; 
and give no indication as to which community governs the 
inquiry. In these, and other ways, the Act does not put 
reasonable persons on notice of what communications are 
prohibited. As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, 
and subscribers, patrons, and customers are forced to guess 
at which speech on interactive computer services may give 
rise to criminal prosecution. 
 
 164. The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and "patently 
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards," 
and of other provisions of the Act, and the draconian 
penalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, their 
members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, and 
substantial numbers of other providers of content to the 
Internet, to self-censor far more speech than would in fact 
be prohibited in order to comply with their understanding 
of the Act's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal 
prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionally protected 
expression. 
 
 165. The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and "patently 
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards," 
and of other provisions of the Act, invites arbitrary 
enforcement. 
 
 166. The Act is, accordingly, so vague as to violate the 
First and Fifth Amendments. 
 
 COUNT 7 
 
 167. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 168. Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the defenses under 
the Act will not be construed as broadly as Congress 
intended, and will therefore subject their dissemination or 
facilitation of constitutionally protected speech to 
criminal prosecution and conviction in several significant 
contexts. 
 
 169. The "good faith defense," which is the only defense 
even arguably available to non-commercial content- 
providers, gives insufficient guidance to content-providers 
as to whether their dissemination of constitutionally 
protected speech is prohibited. Plaintiff content-providers 
have no means of ascertaining whether a jury will determine 
that they have taken "reasonable, effective, and 
appropriate actions under the circumstances" to restrict 
minors' access to material that is "indecent" or "patently 
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards." 
Act 502(2), to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 
223(e)(5)(A). 
 
 170. Similarly, service providers who host Web sites or 
other online sites, without controlling content, but on 
whose facilities others' communications reside, reasonably 
fear an aggressive prosecutor will argue, contrary to 
plaintiffs' understanding of Congressional intent, that 
such actions will constitute a "display" of such 
communications under Section 223(d)(1)(B), and that such 
services are not protected by the "access provider" 
defense, even though the service providers' role clearly 
"does not include the creation of the content of the 
communication." Section 223(e)(1). 
 
 171. For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with 
reasonable certainty rely on the access provider defense, 
Section 223(e)(1), to exempt access providers' operation of 
USENET news servers that automatically store content posted 
by users, which remains on their servers for a number of 
days and is available to subscribers. 
 
 172. For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with 
reasonable certainty determine whether the defense, Section 
223(e)(1), applies to ISPs who assist content providers in 
establishing or operating Web pages or other online sites, 
and who, although having no control of content, might be 
deemed to be a "conspirator" under Section 223(e)(2) if 
they knowingly arrange for access to valuable, 
constitutionally protected material that may be deemed 
"indecent." 
 
 173. As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and 
their subscribers, patrons, and customers, are forced to 
guess at whether their activities may give rise to criminal 
prosecution. 
 
 174. The uncertainty of how prosecutors or the courts will 
construe the defenses, the fact that they are only 
defenses, which must be raised and proved after a defendant 
has already been subjected to the humiliation, stigma, and 
expense of a criminal prosecution, and the draconian 
penalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, their 
members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, and 
a substantial number of other providers of content to the 
Internet, to self-censor speech protected by the First 
Amendment in order to comply with their understanding of 
the Act's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal 
prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionally protected 
expression. 
 
 175. The vagueness of these provisions invites arbitrary 
enforcement. 
 
 176. Sections 502(1) and (2), accordingly, are so vague as 
to violate the First and Fifth Amendments. 
 
 COUNT 8 
 
 177. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 
 
 178. Sections 502(1) and (2) of the Act violate the First 
Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their members, and their 
subscribers, patrons, and customers, insofar as they single 
out for special bans or burdens speakers engaged in one 
class of constitutionally protected speech by one specific 
medium, and do not similarly ban or burden speakers engaged 
in other classes of speech, or in the same speech via other 
mediums, without sufficient justification. WHEREFORE, 
plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: 
 
 A. Declare that Sections 502(1) and (2) of the 
Communications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 
SectionSection 223(a)(1)(B), 223(a)(2), and 223(d), are 
unconstitutional; 
 
 B. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendants from 
enforcing those provisions. 
 
 C. Award plaintiffs such costs and fees as are allowed by 
law; and 
 
 D. Grant plaintiffs such other and further relief as the 
Court deems just and proper. 
 
  Respectfully submitted,

<P>In a Dec. 14, 1995 ruling, a Federal District Court upheld the 1992 rules that require cable television systems to carry local broadcast channels. The three-judge panel had previously upheld the "must-carry" law, but the Supreme Court in 1994 asked the district court to determine whether there was enough evidence that local broadcasting was indeed threatened by the growing cable industry. Judge Stanley Sporkin wrote the majority opinion.</P>

I. Introduction 
 
A. Procedural History 
 
This case is on remand from the Supreme Court in Turner 
Broadcasting Co. v.  FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994), with instructions to 
resolve a variety of factual issues that the Court held were pertinent to 
the plaintiffs' contention that sections 4 and 5 of the Cable Television 
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ("Cable act" or 
"act"), 47 U.S.C. Sections 534-35, violate their rights under the First 
Amendment. After extensive discovery yielding a record of tens of 
thousands of pages, the parties have cross-moved for summary 
judgment. For the reasons stated below, I would grant the plaintiffs' 
motion and deny the defendants'.  
 
The contested sections, together with the other provisions of the act, 
permit a commercial television broadcast station to either (1) refuse to 
allow a cable system to carry its broadcast signal unless payment to the 
station is negotiated ("retransmission consent"), 47 U.S.C.  325(b), or 
(2) force an area cable system to carry its signal even if the system 
does not want to ("must-carry"). 47 U.S.C. Section 534. Non-
commercial stations cannot elect retransmission consent, 47 U.S.C. 
Section 325(b)(2)(A), but may demand carriage. 47 U.S.C. Section 
535. In any case of forced carriage, the station to be carried may 
demand one of several specific channel positions on the cable system 
in question. 47 U.S.C. 534(b)(6) (commercial stations); 47 U.S.C. 535( 
)(5) (noncommercial stations).  
 
We originally applied the "intermediate" standard of First Amendment 
scrutiny set forth in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), and 
a majority of this court found the must-carry provisions valid under 
that standard. Turner Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 819 F. Supp. 32 
D.D.C. 1993). The Supreme Court affirmed that the must-carry rules 
were content-neutral and thus properly to be tested under O'Brien's 
standard, but remanded the case to this court for further factfinding 
because of a "paucity of evidence" necessary to discern whether must-
carry met that standard. Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472.  
 
The Court noted that there was a lack of evidence "indicating that 
broadcast television is in jeopardy," as well as a lack of "any findings 
concerning the actual effects of must-carry on the speech of cable 
operators and programmers" and "findings concerning the availability 
and efficacy of constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means of 
achieving the Government's asserted interests." Id. After extensive 
further development of the record it is clear that must-carry is not 
narrowly tailored to address any government interests that are actually 
at stake. The must-carry provisions burden substantially more speech 
than necessary to advance the government's interests, and therefore 
cannot meet the standard expressed in O'Brien and in Turner's specific 
mandate to this court.  
 
B. Overview 
 
This opinion works through a large number of claims and variations on 
claims, as well as detailed facts about the broadcast and cable 
industries. There is obviously a risk in such an enterprise that the trees 
will obscure the forest. Accordingly, I here give an aerial view of the 
forest, confining myself to my central conclusions.  
 
1. The parties agree that there is no threat to the continued viability of 
broadcast television, either now in existence or looming on the 
horizon. Section III.A.1.  
 
2. The defendants have offered several concepts by which to measure 
whether must-carry might advance some supposed governmental 
interest--such as maximizing the number and prosperity of broadcast 
stations. All but one of these (discussed in 13 immediately below) are 
circular, in that, once it is posited that must carry would enhance the 
profits of the stations electing must-carry (a point that seems never to 
have been disputed), it is so obvious that must-carry will advance the 
interest in question that we do not believe the Court would have 
remanded for fact-finding if it had concluded that such interests were 
adequate to sustain must-carry. Sections III.A.2, III.A.3.  
 
3. While the government has pointed to conclusory assertions that a 
significant number of stations have been materially injured by the 
absence of must-carry, (1) I believe that such evidence would be 
relevant only as evidence that there is some threat to the viability of 
broadcast television, a claim defendants emphatically do not make, 
and, in any event, (2) plaintiffs have met these conclusory assertions 
with substantial contradictory evidence. While I would not rule that 
summary judgment can necessarily be granted in favor of plaintiffs on 
the issue, it is absolutely clear, based on the detailed character of 
plaintiffs' evidence, that summary judgment cannot be granted in favor 
of defendants. Section III.A.3.  
 
4. The proposition that persons in cable households have no access to 
broadcast stations except as the cable operator may carry their signals 
is completely unfounded. Nothing about attachment to cable ipso facto 
cuts a person off from broadcast. Every cable household can secure as 
good access to over-the-air television as it had before adopting cable 
simply by (1) retaining or acquiring the sort of antennae that the 
uncabled 40% of households necessarily use, and (2) operating either 
an input selector switch on their "remote" or an "A/B" switch that can 
be acquired at a local hardware store for a trivial sum. Section IV.B.2.  
 
5. To the extent that "fair competition" is threatened by cable 
operators' characteristic monopoly over provision of cable services 
(and in some cases their vertical integration with cable program 
suppliers), the problem is readily cured by regulation under which all 
suppliers of programming not affiliated with an operator (i.e., 
independent cable programmers and broadcast stations alike) are given 
an entitlement to access at a price compensating the cable operator for 
the costs of carriage. Such systems are in place for industries with 
equivalent structural problems, such as gas, electricity, and wire 
telecommunications. Such a system involves far less intrusion on 
speech than must- carry while better serving the interests of fairness 
and signal diversity: As non-broadcast programmers competing for 
access over a cable system are not arbitrarily excluded by a fiat 
entitlement in favor of broadcast, but compete for access on an equal 
footing, the system enables consumers to choose between programs on 
the basis of the usual price/quality factors that they use to make other 
consumer choices. Section IV.B.1.  
 
Accordingly, I now address the Court's mandate to us to assess the 
reality of the harms to be cured and the fitness of the chosen remedy.  
 
II. The Supreme Court's Mandate 
 
Congress's overriding goal in enacting must-carry was to "preserve 
access to free television programming for the 40% of Americans 
without cable." Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2461. The goal is an important 
one, the Court said, because over-the-air television is a principal 
source of information and entertainment for a great part of the nation's 
population. Id. at 2469. In fact, the goal touches upon a government 
purpose of the "highest order," because "the widest possible 
dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is 
essential to the welfare of the public." Id. at 2470 (internal quotations 
and citations omitted). This goal, as the Court saw it, might be 
jeopardized simply by the prosperity of the cable industry: to the 
extent that viewers were lured by cable away from broadcast (and to 
the extent that they abandoned the antennae and other paraphernalia 
necessary to watch TV over-the-air), the potential audience for over-
the-air TV would shrink. Indeed, on these assumptions the potential 
viewership of any station refused carriage by all of the local cable 
systems serving the broadcast station's area would, on average, shrink 
to 40% of what it would have been. This in turn might shrink or at 
least seriously impair the broadcast industry, leaving non-cable 
viewers with materially reduced options. Thus, Congress was dealing 
with a special case of the general problem that competition from a new 
industry may reduce the economies of scale enjoyed by an established 
one, and thereby disadvantage consumers who use the goods or 
services of the established industry.  
 
I also understand the Court to find the congressional action grounded 
in a related but distinct concern, focused more on the "unfairness" or 
anticompetitive characteristics of the cable industry's competition with 
broadcast than on the deprivations that might be suffered by non-cable 
households. Id. The unfair or anticompetitive aspects of cable are said 
to flow from a combination of the cablecasters' exploitation of their 
market power as the sole providers of cable service in their respective 
communities (as they are in the overwhelming proportion of cases/3 
and from their significant degree of affiliation with cable 
programmers, which create and market programs for release over 
cable. Plaintiff Time Warner, for example, is a programmer, producing 
channels such as Home Box Office, and also a cable operator. Its 
pending merger with plaintiff Turner Broadcasting will broaden its tie 
to cable programming.) Here the contention is that cable companies 
might deny broadcast stations carriage on their systems simply to 
protect or enhance the advertising revenue the cablecasters enjoy from 
cable programming and to realize the cost advantages of using 
affiliates' programming. To the extent that must-carry is addressed to 
this problem, as a kind of specialized antitrust regime designed for a 
possible anticompetitive injury, lesser impairments to viewer welfare 
might suffice to warrant government action--compared to the more 
fundamental threat to non-cable households' access to over-the-air TV 
discussed above.  
 
While these interests are important in the abstract, when the 
government seeks to legislate in the area of free speech "it must do 
more than simply posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured. 
It must demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely 
conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in 
a direct and material way." Id. (internal quotations and citations 
omitted).  
 
Thus, the Supreme Court found in Turner that pursuit of the goal of 
saving non- cable households' access to free TV by means that impinge 
on free speech would be permissible only if that access were truly 
threatened--if "the economic health of local broadcasting is in genuine 
jeopardy" --and then only so long; as the government's remedy "does 
not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the 
government's legitimate interests." Id. (internal quotations and 
citations omitted). Similarly, the goal of correcting anti-competitive 
behavior can justify an infringement on free speech only if cable 
companies are in fact engaging in anti-competitive behavior (or if 
Congress could infer a serious risk of such behavior from 
circumstances such as industry structure) and then only if the scope of 
the proposed infringement--in this case, the must-carry regime--
reasonably fits the evil at hand.  
 
This court's first task in applying O'Brien scrutiny, then, is to ensure 
that Congress has drawn "reasonable inferences based on substantial 
evidence" in finding that there is a real threat to the survival of free 
broadcast television. (Section III.A.) In doing so we must accord 
substantial deference to the predictive judgments of Congress, making 
an independent judgment of the facts but not reweighing the evidence 
de novo. Id. at 2471. The court must also evaluate the presence or 
threat of anticompetitive behavior against broadcasting by the cable 
industry. (Section m.B.) Finally, it must consider whether must carry is 
narrowly tailored to address the risk or risks--if any--fount to be real. 
(Section IV.)  
 
Defendants have asked us first to consider only the information before 
Congress as it passed the Cable act. If that evidence were substantial 
enough to satisfy the defendants' burden, then, they argue, we need 
look no further. Memorandum of the United States and the Federal 
Communications Commission in Support of Their Motion for 
Summary Judgment ("Government Brief") at 4. Only if that evidence 
were insufficient might we look beyond. Id. at 5-6. I would reject this 
contention. The Supreme Court has frequently considered evidence 
outside the legislative record in constitutional review of statutes, see 
generally Kenneth Karst, Legislative Facts in Constitutional Litigation, 
1960 Supreme Ct. Rev. 75, never, so far as appears, suggesting that the 
statute would be invulnerable to such evidence if it were supported by 
the legislative record--a record, one suspects, typically put together 
under the aegis of the statute's proponents. In any event, defendants 
have deliberately chosen not even to present the record that was before 
Congress in the usual sense of the term. The materials they have 
assembled and labelled the "Congressional Record" are neither the 
Congressional Record as such nor the documents and testimony 
actually presented to Congress itself. Rather, they have included 
voluminous materials submitted to the Federal Communications 
Commission during the extended period that must carry was before 
Congress. See, generally, Defendants' Joint Statement of Evidence 
Before Congress. But if anything before the FCC was "before" 
Congress, it is hard to see in what sense anything in the world was not 
equally before Congress; all members of Congress have been 
continuously free to consider any fact extant in the world. As 
defendants have made no effort to isolate data that was peculiarly 
before Congress, they have made it difficult or impossible for us to 
apply the principle they invoke.  
 
Defendants cite the Court's statement that without "a more substantial 
elaboration . . . of the predictive or historical evidence upon which 
Congress relied or the introduction of some additional evidence," 
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472 (emphasis added), it was impossible to 
ascertain whether the alleged threat to broadcast television was real 
enough, and read it as saying that must-carry must be upheld if either 
source satisfied the constitutional standard. I think that a strained 
reading, especially in light of the Court's prior reference to the absence 
of any need for Congress to "make a record of the type that an 
administrative agency or court does to accommodate judicial review." 
Id. at 2471. In any case, the data supplied by defendants, taken all 
together, fail to sustain the burden explicitly placed on them by the 
Court of "demonstrat[ing]" the reality of the harms and their "direct 
and material" alleviation by the remedy selected. Id. at 2470.  
 
III. The Posited Interests 
 
A. The Economic Health of Local Broadcasting  
 
The parties strongly disagree over exactly what proposition concerning 
broadcasting's health and viability this court was to test upon remand. 
The congressional finding at issue is whether, "absent mandatory 
carriage rules, the continued viability of local broadcast television 
would be 'seriously jeopardized."' Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2470, citing  
2(a)(16) of the 1992 Cable act, 106 Stat. 1460 (emphasis added). See 
also  2(a)(10) ("A primary objective and benefit of our Nation's system 
of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of 
programming. There is a substantial government interest in ensuring 
its continuation.n) (emphasis added);  2(a)(12) ("There is a substantial 
government interest in promoting the continued availability of such 
free television programming, especially for viewers who are unable to 
afford other means of receiving programming.") (emphasis added); 
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2461 ("the provisions are designed to guarantee 
the survival of a medium that has become a vital part of the Nation's 
communication system, and to ensure that every individual with a 
television set can obtain access to free television programming") 
(emphasis added).  
 
At first glance these congressional assertions and Supreme Court 
reformulations of the government interest seem rather straightforward: 
Congress believed that the continued availability of free local 
broadcast television, a fixture of the American cultural landscape for 
over fifty years, was in serious jeopardy. The defendants have urged 
several other interpretations upon us, however, each entailing a 
contention that is far more modest--and therefore more readily proven. 
One is that the governmental interest identified as substantial in Turner 
is the interest in ensuring that persons without cable have access "to 
the greatest possible multiplicity of broadcast outlets." Reply 
Memorandum of the United States and the Federal Communications 
Commission in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment 
("Government Reply") at 5 (emphasis added). That is, Congress 
intended broadcast to be as successful as possible. Such an interest is 
self-evidently in jeopardy without must-carry, since must-carry will 
financially benefit the stations that adopt it; their resulting gains will 
enhance the survivability of marginal stations and will enable them all 
to invest more in programming. Defendants also offer another analysis 
that is equally self-validating. In this variant they contend that 
Congress's concerns about "continuation" and "survival" of local 
broadcast applied only to those stations electing must carry; the health 
of those broadcast stations not invoking must-carry is claimed to be 
irrelevant to an evaluation of the health of local broadcast.3 A final 
possible interpretation holds that Congress might have intended to 
ensure that viewing areas across the country all enjoyed at least a 
substantial number of broadcast signals; it is small solace to a viewer 
in a location with few or no broadcast signals that viewers elsewhere 
have plenty. I evaluate each of these interpretations in turn, both for 
the likelihood that each is in fact what the Court embraced as an 
objective substantial enough to justify must carry, and for the 
possibility that each is really, rather than merely conjecturally, at stake.  
 
1. The continued viability of broadcast as a whole  
 
Sections 2(a)(10), 2(a)(12), and 2(a)(16) of the Cable Act, quoted 
above, seem to assert on their face that the survival of local over-the-
air broadcast programming is in question. These legislative findings 
emphasize the importance of a continuation of broadcasting and the 
fear that without must-carry "the economic viability of free local 
broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local 
programming will be seriously jeopardized." Section 2(a)(16).  
 
In fact the defendants unequivocally concede, in the briefs and in the 
depositions of their experts, that the evidence they have introduced on 
remand does not show that the health of the broadcast industry as a 
whole is in danger.4 For example, the defendants' distinguished chief 
expert, the economist Roger Noll, observed that he did not think that 
must carry "in the current environment is properly characterized as 
something that has to do with the viability of the entire industry." 
Deposition of Roger G. Noll ("Noll Deposition") at 156. See also id. at 
79 ("I do not believe that over-the-air broadcasting is going to 
disappear because of the absence of 'must-carry'. If that's what the 
sentence ["health of the industry"] is meant to imply, then indeed the 
health of the industry isn't threatened."); Deposition of Harry 
Shooshan, at 79 ("So do you need must-carry to support the health of 
the broadcasting industry as [a] whole today, no."); Deposition of Jack 
N. Goodman at 7 and 129 (agreeing that broadcasting was "fairly 
healthy overall" and as of 1989, "the TV industry as a whole looking at 
gross numbers was not in an economic decline").  
 
The parties offer several means of empirically assessing broadcast's 
health, all tending to vindicate the above statements. First, since the 
mainstay of free commercial television's diet is the sale of airtime to 
advertisers, changes in advertising revenue over time can reveal 
whether broadcast is thriving. Second, changes in the overall number 
of stations can be a rough proxy for whether the national broadcast 
system is in ascendance, plateau, or decline. If the number of stations 
has been holding steady or increasing, even in the period without must 
carry, then it is difficult to see how the industry can be said to be in 
danger. Third, the government suggests that profits for a particular 
segment of the industry--UHF independents--are so abysmal as to put 
the health of at least that segment in substantial doubt. Although this 
latter data set relating to a special industry sector toes not directly 
speak to the health of the industry as a whole, and does not appear to 
be offered as a bellwether for other segments' futures, I treat it here to 
consider whether it calls for any important qualification of defendants' 
concession about the robust health of the industry overall.  
 
(a) Total advertising revenue 
 
Plaintiffs submitted sets of data from 1981 to 1991 from which gross 
advertising revenues for broadcast, cable, and other industries can be 
analyzed, see Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P.'s Corrected 
Appendix to Brief in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment 
Exhibit ("Time Warner Ex.") 12, and defendants submitted the same 
data, together with the consumer price index for the relevant years, see 
Defendants' Joint Submission of Additional Evidence in Support of 
Motion for Summary Judgment ("Defendants' Additional Evidence") 
Vol. VII.W Exhibits 668 & 672. I have derived from them a table of 
broadcast's total advertising volume in constant dollars during that 
period, see App. #1, and a graph, Graph #1. In that ten-year period 
taken as a whole, broadcast's overall gain in gross ad revenue was $3.7 
billion in constant dollars.  
 
After a rise in the early '80s, gross revenues were more or less flat 
from 1986 to 1990, and fell off by about $2 billion from 1990 to 
1991.5 In this pattern there are no extended declines, from which one 
could draw a reasonable inference that the broadcast industry was in 
jeopardy of losing its lifeblood. The only sharp decline is that of 1990-
91, congruent with the 1990-91 recession beginning in the second half 
of 1990, cf. National Economic Trends, Federal Reserve Bank of St. 
Louis, Oct. 1995 at 4; early in 1991 an official of the INTV (the 
defendant trade association representing independent broadcasters) 
attributed the nascent drop to the recession and concluded that "the 
basic fundamentals of independent television are stronger than they 
have ever been." Time Warner Ex. 5 (from TV Digest, Jan. 7, 1991).  
 
The inference that broadcast is healthy, and not materially harmed by 
cable, is further enhanced when the focus is expanded to look at 
advertisers' expenditures on broadcast's competitors. The graph below, 
Graph #2, shows expenditures on cable, broadcast, and broadcast's two 
largest competitors throughout the period (newspapers and direct 
mail), and all other modes put together.  
 
First, it is apparent that in 1988-91, the period of broadcast's modest 
decline of $2.9 billion (in constant dollars), the newspaper industry, 
broadcast's twin heavy in the advertising world, suffered a similar drop 
(actually $4.4 billion). And the total amount spent on advertising 
across all industries dropped by $7.6 billion. In 1990-91, the year of 
broadcast's adversity, newspaper also suffered a distinct drop while 
direct mail and cable were only marginally higher. See App. #1.  
 
Second, defendants have not even hinted at some theory as to how the 
woes of newspapers, direct mail and "other" advertising venues could 
be due to cable, and cable's diminutive status makes any such claim 
implausible. For 1981-91 as a whole, broadcast gained $3.7 billion 
over 1981's revenue to total $19 billion in 1991, while cable showed a 
gain of $1.4 billion, taking its 1981 revenue of $150 million up to total 
$1.55 billion in 1991. While cable's percentage gain was sharp, it 
started from such a low base that its total impact was necessarily 
modest. And if one looks to 1990-91, the year of broadcast's $2,000 
million drop, there is only a $61 million gain for cable--obviously not 
a serious explanation.  
 
Interestingly, trends in cable advertising suggest that must carry has 
little influence on the competition between the two industries for ad 
revenue. One can usefully divide the period into two phases, 1981-85, 
during which the FCC's must-carry regulations prevailed, and 1985-91, 
the period after they were invalidated.6 In the first period the cable 
industry's annual ad growth averaged $149 million per year; in the 
second--when according to defendants cable was exploiting must-
carry's absence to leverage ad revenue from broadcast cable's average 
growth was lower in constant dollars, $137 million per year. This 
picture is confirmed when one puts the matter in terms of market share 
and thus abstracts away the effect of overall changes in advertising 
volume. Cable's market share increased at the rate of 0.14% per year 
with must-carry ('81-'85) and 0.13% per year without it ('86-'91). App. 
#1. Alternatively, as the Commission's so called Century's must-carry 
rules were in effect from June 10, 1987 to December 11, 1987, see 
Defendants' Additional Evidence Vol. VII.N Ex. 338,7 one might 
divide the period into 1981-87 and 1988-91. Cable's average annual 
gains in those periods were, respectively, $131 million and $158 
million, the latter reflecting 1989's unusually high increase of $241 
million.  
 
I note at this point the defendants' argument that cable pulled its 
punches in the must carry gap period, strategically refraining from 
drops or refusals to carry in order to defuse the political pressure for 
must-carry. Indeed, some officials in the cable industry trade 
association actually exhorted cable companies to refrain from changes. 
See, e.g., Defendants' Additional Evidence Vol. VII.N. Ex.321 (letter 
from NCTA president urging cable operators to minimize channel 
repositioning; ". . .a sensitivity to the political climate needs to be 
shown . . criticism."); id. Ex. 330 ("By minding our social and political 
P's and Q's, we will be better equipped to deal with the touchy 
situation that will result with all of these deregulatory events 
happening at the same time."); id. Ex.333 (after D.C. Circuit struck 
down FCC's must-carry rules in Century, NCTA president states that 
"[i]n the interim, and having in mind that this decision may well be 
appealed, we will advise our members generally to behave as if the 
carriage rules just struck down were still in effect."); id. Ex. 344 
Viacom cable executive insists that local systems seek central approval 
before dropping a broadcast station "[s]o that we do not become an 
example of demonstrated abuse and thereby the justification for 
reregulation").  
 
But I find these statements an inadequate reason to distrust the record 
before us. First, defendants offer not a clue as to how the cable 
industry as an aggregate would overcome obvious collective-action 
problems. While the industry as a whole might benefit from such 
strategic self-restraint, one individual cable system out of more than 
10,000 could hardly expect that its snipping off a broadcast station or 
two would be likely to incur congressional wrath in the form of 
legislated must-carry. Second, to the extent that the constitutionally 
fatal aspect of must-carry is the absence of evidence of any visible 
threat to broadcast, then the rules would become constitutional the 
minute the industry was visibly threatened. Thus, under Turner, and 
assuming no other constitutional infirmities, the cable industry will 
have exactly the same incentive to hold back as it had in the 1985-91 
period. Assuming the industry has the capacity to coordinate its self- 
restraint (as defendants must), it will have to do so into the indefinite 
future in order to avert enactment of a valid must carry.8  
 
(b) Number of broadcast stations 
 
Another way to measure the health of the broadcast industry is through 
the number of stations. More stations presumably translate to more 
choices for viewers of over-the-air television. The Supreme Court 
found it significant that at the time it reviewed the case there was no 
evidence to show that "local broadcast stations have fallen into 
bankruptcy, turned in their broadcast licenses, curtailed their broadcast 
operations, or suffered a serious reduction in operating revenues as a 
result of their being dropped from, or otherwise disadvantaged by, 
cable systems." Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472. The first two inquiries 
(bankruptcies, abandonments of licenses) address the total amount of 
broadcasting available throughout the nation, and an analysis of the 
number of broadcast stations over time suggests why the government 
on remand has not offered an overall count of the number of stations 
that have fallen into bankruptcy through noncarriage (relying instead 
on "evidence before Congress" pertaining to twenty-three independent 
stations, Plaintiffs' Joint Response to Defendants' Proposed 
Undisputed Facts ("Plaintiffs' Fact Response") 1 65). Indeed, 
defendants have conceded their inability to show that any station, 
commercial or public, turned in its license in the period without must-
carry. See Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Joint Statement of 
Undisputed Facts Established by the Record ("Defendants' Fact 
Response") Paras. 57, 59. I have generated the following graphs, 
Graph #3 and Graph #4, depicting the change in the number of 
broadcast stations from 1981 tO 199l and more broadly from 1953 to 
1994. They are based on data provided in the Declaration of Stanley 
M. Besen ("Besen Decl."), Ex. 5, which defendants have not contested 
in this respect.  
 
These data show that the number of stations grew from 1,065 in 1981 
to 1,532 in 1994, with a net growth in stations every year. In fact, the 
average net growth of 41 stations per year during must-carry's absence 
from 1986-91 more than kept pace with the average growth of 39.4 
stations per year from 1981-85, with must-carry in effect. If one takes 
1981-87 vs. 1988-91 as the appropriate periods, the net annual 
additions of stations are 46 and 30, respectively. Although this 
suggests a lesser growth rate in the must-carry gap, annual growth of 
2-3% in number of supplying firms is hardly anemic for a mature 
industry.9 Over the whole period 1981-91, the broadcast industry 
witnessed a 39% expansion of its total number of stations. Congress 
could not have reasonably inferred from this that the industry was in 
decline or even in jeopardy of any material decline. Although the data 
on station increase comes from the Television and Cable Factbook by 
way of plaintiffs, defendants do not dispute the increase. Rather, they 
turn to the weakest subset of stations--UHFs--and point to a decline in 
the growth rate in the period without must-carry. Graph #4 presents the 
UHF stations broken out from total stations.  
 
Besen Decl. Exs. 5-6. In the four-year period 1981-85, with must-
carry, there was an average of 39 new UHF stations per year, as 
against an average of 35 new UHF stations per year in the five-year-
period 1986-91, without must-carry. From this the defendants 
conclude that "this stunted growth of broadcast stations takes on 
greater significance when contrasted with the vast potential for 
broadcast television to expand." Memorandum of the United States 
and the Federal Communications Commission in Support of Their 
Motion for Summary Judgment ("Government Brief") at 36-37 
(emphasis added). 10 But the decline in growth rate is so modest, and 
the persisting actual growth so robust, that there can be no real claim 
that the numbers prefigure an eventual leveling off of the actual 
number of stations on the air waves, much less a decline.  
 
(c) Profits 
 
The parties sharply dispute the relevance of different data sets that 
arguably relate to the prosperity of broadcast stations. The plaintiffs 
call cash flow margins the "predominant industry yardstick" and point 
to near-universal positive cash flow margin figures for stations both 
with and without must-carry. See Plaintiffs' Fact Response 1 51. 
Defendants object that since many stations can have low (but still 
positive) absolute cash flows but high cash flow (percentage) margins, 
absolute cash flow data may be deceptive.1l See Defendants' Fact 
Response 1 67.  
 
The defendants, by contrast, direct us to median profits--a number that 
plaintiffs question, because, as they observe, it is subject to 
manipulation as station owners may deplete profits by payments to 
themselves in the name of salaries or perks. It is, moreover, a function 
of accounting conventions that may not capture essential 
characteristics. But one need not select among the parties' respective 
analyses, because even the defendants' favorite metric seems to afford 
them little support. They point to the dismal 1991 figures for UHF 
independent stations, which as a class are the least prosperous of TV 
stations. See Opposition of NAB and INTV to Plaintiffs' Motions for 
Summary Judgment ("NAB Opposition") at 774. They show pre-tax 
profits in dollars by percentile as follows:  
 
PERCENTILE..........25%...................50%............  
 
090)...........419, 613 
 
Defendants' Additional Evidence VII.W, Ex. 669. In other words, the 
median station was showing a pre-tax loss of over $400,000 in 1991. 
Although the defendants do not offer similar figures for a succession 
of years, which might enable one to discern patterns with some clarity, 
they do supply comparable numbers for 1987, for half of which there 
was no must carry and the other half must-carry under the "Century 
rules," i.e., those in effect in the last half of 1987 and invalidated by 
the D.C. Circuit in late 1987. See Century Communications Corp. v. 
FCC, 835 P.2d 292 (D.C. Cir. 1987), clarified, 837 F.2d 517 (D.C. Cir. 
1988). Putting both figures together one gets:  
 
Percentile..........25%.........50% (median).....75%  
 
1987............(2,542,540).....(1,207,525)....74,802  
 
1991............(1,748,130).......(401,090)...419,613  
 
Defendants' Additional Evidence Vol. VII.W, Exs. 669, 670. In other 
words, in the period from the end of the Commission's must-carry 
rules to the year before the onset of congressional must-carry, the 
profit picture of broadcast's poorest relations improved markedly. 
Average pre-tax profit of the strongest 25% more than quintupled, 
losses of the median station fell by more than two thirds, and losses of 
the very weakest 25% fell by about a third. This improvement in the 
profit picture occurred, it should be recalled, in a period when the 
overall number of stations grew by over 8%, and the number of UHF 
stations grew by over 14%. One might expect per-station profit to fall 
in an era of such expansion--at least where, as was the case, aggregate 
advertising revenues were stable or declining. (See Graph #1.) Indeed, 
the chairman of the INTV observed that part of the problem of a 
softened advertising market for these stations was that there are "too 
many hogs at the trough." Time Warner Ex. 5 (from TV Digest, Jan. 7, 
1991). See also Id. (investment analyst observes that some individual 
independent stations may not have done as well because of the 
increase in the total number of stations); Defendants' Additional 
Evidence Vol. VII.M, Ex. 288 at 38 explains that from 1986 to 1988 
aggregate viewership of independent stations increased but revenues 
dropped, finding an explanation in "the increasing number of 
independent stations, which kept viewership per independent station 
low.").  
 
While the parties have offered no explanations of the low profitability 
of independent UHF stations as a general matter, the defendants' 
offerings on profitability do nothing to sustain their burden of 
identifying the absence of must carry as a threat to broadcast's overall 
health.  
 
If, then, the question squarely put before us by the Supreme Court--
"whether the Government has adequately shown that the economic 
health of local broadcasting is in genuine jeopardy and in need of the 
protections afforded by must carry, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 247  is, at it 
appears on its face, a question about whether the broadcast industry is 
in danger of failing or in peril of a downward spiral, the answer from 
both parties, and that indicated by the evidence, is No.  
 
2. Maximum possible expansion of broadcast  
 
The government claims that the Act's retransmission consent 
provisions, 47 U.S.C. 325(b), through which a broadcast station can 
opt to forego must-carry and instead withhold its carriage from a cable 
company until some form of payment is negotiated, "alone evidence 
Congress's understanding that the broadcast industry as a whole would 
not perish absent the must-carry rules." Government Reply Brief at 3. 
The government accordingly offers a different interpretation of 
promoting the "continued availability" of broadcast programming: that 
the substantial interest to be tested is whether, without must-carry, 
broadcast can expand as much as with it.  
 
Thus, extrapolating from the Court's remark, "Likewise, assuring that 
the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources is a 
governmental purpose of the highest order," Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 
2470, defendants assert that must-carry can be upheld if appropriate to 
ensure that those without cable have access "to the greatest possible 
multiplicity of broadcast outlets." Government Reply at 5 (emphasis 
added). I would reject this analysis. I do not read the Court's statement 
as meaning that we are to find that lack of must-carry impairs the 
industry's health merely on the basis of evidence that its presence 
would bring about a larger industry, measured by number of stations, 
or a more prosperous one, by any metric. If the Court meant that 
Congress had a substantial interest simply in increasing the prosperity 
of a significant number of TV stations (and thus, depending on FCC 
licensing policy, possibly increasing the overall number), it surely 
would have declared in Turner that Congress could reasonably infer 
such an effect; it would not have thought a remand necessary.  
 
Nor do I accept defendants' alternative 
formulation--that the Court meant us to examine whether must-carry 
would, at the margin, tend to produce a "higher quality" broadcast 
industry. The argument that must carry would do so is simple. 
Increased potential audience implies an increased audience, and an 
increased audience implies both a greater ability to spend on 
programming (because of larger revenues) and a greater willingness to 
do so (because each dollar invested in program quality will, with a 
larger audience, yield a larger return. See Government Brief at 38-39; 
Declaration of Roger G. Noll ("Noll Declaration")  36 ("[C]able 
carriage is positively associated with station revenues and with 
improvements in programming"). Again, the intuitive obviousness of 
these results precludes the possibility that the Court remanded the case 
to us to discover them.  
 
Defendants alternatively invite us to look to the total number of 
stations allotted to broadcast by FCC fiat, arguing that Congress might 
have been concerned by a growth in the number of vacant channels; 
indeed, the number of vacant UHF channels increased from 157 to 198 
between June 30, 1989 and June 30, 1991. Government Brief at 37 
n.81. But, as detailed above, the number of operating UHF stations 
increased substantially in that period, so that the claim based on vacant 
channels rests solely on the government's own decisions to increase the 
number of theoretically available channels.12 Even if the spectrum 
were filled with broadcast stations, however, the government 
hypothesizes further possible growth of the broadcast industry, since 
total broadcast viewership could grow even if the number of stations 
remained constant. Here the baseline against which the government 
measures the need for must carry is not (1) broadcast in the absence of 
anticompetitive behavior by cable, nor even (2) broadcast in the 
complete absence of the cable industry, but rather is (3) the maximum 
broadcast audience growth, including the component that cable has 
affirmatively made possible by enabling broadcast signals to be carried 
farther and more clearly than they could over the air:  
 
The extensive cabling of the nation extended the reach of UHF stations 
because it overcame a substantial part of the "UHF handicap." UHF 
stations had difficulty accessing all of their potential audience over the 
hour because of the inferior propagation characteristics of the UHF 
band .... When viewers subscribe to cable, the UHF stations were 
received with greater clarity, and sometimes on a valued lower channel 
number. As a result, they reached a wider audience, inducing more 
stations to enter the industry .... Noll Declaration 1 40. See also 
Declaration of James N. Dertouzos ("Dertouzos Declaration") 1 31 
Local broadcasters are likely to benefit from an expanded audience due 
to enhanced signal reception and access to wider geographic markets). 
Thus, because cable enables its subscribers to receive "broadcast" 
signals of higher quality than they could otherwise obtain, the 
government argues that "cable carriage expands the reach of local 
broadcasters and contributes to the health of local broadcasting." 
Corrected Memorandum of the United States and the Federal 
Communications Commission in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for 
Summary Judgment ("Government Opposition") at 91 (emphasis 
added). The government employs parallel reasoning to defend the 
must- carry provision that forces many cable operators to carry UHF 
stations on a lower- numbered, and thus apparently more prominent, 
channel position than the UHF station's own on-air position. See 47 
U.S.C:. 534(b)(6); Defendants' Joint Submission of Congressional 
Record in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment ("Defendants' 
Record") Vol. I.R, Ex. 85, CR 11503 (UHF station chafed at having to 
negotiate with a cable system for a valuable lower channel, absent 
must carry's forced positioning provision). These theories claim, then, 
that it is not enough for broadcast to be a net gainer from the presence 
of cable (though, to be sure, defendants offer no econometric evidence 
indicating the net effect); the harm to be cured is simply loss of the 
benefits that must-carry would afford when added to the other benefits 
afforded by cable in its absence.13 This "harm" of course is real by 
definition, and thus, again, cannot be what the Supreme Court intended 
for us to assess on remand.  
 
3. The health of stations electing Must-carry  
 
Defendants appear to propose another concept of the interest to be 
advanced by must-carry, namely, the economic health of those stations 
that elect must-carry. They argue that the assessment of harm from 
must-carry's absence must be confined to broadcast stations that would 
presumably be denied carriage or dropped absent must- carry since 
they currently rely upon it.14 F or example, to counter plaintiffs' 
evidence concerning gross broadcast advertising revenue across all 
stations from 1985 to 1991, defendants respond that these numbers 
include the revenue of network affiliates, which "are likely to be 
unaffected by the must-carry regime." Defendants' Fact Response 1 62. 
See also id. 173 ("[A] general statistic referring to the entire industry is 
irrelevant, given the marginal financial condition of UHF independents 
(the stations most often denied carriage absent must-carry)." Indeed, 
first the defendants reject statistics indicating the health of network 
affiliates because they "generally opted for retransmission consent, and 
the stations most at-risk absent must carry are UHF independents and 
public stations," id. 1 65. They then reject statistics regarding the 
health of UHF independents in general: "[I]t is not the health of the 
average independent station that is at issue here, it is the ability of 
stations that have been denied carriage or repositioned to provide the 
same quality and quantity of programming ....". Id. at 66.  
 
By narrowing the field of stations to the most vulnerable, the 
defendants attempt to identify stations whose financial health is truly 
hanging in the balance--those for which the added subsidy of free 
cable carriage could arguably make a critical difference. Again, the 
unremitting growth in the number of even UHF independent stations 
both with and without must-carry, see section III.A.1.(b) above, and 
the improved profit picture for them on defendants' own data from 
1987-91, see section III.A.l.(c) above, belie the notion that significant 
numbers of stations are in jeopardy or that must-carry could greatly 
affect their fate on the margin one way or the other. All defendants 
have demonstrated is that, all else being equal, forced cable carriage is 
at least of some benefit to the broadcast stations so carried. But this 
alone can vindicate Congress's interest only if we take the valid 
interest to be, circularly, maximum possible expansion for broadcast. 
See section III.A.2. above.  
 
Defendants attach great importance to the Court's observation in 
Turner that the government's claim that must-carry was necessary to 
protect the viability of broadcast television rests on two propsitions:  
 
(1) that unless cable operators are compelled to carry broadcast 
stations, significant numbers of broadcast stations will be refused 
carriage on cable systems;   
 
and (2)       that the broadcast stations denied carriage will either 
deteriorate to a substantial      degree or fail altogether. 114 S. Ct. at 
2471.  
 
A natural reading of this passage is that the Court reasoned that must-
carry would be justified if its absence would cause the deterioration or 
failure of so many stations that one might infer a risk to the viability of 
broadcast television. Defendants reject any such reading, disdaining 
(as we have seen) any burden to show that broadcast television was in 
any jeopardy at all. Rather, they argue that evidence showing that the 
absence of must- carry materially injured a lot of stations would in 
itself show the requisite need for must- carry. Accordingly they point 
to statements "before" Congress (i.e., either made to a congressional 
committee or made to the FCC and deemed before Congress), in which 
individuals associated with the broadcast industry or with particular 
stations made statements asserting harm to a station from the absence 
of must-carry. See, generally, Defendants' Joint Statement of Evidence 
Before Congress.  
 
Plaintiffs have sought to respond as to each station identified by 
defendants in briefs or evidence as having suffered--142 commercial 
television stations (out of a total of 1138 in 1992) and 141 public 
stations (out of 368). See Appendices to Time Warner Reply 
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment. The 
number 283 is surely not insignificant, so that, if (1) defendants are 
right that the Court used "significant" in a sense completely 
disembodied from the "viability" of broadcast, and (2) the assertions 
"before Congress" were valid, defendants would prevail on this point. I 
have already explained why I believe the first necessary condition is 
not satisfied; I now comment briefly on the implausibility of the 
second.  
 
In its Broadcast Station Rebuttal Time Warner meticulously recites 
evidence relating to the nearly 300 stations that at one point or another 
defendants claimed were victims of the absence of must-carry. For 
example, one station said to have "gone dark" because of being denied 
carriage appears actually to have gone dark for the very understandable 
reason that its transmitter was hit by a tornado. See Time Warner 
Broadcast Station Rebuttal at 134-35. Moreover, despite the station's 
travails with cable, its owners found a buyer at the price of $1.5 
million (licenses, of course, are issued free) in May 1990--the depths 
of must-carry's absence. Id.  
 
If defendants' station-by-station rebuttal is accurate, see Time Warner 
Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, 
Appendices A & B, for a summary, scarcely any of the 283 alleged 
victims has been seriously jeopardized by the absence of must-carry. 
Defendants make some attempt at a station-by-station refutation, see 
Response of the United States and the Federal Communications 
Commission to Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P.'s 
Broadcast Station Rebuttal, while continuing to point to the assertions 
"before Congress." See Government Reply at 12 n.17. I have not 
examined the station-by-station data in enough detail to say whether, 
under the standards of Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc, 477 U.S. 242, 
247-52 (1986), summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs would be 
proper on this issue. I can, however, unequivocally say that plaintiffs 
have at a minimum put the individualized victimization accounts into 
material dispute, so that if defendants' reading of the Court's 
"significant numbers" passage is correct, a trial would be necessary to 
apply that reading.  
 
In considering whether the data on drops and carriage refusals tend to 
demonstrate a threat to "the continued viability of local broadcast 
television," Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2470, I note that the defendants 
repeatedly characterize the stations under threat of drop--i.e., those 
likely to elect must-carry--as marginal. See, e.g., Noll Deposition at 
17- 18; id. at 60 (absence of must-carry would lead to dropping of 
stations of "relatively low audience rating"); id. at 221-22 (the less 
popular a station the more important is must- carry to its welfare); id. 
at 307-08 (nothing in his declaration or testimony says cable systems 
will drop the "more popular or popular over-the-air televisions 
stations"); Government Reply at 10 ("these same stations are 
particularly weak financially"); Government Brief at 35 (discussing 
"marginal financial position of these stations"). Indeed, they stress 
their experts' observations that the audience appeal of the stations' 
programs (whether measured in number of listeners or intensity of 
preference) will not be enough to seriously enhance a cable operator's 
subscriber revenue (via more subscribers or higher fees). See, e.g., 
Noll Deposition at 663; id. at 142 (drop of third noncommercial outlet 
or weak UHF station will not affect decisions to subscribe); id. at 166 
(similar); Second Declaration of Tom Meek 1 34. Plaintiffs have 
offered evidence that the average cable subscriber was served by a 
cable system carrying local broadcast stations accounting for about 
97% of television ratings in non-cable households. Besen Decl. at 41; 
Plaintiffs' Joint Statement of Undisputed Facts Established by the 
Record ("Plaintiffs' Facts") 1 9. While defendants bristle at this 
statistic, and suggest that there are defects in the type of Nielson data 
that support it, Defendants' Fact Response 11 7-9, they offer no 
alternative figure. And their own contentions--as to the marginality of 
electing stations and as to the improbability that they would beef up 
subscriber revenues--implicitly recognize that what is at stake without 
must carry is a diminutive share of total television viewing.  
 
We also note that defendants had claimed that without must-carry 
cable operators often substituted even more poorly-rated cable 
networks for broadcast stations that admittedly were already-poorly-
rated. Their first attempt at demonstrating such a trend (presumably to 
show an anticompetitive motive in such a substitution) neglected to 
account for the fact, all else being equal, a cable network carried by a 
given system will have lower ratings than a parallel broadcast station 
on that system because the broadcast station is additionally available to 
the 40% of viewers in the area who do not subscribe to cable. See 
Plaintiffs' Facts 1 176, 177. In endeavoring to correct for this, 
defendants' expert Tom Meek tried to compare (as we read his 
declaration) the ratings on cable of the least popular cable programs 
with the ratings on cable of broadcast stations added pursuant to must 
carry, and found that the must-carry stations had ratings higher than 
many of the low-ranked cable programs. See Reply Decl. of Tom 
Meek at 11-12. But this comparison ignored the issue of what fraction 
of cable systems carried the cable programs being compared with 
must-carry broadcasting. Government counsel acknowledged at oral 
argument that the comparison still suffered apples/oranges problems, 
saying in defense that they had used the data they had. See Tr. 167; 
Defendants' Fact Response 1 177. Defendants now assert only that 
there is no evidence that the must-carry programs "are less popular" 
than the marginal cable programs that they replace. Id.  
 
Ultimately the parties seem to agree that, for both marginal cable and 
broadcast stations, operators' decisions on what to air will often not 
rest on either's meager ratings. The First Amendment right at stake is 
the operators' freedom to air what they choose--broadcast or cable--
having to answer only to their subscribers, not the government. The 
risk that cable operators may exercise that right for anticompetitive 
purposes may well permit government intervention, see section m.B 
below, but in the absence of a threat to broadcast's general viability 
there is no other ground permitting government veto power over a 
cable operator's selection of scrvices.  
 
4. Survival of broadcast across all geographic markets  
 
A congressional interest in preserving access to free television 
programming for the 40% of Americans without cable, see Turner, 114 
S. Ct. at 2461, might be thought in jeopardy if areas with only a 
handful of stations were threatened with the loss of just one. In such a 
situation, the harm to a diversity of viewpoints--at least for the people 
in those areas--would be far graver, and therefore worthy of remedial 
intervention, than if carriage drops and refusals, and their adverse 
effects, were concentrated in busy television markets.15 Or, to look at 
the other side of the coin, it would be hard to call the local broadcast 
unhealthy, or to find its health at risk, if one found that all localities 
were enjoying the benefits of a significant number of stations.  
 
As it turns out, though, if there is any pattern to carriage refusal, it is 
concentrated in the most crowded broadcast markets. See Defendants' 
Fact Response 1 11. For example, the government cites an FTC study 
which found that the proportion of local broadcast stations carried fell 
as the number of available local signals increased. Government 
Opposition at 15. The study found that when three local signals were 
available, all were carried; when nine local stations were available, 
about six were carried. Id. Thus, those areas with the fewest broadcast 
stations have the greatest proportion of voluntary carriage and the least 
need for forced damage. It is only those areas in which the airwaves 
are relatively busy--areas in which concern about the health of local 
broadcasting would be at a minimum--that cable carriage becomes an 
issue. Where stations are few and the loss of only one theoretically 
significant, the defendants' figures indicate that cable carries the 
signals voluntarily. Further, from 1981 to 1992 not one local television 
market out of the 209 geographic ADIs experienced a decline in the 
number of broadcast stations available. Besen Decl. Etc. 11. From 
1987-92, the years of falling advertising revenues and the absence of 
must-carry, the Boston ADI dropped from 15 to 13 stations (it had 9 in 
1981) and four other ADIs lost a single station. The other 204 ADIs 
had either the same or more stations. Id. The continued overall 
broadcast station growth during what has been claimed to be the 
industry's darkest hour, then, cannot be said to conceal failures in 
certain geographic areas that are offset by growth in others.  
 
Summary 
 
I conclude that there is insufficient evidence from which Congress 
could conclude that "broadcast television is in jeopardy," Turner, 114 
S. Ct. at 2472, under any interpretation of that phrase consistent with 
the Court's analysis. Only if the government's interest is taken to be the 
maximum growth of broadcast, or enhancement of precisely the 
stations that would elect must carry against the will of cable operators-
-intepretations of Turner's mandate that are manifestly implausible--
can the posited harms be viewed as real rather than conjectural.  
 
B. Unfair Competition 
 
The defendants assert two related bases for inferring that cable 
operators will make "unfair" or anticompetitive carriage decisions at 
the expense of broadcasters. Both depend on the characteristic 
monopoly of cable franchisees over provision of cable in their areas. 
The first theory looks at the combination of that market power with the 
vertical integration between operators and cable programmers, and 
argues that vertical integration will lead operators to unduly favor their 
affiliates' programming over that of broadcasters. The second theory 
relies solely on the typical cable operator's monopoly over cable, and 
argues that various features--ranging from cable operator hopes of 
predation to artificial distortions in the treatment of advertising--will 
thwart competition and deny broadcast consumers the access to 
broadcast that they would enjoy in a perfectly competitive market. I 
here address these claims one by one. I conclude that--at least without 
trial--it is impossible to preclude the possibility of a risk of 
anticompetitive behavior, the correction of which would constitute a 
substantial interest. This would not prevent me from granting summary 
judgment for plaintiffs, however, for I find in section IV that must-
carry is plainly not a remedy narrowly tailored to any such risk.  
 
1. Anticompetitive behavior due to vertical integration  
 
Defendants argue that a vertically integrated firm controlling a 
monopoly bottleneck may not make efficient decisions about what to 
let through the bottleneck, unduly favoring the products of its own 
affiliates. Thus, they say, unaffiliated suppliers (here creators of 
programming, including broadcasters) will be disadvantaged in trying 
to reach the market on the other side of the bottleneck. For purposes of 
this analysis I accept not only the undisputed point that cable operators 
characteristically have a monopoly over provision of cable services in 
their areas, but also the more questionable proposition that cable 
operators have a monopoly over the provision of video signals to 
households subscribing to cable. As a person who subscribes to cable 
does not, in fact, ipso facto lose access to over-the-air television, but 
can continue to reach it merely by operating a so called "A/B" (or 
input selector) switch and by maintaining whatever antenna may be 
necessary (see section IV.B.2 below), the latter proposition would 
require additional evidence. I nevertheless indulge it in favor of 
defendants for these purposes.  
 
Defendants' bias argument runs as follows. First, a significant number 
of cable operators are affiliated with programming networks. See, e.g., 
Government Reply at 30- 31 (saying that as of 1994 operators serving 
more than 70% of cable subscribers held vertical interests in cable 
programmers); Plaintiffs' Fact Response 1 88; see also id. 11 25, 26 
(indicating that cable operators have ownership interests in 39 of 68 
nationally delivered cable video networks). Second, to a 100% 
vertically integrated operator/programmer the real marginal cost of 
using nits own" program is close to zero: it costs almost nothing to 
make another copy (any stated charge is a wash on the firm's collective 
books), and use by the affiliated cable operator does not in any way 
limit the program-producing branch's opportunities to sell identical 
copies of the same program to other operators. The cost of purchasing 
similar programming from an independent network would be positive, 
even though the independent network can also make extra copies of its 
already-produced programming at near-zero cost. All else being equal, 
this appears to tilt the balance arbitrarily in favor of the affiliate's 
programming. For example, as between programming produced by an 
affiliate that would boost subscriber revenue by 100 and that produced 
by a non-affiliate that would boost revenue by 120 but was priced at 
30, the cable operator might well choose the affiliate's programming 
over that of the unaffiliated competitor,16 with a possible loss to 
consumer welfare that is not offset by any cost-saving anywhere else 
in the economy. See Noll Decl. 1 17; cf. Dertouzos Decl. 1 6.  
 
As just mentioned, the competing independent programmer's marginal 
cost of allowing distribution by any one cable operator appears at first 
blush also to be zero. But a programming firm selling all its products 
at marginal cost would not recover its total costs. To stay in business 
the independent must secure some sort of positive price, so it will 
necessarily charge such a price. That accounts for the hypothesized 
price of 30 in the example above. The careful reader, at this point, may 
ask why the unaffiliated supplier does not simply lower its price to this 
firm to somewhere between 20 and zero. At any such price both parties 
will gain. The unaffiliated supplier will make more money than 
without the sale, and, since its product contributes 20 more to revenue 
than does the inside product, the vertically integrated cable operator 
will also improve its position. Defendants do not explicitly address this 
question, but I will try to supply a response. Clearly the transactions 
costs of the hypothetical bargain may often be high. The outside 
supplier will typically not have reliable information on the extra value 
that its product contributes over and above the integrated firm's inside 
product, so the relationship invites bluffing that may obstruct a 
bargain. Moreover, the outside firm will reasonably fear getting a 
reputation for undue willingness to cut its prices; if it keeps getting 
chiseled down to the environs of marginal cost (i.e., zero), its hopes of 
being a profitable enterprise will fade.l7  
 
Before complicating the example with advertising (an additional 
feature of defendants' analysis), one should reexamine this account. 
Because by hypothesis the marginal cost of producing all copies after 
the first one is about zero for any producer (regardless of integration), 
one knows that the program-producing industry will not survive at all 
on a stand-alone basis unless firms sell above marginal cost. Yet, as 
soon as one recognizes this, one is saying that the conditions for 
efficiency, in a first-best sense, cannot possibly be satisfied. One 
should, therefore, be extremely cautious about concluding that the 
complications added by vertical integration will necessarily make 
matters worse. See R. G. Lipsey & R. Kelvin Lancaster, The General 
Theory of the Second Best, 24 Rev. Econ. Stud. 11, 11 (1956); cf. 3 
Phillip Areeda & Donald Turner, Antitrust Law 1 725c (1978) (vertical 
integration of successive unregulated monopolies likely to improve 
welfare).  
 
Defendants press a particular version of the integration-bias argument 
that focuses on cable operators' quest for advertising revenues. This, of 
course, is the setting of most interest to broadcasters, because, by 
tradition at least, they gain their revenue from ads, not from sale of 
programming.18 For example, in some cases programmers sell 
programs that include ads; the programmers, not the operators, are paid 
for the ads by advertisers on the basis of expected viewership. (In fact 
networks and operators make varied arrangements for allocating the 
returns from advertising.) See Noll Decl. 1t 15-17, 23, 24. A fully 
integrated system will reap the revenues for ads sold by its 
programming division if its conduit division runs the program (and 
thus will count them as a plus factor in selecting programming), 
whereas the system would not reap equivalent revenues received by an 
unaffiliated program supplier for ads contained in that supplier's 
programs. Id.  
 
In a case where the affiliate's program would yield the network 100 in 
subscription revenue and the non-affiliate's 120 (i.e., the same numbers 
as in the earlier example), and the outside alternative is offered at 30, 
and in which the affiliate's program would generate 20 in ad revenue 
and the non-affiliate's 30, the system is likely to choose the affiliate's 
program because this allows it both to acquire the program at no cost 
and to capture the ad revenue associated with the program. But by 
hypothesis the affiliate's program still has less viewer appeal (as 
measured by subscribers' willingness to pay and to submit to 
advertising).  
 
This second example appears to add nothing material to the earlier one. 
Ad revenue is largely a function of viewership (see, e.g., Noll Decl. 1 
36), itself a function of program popularity, and is thus simply one 
way of realizing the return on the creation of programs. In this latest 
example the outsider's program is more attractive than the inside 
alternative (by 20), yet the firm may prefer the inside product. The 
main difference is that both products, besides adding 100 and 120 to 
subscriber revenues, are so appealing that they will do so even though 
the viewers must submit to substantial advertising.  
 
But the ad revenue's apparent enhancement of the inside product's 
advantage is an illusion. The outsider, in the hypothetical, has simply 
withheld a portion of the product's value, just as would an auto dealer 
who offered a car for sale without wheels. As moderately alert 
customers of the auto dealer would take that into account in agreeing 
on a price, so would our integrated firm. The range of possible 
bargains between the parties is essentially unchanged. Thus, if the 
outsider agrees to allow the integrated firm to reap the ad revenue, 
both of the parties can (as before) improve their positions by any sale 
in the range of zero to 30. (E.g., at 10, the integrated firm gets 120 in 
subscriber revenue and 20 in ad revenue, minus 10 paid the outside 
supplier, thus doing 10 better than if it used its own programming.) If 
the outsider insists on keeping the ad revenue, i.e., is already 30 ahead, 
then the potential gain to the integrated programmer/operator from 
buying outside drops by 30, so that it must be paid something between 
30 and zero.19  
 
There is considerable question whether the alleged "bias," once 
analyzed, is actually a social problem at all. The orthodox thinking on 
vertical integration by an  
 
The Cable Act added a complication by requiring that a must-carry 
station's material be used without change and by barring any payment 
to the cable operator for carriage. See 47 U.S.C. SS 543(b)(3), 5351); 
see also part m.B.2(a) below. But as Congress cannot invoke a 
problem created by its remedy as a justification for the remedy, these 
complications are not pertinent. unregulated monopoly is that such 
integration normally adds nothing material to the distortions implicit in 
the monopoly itself. A monopoly is able to achieve a single monopoly 
profit on its sales, and its ownership of resources supplying an input 
normally has no bearing on the extent to which the price of its final 
product will exceed the competitive price. See 3 Areeda & Turner, 
supra., 1725. Indeed, vertical integration between a monopolist and an 
imperfectly competitive upstream industry may reduce the economic 
distortions attributable to the monopoly, as the integrated firm will 
base its output decisions on true calculations of the marginal cost of its 
inputs, whereas a separate monopolist would base its decisions on cost 
figures inflated by the independent supplier's selling at prices 
reflecting its need to earn a profit on a stand-alone basis. Id. 1 725c. 
Here, however, in view of the special importance Congress attached to 
increasing the range of programming suppliers able to reach the 
viewers, see, e.g., section 2(a)(6) of the 1992 Cable act ("There is a 
substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a 
diversity of views provided through multiple technology median), the 
evidence might support a finding that the alleged "bias" constituted a 
market distortion in whose possible correction there might be a 
"substantial governmental interest."  
 
The plaintiffs contend that any such bias of cable operators in favor of 
affiliates is entirely theoretical and that the evidence shows that cable 
operators have in fact displayed no bias against broadcasters. They 
point to the finding of defense expert Dertouzos that one study 
supplied no statistically significant evidence that a vertically integrated 
operator is less likely to carry a broadcast station than an unintegrated 
one. See Defendants' Fact Response 1 102; Dertouzos Rebuttal Decl. 
11 l(a), 3-11. The defendants, however, point to instances suggesting 
that the bias is at work, such as the overwhelming adoption of a TCI 
network by TCI systems, as opposed to radically fewer adoptions by 
non-affiliates. Government Opposition at 21; see also Noll Decl. 11 
18-19 (describing studies finding that vertically-integrated cable 
systems tend to favor their own affiliates in deciding which channels to 
carry).  
 
Moreover, because of the background fact of government regulation of 
cable's rates, vertical integration poses a clear risk to a substantial 
interest. A vertically integrated monopolist subject to price regulation 
may be able to disguise its true costs by slipping ones that in reality 
belong to the upstream market into its apparent costs in the regulated 
monopoly sphere, thereby inducing the regulators to raise its rates. 
Since regulation is presumably aimed at holding the monopolist's 
prices below the profit-maximizing level, this price increase nets the 
firm additional profits (i.e., the net gain per sale will not be fully offset 
by lost sales). See 3 Areeda & Turner, supra, 1 726; Roger Blair & 
David Kaserman, Antitrust Economics 290 (1985). Further, on a 
widely held view, the firm is likely to use these profits to undercut 
unaffiliated upstream suppliers. See Daniel F. Spulber, Deregulating 
Telecommunications, 12 Yale J. Reg. 25, 60 (1995)./20 To put this 
into the cable context, the argument would be that vertically integrated 
cable companies would gain an unjustifiable competitive edge on 
unaffiliated programmers (including broadcasters), to the detriment of 
viewers' ability to choose quality programming.  
 
Thus I conclude that Congress could reasonably believe cablecasters' 
vertical integration with programmers constituted a problem--
especially if one takes into account the special congressional concern 
for "promoting a diversity of views" and the price- regulated status of 
cablecasters--for which it might seek a fix.  
 
This finding in favor of defendants should also apply to must-carry for 
public television stations. Here the analysis is slightly different, 
because public stations do not rely on "ads" in the conventional sense 
of the term. Apart from their government- provided subsidies and 
foundation grants, they depend for revenue on viewer contributions. 
But, as is true for commercial television and its ad revenue, the yield in 
contributions is necessarily dependent on the number of viewers and 
the intensity of their preference for the programs. There is no reason to 
doubt that, insofar as there is a risk that cable operators may 
disadvantage unaffiliated programmers for the reasons discussed 
above, parallel reasons apply for public television, to the possible 
detriment of public stations and their viewers.  
 
2. Anticompetitive behavior due to local monopoly regardless of 
vertical integratlon  
 
Defendants also argue that even 
non-vertically-integrated cable operators will unfairly discriminate 
against broadcasters. Such discrimination might happen in two ways, 
the first grounded in broadcast's potential as a programming provider 
to cable, the other in broadcast's competition with cable as an alternate 
video conduit. First, because cable programmers can bring "ad avails"-
-blank spots within a program into which the cable company can insert 
ads--to the carriage negotiating table while broadcasters cannot, cable 
operators will, as defendants see it, improperly favor the cable 
programmers. See Noll Decl. 1 24. Second, broadcast stations and 
cable operators are in competition. By denying carriage to a broadcast 
station, an operator can limit the station's audience, thereby reducing 
its potential to earn ad revenue. To the extent that ad revenue dries up, 
the quality of the station's programming may suffer, and some viewers 
may switch to cable. At the limit the station will be driven out of 
business, again to the potential profit of the cable operator. I address 
these issues in turn.  
 
(a) Independent programmers might outcompete broadcasters for 
access  
 
There are a variety of ways in which the manager of a television 
conduit--broadcaster or cable operator--might choose what 
programming to air. Some programs or complete channel feeds will be 
so popular that conduits will be willing to pay for them. Both cable 
operators and broadcasters do so frequently, and the parties agree that 
programming purchase costs turn out to be a large part of the typical 
broadcaster's budget. Plaintiffs' Fact Response 1 68. Since broadcasters 
are programmers, they are also in the business of selling programming. 
Broadcasters nowadays do so regularly--whenever a broadcast station 
demands retransmission consent before permitting a cable operator to 
air its programming. The conduits expect to cover the costs of program 
acquisition by various means. Cable operators may expect to cover 
them through enhanced subscriber revenue, either by an increase in the 
number of subscribers or an increase in per subscriber fees or both. 
They also may use the programming value to garner ad revenues; part 
of the transaction would be for the programmer to offer the operators 
blank spaces in which to insert their own ads--spaces known in the 
trade as "ad avails." As broadcasters have no ability to prevent viewers 
from tuning in (apart from scrambling techniques), they of course get 
their return solely in the form of enhanced ad revenues.  
 
Other programming is not so directly popular. In such cases the 
programmer might offer to pay the conduit instead of the other way 
around. In transactions of this sort the conduit makes its money from 
these very payments, typically (perhaps always) foregoing the 
opportunity to earn money by additional ad revenues. (By hypothesis 
these programs are ones unlikely to generate extra subscribers or 
higher fees per subscriber.) The record contains several undisputed 
examples of broadcast station conduits that earn their money through 
such alternatives to traditional advertising sales. Some stations, for 
example, are paid lump sums or commissions to carry home-shopping 
feeds, or are paid by religious organizations to carry religious 
programming. See Time Warner Broadcast Station Rebuttal at 33 
(KMCI paid by the hour for programming blocks by Home Shopping 
Network); id. at 60 (KTFO leased its daytime operations to Tulsa 
Christian Television); id. at 78 (LeSea Broadcasting Stations--similar); 
id. at 85-86 (similar; purchaser of all of WRDG's air time, "Jack 
Rehburg Ministries," found its own sources of funding, i.e. donations, 
dried up under some combination of lost cable carriage and the onset 
of televangelist scandals).  
 
Both sides concede that the broadcast stations most likely to avail 
themselves of must-carry have comparatively low ratings. Such 
stations are unlikely to be sought after by cable operators, especially 
because on the margin they cannot be easily expected to affect cable 
subscribership or rates. See Noll Decl. 1 19; Noll Rebuttal Decl. 1 20. 
Comparatively low-rated cable programming might have an edge over 
a broadcast station because the programmers offer the operators ad 
avails. Defendants argue that these ad avails may be especially 
appealing since Congress has regulated the rates cable operators may 
charge their subscribers. Thus ad revenue has a possible advantage--
both in availability and in freedom from regulatory hassle--not shared 
by higher subscription fees.22 But broadcasters cannot offer ad avails 
at all. This is true, so far as the record shows, solely by the terms of the 
commercial must-carry rules themselves; 47 U.S.C. 534(b)(3) requires 
cable systems to run unaltered copies of the broadcast signals they 
carry. See Memorandum of National Cable Television Association Inc. 
in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 17. 
Therefore, all else being equal, the possibility of added opportunities 
to sell ad time gives low-rated programming offered by independent 
programmers an appeal to operators that low-rated broadcast 
programming cannot match.  
 
The parties expend much energy arguing whether ad revenue is 
important to cable, and whether, if now not very important, it is likely 
to become much more so shortly. Because the quantitative importance 
of ad revenue is immaterial in the view I take of the matter, I assume 
throughout, in favor of defendants, that ad revenue is of great and 
rapidly growing importance to cable.  
 
To whatever extent broadcasters are competitively hobbled by 
534(b)(3)'s implicit ban on ad avails, however, they cannot rely on it to 
justify the constitutionality of the rest of the Act. The government 
surely does not have a "substantial interest" in remedying a 
competitive distortion that arises entirely out of a detail in its own 
purportedly remedial legislation.  
 
Further, advertising space is simply one form of the currency that 
changes hands as cable operators negotiate carriage deals with content 
providers. Just as a home- shopping channel might offer an outright 
payment or a commission on sales to every conduit that will carry it 
(either broadcast station or cable operator), presumably the 
disadvantaged broadcaster can simply find another way to sweeten the 
pot when competing for a carriage slot against a cable programmer 
offering ad avails. At least it could do so if Congress had not 
simultaneously barred such side payments. See 47 U.S.C. 535(i). For 
example, but for the congressional ban on such payments, a 
broadcaster could offer a cable operator some share of the ad revenue 
increment expected as a result of carriage on the cable system, and 
thus compete for space on cable on a par with independent operators. 
The defendants' chief expert explicitly acknowledged this parity. See 
Noll Deposition at 555, 10-05. Thus, insofar as broadcast stations 
suffer a competitive disadvantage arising out of their failure to offer ad 
avails, it arises entirely out of a provision in the remedy Congress has 
enacted and cannot possibly constitute the "substantial interest" that 
Congress was seeking to correct.  
 
Accordingly, defendants' primary expert concluded--and the record 
contains no material evidence to the contrary--that with reference to 
this supposed market imperfection the only genuine difference 
between an independent program network and a broadcaster was that 
the weakening of a broadcaster harms non-cable households through 
reduced revenue and reduced investment in programming. See id. at 
105-06. But, as the discussion of the viability of the broadcast industry 
has shown, the Court believed that the interest in programming for 
noncable households could serve as a potential  justification for must- 
carry (apart from actual distortions of the competitive market) only if 
the absence of must-carry would leave broadcast's capacity to serve the 
nation's uncabled 40% seriously impaired, a standard not met by 
defendants' evidence.  
 
I would grant summary judgment for plaintiffs on defendants' theory 
that cable poses an illegitimate competitive threat to broadcast by 
virtue of independent cable programmers' supposed (but plainly 
mythical) advantage over broadcasters in seeking access to viewers via 
cable. The facts show that Congress could not have so found.  
 
(b) Broadcasters as conduit competitors with cable  
 
The defendants claim that a cable operator will have an incentive to 
weaken broadcast competition in general through carriage denials, 
regardless of whether the broadcaster is replaced with a cable network. 
See Dertouzos Reply Decl. 1 23. The theory here is that even 
broadcasters that would otherwise be worthy of carriage in the short 
term (since their presence would enhance the cable system's appeal to 
its subscribers) will be denied carriage in an attempt by cable operators 
to strangle them. Cut off from the incremental ad revenue, marginal 
broadcast stations will decline (disabled from investing more in 
programming) and, at the limit, die. Especially if there is a separate 
market for local advertising on limited-viewership television 
(presumably with lower prices to reflect to smaller audience), then 
destruction of the marginal broadcasters will redound to the benefit of 
the cable operator. Even in the weaker version, which contemplates 
carriage denials causing only lower station revenue and therefore fewer 
program quality enhancements, cable is seen to profit "unfairly" in that 
its carriage denials induce marginal non-cable viewers to switch to 
cable, impairing the broadcasters' competition for ads.  
 
The difficulties with this as a serious justification for must-carry are 
legion. First, the cable operator must share many of the benefits of this 
hypothetical policy with competing broadcast stations: so long as they 
are around, the disappointed viewers of the station denied carriage can 
still turn to other broadcast stations (not to mention book stores, 
libraries and unnumbered other sources of diversion and instruction), 
rather than to cable. Cf. Noll Deposition at 78-79 (nIt seems to me that 
if there's three UHF independents in a city and one is dropped and two 
aren't, the two that aren't dropped benefit; the one that is dropped is 
harmed, and I don't understand how to add that up to be health of the 
[broadcast] industry.")  
 
Second, given the defendants' concession that must carry is generally 
of interest solely to the more marginal stations, Defendants' Fact 
Response at 65, 73, because a cable operator would not dare to incur 
subscriber wrath by dropping stations as popular as local network 
affiliates, id. 1 62, the likelihood of the policy's yielding many 
conversions to cable seems remote.  
 
Further, so far as inflicting fatalities on broadcast stations is 
concerned, the hypothesized policy depicts the cable operators as 
absolute Canutes: as the tide of broadcast stations rises, including even 
stations of the least prosperous class, see Graphs #3 & #4, it must take 
an invincibly obtuse operator to persist in trying to push it back--at 
least if persistence is costly, as it would be wherever adding the 
broadcast station would add to net revenues. And there would be such 
an addition to revenues, in the absence of artificial congressional 
impediments, whenever the additional revenue expected from carrying 
the broadcast station--in subscriber fees, broadcast station payments or 
the yield from ad avails--exceeded those on offer from independent 
programmers proposing to fill equivalent channel capacity.  
 
Finally, the problem identified appears ubiquitous, so that if it is 
enough to sustain forced carriage it must be enough to sustain a wide 
range of forced speech. The Washington Post would presumably gain 
at the margin from the demise (or starvation) of its competitors; yet, 
despite the enormous economies of scale that it enjoys (and a huge 
local market share, cf. Business News Two, Investor's Business Daily, 
March 28, 1995, A1), I doubt that Congress could legitimately force 
the Post to carry whole pages of the Washington Times, with the 
Times then able to obtain higher ad revenue from advertisers who 
would see their ads freely circulated to Post readers as well.  
 
Nonetheless, because the defendants offer some anecdotal evidence of 
operator predation (resolution of which might require trial), see, e.g., 
Plaintiffs' Pact Response 11 447, I will assume that summary judgment 
cannot be granted in plaintiffs' favor on defendants' claim that a kind 
of competitive spite may induce cable operators to deny carriage to 
some broadcast stations.  
 
IV. Narrow Tailoring 
 
I have found some of the assertions of harm offered by the government 
to justify must-carry to be either pure conjecture (and largely refuted 
by the defendants' own experts and data), and some so self-evident that 
if the Supreme Court regarded them as adequate it would not have 
remanded for additional factfinding. In the former category rests the 
possibility that the future of free television as a whole or even in a 
particular geographic market is threatened. All parties and the data 
now appear to agree that no such threat is shown. See sections III.A.l 
and III.A.4 above. In the latter category are defendants' contentions 
that must carry was intended as a way to (1) maximize broadcast's 
wealth in the interest of increased expansion and quality of 
programming or (2) assist whatever stations might elect it. See sections 
III.A.2 and III.A.3 above.  
 
It follows from these latter definitions of the harm that must-carry is 
by definition narrowly tailored, just as the harm itself exists by 
definition. Thus, confronted with the suggestion that narrower must-
carry rules, such as those struck down in Century Communications 
Grp. v. FCC, 835 F.2d 292 D.D.C. Cir. 1987), might be a better 
tailored alternative, the defendants answer, inexorably, that if the 
Century rules didn't help as many stations as the 1992 Act (and they 
didn't), it follows by definition that they are not viable alternatives. See 
Government Reply at 40. Similarly, since the defendants posit an 
interest in enhanced broadcast programming, which as explained 
above could logically be expected to flow from the revenue 
enhancements that must-carry would generate, it follows as a matter of 
logic that any solution that simply gives all would-be suppliers of 
cable programming an entitlement to carriage for a fee remunerating 
the cable operator's costs is inadequate: such a system would 
contribute less money to broadcast stations' coffers. Government Reply 
at 43-45 (dismissing leased access because it would "defeat must-
carry's purpose to the extent that [a broadcaster's] investment in 
programming must be curtailed to pay for carriage"). If the defendants' 
self-validating concepts of "harm" are indeed what the Court intended 
us to examine, must carry fits them so perfectly that, as a matter of 
definition, it must meet the requirements of narrow tailoring as well.  
 
On the other hand, if I am right that the alleged threat to "access to free 
television programming for the 40 percent of Americans without 
cable," Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2461, was conjectural rather than real, the 
question whether must carry constitutes a narrowly tailored remedy for 
injury to that "access" is moot.  
 
Of the two remaining asserted harms by cable operators to the 
broadcast industry--those distinct from a claim that broadcast is in 
general ill health--I have assumed that Congress might reasonably 
have found a problem to be fixed. First, I assumed that the affiliation 
of a cable operator with a cable programmer, especially in an 
environment of rate regulation, could result in an unjustifiable 
competitive edge for the vertically-integrated firm against unaffiliated 
programmers, including broadcasters. See section m.B.1 above. And I 
assumed enough evidence that cable operators might conceivably be 
willing and able to inflict predatory harm on broadcasters that I would 
not necessarily grant summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the 
issue. See section m.B.2(b) above.  
 
I turn, then, to the narrow tailoring step of the analysis under O'Brien, 
canvassing the evidence introduced on remand to answer the questions 
contingently put to us by the Court, examining "the extent to which 
cable operators will, in fact, be forced to make changes in their current 
or anticipated programming selections; the degree to which cable 
programmers will be dropped from cable systems to make room for 
local broadcasters; and the extent to which cable operators can satisfy 
their must-carry obligations by devoting previously unused channel 
capacity to the carriage of local broadcasters." Id. at 2472. I then 
consider the availability and efficacy of "constitutionally acceptable 
less restrictive means" of achieving those asserted interests among the 
legitimate justifications for must carry that have been proven or 
assumed real: preventing anticompetitive behavior by vertically-
integrated cable firms and preventing predatory behavior against 
broadcasters by cable in general. Id.  
 
A. Must-carry's Burden to Operators' and Non-Broadcast 
Programmers'    Speech  
 
The record shows that there are currently 128 national and 40 regional 
cable networks (i.e., programming channels available to cable 
systems), and the parties agree that the number is expected to grow. 
Defendants' Fact Response 1 107. It is also undisputed that as of 
October 1994 an estimated 86% of cable systems had a maximum 
capacity of less than 54 channels. Id. 1 112. An overwhelming 
majority of cable systems therefore had over a hundred programming; 
sources available (not counting broadcast stations), far exceeding what 
they could carry. Indeed, a study by plaintiffs found that in October 
1994 cable systems serving about two-thirds of the industry's 
subscribers had no available, usable channel capacity. Id. 1 l1Ci. The 
defendants offer a survey which shows that 51% of cable systems have 
no excess capacity. Id.; Plaintiffs' Fact Response 1 193. These surveys 
are not necessarily in conflict; the first deals with number of 
subscribers served and the other with the raw number of cable 
operators affected.)  
 
Must-carry is thus most commonly elected--by defendants' data, 51% 
of the time, all else being equal--in an environment of scarce cable 
channels. Defendants' additional data show that in 1993 must-carry 
stations added as a result of the Cable Act accounted for between 1.4% 
and 6% of the channels offered by sampled systems, and total must- 
carry stations accounted for between 7% and 13% of channels. 
Declaration of John L. Peterman Ex. 1. The average percent, weighted 
for subscribership, was 2.4% for added stations and 12.28% for total 
stations. Id. E x. 2. This forced carriage--whether in the form of a 
required addition to a cable system (requiring the operator to eliminate 
programming) or a mandatory retention (preventing the operator from 
adding new programming)--is a tangible burden on operators' 
speech.23  
 
Defendants implicitly claim that the First Amendment harm to a 
programmer denied carriage in the first instance because of a cable 
system's full capacity (partially thanks to must-carry) is somehow 
more remote than the harm experienced by a carried programmer that 
is dropped in order to make room for forced carriage of a broadcast 
station. While the former situation may be more difficult to prove, it is 
no less a real manifestation of the effects of must-carry. Accordingly, 
it follows that, except to the extent that there is excess channel 
capacity (a matter we reexamine below), every benefit to a broadcast 
station (through being added or being sheltered against removal) is 
matched by an injury to a cable operator (in lost choice and possibly in 
lost revenue) and programmer (through being dropped or, thanks to a 
broadcaster's must-carry entitlement, not added).  
 
I note various conflicting claims by the parties as to the comparative 
value of their respective program material, accompanied by 
disclaimers of the relevance of such data. See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Facts 11 
9, 176, 177; Defendants' Fact Response 11 8, 9. We think the 
disclaimers are sound. The value measures are necessarily rather 
crude: as each side points out, the fact that a program has a lower rated 
viewership than another cannot be a basis for congressional 
preference.24 Accordingly, in the systems of constrained capacity, 
which by any measure constitute at least half the market, benefits are 
balanced by burdens--except that congressional choice has supplanted 
that of cable operators seeking to maximize their net return.  
 
Defendants point to an ancillary benefit of must carry: some fraction of 
the revenue enhancement enjoyed by a carried broadcast station will 
redound to the uncabled 40%'s benefit in the form of additional 
program investment. Of course a parallel ancillary benefit results from 
carriage of a cable programmer: just as added revenue both enables a 
broadcast station to invest more in programming and gives it added 
incentive to do so, so too must any additional revenue enjoyed by a 
cable programmer as a result of carriage. Nothing in the record 
supplies a clear reason for supposing one ancillary benefit more 
valuable than the other. Except to the extent that broadcast survival is 
at stake, as it is not, the purpose in such a wealth transfer is elusive.  
 
Even looking simply at the class of programmers forced to "go dark" 
to make room for new must-carry stations in areas in which they had 
previously been carried through cable, the harm from must-carry is 
substantial. For example, Time Warner added 240 broadcast stations to 
its systems because of must-carry and had to drop programming on 7+ 
channels as a result. Defendants' Fact Response 1 117. This is an 
obvious and direct burden on the First Amendment rights of both the 
programmers affected and the cable operator, who had freely 
contracted with the programmers to air their speech.  
 
As indicated, 49% of cable systems have open capacity. It does not 
follow, as defendants would have us believe, that such systems suffer 
no injury from must-carry. Capacity is added at a cost, and one may 
presume that cable operators add capacity only where they suppose 
that they can profitably use the capacity. See Noll Dep. 258-59 (excess 
capacity is a short-run phenomenon, arising from fact that new 
capacity is added in "discrete lumps" that are not instantly filled). 
When a retailer holds goods in storage, or a manufacturer holds parts 
in inventory, their existence presumably contributes to the business 
despite the absence of immediate active use.) Even for a system that 
generally keeps a few channels open, presumably for flexibility in 
responding to carriage opportunities, must-carry is a constraint, 
inevitably hastening the day when it must invest in additional capacity. 
Thus, defendants' evidence that the must-carry duty now embraces 
only a weighted average of 12.28% of the capacity of cable systems, 
and that that percentage will likely shrink as capacity is added, see, 
e.g., Defendants' Fact Response 11 19-201, in no way answers the 
point that any station carried involuntarily blocks the cable operator's 
intended use of the channel, forcing it to make changes in its 
anticipated, if not current, programming selections. If in the future 
fiber optics or compression truly make functionally limitless channel 
capabilities available at no extra marginal cost, must- carry's burden 
would certainly be less along this dimension. But that day has simply 
not arrived.  
 
The channel positioning requirements of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 
534(b)(6) and 535( )(5), further demonstrate the intrusion into 
operators' carriage decisions and programmers' speech. For example, 
the Act offers commercial stations electing must- carry a channel 
position either the same as their on-air positions or on positions 
previously occupied on July 19, 1985, or January 1, 1992, whichever 
they prefer. Since cable systems' capacities were much lower ten years 
ago, this provision tends to permit stations whose forced carriage in 
1985 had necessarily given them a coveted low-numbered channel slot 
to insist upon that slot once again. The defendants put great weight on 
channel position within a system. See, e.g., Government Brief at 18-
22. Channel position, they claim, is of great value because viewers 
apparently tend to "graze" in the lower channels, not even bothering to 
look among higher-numbered ones (a zone known as "Siberia," 
Defendants' Record Vol. I.R Ex. 85 CR 11503-04). WTOG, which is 
on the air as channel 44, thus decries as an adverse repositioning a 
cable system's decision to demote it from channel 9 to channel 25--
even though that is clearly preferable to its over- the-air position. 
Defendants' Record Vol. I.R. Ex. 83 CR 11478.  
 
Moreover, according to one UHF station president, "[e]xisting cable 
technology prevents many [cable] subscribers from accessing cable 
channels above 13 without a converter." Defendants' Record Vol. I.R 
Ex. 85 CR 11503-4. For those cable subscribers, forced repositioning 
of a cable programmer's channel to a higher-numbered station will 
simply eliminate the channel from view. Those same viewers can use 
their television sets to receive broadcast channels above 13. Affidavit 
of David J. Large ("Large Affidavit") 1 15; Defendants' Record Vol. 
I.R. Ex. 85 CR 11504. In such cases, then, a UHF station can reach the 
viewer's set twice--through broadcast on its own over-the-air channel 
and through forced carriage on a lower cable channel--while the 
demoted cable channel will be unattainable.  
 
The congressional mandate on repositioning casts the defendants' 
contentions about the projected future expansion of cable channel 
capacity in a special--and dim--light. Even the most optimistic claims 
of expansion must, by defendants' own accounting, be tempered by the 
fact that as cable expands, the only place it can grow is in the wastes of 
post-channel-13 Siberia. Large tracts of the lower "grazing areas," and 
any real or imagined boost to ratings that positioning there provides, 
are claimed by the government for allotment to the broadcasters--even 
ones that cannot obtain such favorable positioning within the 
government's own broadcast spectrum allocation--and to that degree 
are barred from use for cable programming.  
 
In sum, on systems of clearly constrained capacity the benefits that 
must-carry affords broadcasters are matched by burdens on cable 
operators and programmers. In systems whose capacity is not fully 
occupied by active channels, must-carry interferes with the operators' 
purpose in maintaining channels available for use. Although increasing 
channel capacity will over the years tend to diminish the value of the 
losses inflicted on cable operators and programmers, it will never do 
so entirely, because the marginal opportunity cost of channels will 
presumably never fall to zero and because broadcast stations' 
repositioning entitlements will force alternative cable programming 
into high-numbered, less valued channels.  
 
B. Less Restrictive Alternatives 
 
Assessing the availability of less restrictive alternatives to must carry 
helps determine the reasonableness of the "fit" between forced carriage 
and the fulfillment of any substantial interests established by 
defendants. Because in the first step of the analysis under O'Brien I 
have only assumed two such interests--the interests in preventing 
anticompetitive behavior by vertically-integrated cable firms and in 
preventing predatory behavior against broadcasters by cable in 
general--I focus mainly on fitness to those purposes. Occasionally, 
however, I will make reference to those interests whose substantiality 
the record does not support or that the Court's Turner decision 
implicitly rejected. I consider three possibilities in this light--genuinely 
non-discriminatory entitlements to carriage at regulated rates, the 
"A/B" or input selector switch, and the rules struck down by the D.C. 
Circuit in Century Communications Corp. v. FCC, 835 F.2d 292 (D.C. 
Cir. 1987), clarified, 837 F.2d 517 D.D.C. Cir. 1988).  
 
1. Leased, non-discriminatory access 
 
One cannot correct an unlevel playing field by retilting the field to the 
benefit of some previously-disadvantaged players--broadcasters--at the 
expense of others who were already more severely disadvantaged--
independent programmers. Because must-carry suffers from this 
defect, it is in virtually every respect mismatched to the concern that 
vertically integrated cable bottlenecks will distort program selection 
choices to the detriment of viewers.  
 
First, the remedy is substantially overinclusive, in that it applies to all 
cablecasters, including ones completely free of vertical integration. Cf. 
Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State Crime 
Victims Board, et al., 502 U.S. 105, 121-22 & note (statute was 
overinclusive even under content-neutral scrutiny because a substantial 
portion of its burden on speech did not serve to advance government 
goals). As even defendants claim only that as of 1994 operators 
serving more than 70% of cable subscribers held vertical interests in 
cable programmers, Government Reply at 30-31, Plaintiffs' Fact 
Response 11 88-89, clearly those serving 30% do not. For the class of 
non-vertically-integrated cable operators, must-carry levels a playing 
field that was not tilted to begin with. Moreover, where the affiliated 
program supplier provides only a limited line, e.g., programming for 
one channel, the putative foreclosure effect appears miniscule. A 
"solution" that preempts 20 channels in order to provide "fair 
competition" on one plainly burdens more speech than is necessary.25  
 
Second, although the structural defect within vertically-integrated 
cable firms disadvantages independent programmers in precisely the 
way it disadvantages broadcasters, see Noll Decl. 1 19; Noll. Dep. at 
54-55,104 06; section m.B.2(a) above, must-carry singles out only 
broadcast for forced carriage. This defect of the remedy is not merely a 
matter of Congress exercising its authority to solve a problem "one 
step at a time," cf. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S.483,489 
(1955), and to refrain from burdening additional classes of speech. 
Rather, in two ways it undercuts any claim that must-carry is intended 
as a remedy for the stated problem. First, the limitation of the must-
carry right to broadcasters renders the right "ineffective or remote" as a 
solution to the problem. Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub 
Serv. Comm 'n, 447 U.S.557,564 (1980); Edenfield v. Fane, 113 S. Ct. 
1792,1799 (1993); see also FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 
U.S.364,396 (1984); Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S.524,540 (1989) 
(government "must demonstrate its commitment to advancing [its] 
interest by applying its prohibition evenhandedly"). Second, the 
privileged status of broadcasters here comes substantially at the 
expense of the other injured parties, the unaffiliated programmers, 
narrowing their opportunities to compete for channels. See Turner, 114 
S. Ct. at 2456. Yet the most obvious distinction betveen broadcasters 
and unaffiliated programmers is one that argues for less protection for 
broadcasters: they, in contrast to independent programmers, have their 
own access to viewers--at a minimum to the 40% who lack cable (even 
if one is assuming a station denied carriage by all cable systems in its 
viewing area).26  
 
Finally, the must carry remedy is both more burdensome to speech and 
less fit to advance Congress's expressed competition-protection 
purposes than are standard regulatory tools for assuring 
accommodation of would-be users of a bottleneck. In industry after 
industry--for example, interstate transmission of natural gas, interstate 
transmission of electricity, local area telephone networks--federal and 
state legislatures and regulatory agencies have sought to assure access 
for would-be users on equal terms, and at prices at least allowing the 
bottleneck owner to recover the associated costs. See, e.g., United 
States v. Terminal Railroad Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 411-12 (1912) 
(permitting access on equal terms for all railroad companies to railroad 
bottleneck controlled by a subset); Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission Order No. 636, Pipeline Service Obligations and 
Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing 
Transportation, etc., 57 Fed. Reg. 13267 (April 16, 1992) (establishing 
terms for interstate pipelines' transportation of others' gas); FERC 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Promoting Wholesale Competition 
Through Open-Access Non-Discriminatory Transportation Service by 
Public Utilities, etc., 60 Fed. Reg. 17662 (April 7, 1995); Federal 
Power Act Sections 211 & 212, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 824j, 824k 
(Supp. 1955) (providing limited authorization for orders to "wheel" 
electricity); MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 561 F.2d 365 
D.C. Cir. 1977) ("Execunet"); MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. 
FCC, 580 F.2d 590 D.C. Cir. 1978) ("Execunet II"); United States v. 
AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131, 227 (D.D.C. 1982) (provision of Modified 
Final Judgment assuring non-discriminatory access of interexchange 
carriers to local loop).  
 
Such prices are critical if the intervention is actually to correct the 
distortion without creating others that do equal or greater damage. If 
there is no charge, or if the charge is set too low, there is a risk that the 
bottleneck operator will pass a higher proportion of the protected 
outsiders' material through than would an operator under perfectly 
competitive conditions. See Noll Dep. 183-85 (acknowledging that 
must-carry could result in carriage of more broadcast stations than in 
perfectly competitive environment); see also William J. Baumol & J. 
Gregory Sidak, Toward Competition in Local Telephony 73 & ch. 7 
("The Pricing of Inputs Sold to Competitors") (1994). Conversely, too 
high a price would disfavor the outsiders. While there are sharp 
disputes as to exactly how such charges should be calculated, see, e.g., 
William J. Baumol & J. Gregory Sidak, The Pricing of Inputs Sold to 
Competitors, 11 Yale J. Reg. 171 (1994); William B. Tye, Response, 
id. at 203; Alfred E. Kahn & William E. Taylor, Comment, id. at 225, 
I am unaware of any economist arguing that singling out a special set 
of non- affiliated upstream suppliers and granting them access at a 
price of zero is a "solution" to the bottleneck problem. The universal 
solution in such mundane areas as gas, electricity, and wire 
telecommunications is a non-discriminatory entitlement to access at a 
price set by an administrative agency. Indeed, in section 9 of the 1992 
Cable act (amending section 612 of the 1984 Act) Congress adopted a 
comparable provision for cable, setting aside a portion of each 
operator's channels for mandatory "leasing." 47 U.S.C. 532. 
Regardless of whether defendants' complaints about the adequacy of 
that specific remedy are correct, see Government Opposition at 92-93, 
the type of remedy used for gas, electricity and wire 
telecommunications appears to solve any bottleneck problems of 
broadcasters in a way that creates no ancillary burdens on others 
competing for bottleneck access. And no defendant even suggests the 
contrary.  
 
In fact, the government's response to leased access is precisely that 
such access presupposes payment by broadcasters to cable--none of the 
very evils that Congress noted." Id. But obviously carriage has some 
value. While the government may decry an attempt by cable operators 
to overcharge a programmer for carriage, the claims of anticompetitive 
or "unfair" behavior provide no reason to treat any charge--including 
one worked out through the processes described in comparable 
situations above--as an "evil."  
 
If carriage generates for broadcasters the enormous incremental 
revenues that defendants claim, it is especially odd to find them 
disparaging the idea that they should pay any of the costs of access to 
this bonanza. In describing the value of carriage to broadcast stations, 
for instance, defendants point to evidence of a cable operator's estimate 
that for a particular broadcaster "for every 5% drop in cable viewers, 
this station would lose $1,480,000 in gross revenues and $1,258,000 in 
operating income." Defendants' Fact Response 1 54. I suspect the 
station in question is not typical of those allegedly jeopardized by the 
absence of must-carry, but the point is the same for all stations. 
Neither in terms of equity nor of economic efficiency have defendants 
offered a reason why broadcast stations should not bear any of the 
costs--or pay any of the value--of the access that they identify as 
valuable.  
 
Thus the government fundamentally errs when it claims that 
mandatory free carriage for broadcasters serves consumers' interests as 
measured by the standards of a free market. The Government says:  
 
It is cable operators who deny access by significant numbers of local 
broadcast stations to a significant share of their market, thereby 
disabling that market from ever reaching a 'verdict.' The must-carry 
rules address this reality, and are premised on the principle that, after 
free access to the marketplace is restored, fair competition can begin.  
 
Government Opposition at 41. But granting broadcasters free (as in 
"no charge") access to cable's subscribers--and thereby denying access 
to independent programmers--certainly does not enhance free (as in 
"free and open") competition between broadcasters' programming and 
that of independent programmers. Ultimately, in the absence of an 
overall threat to broadcast's survival, the salient difference between 
independent programmers and broadcasters is that the latter enjoy use 
of a valuable asset given them by the government--a broadcast license-
-that the former lack. I cannot see how principles of "fair competition" 
are enhanced by a rule under which the broadcast license, itself a 
government subsidy, becomes an admissions pass to an additional 
government- enforced subsidy, paid for by cable operators and 
independent programmers.  
 
Accordingly, I would conclude that must-carry violates the First 
Amendment requirement to use the least restrictive alternative, as that 
has been understood since Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 
781 (1989), by adopting a mandate of completely uncompensated 
carriage in favor of a privileged class of users, at the expense of other 
speakers whose access to viewers is subject to more severe limits.  
 
The analysis is parallel for public television. Access to cable 
subscribers who have abandoned their antennae is undoubtedly 
valuable for public stations, and we have already found support for a 
congressional fear of a risk of discrimination against broadcasters and 
other unaffiliated program suppliers. But just as commercial 
broadcasters could use part of the anticipated extra revenue from non-
discriminatory access at a regulated rate, so too, public stations could 
pay for the access with a part of the extra contributions it is expected to 
yield. The only reason offered by public television for more favorable 
treatment--apart from content-based paeans to the quality of its 
programming, see Public Broadcasters Defendant-Intervenors' 
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for 
Summary Judgment at 15-18--is that the public is already subsidizing 
public television and is entitled to protect its investment. See id. at 19-
21. But public television advocates point us to no precedent for the 
proposition that a watered down version of least-restrictive-alternative 
analysis is to be applied to a case of coerced speech simply because the 
stated purpose is to enhance the value of a previously granted public 
subsidy.  
 
I close by acknowledging what is obvious about the governmental 
purposes not based on "unfair" competition. If the defendants are right 
that the government has a "substantial interest" in maximizing the 
revenue or net profits of broadcasters, or maximizing the growth rate 
of UHF independents, then any charge, no matter how legitimate and 
no matter how parallel to permitted charges in other bottleneck 
situations, will fail to advance the interest as well as a free, fiat 
entitlement. I have already stated my belief that the Court did not 
endorse those goals as substantial government interests. But for the 
stated goals of preventing "unfair competition," in any of its alleged 
manifestations, non-discriminatory access at agency-regulated fees 
burdens far less speech and fits--rather than fights--the stated goals.27  
 
2. A/B or "input selector" switches 
 
An "A/B" or input selector switch, despite the slightly forbidding 
name, is simply a switch with one position for cable and one position 
for broadcast. Coupled with whatever antenna is necessary (e.g., the 
one in place before the viewer subscribed to cable), such a switch 
permits the viewer to switch between cable's offerings and all the 
television programming that would have been available to the viewer 
if cable had never been installed.  
 
All parties have pitched their arguments about the use of such switches 
in terms of whether they qualify as a "less restrictive alternative" to 
must-carry. I frankly doubt this classification. The availability of A/B 
or input selector switches is simply part of the landscape. If they 
enable cable subscribers to reach programs they wish to see, as 
plaintiffs argue, that is simply a fact that tends to undermine the claim 
that the continuation of over-the-air television is in any way in 
jeopardy or that cable operators have a "bottleneck" over provision of 
video services to cable subscribers (a foundation of any claim of 
anticompetitive behavior).28 If defendants are right in their assertion 
that the use of such switches is infeasible, that fact merely supports 
their claims as to the fate of marginal broadcast stations and the 
existence of bottleneck distortions in the market. Nonetheless, as both 
parties treat these switches as some sort of "alternative," I address 
them here in that light.  
 
A cable subscriber is able to retain access to broadcast television if 
willing (1) to pay the $10 or less required for the A/B or input selector 
switch (in some cases the subscriber receives it as part of a TV's 
remote control), Large Affidavit 1 22, (2) to use the switch, and (3) to 
retain whatever antenna is necessary to pick up over-the-air signals.  
 
The first barrier is apparently lessening. The record shows that most 
cable-ready TV receivers now on the market have built-in input 
selector switches operable by remote control. Defendants' Fact 
Response 1 154. The record does not disclose, however, just what 
portion of the existing stock of television receivers has this advantage. 
Id. In any event, it would seem that anyone who could afford cable 
could also afford the $10 for an A/B switch for use with an old 
television set.  
 
The defendants claim that A/B switches do little to ease cable's 
monopoly in the houses of its subscribers because consumers find 
them "unacceptable." "Most telling," the government says in its 
evaluation of A/B switches, is that "79% of cable viewers stated that 
the A/B switch was inconvenient for the plain and simple reason that 
they 'had to get up' to use it." Government Reply at 41.29  
 
"Telling" indeed: the Government's point tells us that consumers are 
willing and able to use an A/B switch if they believe it will provide 
access to a program that is worth "get[ing] up" from the couch for, 
once to switch to broadcast, once to return to cable. (We put aside 
those with input selectors in their remotes, who need not even get up.) 
Compare Century, 835 F.2d at 302 (rejecting the FCC's "sluggish 
profile of the American consumer" as inconsistent with fact that "even 
costly items like the video cassette recorder, the cordless telephone, the 
compact disc-player ant the home computer have spread like 
wildfire").  
 
The 1992 Cable act in fact precipitated a controlled experiment in 
consumer resourcefulness. In late 1993 the three major television 
network local affiliates were unable to reach agreement on 
retransmission consent with a TCI cable system in Corpus Christi, 
Texas, resulting in a three-month span in which ABC, CBS, and NBC 
were all absent from cable. In an attempt to placate irate cable 
subscribers, TCI provided A/B switches so that the subscribers could 
switch from cable to broadcast and back again. See Defendants' 
Additional Evidence Vol. VII.M Ex. 291; Large Affidavit 1 71.  
 
Before the dispute the networks collectively captured a 70% share of 
the total cable audience; after a month off cable (and with the 
distribution of A/B switches), they had a share of 67-69% of the total 
cable audience. Defendants' Fact Response 1 161; Large Aff. Para. 72; 
Defendants' Additional Evidence Vol. VII.M Ex. 291.  
 
Defendants note that nearly 70% of sampled cable subscribers in 
Corpus Christi said the switches were "inconvenient" to use. 
Defendants' Fact Response 1 161. It is from this sample that 79% said 
the switches were inconvenient because they "had to get up" to change 
them. Defendants' Additional Evidence Vol. VII.M. Ex. 291. But 
government-mandated carriage seems a rather astonishing solution to a 
problem now redefined as consumers' occasional need to "get up."  
 
The Corpus Christi episode lends credence to plaintiffs' contentions 
that the primary reason viewers choose not to use A/B switches is that 
cable already carries the broadcast stations that viewers regard as 
worth switching to. Defendants concede as much when they address 
the fact that subscribers to direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, must use 
an A/B switch to retain access to any local broadcast stations because 
the DBS feed does not include them. (DBS has joined over-the-air 
broadcast and cable as another way of receiving video signals.) The 
government claims that "[u]se of A/B switches by DBS and MMDS 
[yet another video delivery system] subscribers involves the 
completely different situation where the consumer must resort to A/B 
switches to receive virtually any broadcast stations whatsoever." 
Defendants' Fact Response 1 158. This appears to be no more than an 
ornate way of acknowledging that consumers will use A/B switches 
whenever they want to--i.e., whenever they are aware of a non-carried 
station that is worth a few dollars' capital investment and the 
occasional flick of a switch. Defendants do not contend that DBS 
subscribers--or Corpus Christi residents--are more handy or spry than 
Americans generally.  
 
Defendants point out that use of an A/B switch is successful only to 
the extent that a suitable antenna will pick up the desired signal, and 
observe that antennae may costs as much as $300. There is no 
suggestion that that is a common price, or anywhere near average.) Yet 
the uncabled 40% of America, which in this litigation is often 
presumed to be unable to afford cable, somehow manages the burdens 
of antenna ownership, as do DBS subscribers, who alone amounted to 
1.53 million people in 1994. Large Affidavit 1 ;73; Defendants' Fact 
Response 1 158. Interestingly, it appears that the desire to secure local 
broadcast signals that are not supplied by cable, DBS or some 
alternative service is powerful and rising: from 1993 to 1994 there was 
a 51% increase in the sales of indoor antennas (from 3.5 million units 
to 5.3 million units). Affidavit of Joseph Stem 1 33. Congress made 
specific findings regarding A/B or input selector switches in the 1992 
Cable Act. Section 2(a)(17) states that  
 
[(a)] [c]onsumers who subscribe to cable television often do so to 
obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not be able 
to receive, or to obtain mpn signals. [(b)] Most subscribers to cable 
television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive 
broadcast television services, [(c)] do not have input selector switches 
to convert from a cable to antenna reception system, or [(d)] cannot 
otherwise receive broadcast television services.  
 
Section 2(a)(17) (emphasis added). Scction 2(a)(18) states that  
 
[(e)] [c]able television systems often are the single most efficient 
distribution system for television programming. [(f)] A government 
mandate for a substantial societal investment in alternative distribution 
systems for cable subscribers, such as the 'A/B' input selector antenna 
system, is not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and is not 
in the public interest.  
 
Section 2(a)(18). Several of the drawbacks mentioned--items (b) and 
(c) are simply conclusory assertions of the supposedly insuperable 
barriers posed by the need for switches ant antennae. But these are 
belied by the Corpus Christi episode ant by the behavior of DBS 
subscribers. Neither switch nor antenna is so mysterious, costly or 
unworkable as to be beyond the means of a private citizen who values 
access to a program at the price of a diminutive capital investment and 
the ongoing cost of pushing the switch when necessary.  
 
The remainder of the findings--see items (a), (d), and (e)30_appear to 
reject A/B switches in large part on the ground that cable in many 
cases enhances broadcast stations' signals or even brings them to areas 
they could not otherwise reach. Cf. Noll Declaration Para.Dertouzous 
Declaration 1 31; Government Opposition at 91. But neither the 
enhancement of television options for cable subscribers, nor extending 
broadcast's reach to cable subscribers in otherwise signal-deprived 
areas, was embraced by the Supreme Court in Turner as an interest 
substantial enough to justify must-carry. See section III.A.2 above.  
 
In fact, use of cable to enhance (or create) a signal in previously-
signal-deprived areas may affirmatively injure the uncabled 40%. 
Again, obviously only cable subscribers would directly enjoy the 
enhanced (or new) signal. Further, as forced carriage would reduce a 
station's potential audience to be reached over-the-air, it would pari 
passu reduce the station's incentive to invest in enhancement of its 
over-the-air signal (say, by buttressing its transmitter).  
 
Moreover, while a cable operator in areas where broadcast signals are 
weak or non- existent may have a "monopoly" not only over cable but 
also over television services more generally, defendants' claims about 
cable operators' supposed motives to impoverish or destroy broadcast 
stations for anticompetitive reasons, see section m.B.2(b) above, 
cannot apply in such areas: cable operators have no motive to destroy a 
"competitor" that is unable to compete.  
 
The insufficiencies of A/B switches in weak-signal areas, nonetheless, 
make them, in such areas, an inadequate alternative solution to 
Congress's stated concern that cable's "bottleneck" powers might deny 
consumers adequate access to diverse programming from unaffiliated 
programmers. See sections III.B.1 and III.B.2(a) above. But the 
defendants have made no effort to quantify the weak-signal areas, 
which from all that appears may represent a very small fraction of the 
country. Accordingly, as the 1992 Cable Act imposes its burdens on 
speech throughout the country, while broadcast's own access to 
consumers via A/B switches adequately counters cable's alleged 
anticompetitive tendency to foreclose broadcast programming 
everywhere except in weak-signal areas, it burdens more speech than is 
necessary even with respect to those purposes.31  
 
3. The Century Rules 
 
The plaintiffs appeal to the previously-struck-down Century rules, 835 
F.2d 292, which required fewer forced carriages, as less restrictive. As 
already mentioned, the defendants agree--and thus urge that they are 
less effective. For the valid and real purposes that one can identify, 
however, any carriage scheme which is by fiat (1) guaranteed free to 
the beneficiaries and (2) helpful to only to one class of aggrieved 
parties at the expense of a more vulnerable class, suffers from a 
similarly fatal mismatch. Less encompassing rules such as those in 
Century may reduce the current must carry's distortive effects, but they 
still do not amount to a reasonably tailored fit to the problem when 
there are alternatives available that do not burden speech at 11, such as 
input selector switches, or that at least do not increase the hazards of a 
class of speakers already suffering from greater bottleneck foreclosure 
than the legislatively privileged class.  
 
V. Conclusion 
 
Under the standard of Turner, I would find sections 4 and 5 of the 
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C.  534-535, to be unconstitutional. Defendants 
have not argued that the special entitlement for "low power" stations, 
47 U.S.C. 534(c); see also Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2460 n.6, is severable 
from the rest of 534, nor does such a contention seem plausible. I 
therefore would not reach the issue of whether the low power 
provisions are content- neutral or content-based, and whether, viewed 
in isolation, they would be constitutional. Nor would I reach either 
Time Warner's takings claim or the claim of Atlanta Interfaith 
Broadcasters, Inc., that the must carry provisions are invalid as applied 
to "predominantly religious television stations.  
 
Accordingly, I believe plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment should 
be granted and defendants' motion for summary judgment should be 
denied.

Influence," i.e., non-overlapping geographic areas that define 
television markets, and over 11,000 cable systems, the typical station 
would have approximately 53 cable systems operating in its "ADI."

3 Some stations--typically popular network affiliates--invoke rights 
that the Cable Act offers broadcasters as an alternative to forced 
carriage, namely, to forbid cable carriage until some form of payment 
from the cable system in question is negotiated. 47 U.S.C. Section 
325(b). Divisions between stations electing such "retransmission 
consent and those electing must-carry, however, are blurry: because a 
station's coverage area usually includes several cable providers, see n.1 
above, a station can insist on retransmission consent from some cable 
systems and must-carry on others. See Time Warner Entertainment 
Company, L.P.'s Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' 
and Intervenors' Summary Judgment Motions and in Further Support 
of Its Summary Judgment Motion at 13-15; Corrected Memorandum 
of the United States and the Federal Communications Commission in 
Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment at 10.  
 
4 This was not the defendants' original position before this court. 
Compare, e.g., November 24, 1992 NAB Corrected Memorandum in 
Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 14 
("risks of anticompetitive harm are so substantial, Congress concluded, 
that 'the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its 
ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously 
jeopardized,' absent remedial legislation) (quoting Section 2(a)(16) of 
the 1992 Cable act); December 2, 1992, Memorandum of Intervenor-
Defendant Applicant National Association of Broadcasters in 
Opposition to Motions for a Temporary Restraining Order at 10-11 
(cable's carriage behavior placed broadcasting's future in jeopardy" and 
"could deprive the 40% of American households without cable of the 
opportunity to receive video programming at all"), with NAB 
Opposition at 18 ("Must-carry was not enacted to prevent the 
disappearance of free local broadcast television"); Government 
Opposition at 7 ("Congress did not contemplate, as plaintiffs contend, 
that the entire broadcast industry is in jeopardy").  
 
5 "Advertising Revenues per Television Household: A Market by 
Market Analysis, a 1991 report by the National Association of 
Broadcasters, reports a +healthy" 20.6% increase in total net 
advertising revenues for broadcast between 1986 and 1991. Time 
Warner Ex. 19. It thus appears that if one took into          account 
whatever deductions are made in calculating net ad revenues--
evidently expenses such as commissions that broadcast incurred to 
obtain ad sales, see Time Warner Ex. 14 n.3--the picture of broadcast's 
ad revenue would look still brighter.  
 
6 The D.C. Circuit court of appeals struck down the regulations in July 
1985, in Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC, 768 F.2d 1434 D.C. Cir. 
1985).  
 
7 See Century Communications Co. v FCC, 835 F.2d 292 (D.C. 
Cir.1987), clarified, 837 F.2d 517 D.C. Cir.1987).  
 
8 I am not saying Congress may not act 
prophylactically, which of course it may. I am only saying that where 
the evidence shows a threat to be neither present or detectably on the 
horizon, Congress may not simply obviate the lack of evidence by 
claiming that all the relevant parties are putting on an act to conceal 
the threat.  
 
9 The year 1987 (meaning 12/31/86 to 12/31/87) was a year of great 
growth--72 stations. It is also a period half without must-carry and half 
with. If the growth can somehow be attributed to the must-carry during 
the latter half of 1987 or the must-carry prevailing in 1985 and earlier, 
then absence of must-carry perhaps is responsible for the reduced 
growth rate described in the text. The parties do not give the court 
enough detail on stations' gestation periods, etc., from which one could 
infer likely time lags between a change in must-carry status and an 
effect on additions of new stations.  
 
10 Defendants use slightly different numbers in discussing the 
supposedly stunted growth rate, see Government Brief at 36, but refer 
only to three years, 1986, 1990 and 1991, saying that net additional 
stations in each year were 44, 13 and 11. As 1986 was a year without 
must-carry, this shows a decline only on the assumption of a long 
gestation period for stations, and, again, the court is not given enough 
detail to resolve that. Even accepting the defendants' numbers and 
apparent attributions of particular years, the data still show significant 
net growth.  
 
11 Plaintiffs also call attention to a 1989 NAB memo which 
acknowledges that "the future of free TV is excellent," though as a 
maturing industry, "instead of stations making 50% and 60% profit 
margins, we are seeing them drop to 30% to 35% margins. Many other 
mature businesses would love to have these margins." Time Warner 
Ex. 4.  
 
12 of course, with or without cable, broadcast must have a natural 
saturation point--a point where marginal firms earn only a "normal 
profit," i.e., a rate of return sufficient to attract capital from alternative 
investments, all factors (such as risk) being held constant. There is no 
evidence in the record--at least none identified as such--from which 
one might infer where that point might be, as an absolute matter or in 
relation to the number of channels prescribed by the FCC in the 
rulemaking on which defendants rely. Nor has any party directed the 
court's attention to anything in the record from which they suggest one 
might infer that the economic saturation point is greater or smaller than 
the number of stations made possible by Commission rule.  
 
13 One could use similar reasoning to attempt to justify a government 
requirement that cable operators, at their own expense, print and 
distribute inserts to accompany their subscribers' monthly bills, with 
the content to be determined by local UHF stations. Presumably such 
stations could use the inserts to advertise themselves, or simply sell the 
space to other companies for their own generic advertising, coupons, 
etc.  
 
14 While this might map roughly to the subset of stations claimed to 
be in special financial trouble, see III.A.l.(c) above, it is not an exact 
proxy for such stations. According to an NAB study, over 75% of all 
network affiliates elected must-carry on at least one cable system. 
Affidavit of Gregory M. Loss, Ex. 21 at 5009947. At the same time, 
the NAB reported that over 90% of network affiliates said they would 
exercise their retransmission consent rights as to at least one cable 
system (presumably a system different from one on which must carry 
was elected; see n.3, above). Time Warner Ex. 22.  
 
15 The defendants do not advance this as an interpretation of Turner's 
mandate, but I examine it nonetheless. In fact, the defendants appear to 
repudiate such an interpretation, since they claim that carriage of a 
broadcast station by a cable system is a significant government interest 
without regard to the number of broadcast stations already carried by 
that system, or already flourishing in that market. See Defendants' Fact 
Response 1 11.2.  
 
16 The example assumes constrained capacity, such that it would 
clearly be unprofitable for the operator to run both sets of 
programming. Thus, a cost of using the affiliate's material is loss of the 
opportunity to use the non-affiliate's profitably, and vice versa.  
 
17 In contrast, the programming division of the integrated 
operator/programmer need not be profitable on a stand-alone basis, as 
long as its net contribution to the integrated firm's revenue (net of all 
costs, including+ risk and the cost of capital) is positive.  
 
18 The tradition is breaking down, in that broadcasters have found 
other sources of revenue. As discussed earlier, under the 
retransmission consent provisions of the 1992 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 
Section 325(b), broadcasters are able to sell the rights to their signals 
to cable operators, ant it is undisputed here that over 80% of all 
commercial broadcast stations (as opposed to 90% of network 
affiliates, see n.14 above, have elected to do so on at least one cable 
system. Defendants' Fact Response 113-5.  
 
19 As before, I assume that the operator cannot use both programs, so 
that use of the outsider's program costs the operator 20 in foregone ad 
revenue.  
 
20 Spulber goes on to criticize the theory, which fails to explain why 
the firm should use the profits derived from deception of regulators for 
the purpose of predation in the unregulated market if predation there 
was not otherwise promising. see Spulber, supra, 12 Yale J. Reg. at 
6+61. A possible answer is that the otherwise improbable behavior in 
the adjacent market might be necessary in order to be consistent with 
the practices engaged in to hoodwink the regulators. In any event, 
though the theory may be "discredited," as Spulber says, id., I assume 
that congress could constitutionally act on what was until recently the 
received wisdom.  
 
21 use of must carry as a means of offsetting the unintended 
consequences of rate regulation is quite different from using elements 
of the must-carry remedy itself to justify must-carry; the rate 
regulation has an independent justification. see Time Warner v. FCC, 
56 F.3d 151 +D.c. Cir.1995).  
 
22 of course, to the extent that cable ad revenues are invoked by the 
FCC as a justification for holding back subscriber rates, the apparent 
distinction would dissolve.  
 
23 I pause to note defendants+ argument that the numbers show that 
must carry adds as a result of the Cable act amount to 1.2% of 
channels and that total must-carry stations amount to 7.2%. see 
Defendants+ Joint Statement of Undisputed Facts 11 15+53. These 
figures are arrived at by taking estimates of must-carry elections and 
dividing into the nationwide total number of channels. Id. The 
resulting percentages are meaningless as measures of the foreclosure 
effects of must-carry; dozens of vacant channels on a handful of 
several-hundred-channel systems are obviously of no use to a 
constrained system of 50 channels that is forced to carry, for example, 
six must-carry stations (slightly under the weighted average). I am 
surprised that defendants+ counsel offer us such misleading data.  
 
24 Of course in a trial on defendants' claims that cable operators often 
dropped stations for predatory reasons, an operator's judgment about 
the likely popularity of cable programming selected instead would 
surely be a defense. because I have not assumed summary judgment 
for plaintiffs on that issue, however, I do not ultimately confront the 
context where such a popularity comparison would be pertinent.  
 
25 To the extent that defendants' hypothesis of cable operator 
predation against broadcast stations has merit, as we assumed in 
section m.B.2(b) above, this finding of overinclusiveness is 
inapplicable.  
 
26 Broadcasters also have access to most of the 60% on cable, for 
almost all of them can get broadcast signals simply by maintaining 
their antenna and operating a garden-variety input-selection switch. 
See section IV.B.2 below.  
 
27 Even if one focused solely on the supposed purpose of preventing 
cable operator predation against broadcasters, see section Iv.s.2(b), a 
nondiscriminatory access entitlement at regulated rates fully satisfies 
the purpose with no ancillary burdening of independent programmers 
speech opportunities and less burden on those of cable operators.  
 
28 The FCC itself pointed out, when promulgating the Century rules, 
that "once cable subscribers become accustomed to using off-the-air 
[i.e. over-the-air] reception on an equal basis with cable service, then 
cable systems no longer will have an artificial ability to limit their 
subscribers' access to over-the-air broadcast signals." Amendment of 
Part 76 of the Commission's Rules Concerning Carriage of Television 
Broadcast Signals by Cable Television Systems, 1 F.C.C. Rcd 864 
(1986) 1163; see also id. 1121 (''[Tlhe perception [exists] that cable 
systems may be able to preclude access by their subscribers to off-the-
air broadcast signals. This perception derives not from any inherent 
characteristic of cable service, but rather from cable subscribers' 
current expectation that broadcast signals will always be available as 
part of their basic cable service. This expectation is a direct result of 
the former must carry rules, ... [and] has caused many subscribers to 
perceive that there is no need to install or maintain the capability to 
receive broadcast signals off-the-air.+)  
 
29 Actually, the 79% appears to be 79% of the 68% of A/B switch 
users in Corpus Christi who found the A/B switch "fairly" or "very" 
inconvenient. See Defendants' Additional Evidence Vol. VlI.M No. 
291. See immediately below for discussion of the Corpus Christi 
episode.  
 
30 Item (f), to the extent it does not simply repeat earlier assertions, 
assumes that A/B or input selector switches, and antennae, would 
become available only by means of some sort of massive government 
mandate. A survey of the evidence indicates that consumers 
themselves are quite capable of adopting these measures when they 
think the extra programs are worthwhile. If Congress feared that 
consumers were insufficiently aware of such switches, however, it 
could devise a promotional solution tailored to that end.  
 
31 Of course, apart from this ground for granting summary judgment 
in favor of plaintiffs, section  IV.B.1 Provides an alternative ground: 
non-discriminatory access for all at reguIated rates can meet all the 
defendants bottleneck concerns, see section III.B generally, with less 
burden on speech and without new, offsetting distortions against 
programmers--the independents--who operate at a considerable 
disadvantage vis-a-vis broadcasters.

DEC 12 1995 
 
CLERK U.S. DISTRICT COURT 
 
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER 
 
Civil Action No. 92-2247 
(and related cases) 
(SFW, TPJ, SS) 
 
This matter comes before this three-judge District Court/1 on  
 
remand from the Supreme Court of the United States.  The central  
 
question before the Court is whether the "must-carry" provisions of  
 
the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of  
 
1992 ("1992 Cable Act") violate the First Amendment./2  
 
When the case was originally before the three-judge District  
 
Court, the District Court, in a divided opinion, granted summary  
 
judgment in favor of the Government and the other intervenor-  
 
defendants, ruling that the "must-carry" provisions challenged by  
 
the  Plaintiffs  (consisting of both cable operators and cable  
 
programmers) survived under the intermediate standard of scrutiny  
 
set forth in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968) and Ward  
 
v. Rock Aaainst Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989).  Turner Broadcasting  
 
System. Inc. v. F.C.C.. 819 F. Supp. 32 (D.D.C. 1993)  (Williams,  
 
J., dissenting; Sporkin, J., concurring).  
 
The Supreme Court, while upholding the majority+s decision  
 
that  the  content-neutral  "must-carry"  provisions  should  be  
 
subjected to the intermediate level of scrutiny under the First  
 
Amendment,  remanded the case to t:he District Court for further  
 
development of the factual record.  Pursuant to that remand order,  
 
the case now comes before the Court on cross-motions for summary  
 
judgment. 
 
THE REMAND 
 
Under the intermediate level of scrutiny set forth in O'Brien,  
 
a  content-neutral  regulation will  survive  a  First  Amendment  
 
challenge if 
 
 
"it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the 
governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free 
expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First 
Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance 
of that interest."  
 
Turner Broadcasting System. Inc. v. F.C.C.. 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2469  
 
(1994)  (quoting O'Brien at 377). 
 
In enacting the must-carry provisions, Congress found that the  
 
viability of the local broadcast industry would be  "seriously  
 
jeopardized" without the protections afforded by the provisions.  
 
1992 Cable Act  2(a)(16).  Congress asserted that three important  
 
government interests were being served by the rules: 1) preserving  
 
the benefits of free, over-the-air local broadcast television; 2)  
 
promoting the widespread dissemination of  information  from a  
 
multiplicity of sources; and 3) promoting fair competition in the  
 
market  for  television programming.    Turner  at  2469,  (citing  
 
S.Rep.No. 102-92, p. 58,  (1991); H.R.Rep. No. 102-6 28, 63 (1992);  
 
1992 Cable Act,  2(a)(8),  (9), and (10).  
 
The Supreme Court recognized that the government's asserted  
 
interests are unrelated to the suppression of free expression and  
 
are indeed important.   Id.  at 2469.   The Court held that the  
 
government must still show that the must-carry provisions designed  
 
to protect local over-the-air broadcasters will "in fact advance  
 
those interests."  Id. at 2470.   In defending a regulation, the  
 
government "must do more than simply 'posit the existence of the  
 
disease sought to be cured.'  It must demonstrate that the recited  
 
harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation  
 
will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way."  
 
Id.  (citations omitted). 
 
 
The Supreme Court found that in order for the government to  
 
meet its burden that the viability of the local broadcast industry  
 
would be jeopardized in the absence of "must-carry" rules the  
 
government needed to develop the factual record on two points: "1)  
 
that  unless  cable operators are compelled to carry broadcast  
 
stations, significant numbers of broadcast stations will be refused  
 
carriage on cable systems;  and 2)  that the broadcast stations  
 
denied carriage will either deteriorate to a substantial degree or  
 
fail altogether."  Id. at 24710 
 
With respect to the narrow tailoring step of the O'Brien test,  
 
the Court also found factual gaps in the record.   In order to  
 
determine whether the must-carry rules "burden substantially more  
 
speech than is necessary to further the government+s legitimate  
 
interests," the Court found that the factual record needed to be  
 
supplemented with respect to "the extent to which the must-carry  
 
provisions in fact interfere with protected speech". Id. at 2472  
 
(quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 799).  In addition, the Court held that  
 
further findings were necessary concerning the availability and  
 
efficacy of "constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means of  
 
achieving the government's  asserted interests."   Id.  at  2472  
 
(quoting Sable Communications of California. Inc. v. F.C.C.  
 
U.S. 115, 129 (1989)). 
 
The Supreme Court indicated that this Court's inquiry is not  
 
limited to the record before Congress at the time that it enacted  
 
the 1992 Cable Act.  This Court is entitled to consider "additional  
 
evidence" that bears on the factual issues presented by this case.  
 
Id. at 2472 ("a more substantial elaboration in the District Court  
 
of the predictive or historical evidence upon which Congress relied  
 
or the introduction of some additional evidence" on the harm to  
 
local broadcasters in the absence of the must-carry provisions is  
 
necessary to a determination of the Collstitutional challenge).  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
The Supreme Court clearly dictated that this Court is to  
 
employ  a  deferential  standard  of  review  in  analyzing  the  
 
constitutionality of the "must-carry" provisions.  Turner at 2471  
 
("We agree that courts must accord substantial deference to the  
 
predictive judgments of Congress.")   Congress' judgments "should  
 
not be ignored" just because the "'[appellants]  cas[t]  [their]  
 
claims under the umbrella of the First Amendment."  Id.  (quoting  
 
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.  v.  Democratic  National  
 
Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 103 (1973)).  This Court is not "to reweigh  
 
the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual predictions  
 
with [its] own."  Id. This Court's role is limited to assuring  
 
"that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable  
 
inferences based on substantial evidence."  Id. (citing Century  
 
Communications Corp. v. FCC, 835 F.2d 292, 304 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).  
 
Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable  
 
mind  might  accept  as  adequate  to  support  a  conclusion.  
 
Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLR+3, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).  
 
Not only does the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine  
 
underlying  this  nation's  success  dictate  that  the  review  be  
 
deferential, but practical considerations also necessitate such  
 
review.  As the Supreme Court recognized, "As an institution  
 
Congress is far better equipped than the judiciary to `amass and  
 
evaluate the vast amounts of data' bearlng upon an lssue as complex  
 
and dynamic as that presented here." Id. (citations omitted)./3  
 
"Sound policymaking often requires legislators to forecast future  
 
events and to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on  
 
deductions and inferences for which complete empirical support may  
 
be unavailable."  Id. at 2471./4 
 
This Court's initial role in considering the cross-motions for  
 
summary judgment is to determine whether there are any genuine  
 
issues of material fact which would necessitate a trial.  Fed. R.  
 
Civ. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986).  There  
 
is  no  dispute  among  the  parties  that  there  was  conflicting  
 
testimony and evidence before Congress on the need for and the  
 
efficacy of the must-carry provisions. 
 
Given the reams of paper submitted to this Court, there can be  
 
no doubt but that the parties' experts disagree about the facts  
 
underlying  Congress'  predictive  judgment  that  the  broadcast  
 
industry was in jeopardy.  For example, experts disagree regarding  
 
(1) whether in the absence of must-carry, significant numbers of  
 
broadcast stations would be refused carriage, (2) whether broadcast  
 
stations denied carriage would either deteriorate to a substantial  
 
degree or fail altogether,  and  (3)  the accuracy of Congress'  
 
predictive  judgments  on the actual  effects  of  the must-carry  
 
provisions on the cable industry.  Moreover, there is disagreement  
 
over Congress'  judgments on the availability and efficacy of  
 
"constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means" of achieving  
 
the Government's asserted interest.  Turner at 2472.  One would  
 
expect that experts would disagree whexe predictive judgments are  
 
being made regarding the effects of competition among segments of  
 
a  large  industry  and  regarding  the  effects  of  prophylactic  
 
measures. 
 
However, given the standard of review this Court is to employ,  
 
such a "battle of experts" does not preclude summary judgment.  
 
Rather, the battle supports the rendering of summary judgment for  
 
the government - it suggests that there was "substantial evidence"  
 
before Congress (or substantial "additional evidence") from which  
 
it drew a "reasonable inference" that the must-carry provisions are  
 
necessary to protect the local broadcast: industry and do not  
 
burden "substantially more speech . . . than necessary."  The  
 
Court's role is not to determine whether an inference is "correct"  
 
or whether a given inference is more reasonable - it is not to  
 
substitute its opinion for that of Congress.   As long as there is  
 
no material dispute that there is substantial evidence from which  
 
Congress could have drawn a reasonable inference, then the  
 
government is entitled to summary judgment.  
 
In  the  following pages,  the  substantial evidence before  
 
Congress, as well as additional evidence produced in the remand  
 
proceedings, from which they could have drawn reasonable inferences  
 
will be discussed pursuant to the Supreme Court's remand order./5  
 
The Court is convinced that there is substantial evidence in the  
 
more than 18,000 page record/6 which Congress compiled over 3 years  
 
of hearings from which Congress could draw reasonable inferences  
 
that the must-carry rules are necessary to protect the viability of  
 
the broadcast industry and do not burden "substantially more speech  
 
than . . . necessary." Ward, 491 U.S. at 799.  The Court further  
 
finds that there is substantial additional evidence which confirms  
 
Congress' findings. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Although this case pits expert against expert, there is no  
 
dispute about several fundamental facts.  Cable systems and "over-  
 
the-air  broadcasters"  are  "in  direct  competition"   as  an  
 
"independent source of television programming."  Turner at 2451.  
 
And cable systems are winning the competition, with over 60% of the  
 
"television households" currently subscribing to cable systems./7  
 
The market power of cable systems is expected to increase./8 Once  
 
a television household has subscribed to cable,  then the cable  
 
operator has "monopoly power" - the "physical connection between  
 
the television set and the cable network gives the cable operator  
 
gatekeeper  []  control  over most  (if  not  all)  of  the  
 
television programming that is channeled into the subscriber's  
 
home."  Turner at 2466, 2468.  This gatekeeper control, which has  
 
been  conferred  upon  the  cable  medium  by  local  and  federal  
 
regulation,/9 allows the cable operator to "silence the voice of  
 
competing speakers."  Id. at 2466. 
 
There is also no dispute that these monopolists face virtually  
 
no competition from other monopolists because the vast majority of  
 
television communities are served by only one cable  system./10  
 
Accordingly, local broadcasters cannot look to other cable systems  
 
for recourse when they are denied carriage on the one cable system  
 
in their area. 
 
Finally, the cable industry has become increasingly horizontally  
 
concentrated and vertically integrated. Power has been concentrated  
 
in the  hands  of  fewer and  fewer operators (horizontal  
 
concentration), which has lead to increased vertical integration  
 
as the largest operators have begun to demand ownership  
 
interests in cable programming networks.  
 
 
A. The Need for Must-Carry 
 
GiYen  the  cable  industry's undisputed market  power,  the  
 
question becomes whether Congress made reasonable inferences based  
 
on substantial evidence that its market power would be wielded to  
 
harm local broadcasting and that the must-carry provisions are  
 
necessary to protect the economic health of local broadcasting./11  
 
 
i. Evidence regarding Adverse Carriage Decisions  
 
There was substantial evidence from which Congress could  
 
reasonably  conclude  that  cable  systems  had  significant  and  
 
increasing  incentives  to  deny  carriage  or  reposition  local  
 
broadcasting stations in order to: 1) increase their advertising  
 
revenues,  the "cable industry's hottest and brightest area of  
 
growth;"/12 and 2)  favor cable proqramminq in which they had an  
 
equity interest. 
 
As to advertising revenues, there was substantial testimony  
 
before Congress that advances in technology were making it easier  
 
for cable companies to insert advertising into their networksl3 and  
 
that the cable industry was increasingly looking to advertising as  
 
a source of revenue.14 Common sense dictates, and the evidence  
 
before Congress substantiated, that cable systems would have every  
 
incentive to drop or reposition their advertising competitors in  
 
the absence of regulations. 
 
For example,  testimony before Congress indicated that "as  
 
cable advertising spot sales grow, local cable operators will have  
 
an increased incentive to block out or severely burden local  
 
broadcast stations which represent competition for advertising  
 
revenues",  and  that  it  is  "economic  reality"  that  "[c]able  
 
operators,  if  allowed  total  control  over  their  competitors'  
 
[broadcast] signals, can be expected to utilize it to their own  
 
advantage." /15 Moreover, the FCC reported to Congress that "`[c]able  
 
operators' incentive to deny carriage or provide disadvantageous  
 
carriage" was "particularly great as against local broadcasters,"  
 
because of competition for local advertising. /16  
 
Similarly,  cable operators with equity interests in cable  
 
programmers  would  have  every  reason  to  discriminate against  
 
broadcast stations competing with their own programmers. Preston  
 
Padden,  President of the Association of Independent Television  
 
Stations, Inc., so testified before Congress:  
 
 
"You don't need a Ph.D. in Economics to figure out that the guy who 
controls a monopoly conduit is in a unique position to control the flow 
of programming traffic to the advantage of the program services in 
which he has an equity  investment  and/or  in  which  he  is  selling 
advertising availabilities, and to the disadvantage of those services, 
including local independent broadcasting stations, in which he does 
not have an equity position."  
 
S. Rep. No. 102-92 at 26. 
 
Besides the cable operators' incentives to wield their market  
 
power to the detriment of the broadcast industry, Congress also had  
 
evidence that cable operators had already dropped,  refused to  
 
carry,  or adversely repositioned significant numbers of local  
 
broadcasters.  In 1988, the FCC conducted a study which reported  
 
that by 1988 two hundred and eighty out of the 912 responding  
 
broadcasting stations had indicated that they had been denied  
 
carriage in some 1,533 instances.17 Three hundred and thirteen of  
 
the  responding  stations  reported that  by  1988  they had been  
 
repositioned in 1,274 instances./18 
 
Moreover,  the Association of America's  Public  Television  
 
Stations' 1987 study indicated that public television stations had  
 
been dropped in 74 instances, with only 16 being restored at a  
 
later time.  Of the 128 reported channel repositionings in the 1987  
 
study, only 30 public television stations were later restored to  
 
their prior position./19  In addition to various studies, Congress  
 
received voluminous evidence of adverse carriage decisions by the  
 
cable industry directly from the harmed broadcast stations.  See  
 
Defendants' Joint Statement of Evidence Before Congress (JSCR)  
 
Paras. 291-467 and Pub. Br. Supp. St.  89-116.  Commissioner  
 
Quello of the  FCC  reported  to  Congress  that  "[t]he  record   
 
before  the Commission in its must carry proceeding demonstrated  
 
that cable won't hesitate to drop local broadcast signals." /20  
 
And there was reason to believe that cable systems were on  
 
"good behavior" while Congress conducted its investigation as to  
 
whether must-carry rules were necessary.  It would certainly have  
 
been  against  the  cable  industry's  self-interest  to  behave  
 
"abusively" towards the broadcast industry while it was in the  
 
"spotlight."  Commissioner Quello of the FCC informed Congress that  
 
"the abuses occurring today are just the 'tip of the iceberg.'  These 
activities come at a time when the cable industry is just beginning to 
recognize the importance of local advertising.  In addition, the leaders 
of the  industry have been statesmen in attempting to keep the industry 
from abusing its new  found power.  Experience  tells  me  that  the 
natural   competitive   incentives  will   not   be restrained  forever.   As  
soon  as  the  political spotlight  shifts  from  the  cable  industry,  its 
unbridled power will be brouqht to bear."/21  
 
Based on the record before  it,  Congress drew reasonable  
 
inferences that in the absence of must-carry rules, "significant"  
 
numbers of broadcast stations would be refused carriage.   The  
 
reasonableness of Congress' judgment that significant numbers of  
 
broadcast stations would be harmed is also underscored by the  
 
"small" burden to the cable industry caused by the must-carry  
 
provisions, as discussed infra.  The question of the "significance"  
 
of  the  harm  to  the  broadcast  industry  cannot  be  completely  
 
separated from the question of the burden to the cable industry./22  
 
Additional evidence outside the Congressional record supports  
 
the reasonableness of Congress' predictive judgment.  Obviously,  
 
this case itself confirms that the cable industry would drop  
 
broadcast stations if the must-carry rules were not in place.  And  
 
it would be logical  to conclude that  the cable  industry has  
 
exercised self-restraint due to this litigation.  It would not be  
 
in the cable industry's best interests to force broadcast stations  
 
to opt for their must-carry rights in order to obtain carriage.  
 
The cable industry itself recognizes that for the time being  
 
it should be careful not to engage in behavior that would be self-  
 
defeating.  Viacom's CEO stated that no broadcast station should be  
 
dropped or repositioned without his approval "so that we do not  
 
become  an  example  of  demonstrated  abuse  and  thereby  the  
 
justification for reregulation."/23 In addition, Storer  
 
Communications issued a memorandum admonishing its operators not 
to  
 
"rock the boat," because "we do not wish to be involved in a  
 
wholesale dislocation of broadcast signals until such time as our  
 
legal position is clarified."/24 
 
The government has also provided a slew of notable experts who  
 
testified to the reasonableness of Congress' conclusion that cable  
 
operators had and have substantial and increasing incentives to act  
 
adversely to local broadcast stations (Dr. Roger Noll/25, Dr. John  
 
Haring/26, Dr. James Dertouzos /27) and that the operators had acted 
and  
 
would act in accordance with those incentives in the absence of  
 
must-carry rules (Dr. John Haring, Tom Meek/28, Richard 
Feldman/29).  
 
ii. Evidence regarding Harm if Denied Carriage  
 
That a broadcast station that was denied access to the cable  
 
system in its local market would suffer financial harm and possible  
 
ruin seems to be an obvious conclusion.  See Turner, 114 S.Ct. at  
 
2474 (Stevens, J., concurring) ("Because 60% of Amerlcan households  
 
have cable, and because most cable subscribers rely solely on that  
 
medium to receive video signals, it is a practical certainty that  
 
a broadcaster dropped from the local cable system would suffer  
 
substantial economic harm.")  Not surprisingly, this conclusion is  
 
supported by substantial evidence before Congress.  If a station is  
 
denied access to a cable network or is adversely repositioned, the  
 
size of the audience it can reach will be restricted.  A reduced  
 
audience  decreases  a  commercial  station's  attractiveness  to  
 
advertisers,  which  causes  advertising  revenues  to  decline. /30  
 
Similarly, a reduced audience decreases a public station's ability  
 
to get viewer contributions.   When the revenue declines,  the  
 
station's ability to provide quality programming is hampered,  
 
further decreasing the viewing audience and creating a vicious  
 
cycle of declining financial stability and health./31  
 
One indication of the necessity of carriage to the financial  
 
stability  of  broadcast  stations  is  the  difficulty  stations  
 
encounter in obtaining financing if unable to secure carriage./32  
 
In addition, Congress had evidence that the growth of the broadcast  
 
industry had been negatively impacted by the demise of the FCC's  
 
1986  must-carry rules  (referred to as the Century must-carry  
 
rules)/33 in 1987./34 
 
The Defendants' experts have submitted additional evidence  
 
which supports the importance of cable carriage to insure the  
 
viability and health of the broadcast industry.  See Declarations  
 
of David Schutz/35, Dr. Roger Noll, Dr. John Haring, Dr. Jeffrey  
 
Rohlfs/36, Jonathan Abbott37, Dr. James Dertouzos. The cable  
 
industry recognizes that "[w]ith cable penetration now exceeding  
 
70% in many markets, the ability of a broadcast television station  
 
to reach its audience through cable television is crucial . . . .   
 
The loss of cable carriage could cause a significant decrease in a  
 
station's ratings and a resulting loss in advertising revenues. 1138  
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the government  
 
has met its burden of showing that there was substantial evidence  
 
that  "the economic health of local broadcasting is in genuine  
 
jeopardy and in need of the protections afforded by must-carry.  
 
Turner at 2470. 
 
Narrow Tailoring 
 
The government also bears the burden of showing that the must-  
 
carry provisions do not "burden substantially more speech than is  
 
necessary  to  further  the  government's  legitimate  interests."  
 
Turner at 2470, citing Ward, 491 U.S. at 799.  The intermediate  
 
scrutiny analysis must begin with the "actual effects" of the law  
 
on the cable industry. Turner at 2472.  The Supreme Court stated  
 
that a determination on the tailoring question cannot be made  
 
"unless we know the extent to which the must-carry provisions in  
 
fact interfere with protected speech."  Id.  The answers to the  
 
following questions are critical - "the extent to which cable  
 
operators will, in fact be forced to make changes in their current  
 
or anticipated programming selections; the degree to which cable  
 
programmers will be dropped from cable systems to make room for  
 
local broadcasters; and the extent to which cable operators can  
 
satisfy their must-carry obligations by devoting previously unused  
 
channel capacity to the carriage of local broadcasters."  Id.  
 
i . Actual Effects 
 
There was substantial evidence before Congress from which it  
 
could have drawn a reasonable inference that the burden to the  
 
cable industry as a consequence of the must-carry provisions would  
 
not be substantial.  There is no doubt that the evidence before  
 
Congress indicated that in 1992 the cable industry was healthy and  
 
expanding.   The cable  industry itself provided evidence  that  
 
technological developments would soon vastly increase the channel  
 
capacity  of  cable  systemsO    The  National  Cable  Television  
 
Association ("NCTA") reported that the development of fiber optic  
 
cable meant that "[t]he existing coaxial cable to every home is  
 
theoretically  capable  of  carrying  100-200  channels."/39 The  
 
Association further reported that  "all of  the  twenty largest  
 
multiple system operators (MSOs) already ha[d] begun installation  
 
of fiber within their systems, with the amount of fiber installed  
 
by these companies increasing 400 percent since 1988."/40   The  
 
Association predicted that "consumers who today can choose from  
 
dozens of cable channels soon will have a video menu of well over  
 
100 options."/41 
 
Additional  evidence  from  Plaintiffs'  own  expert  further  
 
confirms Congress' prediction.   According to Dr. Peter Shapiro,  
 
there are approximately 11,628 cable systems nationwide.   The  
 
average cable system has a capacity of 43 channels, which means  
 
that the cable industry's total channel capacity is over 500,000  
 
channels.  Five thousand eight hundred and eighty local broadcast  
 
stations were added to cable systems as a result of the must-carry  
 
rules.  Based on these numbers, it becomes apparent that only 1.2  
 
percent of the cable channel capacity is occupied by broadcast  
 
stations added to cable systems as a result of the must-carry  
 
rules./42  At least 69% of the cable systems have not been required  
 
to  add  any broadcast  station  since  the  rules  were  adopted.  
 
Accordingly,  cable  operators  have  not  been  "forced to make"  
 
substantial "changes in their current or anticipated programming  
 
selections" as a result of the must-carry rules. Turner at 2472.  
 
Moreover,  evidence  from Dr.  Shapiro,  Plaintiffs'  expert,  
 
indicates that the degree to which cable programmers have been  
 
dropped from or repositioned by cable systems to make room for  
 
local broadcasters has been limited. Dr. Shapiro reports that only  
 
640 out of 11,628 cable systems have had to drop even a single  
 
programmer from their line-ups due to the addition of broadcast  
 
stations as a result of the must-carry provisions.  He estimated  
 
that the total number of drops occasioned by the must-carry rules  
 
is 780 and that only 530 of these drops have been drops of cable  
 
programmers.  The President of Telecommunications, Inc. (TCI), the  
 
largest multiple-cable system operator  (MSO)  in the  country,  
 
testified that TCI has been able to add programming which was  
 
dropped as a result of the must-carry rules as the channel capacity  
 
of its cable systems has increased.   DAE Vol.  VI.A,  Exh.  2,  
 
Clouston Dep. at 63-64.   As to repositioning, Dr. Shapiro reported  
 
that only 1,350 cable systems reported that they had repositioned  
 
any programming as a result of must-carry.  These systems indicated  
 
that they had repositioned a total of 1,740 programmers, 1,385 of  
 
which were cable programmers./43 
 
The statistics cited by Dr.  Shapiro indicate that cable  
 
operators have been able to satisfy their must-carry obligations  
 
87+ of the time by devoting previously unused channel capacity to  
 
the carriage of local broadcasters.  Dr. Shapiro indicated that in  
 
order to carry the 5,880 broadcast stations added as a result of  
 
the must-carry rules,  640 cable systems had to drop only 780  
 
programming services. DAE II.A., Exh. 5, Shooshan Decl. 14./44  
 
Not only does the Plaintiffs'  evidence indicate that the  
 
burden due to the must-carry rules has been small, but also the  
 
evidence demonstrates that this burden is likely to diminish as the  
 
channel capacity increases.  The Supreme Court itself recognized  
 
that "given the rapid advances in fiber optics and digital  
 
compression technology, soon there may be no practical limitation  
 
on the number of speakers who may use the cable medium."  Turner at  
 
2457.    Paul  Kagan Associates,  Inc.,  which  the  parties  have  
 
stipulated is "a widely respected source of data and information  
 
concerning the cable and television industries," made the following  
 
predictions regarding the increasing number of cable channels which  
 
would become available to the average television household:  
 
1996: 59 
1997: 69 
1998: 80 
1999: 93 
2000: 111 
2001: 135 
2002: 157 
2003: 180 
 
DAE Vol. II.A., Exh. 5, Shooshan Aff., Exh. T (The Kagan Media  
 
Index, Sept. 30, 1994).  The introduction of digital compression  
 
technology is expected to fuel the expansion of channel capacity.  
 
See oenerally The Cable Television Industry: New Technologies, New  
 
Opportunities and New Competition, March 8, 1993 (DAE Vol., 
VII.R.,  
 
Exh. 426) at 42-43.  As this Court noted in its last opinion, "At  
 
some point, technological innovation will enable cable systems to  
 
accommodate all broadcasters requesting carriage, thereby rendering  
 
'must-carry' a problem of the past."  819 F. Supp. at 54, n. 5.  
 
ii. Tailoring 
 
Having determined that the burden to the cable industry is  
 
quite small and is expected to diminish,  the question becomes  
 
whether the burden on protected speech is "substantially more .  
 
than  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  government's  legitimate  
 
interests."  Turner at 2469 (citing Ward, 491 U.S. at 799).  Under  
 
intermediate scrutiny, there need not be a perfect fit between the  
 
means and the ends as with strict scrutiny analysis.  
 
While the "[g]overnment may not regulate expression in such a  
 
manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not  
 
serve to advance its goals,"  a regulation under the intermediate  
 
standard of scrutiny "will not be invalid simply because a court  
 
concludes that the government's interest could be adequately served  
 
by some less-speech-restrictive alternative." Ward at 799-800.  
 
The narrow tailoring standard is satisfied "'so long as the  
 
regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be  
 
achieved less effectively absent the regulation.'" Id.  (citing  
 
United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 6756, 689 (1985)).  Under this  
 
standard, "the government is not required to settle for means that  
 
serve its interests less effectively merely because an alternative  
 
might be less burdensome."  Turner, 819 F.Supp. at 47.  
 
Plaintiffs assert that the must-carry rules fail the narrow  
 
tailoring  test  because  there  are  less-restrictive  means  of  
 
achieving the government's purpose.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs  
 
contend that there were some five less restrictive alternatives.  
 
These are: 1) adoption of the Century Rules;/45 2) use of A/B  
 
switches  which  allow viewers  to  switch  from  receiving  cable  
 
reception to receiving over-the-air broadcast reception; 3) direct  
 
governmental  subsidies  to  local  disadvantaged,  over-the-air  
 
broadcasters; 4) imposition of charges for  carriage; and  5)  
 
policing of  cable operators'  alleged abuses of power through  
 
antitrust and FCC enforcement.  But even assuming that they would  
 
be less burdensome, it is clear they are not in any respect as  
 
effective in achieving the government", important objectives - 1)  
 
promoting  fair  competition  in  the  market  for  television  
 
programming; 2) preserving the benefits of free, over-the-air local  
 
broadcast television; and 3) promoting the widespread dissemination  
 
of information from a multiplicity of sources.  
 
i . Century Rules 
 
The Century cable rules,  which were imposed by the FCC,  
 
clearly would not come close to providing the coverage as that  
 
provided by the 1992 Cable Act rules.   Plaintiff Turner readily  
 
admitted that "86% of the must carry broadcast stations that were  
 
added under the Cable Act rules would not have been required to be  
 
added under the Century rules." Turner Memo. at 55 (emphasis in  
 
original).  The stations opting for carriage under the must-carry  
 
provisions of the Cable Act are the very stations that would in all  
 
likelihood be dropped in the absence of such rules.  
 
ii . A/B Switches 
 
With respect to "A/B" switches, there was substantial evidence  
 
before Congress from which it could reasonably conclude that these  
 
switches do not represent an equally effective alternative.  The  
 
then President and Chief Executive Officer of Plaintiff National  
 
Cable Television Association ("NCTA"), James P. Mooney, testified  
 
before Congress that by using the A/B switch  
 
"the subscriber would lose the picture-improvement feature of the 
cable antenna service.   In addition, all but a handful of hand-held 
remote control units now in use would be rendered partially or 
altogether ineffective. Predictably,  consumers  would  be  puzzled,  
and  many angered, by the 'switched signals.'"/46  
 
The  "risk of signal degradation and signal leakage" were also  
 
problems of which Congress was apprised by Adelphia 
Communications,  
 
a multiple system operator ("MSO")./47 
 
The NCTA's Committee on Engineering concluded that the costs  
 
entailed by A/B switches "far outweigh the benefits" because "of  
 
the inconvenience that they will cause the subscriber" and "because  
 
the subscriber will not have a VHF antenna capable of receiving  
 
off-air [broadcast] signals. 1148 Congress also had before it the  
 
results of a 1991 consumer survey which found that  
 
"consumers are not willing to use A/B switches.   Four years after the 
FCC began a mandatory consumer education program about A/B 
switches, of all sets connected to a cable system, less than 12 percent 
also were connected to an antenna and an A/B switch.   Only half  of  
those households  could  recall  ever using  the A/B  switch. 
Consumers  appear  unwilling  to  bear  the  expense  of subscribing to 
cable and of maintaininq an adequate antenna for off-the-air reception 
."  
 
Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,  
 
H.R. Rep. No. 628, 102d Cong., 2d Sess.  (June 29, 1992) at 54, CR  
 
00433. 
 
The evidence produced subsequent to the remand also confirms  
 
that A/B switches would not be effective.  Defendants' expert, Mr.  
 
Eldon Haakinson, stated that switching between broadcast and cable  
 
reception "by using an A/B switch may involve substantial equipment  
 
complexity, viewer inconvenience, and a compromised ability to use  
 
many features of the home entertainment system."/49 A 1993 survey  
 
conducted by TCI found that 68+ of consumers find A/B switches  
 
"fairly or very inconvenient."/50 
 
iii. Subsidies 
 
It is extremely difficult to analyze whether direct government  
 
subsidies represent a viable alternative,  let alone an equally  
 
viable alternative to the must-carry provisions of the Cable Act,  
 
given that the structure of the subsidies has not yet been set  
 
forth by either the Plaintiffs or Congress.  Several problems come  
 
to mind with respect to a subsidy program.  
 
First,  fiscal  realities  could  render  the  alternative  a  
 
nullity.   Present and future budget restraints might reduce the  
 
enactment of subsidy legislation.  + Time Warner Entertainment  
 
Co.. L.P. v. F.C.C., 56 Fo3d 151, 186 (D.C. Cir. 1995)  (Randolph,  
 
J.) (under intermediate standard of scrutiny analysis of FCC's rate  
 
regulation of cable television operators, D.C. Circuit found that  
 
alternative remedy would be 'unworkable").  Second, Congress would  
 
have to make the complex determinations as to who to subsidize, how  
 
much the subsidy would be and when the subsidy would end.   In  
 
deciding who to subsidize, Congress would have to steer away from  
 
content decisions because of First Amendment concerns.   If the  
 
subsidy  were  too  large,  Congress  would  be  guaranteeing  the  
 
continued  existence  of  a  broadcast  station  which  would  not  
 
otherwise have been able to survive.  The must-carry rules simply  
 
ensure that a broadcast station will have equal access to the  
 
viewers - they do not guarantee the financial viability of the  
 
broadcast industry or any of its members.  
 
The Court is simply unable to make an informed analysis of  
 
this proposed alternative to which the Plaintiffs have attached no  
 
significant details.   Certainly, it is not this Court's role to  
 
engage experts to develop a proposed subsidy alternative which  
 
might be equally viable but less burdensome to protected speech.  
 
Plaintiffs have not suggested an alternative which this Court can  
 
test. 
 
iv. Leased Access 
 
The  expansion  of  leased  access  carriage  also  does  not  
 
represent an equally effective alternative.  Congress specifically  
 
prchibited cable operators from charging stations for carriage  
 
under the must-carry provisions.  Many of the stations invoking the  
 
must-carry protections are economically vulnerable and would not be  
 
able  to pay a  carriage  charge  or  would have  to  reduce  the  
 
expenditures on their programming in order to pay the fee.   As  
 
such, the quantity and quality of programming available to non-  
 
cable households would be diminished. 
 
v. Antitrust Remedies/ Ad Hoc Complaint Procedures  
 
Antitrust remedies and ad hoc complaint procedures also fail  
 
the equally effective test.  The problems to be cured by the must-  
 
carry provisions are not susceptible to regulation by the antitrust  
 
laws.   What  is  more,  even  if  it  could accomplish Congress'  
 
objective, antitrust litigation is very time-consuming, cumbersome  
 
and expensive.  As Robert Schmidt of the Wireless Cable Association  
 
testlfied,  "it  is not a very satisfactory solution to expect  
 
individual, entrepreneurial, start-up companies, who are relatively  
 
less well funded, to take on some of the country's largest [cable]  
 
companies on a case-by-case, market-by-market basis in antitrust  
 
litigation."/51 
 
Plaintiffs  suggest  that  a  complaint  procedure  could  be  
 
established before the FCC in which the "FCC . . . would resolve in  
 
individual  cases,  whether  noncarriage  of  a  local  broadcast  
 
station[]  reflects a reasonable business decision of the cable  
 
operator or one tainted by anti-competitive incentives."  TW Memo.  
 
at 81.   Such a procedure -- regulation by exception -- would  
 
necessarily create an enormous administrative burden. See  Time  
 
Warner Entertainment Co..L.P. v. F.C.C., 56 F.3d 151 (D.C. Cir.  
 
1995) (Randolph, J.) (rejected holding a cost-of-service proceeding  
 
for each regulated cable system as a viable alternative because the  
 
alternative "would also cause operators to incur expenses and would  
 
in any event be unworkable in light of administrative burdens.")  
 
B. Other Matters 
 
There are three remaining ancillary claims raised by the  
 
Plaintiffs, namely: (1) that the must-carry provisions constitute  
 
an unlawful taking of private property;  (2) that the must-carry  
 
provisions are invalid as applied to  "predominantly religious  
 
television stations;" and (3) that provisions regarding low power  
 
stations are not content neutral and are violative of the First  
 
Amendment. 
 
With respect to the takings issue, the Court does not believe  
 
the issue is one to be decided on summary judgment at this stage of  
 
the proceedings.  The parties did not argue this issue on appeal  
 
and have given it only limited treatment on remand.  Indeed, there  
 
is some question whether the Plaintiffs' failure to raise their  
 
Fifth Amendment takings claim before the Supreme Court results in  
 
a waiver of that claim. 
 
Even if not waived, a takings claim seems out of place in this  
 
litigation which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, a remedy  
 
rarely available for takings claims. See, e.g., Ruckelshaus v.  
 
Monsanto Co.,  467 U.S.  986  (1981);  First Evanaelical Lutheran  
 
Church v. County of Los Anaeles, 482 U S. 304 (1987).  Obviously,  
 
if it is determined that sections 4 and 5 do effect a taking -- an  
 
issue  the  Court  is not  here  deciding  --  a payment  of  just  
 
compensation would cure any constitutional infirmity.  Although a  
 
takings  claim  invokes  the  Fifth Amendment,  such  a  claim  if  
 
sustained would not necessarily invalidate the 1992 Cable Act in  
 
its totality.  As such, a takings clainl does not appear to be the  
 
type of challenge which 47 U.S.C. 555(c)(1) requires be litigated  
 
before a three judge panel.  These claims, because they pertain to  
 
specific property interests, are best dealt with on a case-by-case  
 
basis.  An appropriate forum for such determinations would be the  
 
United States Court of Federal Claims.   28 U.S.C. 1491(a)(1).  
 
Perhaps more important, we do not want: to dilute the issues the  
 
Supreme  Court  has asked us  to address with consideration of  
 
ancillary matters not expressly remanded to us.  
 
Accordingly,  we  will  dismiss  the  takings  claim  without  
 
prejudice.  After the constitutionality of sections 4 and 5 are  
 
definitively resolved, Plaintiffs may reassert their takings claim  
 
before the appropriate forum.   All parties will preserve all  
 
procedural and substantive rights. 
 
The Court also has been presented with a religious challenge  
 
to the must-carry provisions.  Specifically, Plaintiff-intervenor  
 
Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasting ("AIB") moves for partial summary  
 
judgment and a declaration that sections 4 and 5 of the 1992 Cable  
 
Act violate the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the  
 
First Amendment. 
 
We believe this issue was properly dealt with by this Court's  
 
earlier majority opinion, which held that the must-carry provisions  
 
were consistent with both the Establishment and the Free Exercise  
 
Clauses of the First Amendment.  Turner, 819 F. Supp. at 49.  Since  
 
the Supreme Court did not disturb this holding, the Court will  
 
treat this issue as having been decided.  
 
The  final matter before this Court  is  the  issue of  the  
 
content-neutrality of the 1992 Cable Act provisions relating to low  
 
power  stations.   Under certain circumstances,  the must-carry  
 
provisions require carriage of one or more qualified low power  
 
stations.  47 U.S.C. 534(c).  A low power station is qualified for  
 
carriage if the FCC determines,  amony other things,  that the  
 
station's programming "would address local news and informational  
 
needs  which  are  not  being  adequately  served  by  full  power  
 
television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of  
 
such full power stations from the low power station's community of  
 
license."   534(h)(2)(B).   In addition, the FCC may qualify for  
 
must-carry privileges an otherwise ineligible low power station,  
 
depending in part  on whether the  requesting station provides  
 
coverage of news,  sports or other items  "of  interest  to the  
 
community."  534(h)(1)(C)(i) /52 
 
Noting that this Court in its earlier opinion did not address  
 
whether these particular provisions are content-based, the Supreme  
 
Court remanded the issue for us to consider the "content-neutral or  
 
content-based character" of the provisions.  IhLn+, 114 S.Ct. at  
 
2460, n. 6. 
 
Although the provisions at issue here are very close to  
 
content-based legislation triggering strict scrutiny, we do not  
 
believe that they cross the line.  As noted in this Court's earlier  
 
opinion, the low power stations provisions are viewpoint-neutral.  
 
Moreover, nothing in the record suggests in any manner that the  
 
provisions were motivated by a desire to promote or discourage  
 
broadcast of certain messages.  See, Ward v. Rock Aaainst Racism,  
 
491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989)  (noting that the "principal inquiry in  
 
determining content-neutrality...is whether the government has  
 
adopted  a  regulation  of  speech  because  of  [agreement  or]  
 
disagreement with the message it conveys").  Indeed, we note that  
 
the government's interest in ensuring the viability of "over-the-  
 
air broadcasting" seems to be especially on point here, as the low  
 
power stations are the ones that are particularly economically  
 
sensitive  to  cable's  increasing market  power.    Applying  the  
 
standard  of  intermediate  scrutiny,  we  do  not  believe  these  
 
provisions run afoul of the Supreme Court's admonitions regarding  
 
First Amendment protections. 
 
It is far from clear that the Plaintiffs have asserted a  
 
potential injury sufficient to grant them standing with respect to  
 
this claim.   Were the statute to make all low power stations  
 
qualified for must-carry,  the provisions would withstand First  
 
Amendment scrutiny for the reasons stated with respect to their  
 
full power counterparts.  To the extent the provisions, as passed,  
 
exclude certain low power stations from must-carry eligibility, the  
 
challenged provisions limit the number of stations for which the  
 
Plaintiffs could be required to provide carriage.  In doing so, the  
 
provisions potentially ameliorate the impact of the must-carry  
 
provisions on the Plaintiffs.  Even if Plaintiffs could articulate  
 
a basis for vindicating the rights of those low power stations  
 
excluded from the protections of the must-carry provisions, there  
 
is nothing in the statute which precludes the cable companies from  
 
voluntarily granting carriage to any low power station, whether or  
 
not it is entitled to qualified status. 
 
Finally,  it  must  be  remembered  that  this  is  an  action  
 
essentially for declaratory relief.  Nothing in this opinion would  
 
present any cable company, or indeed any low power station, from  
 
seeking relief or raising a First Amendment argument should a  
 
specific application of these provisions cause a clear injury.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
After three long years of hearings and investigation, Congress  
 
made the judgment that the broadcast industry was in need of the  
 
protections afforded by the must-carry provisions in order to  
 
promote  fair  competition,  prese!rve  free,  over-the-air  local  
 
broadcast television and promote the widespread dissemination of  
 
information from a multiplicity of sources.   Congress enacted  
 
comprehensive, prophylactic measures to avert a storm that it saw  
 
gathering on the horizon.   By its actions,  Congress sought to  
 
"neutraliz[e] the adverse effects of cable companies' monopolistic  
 
behavior."  Id. at 54. 
 
As stated by the Supreme Court in its opinion,  courts are  
 
compelled to accord substantial deference to Congress' predictive  
 
judgments.  In the extensive record compiled by Congress, there is  
 
substantial  evidence  from  which  Congress  could  have  drawn  
 
reasonable  inferences  that  the  must-carry  regulations  were  
 
necessary to protect the economic health of the broadcast industry  
 
and that the burden to cable industry imposed by the regulations  
 
would not be substantial.  Additional evidence produced during the  
 
remand proceedings confirms Congress' judgments./53  
 
The means which Congress chose to avert the evil which it had  
 
identified  satisfy  the  narrow  tailoring  test.    Intermediate  
 
scrutiny  does  not  require  a  perfect  fit,  and  none  of  the  
 
alternatives suggested would be as equally effective in promoting  
 
Congress' goals.  In this case, Congress conducted a comprehensive  
 
investigation and engaged in thoughtful analysis.  The laws which  
 
it enacted are appropriate and do not offend the Constitution.  
 
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that sections  
 
4 and 5 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition  
 
Act of 1992 survive the "intermediate level of scrutiny applicable  
 
to content-neutral restrictions that impose only an incidental  
 
burden on speech"  as set forth in O'Brien.   Turner at 2469.  
 
Accordingly, the Court grants the Defelldants' motions for summary  
 
judgment and denies the Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment.  
 
For the foregoing reasons, it is, this  1st day of December, 1995,  
 
ORDERED that plaintiffs' claim that: the must-carry provisions  
 
constitute an unconstitutional taking without just compensation is  
 
DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE; and it is, 
 
FURTHER ORDERED, that, with respect to all remaining issues, 
Plaintiffs'  motions  for  summary  judgment  are  DENIED,  and 
Defendants motions for summary judgment are GRANTED.

Jackson, J., concurring. 
 
 
Left to my own inclination, for the reasons set forth below  
 
I would deny both cross-motions for summary judgment and set this  
 
case for trial.  My colleagues, however, are persuaded to  
 
opposite conclusions on the merits on the record presently before  
 
us.  Were I to follow my own predisposition as a minority of one  
 
I would nevertheless prevail by stalemate, which should not be.  
 
Thus, obliged to choose between two forcefully argued but  
 
contradictory analyses of what I find to be a most ambiguous  
 
record -- eloquent testimony, I believe, as to why a trial is  
 
necessary -- in order that the case be decided I elect to concur  
 
with District Judge Sporkin: I am satisfied that, taken at face  
 
value, the evidence before Congress in 1992 of an impending  
 
demise of local boadcastinq was at least "substantial" enough to  
 
warrant its prediction (a prediction, I note, to which we are  
 
instructed to accord a similar measure of deference whether we  
 
are convinced or not) in the absence of must-carry.  Turner  
 
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. F.C.C., 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2471 (1994)  
 
("Turner") I am also prepared to accept as minimal the burden  
 
must-carry imposes on the cable industry's First Amendment rights  
 
of free speech in default of a genuine Fifth Amendment Takings  
 
Clause challenge based upon the fact that must-carry is for free.  
 
In Turner, the Supreme Court vacated our judgment upholding  
 
the 1992 Cable Act,/1 which we had also granted on cross-motions  
 
for summary judgment, and remanded the case to us for further  
 
proceedings consistent with its opinion.  Finding genuine issues  
 
of material fact still to be resolved, 114 S. Ct. at 2472, the  
 
Supreme Court directed us to develop a more thorough factual  
 
record and to resolve any factual disputes remaining before  
 
passing upon the constitutional validity of the must-carry  
 
provisions of the 1992 Cable Act. Id.  The ultimate issue, viz.,  
 
whether the must-carry provisions of the 1992 Cable Act  
 
impermissibly infringe upon the First Amendment rights of free  
 
speech of cable TV operators and programmers, remains unchanged.  
 
Specifically, we were directed to determine the factual  
 
validity of the Congressional premise upon which the Act was  
 
based, namely, that without the must-carry provisions, "the  
 
economic health of local broadcasting is in genuine jeopardy.'l  
 
Td. at 2470.  Then, if the evidence offered reasonable support  
 
for the premise, we were to consider the impact of must-carry on  
 
the cable operators and programmers affected.  Id. at 2472.  
 
Although both sides insist that the case is still  
 
susceptible of disposition on their cross-motions for summary  
 
judgment, the record they have assembled after extensive post-  
 
remand discovery belies it.  They have been unable to agree on a  
 
common statement of the case after several attempts to do so, and  
 
most of the data I can extract from their separate submissions,  
 
when cabined by the response from the other side, I find to be  
 
intractably ambiguous. 
 
We have previously found, as did Congress, that by 1990 over  
 
50 percent of American households received video signals Yl+  
 
cable, having increased from less than half that figure a decade  
 
earlier, and the rate at which cable service is expanding allows  
 
a prediction of still more, perhaps as much as 70 percent, by the  
 
turn of the century.  Virtually all localities are served by a  
 
single cable operator of whom nearly a half are controlled by  
 
four or five conglomerates, known as "multiple systems operators"  
 
("MSO's"). 
 
Defendants' central premise, apparently accepted by  
 
Congress, is that the typical local cable operator is or will  
 
soon be one monopolist in the control of another, a component of  
 
an elite oligopoly of MSO's who guard the electronic "gate" to  
 
most of America's TV screens. 
 
Of the market forces at work, we know that the lifeblood of  
 
broadcasting is advertising.  Advertisers place their accounts  
 
with the medium offering the greatest dissemination.  Cable  
 
companies compete with local broadcasters for advertising.  It is  
 
therefore to the cable industry's advantage to carry programming  
 
from which it will likely derive advertising revenue as well as  
 
subscription income.  Interlocking ownership of cable operation  
 
and programming interests compounds the problem.  Other factors  
 
being neutral, cable operators prefer to carry the programming of  
 
affiliated programmers in whose advertising revenue they share  
 
than that of  competing broadcasters who pay them nothing.  
 
How significant are these forces, operating in the economic  
 
universe premised by defendants and Congress?  Here, the  
 
ambiguity of the truly uncontroverted facts I am able to quarry  
 
from the record precludes any definite conclusions in which I am  
 
sufficiently confident to submit to the Supreme Court as a basis  
 
for constitutional judgment. 
 
For example, the defenders of the Act tell us that even in  
 
the first two post-Act years cable operators' local advertising  
 
revenues increased by almost half and fill more than double by  
 
the years 2001 to nearly $3.0 billion.  Plaintiffs respond that  
 
virtually all of the cable industry's income has been, is now,  
 
and always will be derived from subscriptions.  Advertising  
 
accounted for less than five percent of the industry's income in  
 
1992 and is not likely to exceed 10 percent until well into the  
 
next century. 
 
Be that as it may, defendants rejoin, in the five or so  
 
years antedating the Cable Act of 1992 over half of the nation's  
 
local broadcast stations, particularly in the smaller markets,  
 
went from being profitable to otherwise.  More than a dozen had  
 
ceased operations altogether, and nearly twice as many were in  
 
bankruptcy. 
 
Profitable or not, the plaintiffs reply, in absolute numbers  
 
broadcasters increased from about 1200 to over 1500 in roughly  
 
the same period.  Those in bankruptcy represent less than two  
 
percent of the total. 
 
Plaintiffs reject the causal connection postulated by the  
 
defendants between cable carriage, or lack of it, and the  
 
prosperity vel non of local broadcasters as mostly conjectural,  
 
or no better than post hoc ergo propter hoc.  There are many  
 
reasons why particular stations succeed or fail.  As a general  
 
proposition, they say, local broadcasters with network  
 
affiliations particularly in the larger markets, were not only  
 
profitable but increasingly so from 1987 through 1992.  
 
How important nevertheless do local broadcasters themselves  
 
regard must-carry to be?  So important, defendants tell us, that  
 
more than a third of them immediately demanded it on one or more  
 
cable systems, foregoing the option to negotiate a fee for  
 
retransmission rights to their signals..  Plaintiffs dismiss that  
 
assertion as standing the significance of the statistic on its  
 
head: the other two-thirds of all broadcast signals are now being  
 
retransmitted by cable operators who are paying the broadcasters  
 
for the right to do so, and some broadcasters who demanded must-  
 
carry on one cable system are being paid for retransmission  
 
rights on another.  In any event, with or without must-carry,  
 
most cable operators have generally transmitted the signals of  
 
local broadcasters in their service areas as a matter of "viewer  
 
preferencell because their subscribers want the service.  
 
Turning to a consideration of the burden imposed by must-  
 
carry on the cable industry, how intrusive has it been on the  
 
cable operators' autonomy to carry their programming of choice?  
 
We are told by defendants that somewhat less than 6000 cable  
 
channels nationwide have been conscripted by broadcasters  
 
invoking must-carry, whereas the cable industry' 8 total channel  
 
capacity has increased since 1992 by nearly 90,000 channels; for  
 
every channel pre-empted by a broadcaster 14 more have come on  
 
line.  The cable industry responds that its technological  
 
advances have occurred unevenly across the country; more than  
 
two-thirds of the nation's households today are served by cable  
 
operators who possess no excess channel capacity whatsoever.  
 
Moreover, replete as this record is with equivocal data as  
 
it relates to competition between conventional broadcasting and  
 
conventional cable, it is also conspicuously barren of  
 
information about still other market forces that may have vastly  
 
more significance in the immediate future, and will bear directly  
 
upon such issues as how long must-carry should constitutionally  
 
be allowed to last.  We are told little, for example, about the  
 
effects to be anticipated from direct broadcast satellite and  
 
telephone company competition, or impending legislation.  Nor are  
 
we able to discern much about the attitudes of the public itself,  
 
assuming consumer preferences were of concern to Congress at the  
 
time of the 1992 Cable Act and remain so today./2  
 
The Supreme Court has reminded us that in addition to our  
 
obligation to "accord substantial deference to the predictive  
 
judgments of Congress," 114 S. Ct. at 2471, we do not have a  
 
"license to reweigh the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress'  
 
factual predictions with our own." Id.  We are to ask only if  
 
Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based upon substantial  
 
evidence.  I am also aware that neither side believes a trial is  
 
necessary.  Nevertheless, the totality of the evidence of record  
 
here, with the myriad inferences that can be drawn from it,  
 
convinces me that a reasonable trier-of-fact could return a  
 
verdict for either party, depending upon whose evidence best  
 
survived the adversarial process.  In such circumstances, to my  
 
understanding, a trial becomes inevitahle.  See Anderson v.  
 
Liberty Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986).

SUPREME COURT STATE OF NEW YORK 
 
Present: 
 
Hon. Stuart L. Aim 
 
STRATTON OAKMONT, INC. 
and DANIEL PORUSH, 
 
Plaintiff(s), 
 
-against- 
 
PRODIGY SERVICES COMPANY, a 
partnership or joint venture with 
IBM CORPORATION AND SEARS ROEBUCK 
& COMPANY, "JOHN DOE" and "MARY 
ROE", 
 
Defendant(s) 
 
The following papers read on this motion: 
Notice of Motion 
Memo of Law in Support 
Amicus Memo - Authors Guild, Inc. 
Affidavit of Plaintiff's Counsel 
Replay Affidavit 
 
Upon the foregoing papers, it is ordered that this motion 
by Defendant, for an order granting renewal and/or 
reargument of the  Plaintiff's motion for partial summary 
judgment is disposed of as hereinafter provided. 
 
By order dated May 24, 1995, this Court determined, inter 
alia,  that the Defendant PRODIGY SERVICES COMPANY 
("PRODIGY"), was a  "publisher" of certain statements 
concerning Plaintiffs which  appeared on its "Money Talk" 
computer bulletin board for the  purposes of Plaintiffs' 
libel claims in this action. 
 
It will suffice, to note that the Court's decision has 
received  wide attention.  Obviously, recent advances in 
computer  technology have caused what some commentators 
have called  "explosive growth" in the Internet and its 
usage.  What was once  a tool used only by a handful of 
researchers and scientists has  become a means of 
entertainment, education and business which is  used by 
millions of people on a daily basis. 
 
As a result, and largely because there is very little legal 
precedent directly on point, the Court's decision of May 
24,  1995, has been highly publicized in the media and in 
legal  circles.  Presumably, the reason for this attention 
is that the  decision offers some guidance for the 
"cyber-content provider [in determining] what its 
responsibilities and/or liabilities  are...(Lieberstein and 
Landa, Content Provider Liability:  Publishers or 
Vendors?), State Bar News, Vol. 37, No. 6, p.11). 
 
Against this background, PRODIGY moves for reargument 
and/or renewal of the motion and the Plaintiffs have 
decided not to oppose the motion (Affidavit of Jacob 
Zamansky, sworn to October 23, 1995).  Indeed, there have 
been media reports that the parties have decided to 
"settle" this case. Those reports are, to the best of the 
Court's knowledge, inaccurate as PRODIGY has thus far 
insisted that any settlement be conditioned upon vacatur of 
the Court's May 24, 1995 decision.  The Court has declined 
to vacate the order as part of a settlement package.  As 
recently noted by the Appellate Division, First Department: 
 
"While we appreciate the desirability of settlement, we do 
not believe it would be advisable to allow private parties 
to demand that the Court eradicate precedent which they 
personally find unacceptable on threat of burdensome 
litigation should the Court refuse.  Moreover, we note the 
conclusion of the Supreme Court that, to follow a policy in 
which private parties could agree to vacate a decision and 
order by agreement would not necessarily, as a general 
matter, serve the purpose of encouraging settlement, as the 
prospect of being able to eradicate a decision would it be 
unfavorable could well encourage the parties to postpone 
settlement until after a decision has been rendered (U.S. 
Bancorp Mortgage Co. v Bonner Mall Partnership [    U.S. 
, 115 S.Ct.386,393])" (Paramount Communications v Gibraltar 
Casualty Co., 212 AD2d 490, 490-491; 623 NYS2d 850). 
 
This logic is persuasive in this case especially 
considering the lack of guidance concerning, the "Internet" 
prior to the Court's decision.  In other words, the Court 
finds that this is a developing area of the law (in which 
it appears that the law has thus far not kept pace with the 
technology) so that there is a real need for some 
precedent.  To simply vacate that precedent on request 
because these two parties (or this Plaintiff) has lost 
interest or decided that the litigation would be too costly 
or time consuming would remove the only existing New York 
precedent in this area leaving the law even further behind 
the technology. 
 
Turning then to the issue of renewal or reargument, it is 
clear beyond question that this is a motion for renewal. 
 
"A motion to reargue is based on no new proof; it simply 
seeks to convince the court that it was wrong and ought to 
change it's mind.  The motion to renew is based on new or 
additional proof not used the first time around." (Siegel, 
New York Practice, Second Edition, 254). 
 
By this standard, there can be no doubt that this is a 
motion for renewal rather than reargument.  Indeed, 
PRODIGY's counsel, in his supporting affidavit refers to 
PRODIGY's failure to provide this "new" information on the 
original motion as an "oversight" (Affidavit of Martin 
Garbus, Esq., sworn to July 6, 1995 para.2, p.1). 
 
Indeed, an examination of the original papers in comparison 
with the renewal papers reveals a number of drastic 
differences.  For example, PRODIGY's former employee 
Willard McDowell has submitted an Affidavit upon this 
application in which he now states that when he answered 
Plaintiffs' counsel's questions at a deposition concerning 
the Board Leaders he (McDowell) was "speculating" 
(affidavit of Willard McDowell, sworn to July 5, 1995, 
para.10, p.3).  Similarly, Jennifer Ambrozek, PRODIGY 
"Manager of Bulletin Board Communications" submits, upon 
renewal, her Affidavit concluding (inter alia) that upon 
the prior motion, the Court "was given the false impression 
that Prodigy possesses and exercises significant editorial 
control and judgment over the content of its bulletin 
boards."  (Affidavit of Jennifer Ambrozek, sworn to June 
30, 1995, para.2, p.1).  Neither Mr. McDowell nor Ms. 
Ambrozek submitted anything to the Court in opposition to 
the original motion notwithstanding the fact that portions 
of their deposition transcripts were appended by Plaintiffs 
to the original moving papers.  There has been no 
explanation for the failure to include an affidavit from 
Mr. McDowell or Ms. Ambrozek on the original application. 
 
"In support of a motion to renew pursuant to CPLR 2221, the 
moving party must show new facts as well as a justifiable 
excuse for not placing such facts before the Court in the 
first instance (see, Matter of Barnes v State of New York, 
159 AD2d 753, lv. dismissed 76 NY2d 816, 819; Foley v 
Roche, 68 AD2d 558, 568)."  (Zebrowski v Kitchens, 172 AD2d 
972, 973). 
 
While it is indeed true that the requirement for showing of 
a justifiable excuse is a "flexible" one, (i.e., the Court 
has some discretion in this regard) (see, Saferstein v 
Stark, 171 AD2d 856; Orenland v Miller Minuteman Constr. 
Corp., 133 Ad2d 816, 817-818; Sciascia v Nevins, 130 AD2d 
649, 650; Albanese v Village of Floral Park, 128 AD2d 612, 
614), in this case, it is clear that the "new" facts set 
forth by PRODIGY were well known to it at the time of the 
original application.  While this, standing alone, is 
insufficient to preclude an exercise of discretion to 
permit reargument, there has been absolutely no explanation 
offered for the failure to include these facts in the 
original opposing papers.  Before the Court can exercise 
its discretion, it must be presented with some reason to do 
so.  "Renewal is by no means guaranteed and 'is not a 
second chance freely given to parties who have not 
exercised due diligence in making their first factual 
presentation' (Matter of Beiny, 132, AD2d 190, lv. 
dismissed 71 NY2d 994; see Gulledge v Adams, 108 AD2d 
950)."  (Matter of Barnes v State of New York, supra, 
p.754). 
 
Accordingly, in the absence of an acceptable excuse for the 
failure to include this new proof in the original motion 
papers, PRODIGY's motion for renewal is denied.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA  
  
Alexandria Division  
  
RELIGIOUS TECHNOLOGY CENTER )   
  
Plaintiff,   
  
v.   
  
ARNALDO PAGLIARINA LERMA, DIGITAL GATEWAY SYSTEMS, THE   
WASHINGTON POST, MARC FISHER, and RICHARD LEIBY,   
  
Defendants.      
  
Civil Action No 95-1107-A  
  
MEMORANDUM OPINION  
  
Before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendants, The   
Washington Post, and two of its reporters, Marc Fisher and Richard Leiby   
(hereinafter referred to collectively as "The Post".)  A court may grant summary   
judgment "only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving   
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Miller v. Leathers, 913 F.2d   
1085, 87(4th Cir. 1990) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In ruling on such motions,   
the court must construe the facts and  all inferences drawn from those facts in   
favor of the non-moving party. Charbonnaves de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d406,   
414 (4th Cir. 1979). Having performed this analysis, the Court finds that   
summary judgment should be entered in favor of the defendants.  
  
1. UNDISPUTED FACTS  
  
The essential facts are not in dispute. In 1991, the Church of Scientology sued   
Steven Fishman, a disgruntled former member of the Church of Scientology, in   
the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Church of   
Scientology  Int'l v. Fishman, No. CV 91-6426. On April 14,1993, Fishman filed   
in the open court file what has come to be known as the Fishman affidavit, to   
which were attached 69 pages of what the Religious Technology Center ("RTC")   
describes as various Advanced Technology works,specifically levels OT-I   
through  OT-VII documents. Plaintiff claims that these documents are protected   
from both unauthorized use and unauthorized disclosure under the copyright   
laws of the United States and under trade secret laws, respectively.  
  
In California, the RTC moved to seal the Fishman affidavit,arguing that the   
attached OT documents were trade secrets. That motion was denied and the   
Ninth Circuit upheld the district court's decision not to seal the file. Church of   
Scientology Int'l v. Fishman, 35 F.3d 570 (9th Cir. 1994).The case was   
remanded for further proceedings and the district court again declined to seal the   
file, which remained unsealed until August 15, 1995.  
  
Defendant Arnaldo Lerma, another former Scientologist, obtained a copy of the   
Fishman affidavit and the attached documents. Lerma admits that on July 31 and   
August 1, 1995, he published the documents on the Internet through defendant   
Digital Gateway Systems ("DGS"), an Internet access provider. RTC, which   
regularly scans the Internet, discovered the publication of documents and on   
August 11,1995, warned Lerma to return the documents and not publish them   
any further. After Lerma refused to cooperate, RTC obtained a Temporary   
Restraining Order prohibiting Lerma from any further publication of the   
documents and a seizure warrant which authorized the United States Marshal to   
seize Lerma's personal computer, floppy disks and any copies of the copyrighted   
works of L. Ron Hubbard, the author of the documents.  
  
During the same time period, on or abut August 5 or 6,1995, Lerma sent a hard   
copy of the Fishman affidavit and attachments to Richard Leiby, an investigative   
reporter for The Washington Post. On August 12, 1995, counsel for RTC   
discovered this disclosure and approached  The Post, which was told that the   
Fishman affidavit might be stolen. In response to the RTC's representations, The   
Post returned the actual copy which Lerma had given it. However, The Post had   
by then learned that a copy of the same Fishman affidavit was available in the   
open court file in the United States District Court for the Central District of   
California. On August 14, 1995, The Post sent Kathryn Wexler, a news aide   
stationed in California, to that court to obtain a copy Fishman affidavit. The   
Clerk's office made a copy for Wexler, who then mailed it to Washington.   
Although it is undisputed that RTC staff members had been checking that file   
out and holding it all day to prevent anyone from seeing it, the file was not   
sealed and obviously was available, upon request, to any member of the public   
who wished to see it.  
  
The day after The Post obtained its copy of the Fishman affidavit, the RTC   
applied for a sealing order and the trial judge ordered the file sealed. However,   
there is no evidence in the record that the judge ordered The Post to return the   
copy made by the Clerk's office or that any kind of a restraining order was issued   
by that court against The Post.  
  
Five days later, on August 19, 1995, The Post published a news article, entitled   
_Church in Cyberspace: Its Sacred Writ is on the Net.  Its Lawyers are on the   
Case," written by defendant Marc Fisher. In that article, RTC's lawsuit against   
Lerma and the seizure of his computer equipment were discussed, as was the   
history of Scientology litigation against its critics and the growing use of the   
Internet by Scientology dissidents. The article included three brief quotes   
(totalling 46 words) from three of the documents. On August 22, 1995, the RTC   
filed its First Amended Verified Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Damages in   
which it added The Washington Post and its two reporters, Fisher and Leiby, as   
additional defendants. A Second Amended Verified was later filed and is now   
the subject of this summary judgment motion.  
  
II. THE COPYRIGHT CLAIM  
  
Although the Court has serious reservations about whether the documents at   
issue in this litigation are properly copyrighted, for the purposes of this motion,   
the Court assumes that the RTC holds properly registered, valid copyrights for   
the documents attached to the Fishman affidavit.  
  
The Post does not deny that it copied the documents and quoted from them. It   
argues, however, that this copying and these quotations fall squarely within the   
"fair user exception. Thus, the dispositive issue as to the copyright claim is   
whether or not The Post's use of the documents falls within the fair use   
exception to the copyright law. Under that exception, "the fair use of a copyright   
... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting ... or research, is not   
an infringement of copyright." 17 U.S.C.A.  107 (West Supp. 1995) (emphasis   
added).  As the Supreme Court has held "fair use is a mixed question of law and   
fact." Harper & Row Publishers Inc. v. Nation Enters, 471U.S. 539, 560 (1985).   
In the instant case, the Court finds no material facts in dispute; therefore, the   
issue can be resolved as a matter of law.  
  
At the outset of its opposition, the RTC argues that because the fair use doctrine   
is an equitable one, The Post should not be allowed to rely on defense because of   
unclean hands. Specifically, the RTC points to The Post's failure to disclose that   
it had made several copies of the Fishman affidavit. In an affidavit signed on   
September 26, 1995, Mary Ann Werner, a Post Vice President and counsel,   
averred that "only one copy of that [Fishman] declaration has been made." In   
fact, through discovery RTC has learned, and The Post does not dispute, that   
other copies were made. Wexler admits that she made an additional copy of the   
materials received from the Clerk's office. She sent that copy to Washington as   
well to ensure that Washington got a copy. A second copy was created, not by   
copying the Fishman affidavit which had been obtained in California, but by   
down loading a copy off the Internet. The Post argues persuasively here that the   
presence of the AT documents on the Internet was part of their very news   
worthiness and that making this copy was an act of legitimate   
newsgathering.  
  
A third copy of the AT documents was generated after Lerma sent a duplicate of   
the Fishman affidavit to Leiby via e-mail. That e-mail was copied to a disk in   
response to a demand by RTC's counsel on August 12, 1995, that The Post   
secure any materials it had been sent by Lerma. (SecondWerner Decl.    4-  
5).  
  
None of these acts of copying strike this Court as constituting unethical behavior   
and the Court is satisfied from her second declaration that Ms. Werner did not   
mislead the Court or counsel in referring to one copy. In any case, the Court   
agrees with The Post that the issue of unclean hands is a weak attempt by RTC   
to avoid the real issue of fair use.  
  
In determining whether the use of a copyrighted work is fair use and therefore   
not an infringement, the Court must consider four factors:  
  
1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a   
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  
  
2. the nature of the copyrighted work;  
  
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the   
copyrighted work as a whole;  
  
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted   
work.  
  
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself  bar a finding of fair use if   
such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.  
  
17 U.S.C.A.   107 (west Supp. 1995). These four statutory factors may not "be   
treated in isolation, one from another. All are to be explored, and the results   
weighed together, in light of the 6 purposes of copyright." Campbell v.Acuff-  
Rose Music Inc., 114 S. Ct. 1164, 1170-71 (1994). The interplay of the four   
factors is recognized elsewhere as well. See, e.g., Sony Corp. of America v.   
Universal Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 449-450 (1984) (reproduction of entire   
work "does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of  fair   
use" as to home videotaping of television programs); Harper & Row,Publishers,   
Inc. v. National Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 564(1985) ("[E]ven substantial   
quotations might qualify as fair use in a review of a published work or a news   
account of a speech" but not in a scoop of a soon-to-be-published memoir). Thus,   
we may not evaluate any single fair use factor in isolation.  
  
As to the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, there is no evidence   
in this record that The Post copied the documents for any purposes other than   
newsgathering, news reporting and responding to litigation. Although the RTC   
has argued that The Post harbors some animus towards Scientology, an unbiased   
observer would conclude that the Church of Scientology and its treatment of   
critics is a newsworthy subject about which The Post is permitted to investigate   
and report. There is no evidence that The Post was trying to "scoop" the RTC in   
quoting the documents or trying to avoid payment of a royalty, conduct to which   
other courts have looked in finding that a media organization violated copyright.   
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539(1985); Iowa   
State University Foundation, Inc., v. American Broadcasting Co., Inc., 463 F.   
Supp. 902 (S.D.N.Y. 1978).  
  
Under the second factor, the scope of the fair use doctrine is greater with respect   
to factual works than creative or literary works. Hubbard's works are difficult to   
classify and courts dealing with this issue have differed in their conclusion. As   
the Second Circuit stated in New Era Publications Int'l v. Carol Publishing   
Group, 904 F.2d 152,158 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 297   
(1990),"reasonable people-can disagree over how to classify Hubbard's works."   
However, that court also concluded that the works "deal with Hubbard's life, his   
views on religion, human relations, the Church, etc. -- [and] are more properly   
viewed as factual or informational." Id. at 157.The United States District Court   
for the Southern District of California is of another view, however. In Bridge   
Publications, Inc. v. Vien, 827 F. Supp. 629, 636 (S.D.Cal. 1993), the court   
stated that "[t]he undisputed evidence shows that L. Ron Hubbard's works are   
the product of his creative thought process, and not merely informational.  
   
However, in this litigation the RTC has characterized the documents essentially   
as training materials. Therefore, this Court concludes that despite their obtuse   
language the documents are intended to be informational rather than creative   
and, therefore, that a broader fair use approach is appropriate.  
  
To evaluate the third factor, which essentially requires making a qualitative as   
well as quantitative analysis of the use made of the work, the three quotes need   
to be read in the context of the article. The first and longest quote is obviously   
included merely as an example of the obtuse language used in the documents.   
No fair-minded reader could possibly construe this quote otherwise.  
  
Most of the 103 pages of disputed texts from the  Fishman file are instructions   
for leaders of the  training sessions. They are written in the dense jargon of the   
church. 'If YOU do and he's still in his head, all is not lost, you have other   
actions you can take. Clusters,Prep-Checks, failed to exercise directions.'  
  
The second quote describes how in "one high-level session trainees are asked to   
pick an object "wrap an energy beam around it and pull themselves toward the   
object," the quote occurs in the very next sentence which describes how trainees   
are to "be in the following places--the room, the sky, the moon, the sun. These   
underlined words comprise the total of the copyrighted materials quoted.  
  
The RTC argues that where quotes, although fragmentary, are of "significant   
material," even de minimis copying infringes. It then bootstraps this argument   
by claiming that because Fisher chose to include these three quotes in his article,   
the quoted language must necessarily be significant. Under this reasoning, no   
one, let alone a newspaper, could ever quote from copyrighted materials without   
fear of being hauled into court for infringement because any quote would be   
deemed significant. To accept this argument would essentially destroy the fair   
use doctrine. It also clearly is unsupported by the facts because as discussed   
above, the three quotes, read in context of the entire article, are offered solely as   
illustrations of the author's claims about Scientology. They are not intended to   
offer a complete definition of the Scientology religion or to capture the total   
essence of what it means to be a Scientologist.  
  
Lastly, we must look at the effect of The Post's use upon the potential market for   
or value of the copyrighted work. Although the RTC claims it has demonstrated   
an enormous effect upon its potential market, a fair view of the record discloses   
no evidence of any economic exploitation by The Post of RTC's copyrighted   
material. As The Post cogently argues, no follower of Scientology could possibly   
be satisfied by these three random fragments quoted in its article so as to bypass   
the complete regime of indoctrination.  
  
Although both sides have raised numerous additional issues the essential   
analysis for the copyright claim comes down to these four factors. Based on this   
analysis, we find for the defendants. RTC properly argues that the mere   
existence of a copyrighted work in an open court file does not destroy the   
owner's property interests in that work. In the same way, the placement of a   
copyrighted book on a public library shelf does not permit unbridled   
reproduction by a potential infringer. However, RTC cannot selectively avail   
itself of only a segment of the copyright law. With the preservation of copyright   
protection invariably comes the fair use exception, and on that ground The Post's   
actions are proper.  
  
III. ATTORNEY'S FEES  
  
Because The Post has been found to be the prevailing party on the copyright   
claim, it qualifies for an award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses. The   
RTC opposes such an award. Whether to award such fees is a matter left to the   
Court's discretion. Foqerty v. Fantasy, Inc. ,--U.S.--, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 1033   
(1994). In deciding the appropriateness of a fee award, the Court should   
consider the motivation of the plaintiff in bringing the action for copyright   
infringement and the extent to which plaintiff's position is reasonable and well-  
grounded in fact and law.  
  
On the first issue, the Court finds that the motivation of plaintiff in filing this   
lawsuit against The Post is reprehensible. Although the RTC brought the   
complaint under traditional secular concepts of copyright and trade secret law, it   
has become clear that a much broader motivation prevailed--the stifling of   
criticism and dissent of the religious practices of Scientology and the destruction   
of its opponents. L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, has been quoted as   
looking upon the law as a tool to harass and discourage rather than to win. The   
law can be used very easily to harass and enough harassment on somebody who   
is simply on the thin edge anyway, well knowing that he is not authorized, will   
generally be sufficient to cause his professional decease. If possible, of course,   
ruin him utterly.  
  
(Declaration of Mary Ann Werner, Attachment A, at C5;see also The Post's   
reply brief at p. 24, note 23).  
  
The context and extent in which The Post copied and quoted from the    
documents was so de minimis that this Court finds that no reasonable copyright   
holder could have in good faith brought a copyright infringement action.   
Although there are limits beyond which the media may not go, even in the   
interests of news gathering and reporting, this case does not come anywhere near   
those limits. Therefore, an award of reasonable attorneys' fees is appropriate and   
granted.  
  
IV. MISAPPROPRIATION CLAIM  
  
To prove misappropriation of a trade secret, the RTC must show (1) that it   
possessed a valid trade secret, (2) that the defendant acquired its trade secret,   
and ( 3) that the defendant knew or should have known that the trade secret was   
acquired by improper means. Trandes Corporation v. Guy F. Atkinson, 996 F.2d   
655, 660 (4th Cir. 1993), cert.denied, -- U.S. --, 114 S.Ct. 443 (1993) .  
  
The Post argues persuasively that the documents were no longer trade secrets by   
the time The Post acquired them. They point to the following undisputed facts.   
First, the Fishman affidavit had been in a public court file from April 14, 1993   
until August 15, 1995, for a total of 28 months. Although RTC has shown that it   
went to extraordinary efforts to control access to that file by having church   
members sign out the file and keep it in their custody at the courthouse, the file   
nevertheless was an open file, available to the public. The Post was able to   
obtain a copy of the Fishman affidavit without any difficulty, by merely asking   
the Clerk of the court to copy it. Thus, having been in the public domain for an   
extensive period of time, these documents cannot be deemed "trade secrets."   
Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corm., 416 U.S. 470,484 (1974).  
  
Of even more significance is the undisputed fact that these documents were   
posted on the Internet on July 31 and August 1, 1995. (Lerma Affidavit). On   
August 11, 1995, this Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order among   
other orders which directed Lerma to stop disseminating the documents.   
However, that was more than ten days after the documents were posted on the   
Internet, where they remained potentially available to the millions of Internet   
users around the world.  
  
As other courts who have dealt with similar issues have observed, "posting   
works to the Internet makes them generally known'" at least to the relevant   
people interested in the news group. Religious Technology Center v. Netcom   
On-Line Communications Services, Inc., No. C.95-20091 RMW (N.D. Cal.) Slip   
Opinion entered 9/22/95 at 30. Once a trade secret is posted on the Internet, it is   
effectively part of the public domain, impossible to retrieve. Although the person   
who originally posted a trade secret on the Internet may be liable for trade secret   
misappropriation, the party who merely down loads Internet information cannot   
be liable for misappropriation because there is no misconduct involved in   
interacting with the Internet.  
  
Even if one were to assume that the AT documents are still trade secrets, under   
Virginia law, the tort of misappropriation of trade secrets is not committed by a   
person who uses or publishes a trade secret unless that person has used unlawful   
means, or breached some duty created by contract or implied by law resulting   
from some employment or similar relationship. Smith v. Snas-On Toss Corp.,   
833 F.2d 578, 581 (5th Cir. 1988); Aerospace Am.,Inc. v. Abatement Tech.,   
Inc., 738 F. Supp. 1061, 1071(E.D. Mich. 1990).  
  
It is the employment of improper means to procure the trade secret, rather than   
the mere copying or use, which is the basis of [liability] . . . Apart from breach   
of contract, abuse of confidence or impropriety in the means of procurement,   
trade secrets may be copied freely as devices or processes which are not   
secret.  
  
Trandes Corporation v. Guy F. Atkinson Company, 996 F.2d at660, (quoting the   
Restatement  (First of Torts)) (emphasis in original). The Trandes court notes   
that abuse of confidence or impropriety in the means of procurement represented   
the "essential element' and the "core" of a misappropriation claim. Id.  
  
The RTC claims that because The Post was on notice of the RTC's allegations   
that the AT documents were stolen and were both trade secrets and unpublished   
copyrighted works, The Post was under a legal obligation not to copy or use the   
documents. This Court knows of no law which required The Post to sit on its   
hands and do no further investigation into what was obviously becoming a   
newsworthy event and newsworthy documents. The RTC's allegations are still   
just allegations. The very court from which the Fishman affidavit was obtained   
still has under advisement the issue of whether the AT documents are trade   
secrets. Although The Post was on notice that the RTC made certain proprietary   
claims about these documents, there was nothing illegal or unethical about The   
Post going to the Clerk's office for a copy of the documents or downloading them   
from the Internet.  
  
Because there is no evidence that The Post abused any confidence, committed an   
impropriety, violated any court order or committed any other improper act in   
gathering information from the court file or down loading information from the   
Internet, there is no possible liability for The Post in its acquisition of the   
information. This is true regardless of the documents status as trade secrets. As   
for the disclosure of the information, The Post did nothing more than briefly   
quote from publicly available materials. These acts simply do not approach a   
trade secret misappropriation, and, therefore, summary judgment must be   
entered for the defendants.  
  
The Clerk is directed to forward copies of this Memorandum Opinion to counsel   
of  record.

<P>This is a U.S. district court opinion and order dismissing most of a Church of Scientology libel suit against Time magazine. Judge Peter Leisure ruled on November 14, 1995, that the suit could proceed on only one of the allegedly libelous statements made in the 1991 cover story, "Scientology: The Cult of Greed and Power." The church is seeking $419 million.</P>

LEISURE, District Judge: 
 
Plaintiff Church of Scientology International ("CSI") brought this 
action to recover for damages allegedly suffered from the 
publication of false and defamatory statements concerning CSI in 
the cover story of the May 6, 1991 issue of Time Magazine. 
Defendants Time Warner, Inc., Time Inc. Magazine Company, and 
Richard Behar (collectively "Time") move this Court for summary 
judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, on the 
grounds that they lacked actual malice in publishing the article 
about CSI, an admitted public figure. See Plaintiff's Response to 
Defendants' First Set of Requests for Admission to Plaintiff. For 
the reasons stated below, defendants' motion is granted in part 
and denied in part. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
"Summary judgment is proper only if, viewing all evidence in the 
light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no genuine 
issue of material fact" as to an essential element of a claim. 
Buttry v. General Signal Corp., No. 95-7135, 1999 WL 628556, at 
#3 
(2d Cir. Oct. 26, 1995). A public figure suing for libel must 
prove, as one of the essential elements of the claim, that the 
defendant published the material with actual malice, i.e., actual 
knowledge of its falsity or with serious subjective doubts as to 
its truth. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 
279-80 (1964); St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731-32 
(1968). 
The First Amendment further requires that the plaintiff prove 
actual malice with clear and convincing evidence. See id. 
Therefore, "there is no genuine issue if the evidence presented in 
the opposing affidavits is of insufficient caliber or quantity to 
allow a rational finder of fact to find actual malice by clear and 
convincing evidence." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 
242, 254 (1986). 
 
Although a defendant's state of mind is at issue in a libel case 
covered by New York Times, that fact alone cannot preclude 
summary 
judgment, for First Amendment protection cannot be emasculated 
by 
unwillingness on the part of a court to grant summary judgment 
where "affidavit evidence of the defendant's state of mind" is 
lacking. A libel suit cannot be allowed to get to the jury, at 
enormous expense to the defendant, based on mere assertions of 
malice by the plaintiff. Cf. St. Gurin v. Virgin Islands Daily 
News, Inc., 21 F.3d 1309, 1318 (3d Cir. 1994) ("Summary 
judgment 
for the publisher is quite often appropriate because of the 
difficult a public office has in showing 'actual malice.'"). 
Indeed, without judicious use of summary judgment to dispose of 
libel suits, "the threat of being put to the defense of a lawsuit 
freedoms as fear of the outcome of the lawsuit itself." Immuno AG. 
v. Moor-Jankowski, 74 N.Y.2d 548, 561, 549 N.E.2d 129, 135, 
549 
N.Y.S.2d 938, 944 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); 
vacated, 497 U.S. 1021 (1990), adhered to, 77 N.Y.2d 335, 567 
N.E.2d 1270, 566 N.Y.S.2d 906 (1991), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 954 
(1991). Because the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment 
are 
designed to ensure that debate not litigation, is vigorous, the 
subjective nature of the test of liability cannot create a bar to 
summary disposition of libel suits.[FN1] See McLee v. Chrysler 
Corp., 38 F.3d 67, 68 (2d Cir. 1994) (ruling that district court's 
view - that summary judgment was unavailable in discrimination 
cases where employer's intent was at issue - was unsupportable). 
Indeed, this Court finds little to distinguish silence enforced by 
oppressive litigation from "silence coerced by law - the argument 
of force in its worst form." Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 337, 
375-76 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). 
 
In addition, the Court must "consider this case against the 
background of a profound national commitment to the principle 
that 
debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and 
wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and 
sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks." New York Times Co., 376 
U.S. at 270. As quoted in New York Times, 
 
In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political belief, 
sharp differences arise. In both fields of the tenets of one man 
may seem the rankest error to his neighbor. To persuade others to 
his own point of view, the pleader, as we know, at times, reports 
to exaggeration, to vilification of man who have been, or are, 
prominent in church or state, and even to false statement. But the 
people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, 
in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these 
liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion 
and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy." 
 
Id. at 271 (quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 310 
(1940)). Because sharp disagreement is essential to robust debate 
about important issues, "[a]ctual malice under the New York 
Times 
standard should not be confused with the concept of malice as an 
evil intent or a motive arising from spite or ill will." Masson v. 
New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 510 (1991). The 
speaker's 
belief in his statements, even his exaggerations, enhances, rather 
than diminishes, the likelihood that they are protected from libel 
attack by the First Amendment. Only where the speaker himself 
lacks this conviction, where the speaker entertains serious doubts 
as to the veracity of his statements, is the false statement 
actionable. See St. Amant, 390 U.S. at 731. 
 
As a threshold matter, then, the Court considers plaintiff's 
assertions that Behar, after publishing an article in Forbes 
critical of the church, 
 
targeted the Church with a fixed view of it as a 'destructive 
cult.' In the next five years, through the publication of his 
article in the May 6, 1991 issue of Times, Behar refined his focus 
- gathering negative information from Scientology adversaries and 
proposing anti-Church articles - while never changing any view 
about the Church, never accepting anything a Scientologist said 
and uniformly ignoring anything positive he learned about the 
Church. 
 
Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' 
Motion 
for Summary Judgment at 2. As noted, malice in the sense of 
hatred 
or ill-will is often indicative of lack of the actual malice 
required under New York Times, and therefore would tend to 
undermine, not support, plaintiff's case. In addition, "reckless 
conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man 
would 
have published, or would have investigated before publishing." St. 
Amant, 390 U.S. at 731. However, the combination of inadequate 
investigation with bias on the part of the publisher can give rise 
to an inference of actual malice. See Harte-Banks 
Communications, 
Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 632 (1989). With a showing of 
an extreme departure from standard investigative techniques, bias 
of the reporter becomes relevant to explain this extreme departure 
as more than mere carelessness rather as purposeful avoidance of 
the truth. Plaintiff therefore devotes much of its opposition to 
the motion to attempting to demonstrate Behar's predetermined 
bias 
toward the church. However, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate 
the correlative circumstance or inadequate investigation to make 
its evidence of bias probative of actual malice, rather than 
probative of lack thereof. Without a showing of inadequate 
investigation, bias merely confirms the publisher's firmly-held 
belief in the allegedly defamatory statements, 
 
With these principles in mind, the Court considers each allegedly 
libelous statement individually to determine whether a rational 
finder of fact could find actual malice by clear and convincing 
evidence. See Tayoulareas v. Piro, 817 F.2d 762, 794 (D.C. Cir.) 
(en banc) ("[D]efamation plaintiffs cannot show actual malice in 
the abstract; they must demonstrate actual malice in conjunction 
with a false defamatory statement." (emphasis in original)), cert. 
denied, 484 U.S. 870 (1987). 
 
A. Statements Set Forth at 40 
 
Paragraph 40 of the complaint sets forth several statements 
alleged to be false and defamatory. (The text of the sentences as 
they appear in the article is set forth below, the portions quoted 
in the complaint are underlined.) 
 
1. "In reality the church is hugely profitable global racket that 
survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like 
manner." 
 
2. "Says Cynthia Kisser, the (Cult Awareness) network's 
Chicago-based executive director: 'Scientology is quite likely the 
most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most 
litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. 
No cult extracts more money from its members.'" 
 
3. "Those who criticize the church - journalists, doctors, lawyers 
and even judges - often find themselves engulfed in litigation, 
stalked by private eyes, framed for fictional crimes, beaten up or 
threatened with death." 
 
 
Mafia-Like Intimidation 
 
Time relied on many sources as the basis for its belief that "the 
church . . . survives by intimidating members and critics in a 
Mafia-like manner." None of these sources is so obviously 
incredible that a reasonable jury could infer from Time's reliance 
on them knowledge of falsity or subjective doubt as to veracity. 
See St. Amant, 390 U.S. at 732; cf. id. ("Professions of good 
faith will be unlikely to prove persuasive, for example, where a 
story is fabricated by the defendant, is the product of his 
imagination, or is based wholly on an unverified anonymous 
telephone call."). Compare Harte-Hanks, 491 U.S. at 691 ("The 
hesitant, inaudible, and sometimes unresponsive and improbable 
tone of Thompson's answers to various leading questions raise 
obvious doubts about her veracity."). On the contrary, Behar 
relied on affidavits from former high-ranking Scientologists, 
newspaper and periodical articles, interviews and personal 
experience, and published court opinions, often issued after the 
benefit of adversarial presentation of testimony, which supported 
his professed belief that CSI intimidated critics and members. See 
Affidavit of Richard Behar ("Behar Aff.") Paragraphs 28-61. The 
Court finds that based on this evidence, no reasonable jury could 
find that CSI had proven by clear and convincing evidence that 
Time either knew or entertained serious doubts that the statement 
was false. 
 
2. Most Ruthless, Classically Terroristic Cult 
 
This statement appeared in the article in the form of a quotation 
from Cynthia Kisser, executive director of the Cult Awareness 
Network. "Repetition of another's words does not release one of 
responsibility if the reporter knows that the words are false or 
inherently improbable, or there are obvious reasons to doubt the 
veracity of the person quoted or the accuracy of his reports." 
Goldwater v. Ginzburg, 414 F.2d 324, 337 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. 
denied, 396 U.S. 1049 (1970). Based on the material supporting 
Behar's statement regarding Mafia-like intimidation, see Behar 
Aff. Paragraphs 28-61; see also id. Paragraphs 62-67, Behar's 
repetition of Kisser's statement was not done with knowledge that 
the statement was false or inherently improbable. Nor are there 
obvious reasons to doubt Kisser's veracity. There is no doubt that 
her views are deeply opposed to CSI's views, and each likely 
regards the other's conduct as reprehensible if not criminal, see 
Farny Aff. Paragraph 98, but such sharp disagreement and Kisser's 
obvious antagonistic relationship with Scientology does not 
amount 
to an obvious reason to doubt her veracity. On the contrary, as 
executive director of an organization dedicated to studying 
so-called cults, her judgment as to CSI's ruthlessness and 
terroristic practices likely carried credence with Behar. See id. 
Paragraph 62. The Court therefore finds that a reasonable jury 
could not find that plaintiff had demonstrated actual malice on 
the part of Time in publishing this statement by clear and 
convincing evidence. 
 
3. Journalists, Doctors, Lawyers, and Judges Framed, Beaten pp. or 
Threatened with Death 
 
In light of Behar's beliefs regarding his own experiences with 
Scientology, the admitted harassment of Paulette Cooper by 
Scientology's Guardian's office (which has been disbanded), and 
the other sources relied on by Behar, see Behar Aff. Paragraphs 
85-93, the Court finds no evidence that Behar made the statement 
regarding journalists with actual malice. Similarly, there are not 
"obvious reasons to doubt" Behar's sources for his statement 
regarding doctors, lawyers, and judges. See St. Amant. 390 U.S. at 
732. Although Behar does not have convincing evidence to link 
CSI 
with many of the strange incidents befalling these groups of 
people in conflict with Scientology, that fact alone does not 
allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Behar entertained doubts 
as to the veracity of his statement that these incidents are 
linked to CSR. Compare id. at 732 (good faith unlikely where story 
is fabricated by defendant, based on his imagination, or based on 
unverified anonymous telephone call). Therefore, the Court finds 
that no reasonable jury could find by clear and convincing 
evidence that Time published the above statement with actual 
malice. 
 
B. Statements Set Forth at Paragraph 58 
 
CSI challenges the following as false and defamatory: 
 
"THE LOTTICKS LOST THEIR SON, Noah, who jumped from a 
Manhattan 
hotel clutching section 171, virtually the only money he had not 
yet turned over to Scientology. His parents blame the church and 
would like to sue but are frightened by the organization's 
reputation for ruthlessness. 
 
"His death inspired his father Edward, a physician, to start his 
own investigation of the church. 'We thought Scientology was 
something like Dale Carnegie,' Lottick says. 
 
'I now believe it's a school for psychopaths. Their so-called 
therapies are manipulations. They take the best and brightest 
people and destroy them.' 
 
"It was too late. 'From Noah's friends at Dianetics' read the card 
that accompanied a bouquet of flowers at Lottick's funeral. Yet no 
Scientology staff members bothered to show up." 
 
The primary sources relied on by Behar for these statements are 
the parents of Noah Lottick. The Lotticks affirmed the accuracy of 
each statement in the article. See Reply Memorandum of Law in 
Further Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment 
("Def.'s Reply") at 12. Furthermore, the Lotticks are not 
obviously lacking in credibility, and the statements are not 
inherently improbable. Nevertheless, Behar made a thorough 
investigation of this aspect of his article by discussing it with 
various persons who knew Noah. Although Behar can be criticized 
for not interviewing Fred Lemons, an active Scientologist, 
asserted Scientology staff member, and former roommate of Noah 
Lottick, this omission is not such that it might raise an 
inference of purposeful avoidance of the truth. Cf. Harte-Hanks, 
491 U.S. at 582 ("[W]hile denials coming from Connaughten's 
supporters might be explained as motivated by a desire to assist 
Connaughton, a denial coming from [the uninterviewed] Stephens 
would quickly put an end to the story."). Any information to be 
gleaned from Lemons might be expected to be similar to, though 
less authoritative than, information that might be obtained from 
the director of the Scientology Dianetic Center, whom Behar twice 
attempted to contact. See Behar Aff. Paragraph 106. In short, 
besides minor omissions in investigation, from which no 
inferences 
of purposeful avoidance of the truth could reasonably be drawn, 
(even combined with Behar's alleged bias, see supra) CSI has not 
produced evidence such that a reasonable jury could find by clear 
and convincing evidence that behar published the statements with 
actual malice. On the contrary, as reflected in Behar's notes from 
one of his conversations with the Lotticks, it appears that Noah 
had spent the money to which he had access, that Dr. Lottick had 
concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations, and that 
no Scientology staff members attended the funeral.[FN2] See 
Affidavit of Jonathan W. Lubell, esq., at Ex. 41. Therefore, the 
Court finds that no reasonable jury could find by clear and 
convincing evidence that Tire published the above statement with 
actual malice. 
 
C. Statements Set Forth at Paragraph 43 
 
Of the statements set forth at paragraph 45 of the complaint, 
pursuant to this Court's ruling of November 23, 1992, only the 
following remains at issue; 
 
"Scientology denies any tie to the Fishman Scam, a claim strongly 
disputed by both Fishman and his longtime psychiatrist, Uwe 
Goertz, a prominent Florida hypnotist. Both man claims that when 
arrested, Fishman was ordered by the church to kill Goertz and 
then do an 'EOC,' or end of cycle, which is church jargon for 
suicide." 
 
Behar relied on Steven Fishman, Owe Goertz, Fishman's 
psychologist, Marc Nurik, Fishman's former counsel, Vicki 
Aznaran, 
a former Scientologist, and Robert Dondero, the assistant United 
States Attorney who prosecuted Fishman for stock fraud. Although 
Fishman in many respects is not highly credible, based on the 
corroboration of aspects of his claim by other sources, this Court 
finds that his claims are not obviously incredible. Ct. St. Amant, 
390 U.S. at 732 (good faith unlikely where unverified reliance on 
obviously incredible source). Specifically, Behar relied on 
Goertz's evaluation of Fishman's claims, Vicki Asnaran's 
corroboration of Fishman and Goertz's claims regarding the length 
of Fishman's involvement with the church, the depth of knowledge 
of Scientology that Fishman demonstrated, and the corroboration 
of 
certain claims by Robert Dondero. The fact that Dondero did not 
believe Fishman's claims does not undermine Behar's belief 
because 
Dondero was at the time prosecuting Fishman, and that prosecution 
would be undermined by accepting Fishman's account of 
Scientology's involvement with Fishman. Cf. Harte-Hanks, 491 
U.S. 
at 682 (denials coming from interested witnesses would not cause 
reporter to question veracity of allegations). Therefore, the 
Court finds that no reasonable jury could find by clear and 
convincing evidence that Time published the above statement with 
actual malice. 
 
D. Statements Set Forth in Paragraph 52 
 
Of the statements set forth at paragraph 52 of the complaint, 
pursuant to this Court's ruling of November 23, 1992, only the 
following remains at issue: 
 
"One source of funds for the Los Angeles-based church is the 
notorious, self-regulated stock exchange in Vancouver, British 
Columbia, often called the Scam capital of the world." 
 
The Court finds that a reasonable jury could find by clear and 
convincing evidence that Time published the above statement with 
actual malice. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the reasons stated above, defendants' motion for summary 
judgment is HEREBY DENIED as to the statement set forth at 
paragraph 52 of the complaint, and HEREBY GRANTED as to all 
other 
statements.

==========FOOTNOTES========== 
 
(1) In this respect, the Court notes that both debate and 
litigation have been vigorous in the case at bar. CSI published an 
80-page rebuttal to the Time article, which it distributed to 
church members, business leaders, and political figures. See 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants' Motion for 
Summary 
Judgment ("Def.'s Memo.") at 3. In addition, CSI published a 
series of full-page advertisements in USA Today challenging the 
article and Time's accuracy and biases in publishing it. See id.; 
Affidavit of Lynn R. Farny ("Farny Aff.") Paragraph 16, Exs. 14, 
15. The discovery in this case has been extensive, even though 
discovery has not yet been directed to the issue of truth or 
falsity. For example, Richard Behar, the author of the article, 
was deposed for 16-1/2 days over a 12 month period. See Def.'s 
Memo. at 4. The submissions to the Court in support of or in 
opposition to this motion consist of thousands of pages of 
memoranda, affidavits, and exhibits. 
 
(2) Although CSI asserts that Fred Lemons is a staff member, there 
is no evidence that Behar knew this fact. In addition, if Behar 
were trying to avoid this fact, he would not have contacted the 
Scientology center.

AGREEMENT made as of the 25th day of October, 1995  
by and between COMPUSERVE INCORPORATED with offices at 
5000 Arlington Centre Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43220  
("CompuServe"), of the one part, and FRANK MUSIC CORP. with  
offices at 39 West 54th Street, New York, New York 10019  
("FRANK") and THE HARRY FOX AGENCY, INC. with offices at 
711 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017 ("HFA"), 
of the other part. 
 
This AGREEMENT is predicated upon the following  
AGREED STATE OF FACTS: 

I. FRANK has heretofore, on November 29, 1993,  
filed a class action, on behalf of itself and all others  
similarly situated, against CompuServe for copyright in-  
fringement in the United States District Court for the  
Southern District of New York (the "Court") bearing Civil  
Action No. 93 Civ. 8153 (JFK) (the "Action").

II. Annexed to and made part of this Agreement as  
Schedule "A" is a list of those music publishers who are all  
publisher-principals of HFA (who acts as their common  
licensing and collecting agent) and who, together with FRANK,  
pursuant to that Stipulation amending the pleadings in the  
Action which will be submitted to the Court for approval on  
November 7, 1995, are the putative members of the plaintiff  
class in the Action (hereinafter the "Class Plaintiffs");  
Schedule "A" also sets forth those musical compositions  
respectively owned or controlled by the Class Plaintiffs, the  
copyrights of which are alleged in the Action to be infringed  
by CompuServe (hereinafter collectively the "Class  
Compositions.")

III. Each cause of action set forth on behalf of  
the Class Plaintiffs in the Action is predicated, amongst  
other things, upon the following basic allegations:

A. Each Class Plaintiff owns or controls a valid  
and subsisting copyright in each of their respective Class  
Compositions;

B. CompuServe has wilfully infringed the Class  
Plaintiffs' copyrights in their respective Class Compositions  
by:

1. permitting and enabling its Subscribers to  
Upload recordings of the Class Compositions made by such  
Subscribers into a CompuServe Forum/Library in  
CompuServe's Information Service on-line computer  
database via computer modems and telephone line and other  
telecommunications connections, which database is made  
available by CompuServe to its Subscribers for Uploading  
and Downloading;

2. maintaining the Storage of such aforesaid  
recordings in its computer database, and

3. permitting and enabling its Subscribers to  
Download copies of such recordings so Stored in a  
CompuServe Forum/Library computer database  
all without any authority from the Class Plaintiffs or  
otherwise with respect to the Class Compositions, CompuServe  
thereby facilitating and participating in the unauthorized  
making and distribution of Phonorecords of the Class  
Compositions.

IV. In its pleadings in the Action, CompuServe has  
asserted numerous defenses to the claims therein alleged on  
behalf of the Class Plaintiffs and has denied any liability on  
its part with respect thereto.

V. Without CompuServe admitting any liability on  
its part with respect to any claims alleged in the Action and  
with neither CompuServe nor FRANK (on its own behalf or on  
behalf of the other Class Plaintiffs) withdrawing any position  
stated in their respective pleadings in the Action,  
CompuServe, FRANK and HFA respectively desire, conditioned  
upon and subject to the issuance of an order of the Court  
approving this Agreement without modification, which may be  
entered after a hearing on notice to the Class Plaintiffs (the  
"Order of Approval"):

A. in order to eliminate the continued expenses and  
burdens of, as well as the uncertainties associated with,  
the continued litigating of the Action, to provide for  
the settlement and dismissal of the Action, and

B. in order to avoid future uncertainties and the  
prospects of future litigation:

1. to provide for the mutually beneficial  
"Licensing Arrangement" (as such term is hereinafter  
defined and provided) for continued use of the Class  
Compositions and other musical compositions owned or  
controlled by the Class Plaintiffs in the making and  
distribution of Phonorecords via Uploading and  
Downloading to and from CompuServe's Forum/Library  
computer databases, 

2. to provide for the availability of the  
"Licensing Arrangement" to others of HFA's  
publisher-principals (in addition to the Class  
Plaintiffs) for the use of their musical com-  
positions in the making and distribution of  
Phonorecords via Uploading and Downloading to and  
from CompuServe's Forum/Library computer databases,  
and 

3. To provide a mechanism for CompuServe's  
Managers to obtain license authority for the use of  
the musical compositions owned by those Class  
Plaintiffs (who do not opt out) as well as other  
publisher-principals of HFA. 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, predicated upon the foregoing AGREED  
STATE OF FACTS, the parties hereto AGREE AS FOLLOWS:  

1. IT IS AGREED that upon the first business day  
after the date on which the Order of Approval becomes a final  
order (the "Effective Date"), this Agreement shall become  
fully operative in accordance with its terms, provided that  
the applicable provisions of paragraphs 2, 3, 5B, 6, 8, 9,  
ll(A) and 12-15 shall become fully operative upon the  
execution of this Agreement. 

2. The parties hereto shall, and they shall direct  
their respective attorneys in the Action to, fully cooperate  
in the submission of this Agreement to the Court and fully  
cooperate in the hearing or other proceedings required by the  
Court, as well as execute, obtain and deliver any documents  
necessary or required to secure the approval of this Agreement  
and the entry of the Order Of Approval with respect hereto.  

3. Upon entry of the Order of Approval by the  
Court, CompuServe shall pay the sum of Five Hundred, Sixty  
Eight Thousand (568,000.00) Dollars to HFA (the "Settlement  
Sum"), the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by HFA.  
The Settlement Sum shall be allocated and upon entry of the  
Order of Approval, paid by HFA as follows:  

A. the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for  
each of the nine hundred forty seven (947) Class  
Compositions to the respective Class Plaintiffs who do  
not opt out in proportion to their ownership interests  
thereof as shown on Schedule "A" as and for their shares  
of the Settlement Sum hereunder, and 

B. the sum of Ninety Four Thousand, Five Hundred  
Dollars ($94,500.00) shall be retained by HFA as and for  
the sum agreed upon for partial reimbursement of the  
legal fees and expenses heretofore incurred by HFA in the  
prosecution of this Action and to be incurred in the  
resolution of the Action. 

C.  HFA shall hold the Settlement Sum in escrow  
until the Effective Date and shall thereupon make such  
payments and reimburse itself as aforesaid. In the  
event, however, that a successful appeal is taken or  
rehearing obtained by a third party with respect to the  
Order of Approval that results in its being dissolved or  
substantially modified, then and in such event, HFA shall  
either repay the Settlement Sum to CompuServe or  
otherwise conform to such modification if such  
modification is agreed to be mutually acceptable by the  
parties to this Agreement and the Action.  

4.  Upon the Effective Date, CompuServe, Managers,  
Frank, HFA and all of the Class Plaintiffs who do not opt out  
of this Action shall be bound by those express operative

such terms are capitalized in this Agreement and  
shall likewise apply to all forms of the terms so  
defined (e.g. the definition of "Upload" shall

B. From and after the Effective Date, CompuServe  
shall require each of its Managers on Schedule "B" and  
any other Manager known to CompuServe to operate a  
Forum/Library to obtain license authority where necessary  
under the Copyright Act prior to any Downloading by a  
Subscriber of a Sound Recording of a Licensable Song from  
such Forum/Library's database in accordance with the  
provisions herein set forth. In such connection, from  
and after the date of execution hereof in the case of  
Managers on Schedule "B" and from and after the Effective  
Date in the case of other such Managers, CompuServe  
agrees that it shall require each such Manager to agree  
with it in writing to adhere to the provisions of this  
Agreement relating to Licensable Songs and shall provide  
HFA with a copy of each such writing promptly after its  
execution, or CompuServe otherwise shall take steps to  
prevent infringement of Licensable Songs by such Manager  
through Downloading from such Forum/Library.  

C. No Manager shall permit or enable the  
Downloading of a recording of a licensable song from the  
Manager's Forum/Library until a Mechanical License, where  
necessary under the Copyright Act for such Downloading is  
obtained hereunder therefor from HFA (or other authorized  
Licensor, if any) and in such connection it is agreed  
that Uploads of such recordings may be Stored in a  
Preview Area, without liability therefor, until such time  
as a Mechanical License for such recording is obtained  
from HFA. CompuServe agrees to use its reasonable best  
efforts to ensure each of its Managers complies with the  
Manager's obligations under the foregoing provisions of  
this subparagraph C. 

D. HFA shall provide for 24-hours a day access by a  
representative or designee of CompuServe to HFA's song  
file database of Licensable Songs for the purpose of  
determining the availability thereof for the issuance of  
Mechanical Licenses hereunder. Such song file database  
shall contain the song number and related information  
necessary for the accurate completion of Mechanical  
License Requests by Managers hereunder. There will be no  
charge by HFA for such access on the condition that there  
will be no charge by CompuServe to Subscribers for the  
information contained in HFA's song file database.  

E. Mechanical Licenses shall be requested and  
issued hereunder in accordance with the following  
procedures and shall be governed by the following terms  
and conditions: 

(1) Each Manager who is not a "Defaulting  
Manager" (as such term is defined in sub-paragraph  
(9) below) may obtain a Mechanical License for the  
use of a licensable song by electronically (via  
modem) transmitting an accurate and completed  
Mechanical License Request to HFA with a copy  
thereof to CompuServe utilizing therein the "PIN"  
number which HFA shall have approved and assigned  
for each Manager who shall have previously applied  
to HFA therefor in writing. "PIN" numbers shall be  
approved and assigned by HFA for each Forum/Library  
Manager as to which such a Forum/Library Manager  
request in writing is received by HFA. An  
application by a Manager for a PIN number shall be  
accompanied by a statement from an authorized  
employee of CompuServe approving such application  
and attesting to the identity of the applicant and  
the Forum/Library to which the application pertains.  
The Manager is not obligated to submit such a  
request until immediately prior to the transfer to  
the publicly-accessible areas of the Forum/Library  
of a Sound Recording of a Licensable Song.  

(2) Each Mechanical License Request shall  
request a Mechanical License for the use in con-  
junction with CompuServe and the Forum/Library of a  
licensable song at the Statutory Rate unless prior  
to its transmission HFA shall have received written  
consent from a Licensor to issue same at a lesser  
royalty rate, in which case it shall be deemed  
issued at such lesser rate. In this connection, it  
is understood and agreed that Managers are free to  
directly negotiate for and seek to obtain the  
consent from Licensors to any such lesser royalty  
rate 

(3) Upon the electronic receipt by HFA from a  
Manager (who is not a "Defaulting Manager") of an  
accurate, clearly transmitted and completed  
Mechanical License Request for a licensable song  
transmitted by such Manager with his (its) "PIN"  
number thereon, such Mechanical License (in the form  
comprised of Exhibit "1",  Parts I and II taken  
together) shall be and be deemed issued by HFA on  
behalf of the respective Licensor (HFA publisher-  
principal) and both the Licensor and such Manager  
shall be and be deemed bound in all respects by the  
provisions of such Mechanical License for such  
licensable song all in accordance with the terms and  
conditions of the Mechanical License as set forth in  
Exhibit 1, Parts I and II, and the related  
provisions of this Agreement. 

(4) Within a reasonable period after the end  
of each month during the operation of these  
Mechanical License provisions, HFA shall send to  
each Manager, who shall have obtained a Mechanical  
License pursuant to the provisions hereof during  
such month, a written summary of the Mechanical  
Licenses so obtained during such month setting forth  
therein the license numbers assigned thereto by HFA.  
Copies of such monthly summaries shall likewise be  
sent to CompuServe by HFA. 

(5) Each individual Mechanical License is  
deemed to be limited to the making and distribution  
to P.C.'s only of Phonorecord copies from one  
specific Uploaded Sound Recording that do not  
accompany an Audiovisual Work and for private use  
with no further copying being included within the  
license authority. CompuServe shall not be liable  
for the acts of Subscribers that exceed the scope of  
the Mechanical License, provided that CompuServe  
does not advertise or promote Subscriber usage  
beyond the scope of the Mechanical License.  
(6) To the extent, if any, it is an infringer  
under applicable copyright laws for any unauthorized  
use on CompuServe's Information Services of a  
musical composition covered by this Agreement,  
CompuServe shall be liable therefor and, in  
addition, any use of a licensable song for which a  
Mechanical License is revoked and terminated by  
reason of failure to pay royalties not timely cured  
after notice shall be actionable as an act of  
copyright infringement as provided in such  
Mechanical Licenses and under Section 115 of the  
U.S. Copyright Act, but nothing in this Agreement  
shall limit any rights or defenses of CompuServe or  
the Managers under the Copyright Act in any action  
based on the foregoing.

(7) HFA shall, not more than once in any  
calendar year, by its authorized representatives, on  
thirty (30) days prior notice, have access to  
CompuServe's applicable revenue and service activity  
records and such other books and records as may be  
required for the purpose of verifying the accuracy  
of the royalty statements rendered and payments made  
pursuant to the Mechanical Licenses. Such  
examinations shall be conducted during CompuServe's  
business hours at CompuServe's offices in Columbus,  
Ohio. The costs of such examinations shall be borne  
by HFA unless the amount of any revealed  
underpayment is ten (10%) percent or more of the  
sums actually paid during the period for which the  
examination is conducted. If the amount of revealed  
underpayment exceeds ten percent (10%) of such sums,  
then the cost of such examination shall be borne by  
CompuServe. Such access, however, shall be subject  
to the policies of CompuServe as to confidentiality  
concerning the identity of Subscribers and  
Subscriber information where they so require.  

(8) Royalties under such Mechanical Licenses  
shall be paid within forty-five (45) days after the  
end of each calendar quarter and shall be  
accompanied by statements (which may be provided  
electronically) showing, for each Licensor  
(publisher-principal), the license number, the title  
of each Licensable Song, the number of copies  
Downloaded for each and the royalty due thereon.  
(9) CompuServe agrees to and does hereby  
guarantee the payment of those royalties to be paid  
by its respective Managers pursuant to the  
Mechanical Licenses. Notwithstanding such guaranty  
by CompuServe, and without limiting the rights of  
HFA on behalf of the Licensors to seek payment from  
CompuServe based thereon, in the event that the  
statements and payments are not made in accordance  
with the terms of the Mechanical Licenses, then the  
affected Licensors shall have the right to terminate  
and revoke the Mechanical Licenses on thirty (30)  
days' prior written notice to the respective  
Managers with copies to CompuServe. In the event  
that such payments are not made by either the  
Managers or CompuServe within such thirty-day period  
then the Mechanical Licenses shall be automatically  
revoked and terminated and those copies for which  
payments were not made shall be actionable as acts  
of infringement and fully subject to the remedies  
provided for under the Copyright Act. 
In addition, upon the date of any such notice,  
the Manager to whom same is directed shall, for the  
purposes of this Agreement and the Licensing  
Arrangement, be and be deemed a "Defaulting Manager"  
and such Manager shall remain a Defaulting Manager  
unless and until the default in royalty payments is  
cured within the thirty day period commencing on the  
date of the notice. 

(10) All rights in the Licensable Songs not  
specifically granted in the Mechanical Licenses are  
reserved to the Licensors. 

(11) The scope of the Mechanical Licenses is  
deemed limited to Uploading, Storage and Downloading  
to and from CompuServe's Forum/Library databases  
located in the United States only, with access  
however to such Forum/Library databases for  
Uploading and Downloading permitted for Subscribers  
located anywhere in the world. 

(12) Notwithstanding anything herein or in a  
Mechanical License contained to the contrary, no  
authority to use a licensable song hereunder or  
pursuant to a Mechanical License issued hereunder  
shall be deemed granted unless the prior consent of  
the lawful owner of the Sound Recording (and the  
sounds fixed therein) containing such licensable  
song is first obtained for the making of Phonorecord  
copies thereof. 

(13) In addition to the access to be provided  
pursuant to subparagraph (7) hereof, CompuServe  
shall, without charge, provide HFA with sponsored  
account access to CompuServe's Information Service  
which shall, to the extent possible, provide for the  
tracking, identifying and verifying the uses of  
musical compositions therein and thereby. Such  
access, however, shall be subject to the policies of  
CompuServe as to confidentiality concerning the  
identity of Subscribers and Subscriber information  
where they so require. In any event, CompuServe  
shall provide HFA access to the number of Downloads  
of Licensable Songs. 

(14) Any Manager, prior to submitting any  
Mechanical License Request, must apply to HFA for  
assignment of a PIN number, which shall be unique to  
that Manager. If a Manager manages or operates more  
than one Forum/Library, and intends to use  
Licensable Songs in two or more of those  
Forum/Libraries, separate applications shall be made  
for each such Forum/Library and HFA shall assign  
unique PIN numbers for each such Forum/Library. The  
confidentiality of PIN numbers shall be strictly  
maintained by all parties. Following the initial  
assignment, HFA shall reassign a PIN number promptly  
at the request of a Manager or CompuServe, and HFA  
may reassign any PIN number at its discretion, upon  
prior notice to the affected Manager and to  
CompuServe, in each case, regardless of whether the  
PIN number has suffered a breach of confidentiality.  
An application by a Manager for a PIN number shall  
be accompanied by a statement from an authorized  
employee of CompuServe approving such application  
and attesting to the identity of the applicant and  
the Forum/Library to which the application pertains.  
Applications for PIN numbers shall be made in  
writing on forms prescribed for that purpose by HFA  
and approved by CompuServe. Upon receipt of a PIN  
number from HFA, a Manager may begin submitting  
Mechanical License Requests. If a Manager ceases to  
manage any Forum/Library for which HFA has assigned  
a PIN number, CompuServe shall promptly advise HFA  
to discontinue such PIN number. Any new Manager of  
such Forum/Library shall promptly apply for a PIN  
number in accordance with the foregoing procedure,  
and any substitute Mechanical License for one issued  
previously to the prior Manager shall, upon  
application by the new Manager, be newly issued to  
the new Manager, provided that there shall then  
exist no uncured default in the payment of royalties  
under the previously issued Mechanical License  
hereunder. 

6. CompuServe hereby warrants and represents that  
Schedule "B" annexed to and made part of this Agreement is a  
complete and accurate list of the Managers of the  
Forum/Libraries in which are located the files known to  
CompuServe as of the date hereof as embodying Sound Recordings  
of Class Compositions. The Class Plaintiffs hereby  
respectively represent and warrant that each of those  
respective Class Compositions set forth next to their re-  
spective names in Exhibit A hereto was protected by a valid  
and subsisting copyright during all times pertinent to the  
Action and so remains as of the date hereof, that Exhibit A is  
a complete and accurate list of the ownership or control of  
the copyrights or those rights that are the subject of this  
Action with respect to the Class Compositions, that all of the  
persons or entities listed in Schedule A are HFA publisher-  
principals, and that each of the Class Compositions is a work  
as to which HFA is authorized to issue written variations of  
the compulsory license provisions contained in 17 U.S.C.  
115. 

7. Upon the Effective Date, and in reliance on the  
warranty and representation of CompuServe set forth above in  
Paragraph 6, the claims set forth in the Complaint, as  
amended, in the Action for those Class Plaintiffs (who do not  
opt out of this Action) shall be deemed settled and  
compromised, and dismissed with prejudice, and such Class  
Plaintiffs shall be deemed to and shall thereupon release,  
remise and forever discharge CompuServe, its Subscribers, and,  
with respect to a Forum/Library for which they have signed a  
written agreement (as referred to in paragraph 5B above),  
those Managers identified on Schedule "B" annexed hereto, and  
their respective directors, officers, shareholders,  
representatives, agents, servants and employees of and from  
any claim, demand or cause of action now or heretofore  
existing from the beginning of time up to and inclusive of the  
date of the execution hereof with respect to any act or  
omission in connection with, or the use of, the respective  
Class Compositions owned or controlled by such Class Plain-  
tiffs as set forth on Schedule "A" annexed hereto, including,  
but not limited to, those claims and causes of action which  
are or could have been alleged or based upon any facts alleged  
in the Complaint, as amended, in the Action.  

8. Promptly after entry of the Order of Approval,  
the parties to the Action shall cause their respective counsel  
to the Action to execute and deliver to the Court, for the  
entry of an order thereon, a Stipulation of Dismissal with  
respect to the Action in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit  
"2" 

9. CompuServe, HFA and the Class Plaintiffs waive  
any rights they might otherwise have to appeal or seek  
rehearing of the Order of Approval. 

10. Promptly after the Effective Date, HFA shall  
give all of its other publisher-principals (i.e., those who  
are not Class Plaintiffs) written notice setting forth in  
substance the terms and conditions of the Licensing  
Arrangement and offer them the opportunity to become a party  
to and be bound by the Licensing Arrangement with respect to  
the musical compositions they respectively own. Each of such  
publisher-principals who agrees to be bound by the Licensing  
Arrangement shall thereupon and thereafter be a potential  
Licensor and its respective musical compositions shall  
thereupon and thereafter be deemed and become Licensable Songs  
for all purposes. 

11. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to  
the contrary: 

A. CompuServe shall have the right to avoid the  
operation of this Agreement prior to the entry of the  
Order of Approval and render it without effect by giving  
HFA and the Court written notice of its intention so to  
do in the event and upon the condition that a number of  
the Class Plaintiffs, if any, whose respective Class  
Compositions shall exceed, in the aggregate, more than  
twenty (20%) percent of the total number of Class  
Compositions set forth on Schedule "A", shall elect to  
opt out of this Action. In this connection, it is  
understood and agreed that, in any event, the Settlement  
Sum shall be reduced by the sum of $500.00 for each Class  
Composition which shall fall outside the operation of  
this Agreement by reason of the opting out of this  
Agreement by a Class Plaintiff owning or controlling  
same. 

B. CompuServe acknowledges that upon ninety (90)  
days prior notice HFA's publisher-principals (including  
the Class Plaintiffs) have the right to terminate their  
agency relationship with HFA thereby effectively ter-  
minating the operation of the Licensing Arrangement as  
applicable to the issuance of new Mechanical Licenses by  
such publisher-principals. In addition, HFA's publisher-  
principals, upon notice, shall have the right to exclude  
any or all of the musical compositions, for which they  
own or control the right to issue Mechanical Licenses,  
from the issuance of Mechanical Licenses pursuant to the  
Licensing Arrangement hereunder, but the provisions of  
this paragraph shall not affect the inclusion of the  
Class Compositions owned or controlled by those Class  
Plaintiffs who do not opt out of the Action from the  
operation of the provisions of Paragraph 7 hereinabove  
set forth. In the instances of termination and  
exclusion, the Mechanical Licenses issued hereunder prior  
thereto would nevertheless remain in full force and  
effect, provided, however, that in instances of  
termination by a publisher-principal of the agency  
relationship with HFA, the royalty payments and  
statements under such Mechanical Licenses shall be made  
thereafter directly to the terminating publisher-  
principal. 

12. Annexed hereto as Exhibit 3 is the form of a  
joint press release which is agreed upon by the parties hereto  
as the form of press release that will be issued on the date  
the Court schedules a hearing for the approval of this  
Agreement by the parties with respect to the settlement of the  
Action. 

13. All Notices required or desired to be given  
hereunder shall be in writing and transmitted via pre-paid  
certified mail, return receipt requested:  

A. To HFA: At its address first indicated above,  
directed to the attention of Edward P. Murphy, Chief

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN MUSIC PUBLISHERS' CLASS ACTION  
 
NEW YORK, NEW YORK           [November 7,] 1995:  
 
Edward P. Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer of the 
National Music Publishers' Association and The Harry Fox Agency, 
Inc., and Robert J. Massey, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
CompuServe Incorporated jointly announced today that an agreed 
upon settlement had been reached in the pending class action for 
copyright infringement against the on-line computer information 
service provider. Since its filing in November, 1993, the litigation has 
been one of the most closely watched copyright actions in the nation.  
The suit, Frank Music Corp., et al. v. CompuServe. Inc., was brought 
in the United States District Court in Manhattan by Frank Music 
Corp., and has been supported by the Harry Fox Agency, Inc. (HFA), a 
mechanical rights licensing agency for music publishers. The 
suit alleged that the copyrights in the song "UNCHAINED MELODY" 
and more than 900 additional songs owned by other music publisher-
principals of HFA were infringed, and that CompuServe was 
responsible for the alleged infringement. As alleged in the 
complaint, the claims were based upon the copying of such songs in 
the uploading and downloading of sound recordings to and from 
CompuServe's databases by subscribers to the CompuServe 
Information Service (CIS), and the alleged facilitation of this copying 
by CompuServe.

The Settlement Agreement has been submitted for court approval to 
U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan who has scheduled a hearing for 
such purpose on [December 19,] 1995. As required in this type of class 
action, each publisher member of the plaintiff class will 
be given notice of the terms of the Agreement and an opportunity to 
opt out of its operation prior to the hearing.  
In settling the dispute, CompuServe has made no admission of 
liability, and the parties have reserved all of their rights and defenses 
under the copyright laws. As part of the overall settlement, 
CompuServe will make a payment to HFA, which will be divided 
(after deduction of litigation expenses) among the music publishers 
whose songs were involved in the case. CompuServe and HFA will 
work together to make it possible for the managers of a number of 
interest areas and forums on CIS to take licenses from HFA that 
permit the future uploading and downloading of recordings of the 
publishers' songs. The licensing arrangement - a key part of the 
settlement for all of the parties - will provide express authority to 
managers for the use of the publishers' songs in the making and 
distribution of audio recordings on the CompuServe system, thus 
insuring against claims of copyright infringement for such uses. The 
licensing arrangement is also important for music publishers, since it 
will make available to them yet another organized means of 
licensing, and collecting royalties for, the use of their musical 
compositions.

Under the terms of the settlement agreement and licensing 
arrangement, the managers shall obtain licenses prior to any 
downloading by subscribers from CIS of musical 
compositions owned or controlled by HFA's publisher-principals 
unless the uses involved are otherwise exempted under applicable 
copyright law. HFA will issue licenses electronically, provided the 
song's copyright is owned or controlled by one of the Agency's 
publisher-principals. This licensing arrangement will be available not 
only to the owners of the songs directly involved in the lawsuit, but to 
all of HFA's other publisher-principals, as well. The licenses issued 
will be variations of the compulsory licensing provisions with respect 
to phonorecords set forth in Section 115 of the U.S. Copyright Act. 
HFA will also collect royalties under the license, distribute the 
royalties to publishers, and audit payments as necessary to validate 
accuracy.

Both Mr. Murphy and Mr. Massey mutually expressed their 
appreciation for each other's dedicated efforts in attaining settlement of 
the nearly two year old litigation.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 
FRANK MUSIC CORP., on behalf of 
itself and all others similarly 
situated, 
 
-against- 
 
COMPUSERVE INCORPORATED, 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
Civil Action No. 93 Civ. 8153 (JFK) 
 
COMPLAINT 
 
CLASS-ACTION 
 
 
Plaintiff, by its attorneys, Silverman & Shulman, P.C., 
complaining of the defendant herein, alleges as follows:  
 
Jurisdictional Allegations 
 
1.  This action arises under the Copyright Act of the United 
States (17 U.S.C. Sec. 101, et seq.).  This Court has exclusive 
jurisdiction over this action under Section 1338(a) of the 
Judicial Code [28 U.S.C. Section 1338(a).] Venue is proper 
under Section 1400(a) of the Judicial Code [28 U.S.C. Section 
1400(a).]  
 
Class Action Allegations 
 
2.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rule 23(a), (b)(2) and 
(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of itself 
and all other copyright owners similarly situated (the "Class"), 
who are all music publishers-principals of the The Harry Fox 
Agency, Inc., their common licensing and collecting agent, and 
whose copyrighted musical compositions are the subject of 
those unauthorized uses by defendant hereinafter alleged, in 
violation and infringement of the exclusive rights granted to 
copyright owners of musical compositions pursuant to Section 
106 of the U.S. Copyright Act [17 U.S.C. Section 106.]  
 
3.  The class numbers in excess of one hundred forty (140), and 
it is therefore impracticable to bring them all before the Court. 
The questions of law and fact presented herein regarding 
defendant's violation and infringement of rights under the 
Copyright Act and its liabilities therefor are common to the 
entire Class. The claims of plaintiff herein are typical of the 
claims of the Class. Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect 
the interests of the Class in that plaintiff has retained competent 
counsel experienced in litigation of this nature, has the 
financial support of the Harry Fox Agency, Inc.*, and is 
seeking injunctive relief based upon defendant's violation of 
the rights of each member of the Class and statutory damages 
determinable for each member of the Class. A class action is 
superior to individual litigation because it permits a resolution 
of all claims in one action; there is no pending litigation of any 
of such claims. Any notices required to be given to the Class of 
any proceeding in this action can be given to The Harry Fox 
Agency, Inc., the Class' common agent, who shall undertake to 
transmit such notices to each member thereof.  
 
The Parties 
 
4.  Plaintiff FRANK MUSIC CORP. (hereinafter "Frank") is a 
New York corporation with its principal office at 39 West 54th 
Street, New York, New York 10019.  
 
5.  Frank and the members of the Class were and continue to be 
copyright owners engaged in the business of publishing, 
licensing and otherwise marketing and exploiting musical 
compositions.  
 
6.  Defendant (hereinafter "Compuserve") is an Ohio 
corporation with an office for the conduct of its business at 120 
Broadway in the City, County and State of New York, and 
accordingly, can be found in this judicial district.  
 
7.  Compuserve, a wholly-owned subsidiary of H & R Block 
Group, Inc., upon information and belief, has offices and 
subsidiaries of its own in over 16 states and in seven foreign 
countries, employing more than 1600 persons and has annual 
sales in excess of two hundred eighty million ($280,000,000.) 
dollars. Compuserve, amongst other things, is engaged in the 
business of maintaining a computer-based on-line information 
and electronic communication service which involves 
Compuserve's maintenance of a large mainframe computer and 
the database contained therein consisting of literary, graphic 
and musical material. Such mainframe computer and database 
are hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Bulletin Board." 
Compuserve grants access to its Bulletin Board to it paid 
subscribers, who via a device known as a "modem" and the use 
of their own personal computers: a) put into the Bulletin Board, 
for storage in the Bulletin Board's database, the literary, 
graphic and musical material chosen by such subscribers (a 
process known as "uploading"), and b) can select and take from 
the Bulletin Board the literary, graphic and musical material 
stored in the Bulletin Board's database (a process known as 
"downloading".) Each subscriber pays Compuserve a monthly 
fee for such access and also pays Compuserve, in the form of 
"log on" charges, for the time that it is connected to 
Compuserve's Bulletin Board. The material contained in this 
Bulletin Board's database is identified in tables of contents 
which are known as "menus." The menus list, amongst other 
things, the various on-line literary, graphic and musical 
material and other communication services which are 
accessible to Compuserve's subscribers.  
 
8.  Compuserve provides the aforesaid access (to upload to and 
download from its Bulletin Board) to subscribers who reside 
within this judicial district and elsewhere.

the sole copyright owner of the musical composition entitled 
"UNCHAINED MELODY" (hereinafter the "Frank Work"):  
 
A. which was written and composed by Alex North and Hy 
Zarat, both citizens of the United States (the "authors");

Hy Zarat), which written were recorded in the U.S. Copyright 
Office, respectively, in Volume 1954 at page 396 and in 
Volume 1666 at page 36.  
 
10. Frank has duly complied with all pertinent provisions of the 
Copyright Act and all laws governing copyright with respect to 
the Frank Work.  
 
11. Members of the Class are, and at all times relevant herein

(the "Class Compositions"), which class compositions:  
 
A. were all identified in the Bulletin Board's menus and 
number in excess of five hundred fifty (550);  
 
B. were, together with the Frank Work (as more particularly 
hereinafter alleged), the subject of recordings which were 
uploaded and downloaded to and from Compuserve's Bulletin 
Board by Compuserve's subscribers, and  
 
C. were the subject of copyright registrations in the U.S. 
Copyright Office with the Register of Copyrights having issued 
appropriate registration certificates therefor, and if appropriate 
and required by the copyright act, the subject of duly renewed 
copyrights.  
 
12. The members of the Class have duly complied with all 
pertinent provisions of the Copyright Act and all laws 
governing copyright with respect to the Class Compositions.  
 
13. Compuserve, in providing access to its Bulletin Board (in 
particular its "MIDI **/Music Forum" and various "libraries" 
therein) by its paying subscribers, is , and at all relevant times 
herein was, engaged in the following activities with respect to 
the Frank Work and the Class Compositions:  
 
A. permitting, facilitating and participating in the recording of 
performances of the Frank Work and the Class Compositions 
into, and storing such recordings in, Compuserve's computer 
database by permitting and enabling its paying subscribers to

15. At all times relevant herein Compuserve had actual 
knowledge of, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence could 
have determined, the nature and content of materials stored in 
its Bulletin Board and downloaded therefrom.  
 
16. At all times relevant herein Compuserve had actual notice, 
or in the exercise of reasonable diligence could have 
determined, the recordings of the Frank Work and the Class 
Compositions were uploaded (recorded) to, stored in, and 
downloaded (re-recorded) from its computer database.  
 
17. Neither Compuserve, nor its subscribers, sought or obtained 
authority from Frank or the members of the Class to upload 
(record), store, or download (re-record) performances of their 
respective Frank Work or Class Compositions to, in or from 
Compuserve's Bulletin Board.  
 
18. The acts and omissions of Compuserve hereinabove 
referred to constitute acts of copyright infringement by 
Compuserve with respect to the Frank Work and the Class 
Compositions.  
 
19. Written demand was heretobefore made upon Compuserve 
to cease and desist from is hereinabove alleged activities with 
respect to the musical compositions owned or controlled by the

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES
CORPORATION and WHITE ACQUISITION
CORP.,
          Plaintiffs,

-against-

LOTUS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION and
JIM P. MANZI,
          Defendants.

Civil Action No. 95-328

COMPLAINT

International Business Machines Corporation
("IBM") and White Acquisition Corp. ("White"), as and for
their complaint, allege upon knowledge with respect to
themselves and their own acts, and upon information and
belief as to all other matters, as follows:

Nature of the Action

1. Plaintiffs bring this action for injunctive
and/or declaratory relief:

(a) to prevent the application of defendant Lotus
Development Corporation's ("Lotus") anti-takeover
devices and other defensive measures to White's tender
offer, proposed merger and consent solicitation, in
violation of fiduciary duties owed to Lotus's
stockholders;

(b) to prevent the application of certain
Massachusetts statutes to White's tender offer, in
violation of the Constitution of the United States; and

(c) to prevent Lotus from otherwise impeding
White's tender offer, proposed merger and consent
solicitation, which comply with all applicable laws,
obligations and agreements.

2. On June 5, 1995, White announced its intention
to commence an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
shares of common stock of Lotus, at a price of $60 per share
(the "Offer"). The Offer is conditioned on removal or
inapplicability of a number of Lotus's anti-takeover
devices. IBM intends, as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer, to have Lotus merge with White or
another IBM subsidiary (the "Proposed Merger"). At the same
time as it announced the Offer, White announced its
intention to commence a consent solicitation to replace
Lotus's current Board of Directors with other nominees and
to take certain other actions to facilitate consummation of
the Offer and Proposed Merger (the "Consent Solicitation").

3. The Offer is fully financed, non-coercive and
fair to Lotus stockholders. The Offer represents a
substantial premium over the market price for Lotus shares
prior to announcement of the Offer. The Offer, Proposed
Merger and Consent Solicitation do not pose any threat to
the interests of Lotus's stockholders or to Lotus's
corporate policy and effectiveness.

4. Lotus has previously expressed its opposition
to being acquired by IBM. Lotus has available various
defensive measures--including a "poison pill", the Delaware
Business Combinations Statute, 8 Del. C.  203
("Section 203"), the Massachusetts Control Share Acquisition
Statute, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 110E ("Chapter 110E") and the
Massachusetts Anti-Takeover Statute, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 110C
("Chapter 110C")--which may be used to block the Offer. In
light of its opposition to an acquisition, Lotus may also
take steps to block the Consent Solicitation.

5. Given the nature of the Offer and its
substantial value to Lotus's stockholders, the Lotus Board
should not be allowed to deprive the stockholders of the
opportunity to decide upon the merits of the Offer for
themselves. Use of Lotus's anti-takeover devices or other
defensive measures against the Offer, Proposed Merger or
Consent Solicitation represent an unreasonable response to
the Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent Solicitation, in
violation of fiduciary duties owed to Lotus's stockholders.

6. Chapters 110E and 110C are unconstitutional,
both on their face and as applied in this case, because they
violate the Commerce Clause of the United States
Constitution. These Massachusetts statutes purport to
regulate unsolicited takeovers with respect to a significant
number of foreign corporations throughout the United States,
which engage in interstate commerce, even though most or all
of these corporations' stockholders are not located in
Massachusetts. This extraterritorial reach here invades
Delaware's regulatory authority over its domestic
corporations, and subjects non-Massachusetts corporations to
inconsistent regulation. Moreover, each statute's
application to foreign stockholders creates a burden that is
excessive in relation to its purported local benefits.

7. Chapter 110C is also pre-empted by the
Williams Act and thus violates the Supremacy Clause of the
United States Constitution. The Williams Act establishes a
regime designed to provide even-handed regulation of tender
offers. Chapter 110C frustrates this objective by imposing
disclosure, hearing and adjudication provisions that are
inconsistent with the Williams Act and the regulations
thereunder, in violation of the Supremacy Clause.

8. The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation comply or will comply with all applicable laws,
obligations and agreements, including, without limitation,
the securities laws, the antitrust laws, and all other legal
obligations to which plaintiffs are subject, including any
contractual and common law obligations that may be owed by
plaintiffs to Lotus. Given the nature of the Offer and its
benefits, Lotus should assist plaintiffs in obtaining any
necessary regulatory approvals. In any event, Lotus should
not be permitted to attempt to delay consummation of the
Offer, Proposed Merger or Consent Solicitation by litigation
in other forums.

9. Lotus's use of defensive measures and
unconstitutional statutes to obstruct the Offer, Proposed
Merger and Consent Solicitation will deprive Lotus's
stockholders of the opportunity to decide upon their merits
for themselves and will cause plaintiffs irreparable injury
as a result of the loss of the unique opportunity to acquire
control of Lotus.

Jurisdiction and Venue

10. The Court has jurisdiction of the subject
matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1331,
1332(a), 1337(a), 1367(a) and 2201. The plaintiffs and
defendants are citizens of different states, and the matter
in controversy exceeds the sum of $50,000, exclusive of
interest and costs.

11. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to
28 U.S.C.  1391(b) and (c).

The Parties

12. Plaintiff IBM is a New York corporation with
its principal place of business in New York. IBM's business
activities (including research and development,
manufacturing, marketing and service) are primarily in the
field of information processing products and services. IBM
owns common stock of Lotus.

13. Plaintiff White is a New York corporation
with its principal place of business in New York. It is a
wholly owned.subsidiary of IBM and was incorporated for the
purpose of making the Offer and Consent Solicitation and
acquiring all the stock of Lotus. White owns common stock
of Lotus.

14. Defendant Lotus is a Delaware corporation
with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. It
is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing,
marketing and supporting applications software and services.

15. Defendant Jim P. Manzi is a citizen of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Since 1984, he has been
President of Lotus and since 1986 he has been Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Lotus.

The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent Solicitation

16. On June 5, 1995, White announced its
intention to commence a tender offer for all outstanding
shares of Lotus common stock (together with the associated
preferred share purchase rights issued in connection with
Lotus's poison pill), at the price of $60 per share (and
associated right) net to the seller in cash. The Offer is
conditioned, inter alia, upon (a) valid tender of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Lotus's common stock;
(b) redemption, invalidation or inapplicability of the share
purchase rights; (c) approval of the acquisition of shares
pursuant to the Offer and the Proposed Merger under
Section 203, or inapplicability of Section 203; and
(d) elimination from Lotus's bylaws, invalidity or
inapplicability of Chapter 110E. The Offer is not subject
to any condition relating to plaintiffs' ability to finance
the Offer or the Proposed Merger.

17. IBM intends, as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer, to propose and seek to have Lotus
consummate a merger or similar business combination with
White or another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of IBM. The purpose of the Proposed Merger is to acquire
all shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offer
or otherwise. Pursuant to the Proposed Merger, each such
share (other than those held by stockholders who perfect
appraisal rights) would be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the price per share paid
pursuant to the Offer.

18. On June 5, 1995, White announced its
intention to file preliminary consent solicitation materials
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for
use in connection with the solicitation of written consents
from Lotus's stockholders to, inter alia, (i) remove all six
of the present members of the Board of Directors of Lotus,
(ii) replace them with other nominees (who intend to redeem
the poison pill or make it inapplicable to the Offer and
Proposed Merger, approve the Offer and Proposed Merger for
the purposes of Section 203, and take any other appropriate
action to facilitate consummation of the Offer and Proposed
Merger, or, if any other transaction offering more value to
Lotus's stockholders is proposed, take action to facilitate
such a transaction) and (iii) take certain other actions
designed to facilitate consummation of the Offer and
Proposed Merger, including the elimination from Lotus's
bylaws of the provision purporting to provide for the
application of Chapter 110E.

19. White's Offer is clearly in the best
interests of Lotus's stockholders. It is a fully financed,
all cash offer, available to all Lotus stockholders, for all
outstanding shares. It is not "front-end loaded" or
otherwise coercive in nature. Moreover, it provides Lotus's
stockholders with the opportunity to realize a substantial
premium over the market price of their shares prior to
announcement of the Offer. On the last Nasdaq National
Market trading day before announcement of the Offer, the
~closing price of Lotus shares was $32-1/2 per share. The
Offer price therefore represents a premium of $27-1/2-per
share (or 85%) over the market price of the shares
immediately prior to announcement of the Offer.

20. The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation do not pose any threat to the interests of
Lotus's stockholders or to Lotus's corporate policy and
effectiveness.

21. The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation comply or will comply with all applicable laws,
obligations and agreements, including, without limitation,
the securities laws, the antitrust laws, and all other legal
obligations to which plaintiffs are subject, including any
contractual and common law obligations that may be owed by
plaintiffs to Lotus. The offering documents and preliminary
Consent Solicitation materials will be filed with the SEC
and NASD and delivered to Lotus upon commencement of the
Offer. The offering documents fairly disclose all
information material to the decision of Lotus's stockholders
whether to accept or reject the Offer, in compliance with
plaintiffs' obligations under the securities laws.
Plaintiffs will also make the filings required by the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Act. The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation are lawful under the antitrust laws.

22. The Offer and Proposed Merger cannot be
completed successfully unless the Lotus Board agrees to
remove Lotus's anti-takeover devices or allows the Consent
Solicitation to proceed unhindered.

23. Lotus's Chairman, Mr. Manzi, has previously
expressed opposition to an acquisition by IBM. On January
31, 1995, John M. Thompson, the senior vice president in
charge of IBM's software development activities, inquired as
to Mr. Manzi's interest in having IBM acquire Lotus, but Mr.
Manzi indicated that Lotus (as opposed to only a part of its
business) was not for sale. On March 16, 1995, Mr. Thompson
met with Mr. Manzi to review the status of ongoing
discussions concerning marketing and development
collaboration between IBM and Lotus. One of the potential
business arrangements suggested by Mr. Thompson was an
acquisition by IBM of Lotus. Mr. Manzi stated that he would
not sell equity directly to IBM. On March 17, 1995, Mr.
Manzi informed Mr. Thompson that he would not discuss an
acquisition by IBM of Lotus.

Lotus's Defensive Measures

Poison Pill

24. On November 7, 1988, Lotus's Board adopted a
stockholder rights plan (the "Poison Pill"), which
effectively allows the Board unilaterally to block
acquisition offers, even those providing substantial
benefits to Lotus's stockholders. The Registration
Statement which was filed by Lotus with the SEC stated:

"The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects.
The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire the
Company on terms not approved by the Company's
Board of Directors, except pursuant to an offer
conditioned on a substantial number of Rights
being acquired."

25. The Board declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right per share of common stock (a
"Right"), payable to each of Lotus's stockholders of record
as of November 23, 1988. Each Right entitles the holder to
purchase a unit of a new issue of Lotus's preferred stock,
amounting to one one-hundredth of a share of such stock, at
a price of $75 per unit. If the Rights are "triggered"--
inter alia, by an acquisition of 15% or more of Lotus's
common stock--each holder of a Right will be able to
exercise the Right to receive common stock (or in certain
circumstances, cash, assets or other securities of Lotus)
having a market value of twice the then current exercise
price of such Right. Under a "sterilizing" provision of the
Poison Pill, in the event of an unsolicited takeover, any
Rights held by the acquiror will be null and void.

26. Lotus's Board can redeem the Rights at a
redemption price of $.01 per Right, or alternatively, can
amend the Poison Pill to make the Rights inapplicable to the
Offer and the Proposed Merger. Although the Rights may be
redeemed pursuant to a stockholder vote at a special meeting
called to vote upon a tender offer which complies with
certain specified conditions, this meeting need not be
called by the Board until up to 120 days after the later of
(1) the date the offer is received and (2) the date of any
meeting of stockholders already scheduled as of the offer
date.

27. The Poison Pill, at a minimum (and aside from
the prohibitively expensive effect of its triggering),
enables the Lotus Board to stall any tender offer for a
period of at least 4 months from the date of the offer,
regardless of the interests of Lotus's stockholders. This
potential delay is especially unjustified in this case,
given the non-coercive nature of White's Offer and the
substantial benefits it would generate. Given the nature
and value of the Offer, the Lotus Board should redeem the
Rights, or amend the Poison Pill to make the Rights
inapplicable to the Offer and Proposed Merger, to enable
stockholders to decide upon the merits of the Offer for
themselves.

Delaware Business Combination Statute, Section 203

28. Section 203, entitled "Business Combinations
with Interested Stockholders", applies to any Delaware
corporation that has not opted out of the statute's
coverage. Lotus has not opted out of the statute's
coverage.

29. Section 203 was designed to impede coercive
and inadequate tender offers. Section 203 provides that if
a person acquires 15% or more of a corporation's voting
stock (thereby becoming an "interested stockholder"), such
interested stockholder may not engage in a "business
combination" with the corporation (defined to include a
merger or consolidation) for three years after the
interested stockholder becomes such, unless: (i) prior to
the 15% acquisition, the Board of Directors has approved
either the acquisition or the business combination, (ii) the
interested stockholder acquires 85% of the corporation's
voting stock in the same transaction in which it crosses the
15% threshold, or (iii) on or subsequent to the date of the
15% acquisition, the business combination is approved by the
Board of Directors and authorized at an annual or special
meeting of stockholders (and not by written consent) by the
affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding
voting stock which is not owned by the interested
stockholder.

30. Because the Lotus Board should approve
White's Offer, Section 203 should not be applicable.
Section 203 should not be used by the Lotus Board to
obstruct the Offer, which is non-coercive, offers Lotus's
stockholders a substantial premium for their shares, and
poses no threat to the interests of Lotus's stockholders or
to Lotus's corporate policy and effectiveness.

Massachusetts Control Share Acquisition Statute
Chapter 110E

31. Chapter 110E, entitled "Regulation of Control
Share Acquisitions of Foreign Corporations", purports to
apply to any foreign corporation ("issuing public
corporation") whose bylaws provide for its application and
which meets the following jurisdictional requirements:
(i) two hundred or more stockholders; (ii) its principal
executive office within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
and more of its employees or assets, including employees or
assets of its majority owned subsidiaries, employed or
located in the Commonwealth than in any other state as of
the end of any of its four fiscal quarters immediately
preceding the control share acquisition or the date on which
the control share acquisition statement is delivered; and
(iii) either more than 10% of its stockholders residing
within the Commonwealth or more than 10% of the issued and
outstanding shares owned of record by residents of the
Commonwealth. By virtue of this definition, the provisions
of Chapter 110E purport to apply to acquisitions of shares
in foreign corporations where up to 90% of the shareholders
or ownership of up to 90% of the shares are located outside
of Massachusetts.

32. Section 5 of Chapter 110E provides that
shares in an issuing public corporation which are acquired
in a control share acquisition shall have voting rights only
to the extent authorized by a majority of stockholders other
than holders of interested shares (defined to include shares
which are beneficially owned by any person who has made or
proposes to make a control share acquisition). A control
share acquisition is defined as the acquisition of
beneficial ownership of shares with (i) one-fifth or more
but less than one-third of all voting power; (ii) one-third
or more but less than a majority of all voting power; or
(iii) a majority or more of all voting power. It does not
include an acquisition pursuant to a tender offer, merger or
consolidation which is made pursuant to an agreement of
merger or consolidation to which the issuing public
corporation is a party.

33. The effect of Chapter 110E is, therefore,
that shares acquired in an unsolicited tender offer shall
only carry voting rights to the extent authorized by holders
of shares other than those already acquired in the tender
offer. Moreover, the shareholder vote on the resolution
regarding the voting rights to be accorded the acquiror's
control shares is not required to be taken until the next
scheduled special or annual meeting of stockholders unless
the person delivering the control share acquisition
statement makes a contemporaneous written demand on the
target corporation for a special meeting of stockholders for
this specific purpose. In that event, the directors of the
corporation may wait for up to 50 days after receipt of the
demand by the corporation before holding such a meeting.

34. In short, the purpose and effect of
Massachusetts' Chapter 110E is to deter and prevent
takeovers of foreign corporations, such as Lotus, with up to
90% foreign stockholders, by depriving any person who seeks
to acquire control of such a company, without Board
approval, of many of the substantial benefits and incentives
of such an acquisition.

35. Given the nature and value to Lotus's
stockholders of White's Offer, Lotus's Board should not take
any steps to apply or enforce the provisions of Chapter 110E
and should permit the Offer to proceed unhindered so that
Lotus's stockholders can decide upon its merits for
themselves.

Massachusetts Anti-Takeover Statute, Chapter 110C

36. Chapter 110C, entitled "Regulation of Take-
Over Bids in the Acquisition of Corporations", purports to
apply, inter alia, to takeover bids for any corporation that
has its principal place of business in Massachusetts.
Accordingly, it purports to apply even to takeover bids for
foreign corporations where all of the corporation's
shareholders or ownership of all of the corporation's shares
are located outside Massachusetts.

37. Section 2 of Chapter 110C provides that no
offeror will make a "takeover bid"--defined to exclude any
takeover bid to which the target Board consents--unless,
among other things, the offeror publicly announces the terms
of the proposed takeover bid and files with the Secretary of
State of Massachusetts and the target, on the date of the
commencement of the bid, copies of all information required
by Section 4. Section 2 further provides that the Secretary
of State~ may, on his own initiative or at the request of the
target or an offeree, order a hearing to consider whether
the bid complies with the provisions of the chapter.
Pursuant to Section 6, the Secretary has up to 45 days to
render a decision.

38. Chapter 110C therefore requires a tender
offeror to comply with onerous requirements--in addition to
the disclosure obligations under the Williams Act--and to
wait for up to 45 days before consummating the offer, unless
the offeror is prepared to run the risk that the Secretary
of State may deem the disclosures inadequate in some respect
and that stockholders who have already accepted the offer
may then seek to rescind and recover their securities.

39. Given the nature and value to Lotus
stockholders of White's Offer, Lotus's Board should not take
any steps to apply or enforce the provisions of Chapter 110C
and should permit the Offer to proceed unhindered so that
Lotus's stockholders can decide upon its merits for
themselves.

Irreparable Injury

40. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.
Only through the exercise of the Court's equitable powers
will plaintiffs and Lotus's other stockholders be protected
from immediate and irreparable injury. Unless the Court
enjoins the application of Lotus's anti-takeover devices to
White's Offer and enjoins Lotus from impeding the Offer,
Proposed Merger and Consent Solicitation by any other
measures, including litigation in other forums, Lotus
stockholders will be deprived of the opportunity to decide
for themselves whether or not to accept the Offer.
Moreover, White will be precluded from consummating the
Offer, which is conditioned on removal or inapplicability of
Lotus's anti-takeover devices, will be denied any meaningful
access to or control over the assets of Lotus, and will be
hindered in or prevented from exercising its fundamental
stockholder rights under Delaware law. Should that occur,
plaintiffs will have lost the unique opportunity to acquire
Lotus, and other Lotus stockholders will have lost the
opportunity to sell their shares for a substantial premium.

COUNT ONE

41. Plaintiffs repeat, reaver and incorporate
each averment contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40 of this
Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

42. White's Offer is fully financed; it is non-
coercive and non-discriminatory; it is fair to Lotus
stockholders; and it represents a substantial premium over
the market price of Lotus shares prior to announcement of
the Offer. The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation comply with all applicable laws, obligations
and agreements--including, without limitation, the
securities laws, the antitrust laws, and all other legal
obligations to which plaintiffs are subject, including any
contractual and common law obligations that may be owed by
plaintiffs to Lotus--and pose no threat to the interests of
Lotus's stockholders or to Lotus's corporate policy or
effectiveness. Use of Lotus's anti-takeover devices or any
other defensive measures to prevent Lotus stockholders from
deciding for themselves whether or not to accept the Offer
or Consent Solicitation is not proportionate to any threat
posed, nor within the range of reasonable responses to the
Offer, Proposed Merger or Consent Solicitation, in breach of
the Board's fiduciary duties to Lotus stockholders.
Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against such breaches of
fiduciary duties.

43. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.

COUNT TWO

44. Plaintiffs repeat and reaver as if fully set
forth herein each averment in Paragraphs 1 through 40 of
this Complaint.

45. This cause of action arises under the
Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the United States
Constitution, U.S. Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, and art. 6,
2, respectively.

46. The Offer constitutes a substantial
securities transaction in interstate commerce, employing
interstate instrumentalities and facilities in the
communication of the Offer, and in transactions for the
purchase and sale of Lotus's securities occurring across
state lines.

47. The extraterritorial application of
Chapters 110E and 110C here invades Delaware's regulatory
authority over its domestic corporations, and subjects non-
Massachusetts corporations to inconsistent regulation.
Massachusetts is but one of numerous states with which Lotus
has significant contacts. To allow Massachusetts to
regulate an acquisition of a Delaware corporation with
significant contacts in states other than Massachusetts is
to guarantee inconsistent regulation, in violation of the
Commerce Clause.

48. Chapters 110E and 110C also violate the
Commerce Clause because they impose direct, substantial and
adverse burdens on interstate commerce that are excessive in
relation to local interests served by the statutes. Among
other things, Chapters 110E and 110C inhibit the making and
consummation of nationwide control share acquisitions and
takeover bids involving purely out of state shares and share
transactions. Chapter 110E deters out of state control
share acquisitions because of the risk or actuality that an
acquiror will not gain voting rights in the corporation even
if the acquisition is otherwise successful and because of
the delay necessary to consummate the acquisition. Chapter
110C deters out of state takeover bids by imposing
substantial filing and disclosure burdens on bidders and by
delaying consummation of bids or creating uncertainty with
respect to the status of share transactions entered into
pursuant to such bids.

49. Chapters 110E and 110C do not serve any
legitimate local interests sufficient to justify the burdens
they impose on interstate commerce. Massachusetts has no
legitimate interest in the purely out of state sales and
purchases of shares in a Delaware corporation acquired
pursuant to a tender offer or in the voting rights attendant
upon these shares to weigh in its balance against the
substantial burdens that Chapters 110E and 110C place on
interstate commerce. Massachusetts also has no interest in
protecting nonresident shareholders of nonresident
corporations. There are no local benefits that arise from
the statutes' application to such persons.

50. Chapters 110E and 110C are unconstitutional
and null and void on their face under the Commerce Clause.
In addition, Chapters 110E and 110C are unconstitutional and
null and void under the Commerce Clause in their application
under the circumstances of this case. Lotus is a foreign
corporation with numerous foreign shareholders to which
these statutes purport to apply, and plaintiffs are both
foreign corporations. Accordingly, the risk of inconsistent
regulation and the undue burden on interstate commerce that
are created by these statutes have a direct and substantial
impact in this case.

51. Chapter 110C also violates the Supremacy
Clause of the United States Constitution. The Offer is
subject to the federal laws and regulations governing tender
offers, including the Williams Act amendments to the
Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.  78m and 78n, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Williams
Act is intended to establish even-handed regulation of
tender offers which favors neither the offeror nor incumbent
management of the target but leaves the decision concerning
the merits of the offer to the target's stockholders.

52. The provisions of Chapter 110C conflict with
the provisions of the Williams Act and the regulations
thereunder, inter alia, by imposing additional disclosure
requirements on the tender offeror which are not required by
the Williams Act, by providing for a hearing at the instance
of the Massachusetts Secretary of State or any offeree, and
by allowing the Secretary of State to pass on the
substantive fairness of the offer. These provisions impose
substantial and unnecessary burdens on the offeror,
introduce extended delay into the offer process, interfere
with the freedom of the target's stockholders to make their
own decisions concerning the merits of the offer, and upset
the balance struck by Congress in enacting the Williams Act
by favoring target management at the expense of
stockholders.

53. The provisions of Chapter 110C are
unconstitutional and null and void on their face under the
Supremacy Clause because they conflict with and stand as an
obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full
purposes and objectives of the Williams Act. Moreover,
because Lotus is a corporation to which Chapter 110C
purports to apply, the unconstitutional burdens imposed by
Chapter 110C have a direct and substantial impact in this
case. Accordingly, Chapter 110C is also unconstitutional
and null and void in its application under the circumstances
of this case under the Supremacy Clause.

54. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief with
respect to the unconstitutionality of Chapters 110E and
110C, pursuant to the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, 28
U.S.C.  2201, and injunctive relief against the application
and enforcement of these unconstitutional statutes.

55. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.

COUNT THREE

56. Plaintiffs repeat and reaver as if fully set
forth herein each averment in Paragraphs 1 through 40 of
this Complaint.

57. The Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation comply or will comply with all applicable laws,
obligations and agreements, including, without limitation,
the securities laws, the antitrust laws, and all other legal
obligations to which plaintiffs are subject, including any
contractual and common law obligations that may be owed by
plaintiffs to Lotus. Given the nature of the Offer and its
benefits, Lotus should assist plaintiffs in obtaining any
necessary regulatory approvals. In any event, Lotus should
not be permitted to attempt to delay consummation of the
~Offer, Proposed Merger or Consent Solicitation by litigation
in other forums. To prevent any unnecessary impediment to
consummation of the Offer, Proposed Merger and Consent
Solicitation, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment with
respect to their validity and declaratory and injunctive
relief against Lotus's commencement of proceedings in any
forum other than this Court which would impede their
commencement, continuation or consummation.

58. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.

WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court
enter an order:

(a) enjoining Lotus, its directors, officers,
successors, agents, servants, subsidiaries, employees
and attorneys, and all persons acting in concert or
participating with them, from taking any steps to
impede or frustrate the ability of Lotus's stockholders
to consider and make their own determination as to
whether to accept the terms of the Offer or give or
withhold consent to the terms of the Consent
Solicitation, or taking any other action to thwart or
interfere with the Offer, Proposed Merger or Consent
Solicitation;

(b) compelling Lotus's Board of Directors to
redeem the Rights associated with the Poison Pill or to
amend the Poison Pill so as to make the Rights
inapplicable to the Offer and the Proposed Merger, and
enjoining Lotus, its directors, officers, successors,
agents, servants, subsidiaries, employees and
attorneys, and all persons acting in concert or
participating with them, from taking any action to
implement, distribute or recognize any rights or powers
with respect to said Rights (other than to redeem the
Rights), and from taking any actions pursuant to the
Poison Pill that would dilute or interfere with White's
voting rights or in any other way discriminate against
White in the exercise of its rights with respect to its
Lotus stock;

(c) compelling Lotus's Board of Directors to
approve the Offer and the Proposed Merger for the
purposes of Section 203, and enjoining Lotus, its
directors, officers, successors, agents, servants,
subsidiaries, employees and attorneys, and all persons

SEC. 3. PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this Act to increase competition
in all telecommunications markets and provide for an orderly
transition from regulated markets to competitive and deregulated
telecommunications markets consistent with the public interest,
convenience, and necessity. SEC. 4. GOALS. This Act is intended to
establish a national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly
the private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and
information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all
telecommunications  markets to competition, and to meet the following
goals: (1) To promote and encourage advanced telecommunications
networks, capable of enabling users to originate and receive
affordable, high-quality voice, data, image, graphic, and video
telecommunications services. (2) To improve international
competitiveness markedly. (3) To spur economic growth, create jobs,
and increase productivity. (4) To deliver a better quality of life
through the preservation and advancement of universal service to allow
the more efficient delivery of educational, health care, and other
social services. SEC. 5. FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following
findings: (1) Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur
innovation and the development of new services.  A competitive market
place is the most efficient way to lower prices and increase value for
consumers. In furthering the principle of open and full competition in
all telecommunications markets, however, it must be recognized that
some markets are more open than others. (2) Local telephone service is
predominantly a monopoly service.  Although business customers in
metropolitan areas may have alternative providers for exchange access
service, consumers do not have a choice of local telephone service.  
Some States have begun to open local telephone markets to competition.
 A national policy framework is needed to accelerate the process. (3)
Because of their monopoly status, local telephone companies and the
Bell operating companies have been prevented from competing in certain
markets.  It is time to eliminate these restrictions.  Nonetheless,
transition rules designed to open monopoly markets to competition must
be in place before certain restrictions are lifted. (4) Transition
rules must be truly transitional, not protectionism for certain
industry segments or artificial impediments to increased competition
in all markets.  Where possible, transition rules should create
investment incentives through increased competition.  Regulatory
safeguards should be adopted only where competitive conditions would
not prevent anticompetitive behavior. (5) More competitive American
telecommunications markets will promote United States technological
advances, domestic job and investment opportunities, national
competitiveness, sustained economic development, and improved quality
of American life  more effectively than regulation. (6) Congress
should establish clear statutory guidelines, standards, and time
frames to facilitate more effective communications competition and, by
so doing, will reduce business and customer uncertainty, lessen
regulatory processes, court appeals, and litigation, and thus
encourage the business community to focus more on competing in the
domestic and international communications marketplace. (7) Where
competitive markets are demonstrably inadequate to safeguard important
public policy goals, such as the continued universal availability of
telecommunications services at reasonable and affordable prices,
particularly in rural  America, Congress should establish workable
regulatory procedures to advance those goals, provided that in any
proceeding undertaken to ensure universal availability, regulators
shall seek to choose the most procompetitive and least burdensome
alternative. (8) Competitive communications markets, safeguarded by
effective Federal and State antitrust enforcement, and strong economic
growth in the United States which such markets will foster are the
most effective means of assuring that all segments of the American
public command access to advanced telecommunications technologies. (9)
Achieving full and fair competition requires strict  parity of
marketplace opportunities and responsibilities on the part of
incumbent telecommunications service providers as well as new entrants
into the telecommunications marketplace, provided that any
responsibilities placed on providers should  be the minimum required
to advance a clearly defined public policy goal. (10) Congress should
not cede its constitutional responsibility regarding interstate and
foreign commerce in communications to the Judiciary through the
establishment of procedures which will encourage or necessitate
judicial interpretation or intervention into the communications
marketplace. (11) Ensuring that all Americans, regardless of where
they  may work, live, or visit, ultimately have comparable access to
the full benefits of competitive communications markets  requires
Federal and State authorities to work together affirmatively to
minimize and remove unnecessary institutional and regulatory barriers
to new entry and competition. (12) Effectively competitive
communications markets will ensure customers the widest possible
choice of services and equipment, tailored to individual desires and
needs, and at prices they are willing to pay. (13) Investment in and
deployment of existing and future advanced, multipurpose technologies
will best be fostered by minimizing government limitations on the
commercial use of  those technologies. (14) The efficient development
of competitive United States communications markets will be furthered
by policies which aim at ensuring reciprocal opening of international
investment opportunities. SEC. 6.  AMENDMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF
1934. Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an
amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or
repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be
considered to be made to a section or other provision of the

INTERCONNECTION REQUIREMENTS. (a) Required Interconnection: Title II
(47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 228 the
following: `PART II--COMPETITION IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS `SEC. 251.
INTERCONNECTION. `(a) Duty to Provide Interconnection:  `(1) In
general: A local exchange carrier, or class of local exchange
carriers, determined by the Commission to have market power in
providing telephone exchange service or exchange  access service has a
duty under this Act, upon request-- `(A) to enter into good faith
negotiations with any telecommunications carrier requesting
interconnection between the facilities and equipment of the requesting
telecommunications carrier and the carrier, or class of carriers, of
which the request was made for the purpose of permitting the
telecommunications carrier to provide telephone exchange or exchange
access service; and `(B) to provide such interconnection, at rates
that are reasonable and nondiscriminatory, according to the terms of
the agreement and in accordance with the requirements of this section.
`(2) Initiation: A local exchange carrier, or class of carriers,
described in paragraph (1) shall commence good faith negotiations to
conclude an agreement, whether through negotiation under subsection
(c) or arbitration or intervention under subsection (d), within 15
days after receiving a request from any telecommunications carrier
seeking to provide  telephone exchange or exchange access service.
Nothing in this Act shall prohibit multilateral negotiations between
or among a local exchange carrier or class of carriers and a
telecommunications carrier or class of carriers seeking
interconnection under subsection (c) or subsection (d). At the request
of any of the parties to a negotiation, a State may participate in the
negotiation of any portion of an agreement under subsection (c). `(3)
Market power: For the purpose of determining whether a carrier has
market power under paragraph (1), the relevant market shall include
all providers of telephone exchange or exchange access services in a
local area, regardless of the technology used by any such provider.
`(b) Minimum Standards: An interconnection agreement entered into
under this section shall, if requested by a telecommunications carrier
requesting interconnection, provide for-- `(1) nondiscriminatory
access on an unbundled basis to the network functions and services of
the local exchange carrier's telecommunications network (including
switching software, to  the extent defined in implementing regulations
by the Commission); `(2) nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled
basis to any of the local exchange carrier's telecommunications
facilities and information, including databases and signaling,
necessary to  the transmission and routing of any telephone exchange
service or exchange access service and the interoperability of both
carriers' networks; `(3) interconnection to the local exchange
carrier's telecommunications facilities and services at any
technically feasible point within the carrier's network; `(4)
interconnection that is at least equal in type, quality, and price (on
a per unit basis or otherwise) to that provided  by the local exchange
carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party
to which the  carrier provides interconnection; `(5) nondiscriminatory
access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way owned or
controlled by the local exchange carrier at just and reasonable rates;
`(6) the local exchange carrier to take whatever action under its
control is necessary, as soon as is technically feasible,  to provide
telecommunications number portability and local dialing parity in a
manner that-- `(A) permits consumers to be able to dial the same
number of digits when using any telecommunications carrier providing
telephone exchange service or exchange access service in the market
served by the local exchange carrier; `(B) permits all such carriers
to have nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator
services, directory assistance, and directory listing with no
unreasonable dialing delays; and `(C) provides for a reasonable
allocation of costs among the parties to the agreement; `(7)
telecommunications services and network functions of the local
exchange carrier to be available to the  telecommunications carrier on
an unbundled basis without any unreasonable conditions on the resale
or sharing of those services or functions, including the origination,
transport,  and termination of such telecommunications services, other
than reasonable conditions required by a State; and for purposes of
this paragraph, it is not an unreasonable condition for a State to
limit the resale-- `(A) of services included in the definition of
universal service to a telecommunications carrier who resells that
service to a category of customers different from the category of
customers being offered that universal service by such carrier if the
State orders a carrier to provide  the same service to different
categories of customers at different prices necessary to promote
universal service; or `(B) of subsidized  universal service in a
manner that allows companies to charge another carrier rates which
reflect the actual cost of providing those services to that carrier,
exclusive of any universal service support  received for providing
such services in accordance with section 214(d)(5); `(8) reciprocal
compensation arrangements for the origination and termination of
telecommunications; `(9) reasonable public notice of changes in the
information necessary for the transmission and routing of services
using that local exchange carrier's facilities or networks, as well 
as of any other changes that would affect the interoperability of
those facilities and networks; and `(10) a schedule of itemized
charges and conditions for each service, facility, or function
provided under the agreement. `(c) Agreements Arrived at Through
Negotiation: Upon receiving a request for interconnection, a local
exchange carrier may meet its interconnection obligations under this
section by negotiating and entering into a binding agreement with the
telecommunications carrier seeking interconnection without regard to
the standards set forth in subsection (b). The agreement shall include
a schedule of itemized charges for each service, facility, or function
included  in the agreement. The agreement, including any
interconnection agreement negotiated before the date of enactment of
the Telecommunications Act of 1995, shall be submitted to the State
under subsection (e). `(d) Agreements Arrived at Through Arbitration
or Intervention:  `(1) In general: Any party negotiating an
interconnection agreement under this section may, at any point in the
negotiation, ask a State to participate in the negotiation and to
arbitrate any differences arising in the course of the negotiation. 
The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate
further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the  State in carrying
out its function as a arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good
faith in the presence, or with  the assistance, of the State shall be
considered a failure to negotiate in good faith. `(2) Intervention: If
any issues remain open in a negotiation commenced under this section
more than 135 days after the date upon which the local exchange
carrier received the request for such negotiation, then the carrier or
any other party to the negotiation may petition a State to intervene
in the negotiations for purposes of resolving any such remaining open
issues. Any such request must be made during the 25-day period that
begins 135 days after the carrier receives the request for such
negotiation and ends 160 days after that date. `(3) Duty of
petitioner:  `(A) A party that petitions a State under paragraph (2)
shall, at the same time as it submits the petition, provide the State
all relevant documentation concerning the negotiations necessary to
understand-- `(i) the unresolved issues; `(ii) the position of each of
the parties with  respect to those issues; and `(iii) any other issue
discussed and resolved by the parties. `(B) A party petitioning a
State under paragraph (2)  shall provide a copy of the petition and
any documentation to the other party not later than the day on which
the  State receives the petition. `(4) Opportunity to respond: A party
to a negotiation under this section with respect to which the other
party has petitioned a State under paragraph (2) may respond to the
other party's petition and provide such additional information as it
wishes within 25 days after the State receives the petition. `(5)
Action by state:  `(A) A State proceeding to consider a petition under
this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
promulgated by the Commission under subsection (i). The State shall
limit its consideration of any petition under paragraph (2) (and any
response thereto) to the issues set forth in the petition and in the
response, if any, filed under paragraph (4). `(B) The State may
require the petitioning party and the responding party to provide such
information as may be necessary for the State to reach a decision on
the unresolved issues. If either party refuses or fails unreasonably
to respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the State,
then the State may proceed on the basis of the best information
available to it from whatever source derived. `(C) The State shall
resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any,
by imposing appropriate conditions upon the parties to the agreement,
and shall conduct the review of the agreement (including the issues
resolved by the State) not later than 10 months after the date on
which the local exchange carrier received the request for
interconnection under this section. `(D) In resolving any open issues
and imposing conditions upon the parties to the agreement, a State
shall ensure  that the requirements of this section are met by the
solution imposed by the State and are consistent with the Commission's
rules defining minimum standards. `(6) Charges: If the amount charged
by a local exchange carrier, or class of local exchange carriers, for
an unbundled element of the interconnection provided under subsection
(b) is determined by arbitration or intervention under this 
subsection, then the charge-- `(A) shall be `(i) based on the cost
(determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based
proceeding) of providing the unbundled element, `(ii)
nondiscriminatory, and `(iii) individually priced to the smallest
element that is technically feasible and economically  reasonable to
provide; and `(B) may include a reasonable profit. `(e) Approval by
State: Any interconnection agreement under this section shall be
submitted for approval to the State. A State to which an agreement is
submitted shall approve or reject the agreement, with written findings
as to any deficiencies.  The State may only reject-- `(1) an agreement
under subsection (c) if it finds that the agreement discriminates
against a telecommunications carrier  not a party to the agreement;
and `(2) an agreement under subsection (d) if it finds that-- `(B) the
agreement does not meet the standards set forth in subsection (b), or
`(B) the implementation of the agreement is not in the public
interest. If the State does not act to approve or reject the agreement
within 90 days after receiving the agreement, or 30 days in the case
of an agreement negotiated under subsection (c), the agreement shall
be deemed approved.  No State court shall have jurisdiction to review
the action of a State in approving or rejecting an agreement under
this section. `(f) Filing Required: A State shall make a copy of each
a greement  approved under subsection (e) available for public
inspection and copying within 10 days after the agreement is approved.
The State may charge a reasonable and nondiscriminatory fee to the
parties to the agreement to cover the costs of approving and filing
such agreement. `(g) Availability to Other Telecommunications
Carriers: A local exchange carrier shall make available any service,
facility, or function provided under an interconnection agreement to
which it is a party to any other telecommunications carrier that
requests such interconnection upon the same terms and conditions as
those  provided in the agreement. `(h) Collocation: A State may
require telecommunications carriers to provide for actual collocation
of equipment necessary for interconnection at the premises of the
carrier at reasonable charges, if the State finds actual collocation
to be in the public interest. `(i) Implementation:  `(1) Rules and
standards: The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
requirements of this section within 6 months after the date of
enactment of the Telecommunications  Act of 1995.  In establishing the
standards for determining  what facilities and information are
necessary for purposes of subsection (b)(2), the Commission shall
consider, at a minimum, whether-- `(A) access to such facilities and
information that are proprietary in nature is necessary; and `(B) the
failure to provide access to such facilities and information would
impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking
interconnection to provide the services that it seeks to offer. `(2)
Commission to act if state will not act: If a State, through action or
inaction, fails to carry out its responsibility under this section in
accordance with the rules prescribed by the Commission under paragraph
(1) in any proceeding or other matter under this section, then the
Commission shall issue an order preempting the State's jurisdiction of
that proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or
taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume the responsibility of
the State under this section with respect to the proceeding or matter
and act for the State. `(3) Waivers and modifications for rural
carriers: The Commission or a State shall, upon petition or on its own
initiative, waive or modify the requirements of subsection (b) for a
rural telephone company or companies, and may waive or modify the
requirements of subsection (b) for local exchange carriers with fewer
than 2 percent of the Nation's subscriber lines installed in the
aggregate nationwide, to the extent that the Commission or a State
determines that such requirements would result in unfair competition,
impose a significant  adverse economic impact on users of
telecommunications  services, be technically infeasible, or otherwise
not be in the public interest. The Commission or a State shall act
upon any petition filed under this paragraph within 180 days of 
receiving such petition. Pending such action, the Commission or a
State may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements to
which the petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or
carriers. `(j) State Requirements: Nothing in this section precludes a
 State from imposing requirements on a telecommunications carrier  for
intrastate services that are necessary to further competition  in the
provision of telephone exchange service or exchange access service, as
long as the State's requirements are not inconsistent with the
Commission's regulations to implement this section. `(k) Access Charge
Rules: Nothing in this section shall affect 
the Commission's interexchange-to-local exchange access charge  rules
for local exchange carriers or interexchange carriers in effect on the
date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995. `(l) Review
of Interconnection Standards: Beginning 3 years after the date of
enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995 and every 3 years
thereafter, the Commission shall review the standards and requirements
for interconnection established under subsection (b).  The Commission
shall complete each such review within 180  days and may modify or
waive any requirements or standards established under subsection (b)
if it determines that the modification or waiver meets the
requirements of section 260. `(m) Commercial Mobile Service Providers:
The requirements of  this section shall not apply to commercial mobile
services provided by a wireline local exchange carrier unless the
Commission determines under subsection (a)(3) that such carrier has
market power in the provision of commercial mobile service.'. (c)
Technical Amendments:  (1) Title II (47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended
by inserting before section 201 the following: `PART I--GENERAL
PROVISIONS'. (2) Section 2(b) (47 U.S.C. 152(b)) is amended by
striking `sections 223 through 227, inclusive, and section 332,' and
inserting `section 214(d), sections 223 through 227, part II of title
II, and section 332,'. SEC. 102. SEPARATE AFFILIATE AND SAFEGUARD

sell telephone exchange services provided by the Bell operating
company unless that company permits other entities offering the same
or similar service to market and sell its telephone exchange services.
`(2) A Bell operating company may not market or sell any service
provided by an affiliate required by this section until that company
has been authorized to provide interLATA services under section 255.
`(3) The joint marketing and sale of services permitted under this

information are made available to  other providers of interLATA
services in that market on the  same terms and conditions; `(5) shall
charge the affiliate described in subsection (a), and impute to itself
or any intraLATA interexchange affiliate, the same rates for access to
its telephone exchange service and exchange access service that it
charges unaffiliated interexchange carriers for such service; and `(6)
may provide any interLATA or intraLATA facilities or services to its
interLATA affiliate if such services or facilities are made available
to all carriers at the same rates and on the same terms and conditions
so long as the costs are appropriately allocated. `(g) Proprietary
Information:  `(1) In general: In complying with the requirements of
this section, each Bell operating company and any affiliate of such
company has a duty to protect the confidentiality of propriety
information relating to other common carriers, to equipment
manufacturers, and to customers.  A Bell operating company may not
share customer proprietary information in aggregate form with its
affiliates unless such aggregate information is available to other
carriers or persons under the same terms and conditions.  Individually
identifiable customer proprietary information and other proprietary
information may be-- `(A) shared with any affiliated entity required
by this section or with any unaffiliated entity only with the consent
of the person to which such information relates or from which it was
obtained (including other carriers); or `(B) disclosed to appropriate
authorities pursuant to court order. `(2) Exceptions: Paragraph (1)
does not limit the disclosure of individually identifiable customer
proprietary information  by each Bell operating company as necessary--
`(A) to initiate, render, bill, and collect for telephone exchange
service, interexchange service, or telecommunications service
requested by a customer; or `(B) to protect the rights or property of
the carrier, or to protect users of any of those services and other 
carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription
to, any such service. `(3) Subscriber list information: For purposes
of this subsection, the term `customer proprietary information' does 
not include subscriber list information. `(h) Commission May Grant
Exceptions: The Commission may grant an exception from compliance with
any requirement of this section upon a showing that the exception is
necessary for the public interest, convenience, and necessity. `(i)
Application to Utility Companies:  `(1) Registered public utility
holding company: A registered company may provide telecommunications
services only through a separate subsidiary company that is not a
public utility company. `(2) Other utility companies: Each State shall
determine whether a holding company subject to its jurisdiction-- `(A)
that is not a registered holding company, and `(B) that provides
telecommunications service, is required to provide that service
through a separate subsidiary company. `(3) Savings provision: Nothing
in this subsection or the Telecommunications Act of 1995 prohibits a
public utility company from engaging in any activity in which it is
legally engaged on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act
of 1995; provided it complies with the terms of any applicable
authorizations. `(4) Definitions: For purposes of this subsection, the
terms `public utility company', `associate company', `holding
company', `subsidiary company', `registered holding company', and
`State commission' have the same meaning as they have in section 2 of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.'. (b) Implementation:
The Commission shall promulgate any regulations necessary to implement
section 252 of the  Communications Act of 1934 (as added by subsection
(a)) not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act.
Any separate affiliate established or designated for purposes of
section 252(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 before the
regulations have been issued in final form shall be restructured or
otherwise modified,  if necessary, to meet the requirements of those
regulations. (c) Effective Date: The amendment made by subsection (a)
shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 103.
UNIVERSAL SERVICE. (a) Findings: The Congress finds that-- (1) the
existing system of universal service has evolved  since 1930 through
an ongoing dialogue between industry,  various Federal-State Joint
Boards, the Commission, and the courts; (2) this system has been
predicated on rates established by the Commission and the States that
require implicit cost shifting by monopoly providers of telephone
exchange service through both local rates and access charges to
interexchange carriers; (3) the advent of competition for the
provision of telephone exchange service has led to industry requests
that the existing system be modified to make support for universal
service explicit and to require that all telecommunications carriers
participate in the modified system on a competitively neutral basis;
and (4) modification of the existing system is necessary to promote
competition in the provision of telecommunications services and to
allow competition and new technologies to  reduce the need for
universal service support mechanisms. (b) Federal-State Joint Board on
Universal Service:  (1) Within one month after the date of enactment
of this Act, the Commission shall institute and refer to a
Federal-State Joint Board under section 410(c) of the Communications
Act of 1934 a proceeding to recommend rules regarding the
implementation of section 253 of that Act, including the definition of
universal service. The Joint Board shall, after notice and public
comment, make its recommendations to the Commission no later than 9
months after the date of enactment  of this Act. (2) The Commission
may periodically, but no less than once every 4 years, institute and
refer to the Joint Board  a proceeding to review the implementation of
section 253 of that Act  and to make new recommendations, as
necessary, with  respect to any modifications or additions that may be
needed.  As part of any such proceeding the Joint Board shall review
the definition of, and adequacy of support for, universal service and
shall evaluate the extent to which universal service has been
protected and advanced. (c) Commission Action: The Commission shall
initiate a single proceeding to implement recommendations from the
initial Joint  Board required by subsection (a) and shall complete
such proceeding within 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.
Thereafter, the Commission shall complete any proceeding to implement
recommendations from any further Joint Board required under subsection
(b) within one year after receiving such recommendations. (d)
Separations Rules: Nothing in the amendments made by this Act to the
Communications Act of 1934 shall affect the Commission's separations
rules for local exchange carriers or interexchange carriers in effect
on the date of enactment of this Act. (e) Amendment of Communications
Act: Part II of title II (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.), as added by this
Act, is amended by inserting after section 252 the following new
section: `SEC. 253. UNIVERSAL SERVICE. `(a) Universal Service
Principles: The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for
the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following
principles: `(1) Quality services are to be provided at just,
reasonable, and affordable rates. `(2) Access to advanced
telecommunications and information services should be provided in all
regions of the Nation. `(3) Consumers in rural and high cost areas
should have  access to telecommunications and information services, 
including interexchange services, that are reasonably  comparable to
those services provided in urban areas. `(4) Consumers in rural and
high cost areas should have  access to telecommunications and
information services at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates
charged for similar services in urban areas. `(5) Consumers in rural
and high cost areas should have  access to the benefits of advanced
telecommunications and information services for health care,
education, economic development, and other public purposes. `(6) There
should be a coordinated Federal-State universal service system to
preserve and advance universal service using specific and predictable
Federal and State mechanisms administered by an independent,
non-governmental entity or entities. `(7) Elementary and secondary
schools and classrooms should have access to advanced
telecommunications services. `(b) Definition:  `(1) In general:
Universal service is an evolving level of intrastate and interstate
telecommunications services that the Commission, based on
recommendations from the public, Congress, and the Federal-State Joint
Board periodically convened under section 103 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, and taking into account advances in
telecommunications and information technologies and services,
determines-- `(A) should be provided at just, reasonable, and
affordable rates to all Americans, including those in rural and high
cost areas and those with disabilities; `(B) are essential in order
for Americans to participate effectively in the economic, academic,
medical, and democratic processes of the Nation; and `(C) are, through
the operation of market choices, subscribed to by a substantial
majority of residential customers. `(2) Different definition for
certain purposes: The  Commission may establish a different definition
of universal service for schools, libraries, and health care providers
for the purposes of section 264. `(c) All Telecommunications Carriers
Must Participate: Every telecommunications carrier engaged in
instrastate, interstate, or foreign communication shall participate,
on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in the specific and
predictable mechanisms established by the Commission and the States to
preserve and  advance universal service. Such participation shall be
in the  manner determined by the Commission and the States to be
reasonably necessary to preserve and advance universal service. Any
other provider of telecommunications may be required to participate in
 the preservation and advancement of universal service, if the  public
interest so requires. `(d) State Authority: A State may adopt
regulations to carry out its responsibilities under this section, or
to provide for additional definitions, mechanisms, and standards to
preserve and advance universal service within that State, to the
extent that  such regulations do not conflict with the Commission's
rules to implement this section. A State may only enforce additional
definitions or standards to the extent that it adopts additional
specific and predictable mechanisms to support such definitions or
standards. `(e) Eligibility for Universal Service Support: To the
extent necessary to provide for specific and predictable mechanisms to
achieve the purposes of this section, the Commission shall modify its
existing rules for the preservation and advancement of  universal
service. Only essential telecommunications carriers designated under
section 214(d) shall be eligible to receive  support for the provision
of universal service. Such support, if any, shall accurately reflect
what is necessary to preserve and advance universal service in
accordance with this section and the other requirements of this Act.
`(f) Universal Service Support: The Commission and the States shall
have as their goal the need to make any support for universal service
explicit, and to target that support to those essential
telecommunications carriers that serve areas for which such support is
necessary. The specific and predictable mechanisms adopted by  the
Commission and the States shall ensure that essential
telecommunications carriers are able to provide universal service  at
just, reasonable, and affordable rates. A carrier that receives
universal service support shall use that support only for the
provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services  for
which the support is intended. `(g) Interexchange Services: The rates
charged by any provider of interexchange telecommunications service to
customers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than those
charged by such provider to its customers in urban areas. `(h) Subsidy
of Competitive Services Prohibited: A telecommunications carrier may
not use services that are not competitive to subsidize competitive
services. The Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the
States, with respect to intrastate services, shall establish any
necessary cost allocation rules, accounting safeguards, and guidelines
to ensure that  services included in the definition of universal
service bear no more than a reasonable share of the joint and common
costs of facilities used to provide those services. `(i) Congressional
Notification Required:  `(1) In general: The Commission may not take
action to  require participation by telecommunications carriers or
other providers of telecommunications under subsection (c), or to
modify its rules to increase support for the preservation and
advancement of universal service, until-- `(A) the Commission submits
to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
Senate and the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives a
report on the participation required, or the increase in support 
proposed, as appropriate; and `(B) a period of 120 days has elapsed
since the date the report required under paragraph (1) was submitted.
`(2) Not applicable to reductions: This subsection shall not apply to
any action taken to reduce costs to carriers or consumers. `(j) Effect
on Commission's Authority: Nothing in this section shall be construed
to expand or limit the authority of the Commission to preserve and
advance universal service under this Act. `(k) Effective Date: This
section takes effect on the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, except for subsections (c), (d), (e),
(f), and (i) which take effect one year after the date of enactment of
that Act.'. (f) Prohibition on Exclusion of Areas from Service Based
on Rural Location, High Costs, or Income: Part II of title II (47
U.S.C. 201 et seq.) as amended by this Act, is amended by adding after
section 253 the following: `SEC. 253A PROHIBITION ON EXCLUSION OF
AREAS FROM SERVICE BASED ON RURAL LOCATION, HIGH COSTS, OR INCOME.
`(a) The Commission shall prohibit any telecommunications carrier from
excluding from any of such carrier's services any high-cost area, or
any area on the basis of the rural location or the income of the
residents of such area: Provided, That a carrier may exclude an area
in which the carrier can demonstrate that-- `(1) there will be
insufficient consumer demand for the carrier to earn some return over
the long term on the capital invested to provide such service to such
area, and-- `(2) providing a service to such area will be less
profitable for the carrier than providing the service in areas to
which  the carrier is already providing or has proposed to provide the
service. `(b) The Commission shall provide for public comment on the
adequacy of the carrier's proposed service area on the basis of the
requirements of this section.'. SEC. 104.  ESSENTIAL
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. (a) In General: Section 214(d) (47 U.S.C.
214(d)) is amended-- (1) by inserting `(1) Adequate facilities
required: ' before `The Commission'; and (2) by adding at the end
thereof the following: `(2) Designation of essential carrier:  If one
or more common carriers provide telecommunications service to a
geographic area, and no common carrier will provide universal service
to an unserved community or any portion thereof that requests such
service within such area, then the Commission, with respect to
interstate  services, or a State, with respect to intrastate services,
shall determine which common carrier serving that area is best able to
provide universal service to the requesting unserved community or
portion thereof, and shall designate that common carrier as an
essential telecommunications carrier for that unserved community or
portion thereof. `(3) Essential carrier obligations: A common carrier
may be designated by the Commission, or by a State, as appropriate, as
an essential telecommunications carrier for a specific service area 
and become eligible to receive universal service support under section
253.  A carrier designated as an essential telecommunications carrier
shall-- `(A) provide through its own facilities or through a
combination of its own facilities and resale of services using another
carrier's facilities, universal service and any additional service
(such as 911 service) required by the Commission or the State, to any
community or portion thereof which requests such service; `(B) offer
such services at nondiscriminatory rates established by the
Commission, for interstate services, and the State, for intrastate
services, throughout the service area; and `(C) advertise throughout
the service area the availability  of such services and the rates for
such services using media of general distribution. `(4) Multiple
essential carriers: If the Commission, with respect to interstate
services, or a State, with respect to intrastate services, designates
more than one common carrier as an essential telecommunications
carrier for a specific service area, such  carrier shall meet the
service, rate, and advertising requirements imposed by the Commission
or State on any other essential telecommunications carrier for that
service area. A State shall require that, before designating an
additional essential telecommunications carrier, the State agency
authorized to make the designation shall find that-- `(A) the
designation of an additional essential telecommunications carrier is
in the public interest and that there will not be a significant
adverse impact on users of telecommunications services or on the
provision of universal service; `(B) the designation encourages the
development and  deployment of advanced telecommunications
infrastructure and services in rural areas; and `(C) the designation
protects the public safety and welfare, ensures the continued quality
of telecommunications services,  or safeguards the rights of
consumers. `(5) Resale of universal service: The Commission, for
interstate services, and the States, for intrastate services, shall
establish rules to govern the resale of universal service to allocate
any support received for the provision of such service in a manner
that ensures that the carrier whose facilities are being resold is
adequately compensated for their use, taking into account the  impact
of the resale on that carrier's ability to maintain and deploy its
network as a whole.  The Commission shall also  establish, based on
the recommendations of the Federal-State Joint Board instituted to
implement this section, rules to permit a carrier designated as an
essential telecommunications carrier to relinquish that designation
for a specific service area if another telecommunications carrier is
also designated as an essential telecommunications carrier for that
area.  The rules-- `(A) shall ensure that all customers served by the
relinquishing carrier continue to be served, and shall require
sufficient notice to permit the purchase or construction of adequate
facilities by any remaining essential telecommunications carrier if
such remaining carrier provided universal service through resale of
the facilities of the relinquishing carrier; and `(B) shall establish
criteria for determining when a carrier which intends to utilize
resale to meet the requirements for designation under this subsection
has adequate resources to purchase, construct, or otherwise obtain the
facilities necessary to meet its obligation if the reselling carrier
is no longer able or obligated to resell the service. `(6)
Enforcement: A common carrier designated by the Commission  or a State
as an essential telecommunications carrier that refuses to provide
universal service within a reasonable period to an unserved community
or portion thereof which requests such service shall forfeit to the
United States, in the case of interstate services, or the State, in
the case of intrastate services, a sum  of up to $10,000 for each day
that such carrier refuses to provide such service. In determining a
reasonable period the Commission or the State, as appropriate, shall
consider the nature of any construction required to serve such
requesting unserved community  or portion thereof, as well as the
construction intervals normally attending such construction, and shall
allow adequate time for regulatory approvals and acquisition of
necessary financing. `(7) Interexchange services: The Commission, for
interstate services, or a State, for intrastate services, shall
designate an essential telecommunications carrier for interexchange
services for any unserved community or portion thereof requesting such
s ervices.  Any common carrier designated as an essential
telecommunications carrier for interexchange services under this
paragraph shall provide interexchange services included in  universal
service to any unserved community or portion thereof  which requests
such service.  The service shall be provided at nationwide
geographically averaged rates for interstate interexchange services
and at geographically averaged rates for intrastate interexchange
services, and shall be just and reasonable and not unjustly or
unreasonably discriminatory.  A common carrier designated as an
essential telecommunications carrier for interexchange services under
this paragraph that refuses to provide interexchange service in
accordance with this paragraph to an unserved community or portion
thereof that requests such service within 180 days of such request
shall forfeit to the United States 

a sum of up to $50,000 for each day that such carrier refuses to
provide such service.  The Commission or the State, as appropriate,
may extend the 180-day period for providing interexchange service upon
a showing by the common carrier of good faith efforts to  comply
within such period. `(8) Implementation: The Commission may, by
regulation, establish guidelines by which States may implement the
provisions of this section.'. (b) Conforming Amendment: The heading
for section 214 is amended by inserting a semicolon and `essential
telecommunications  carriers' after `lines'. (c) Transition Rule: A
rural telephone company is eligible to receive universal service
support payments under section 253(e) of the Communications Act of
1934 as if such company were an essential telecommunications carrier 
until such time as the Commission, with respect to interstate
services, or a State, with respect to intrastate services, designates
an essential telecommunications carrier or carriers for the area
served by such company under section 214 of that Act. SEC. 105.
FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND OWNERSHIP REFORM. (a) In General: Section 310
(47 U.S.C. 310) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following
new subsection: `(f) Termination of Foreign Ownership Restrictions: 
`(1) Restriction not to apply where reciprocity found: Subsection (b)
shall not apply to any common carrier license held, or for which
application is made, after the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995 with respect to any alien (or
representative thereof), corporation, or foreign government (or
representative thereof) if the Commission determines that the foreign
country of which such alien is a citizen, in which such corporation is
organized, or in which such foreign government is in control provides
equivalent  market opportunities for common carriers to citizens of
the United States (or their representatives), corporations  organized
in the United States, and the United States   Government (or its
representative): Provided, That the  President does not object within
15 days of such determination. If the President objects to a
determination, the President shall, immediately upon such objection,
submit to Congress a written report (in unclassified form, but with a
classified annex if necessary) that sets forth a detailed explanation
of the findings made and factors considered in objecting to the
determination. The determination of whether market  opportunities are
equivalent shall be made on a market segment specific basis within 180
days after the application is filed. While determining whether such
opportunities are equivalent on that basis, the Commission shall also
conduct an evaluation of opportunities for access to all segments of
the telecommunications market of the applicant. `(2) Snapback for
reciprocity failure: If the Commission determines that any foreign
country with respect to which it  has made a determination under
paragraph (1) ceases to meet the requirements for that determination,
then-- `(A) subsection (b) shall apply with respect to such aliens,
corporations, and government (or their representatives) on the date on
which the Commission publishes notice of its determination under this
paragraph, and `(B) any license held, or application filed, which
could not be held or granted under subsection (b) shall be withdrawn,
or denied, as the case may be, by the Commission under the provisions
of subsection (b).'. (b) Conforming Amendment: Section 332(c)(6) (47
U.S.C. 332(c)(6)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the
following: `This paragraph does not apply to any foreign ownership 
interest or transfer of ownership to which section 310(b) does not
apply because of section 310(f).'. (c) The Application of the
Exon-Florio Law: Nothing in this section (47 U.S.C. 310) shall limit
in any way the application of the Exon-Florio law (50 U.S.C. App.
2170) to any transaction. SEC. 106. INFRASTRUCTURE SHARING. (a)
Regulations Required: The Commission shall prescribe, within one year
after the date of enactment of this Act, regulations that require
local exchange carriers that were subject to Part 69 of the
Commission's rules on or before that date to make available to any
qualifying carrier such public switched network infrastructure,
technology, information, and telecommunications facilities and
functions as may be requested by such qualifying carrier for the
purpose of enabling such qualifying carrier to provide
telecommunications services, or to provide access to information
services, in the service area in which such qualifying carrier has
requested and obtained designation as an essential telecommunications
carrier under section 214(d) and provides universal service by means
of its own facilities. (b) Terms and Conditions of Regulations: The
regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to this section
shall-- (1) not require a local exchange carrier to which this 
section applies to take any action that is economically unreasonable
or that is contrary to the public interest; (2) permit, but shall not
require, the joint ownership or operation of public switched network
infrastructure and  services by or among such local exchange carrier
and a qualifying carrier; (3) ensure that such local exchange carrier
will not be treated by the Commission or any State as a common carrier
for hire or as offering common carrier services with respect to any
infrastructure, technology, information, facilities, or functions made
available to a qualifying carrier in accordance with regulations
issued pursuant to this section; (4) ensure that such local exchange
carrier makes such infrastructure, technology, information,
facilities, or functions available to a qualifying carrier on just and
reasonable terms and conditions that permit such qualifying carrier to
fully benefit from the economies of scale and scope of such local
exchange carrier, as determined in accordance  with guidelines
prescribed by the Commission in regulations issued pursuant to this
section; (5) establish conditions that promote cooperation between
local exchange carriers to which this section applies and qualifying
carriers; (6) not require a local exchange carrier to which this 
section applies to engage in any infrastructure sharing agreement for
any services or access which are to be provided  or offered to
consumers by the qualifying carrier in such local exchange carrier's
telephone exchange area; and (7) require that such local exchange
carrier file with the Commission or State for public inspection, any
tariffs, contracts, or other arrangements showing the rates, terms,
and conditions under which such carrier is making available public
switched network infrastructure and functions under this section. (c)
Information Concerning Deployment of New Services and Equipment: A
local exchange carrier to which this section applies that has entered
into an infrastructure sharing agreement under  this section shall
provide to each party to such agreement timely information on the
planned deployment of telecommunications  services and equipment,
including any software or upgrades of software integral to the use or
operation of such  telecommunications equipment. (d) Definitions: For
purposes of this section-- (1) Qualifying carrier: The term
`qualifying carrier' means a telecommunications carrier that-- (A)
lacks economies of scale or scope, as determined in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to this section; and
(B) is a common carrier which offers telephone exchange service,
exchange access service, and any other service  that is included in
universal service, to all consumers without preference throughout the
service area for which such carrier has been designated as an
essential telecommunications carrier under section 214(d) of the
Communications Act of 1934. (2) Other terms: Any term used in this
section that is  defined in the Communications Act of 1934 has the
same meaning as it has in that Act. SEC. 107. COORDINATION FOR
TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK-LEVEL INTEROPERABILITY. (a) In General: To
promote nondiscriminatory access to telecommunications networks by the
broadest number of users and vendors of communications products and
services through-- (1) coordinated telecommunications network planning
and  design by common carriers and other providers of
telecommunications services, and (2) interconnection of
telecommunications networks, and of devices with such networks, to
ensure the ability of users and information providers to seamlessly
and transparently transmit and receive information between and across
telecommunications networks, the Commission may participate, in a
manner consistent with its authority and practice prior to the date of
enactment of this Act, in the development by appropriate voluntary
industry standards-setting organizations to promote telecommunications
network-level interoperability. (b) Definition of telecommunications
network-level interoperability: As used in this section, the term
`telecommunications network-level interoperability' means the ability
of 2 or more telecommunications networks to communicate and interact
in concert with each other to exchange information without
degeneration. (c) Commission's Authority Not Limited: Nothing in this
section shall be construed as limiting the existing authority of the
Commission. TITLE II--REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS TO COMPETITION SUBTITLE
A--REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS SEC. 201. REMOVAL OF ENTRY BARRIERS. (a)
Preemption of State Rules: Part II of title II (47 U.S.C. 251 et
seq.), as added by this Act, is amended by inserting after section 253
the following: `SEC. 254. REMOVAL OF BARRIERS TO ENTRY. `(a) In
General: No State or local statute or regulation, or  other State or
local legal requirement, may prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or
intrastate telecommunications services. `(b) State Regulatory
Authority: Nothing in this section shall affect the ability of a State
to impose, on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with
section 253, requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal
service, protect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued
quality of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of
consumers. `(c) State and Local Government Authority: Nothing in this 
section affects the authority of a State or local government to manage
the public rights-of-way  or to require fair and reasonable
compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public  rights-of-way
on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation required is publicly
disclosed by such government. `(d) Preemption: If, after notice and an
opportunity for public comment, the Commission determines that a State
or local government has permitted or imposed any statute, regulation,
or legal requirement that violates subsection (a) or (b), the
Commission shall preempt the enforcement of such statute, regulation,
or legal requirement to the extent necessary to correct such violation
or inconsistency. `(e) Commercial mobile services providers: Nothing
in this  section shall affect the application of section 332(c)(3) to
commercial mobile services providers.'. (b) Provision of
Telecommunications Services by a Cable Operator:  (1) Jurisdiction of
franchising authority: Section 621(b) (47 U.S.C. 541(b)) is amended by
adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph: `(3)(A) To the
extent that a cable operator or affiliate thereof is engaged in the
provision of telecommunications services-- `(i) such cable operator or
affiliate shall not be required to obtain a franchise under this title
for the provision of telecommunications services; and `(ii) the
provisions of this title shall not apply to  such cable operator or
affiliate for the provision of telecommunications services. `(B) A
franchising authority may not order a cable operator  or affiliate
thereof to discontinue the provision of a telecommunications service.
`(C) A franchising authority may not require a cable operator to

the initial grant of a franchise, franchise renewal, or transfer of a
franchise. `(D) Nothing in this paragraph affects existing Federal or
State authority with respect to telecommunications services.'. (2)
Franchise fees: Section 622(b) (47 U.S.C. 542(b)) is amended by
inserting `to provide cable services' immediately before the period at
the end of the first sentence. (c) State and Local Tax Laws: Except as
provided in section 202, nothing in this Act (or in the Communications
Act of 1934 as  amended by this Act) shall be construed to modify,
impair, or supersede, or authorize the modification, impairment, or
supersession of, any State or local law pertaining to taxation that is
consistent with the requirements of the Constitution of the United
States, this Act, the Communications Act of 1934, or any other
applicable Federal law. (d) Effective Date: The amendments made by

202. ELIMINATION OF CABLE AND TELEPHONE COMPANY  CROSS-OWNERSHIP
RESTRICTION. (a) In General: Section 613(b) (47 U.S.C. 533(b)) is
amended to read as follows: `(b) Video Programming and Cable Services:
 `(1) Distinction between video platform and cable service: To the
extent that any telecommunications carrier carries video programming
provided by others, or provides video programming that it owns,
controls, or selects directly to subscribers, through a common carrier
video platform, neither the telecommunications carrier nor any video
programming provider making use of such platform shall be deemed to be
a cable operator providing cable service. To the extent that any
telecommunications carrier provides video programming directly to
subscribers through a cable system, the carrier shall be deemed to be
a cable operator providing cable service. `(2) Bell operating company
activities:  `(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 252, to 
the extent that a Bell operating company carries video programming
provided by others or provides video  programming that it owns,
controls, or selects over a  common carrier video platform, it need
not use a separate affiliate if-- `(i) the carrier provides
facilities, services, or information to all programmers on the same
terms and conditions as it provides such facilities, services, or
information to its own video programming operations, and `(ii) the
carrier does not use its telecommunications services to subsidize its
provision of video programming. `(B) To the extent that a Bell
operating company provides cable service as a cable operator, it shall
provide such service through an affiliate that meets the requirements
of section 252 (a), (b), and (d) and the Bell operating company's
telephone exchange services and exchange access services shall meet
the requirements of subparagraph  (A)(ii) and section 252(c); except
that, to the extent the Bell operating company provides cable service
utilizing its own telephone exchange facilities, section 252(c) shall
not require the Bell operating company to make video  programming
services capacity available on a non-discriminatory basis to other
video programming  services providers. `(C) Upon a finding by the
Commission that the  requirement of a separate affiliate under the
preceding subparagraph is no longer necessary to protect consumers,
competition, or the public interest, the Commission shall exempt a
Bell operating company from that requirement. `(3) Common carrier
video platform: Nothing in this Act precludes a telecommunications
carrier from carrying video programming provided by others directly to
subscribers over a common carrier video platform. Nothing in this Act
precludes a video programming provider making use of a common carrier
video platform from being treated as an operator of a cable system 
for purposes of section 111 of title 17, United States Code. `(4)
Rates; access: Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(A)(i), a provider of
common carrier video platform services shall  provide local broadcast
stations, and to those public, educational, and governmental entities
required by local franchise authorities to be given access to cable
systems operating in the same market as the common carrier video
platform, with access to that platform for the transmission of
television broadcast programming at rates no higher than the
incremental-cost-based rates of providing such access.  Local
broadcast stations shall be entitled to obtain access on the first
tier of programming on the common carrier video platform. If the area
covered by the common carrier video platform includes more than one
franchising area, then the Commission shall determine the number of
channels allocated to public, educational, and governmental entities
that may be eligible for such rates for that platform. `(5)
Competitive neutrality: A provider of video programming may be
required to pay fees in lieu of franchise fees (as defined in section
622(g)(1)) if the fees-- `(A) are competitively neutral; and `(B) are
separately identified in consumer billing. `(6) Acquisitions; joint
ventures; partnerships; joint use of facilities: `(A) Local exchange
carriers: No local exchange carrier  or any affiliate of such carrier
owned by, operated by, controlled by, or under common control with
such carrier  may purchase or otherwise acquire more than a 10 percent
financial interest, or any management interest, in any  cable operator
providing cable service within the local exchange carrier's telephone
service area. `(B) Cable operators: No cable operator or affiliate of
a cable operator that is owned by, operated by, controlled  by, or
under common ownership with such cable operator may purchase or
otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, more than a 10 percent
financial interest, or any management interest, in any local exchange
carrier providing telephone exchange service within such cable
operator's franchise area. `(C) Joint Venture: A local exchange
carrier and a cable operator whose telephone service area and cable
franchise area, respectively, are in the same market may not enter
into any joint venture or partnership to provide video programming
directly to subscribers or to provide telecommunications services
within such market. `(D) Exception: Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A),
(B), and (C) of this paragraph, a local exchange carrier (with respect
to a cable system located in its telephone service area) and a cable
operator (with respect to the facilities of a local exchange carrier
used to provide telephone exchange service in its cable franchise
area) may obtain a controlling interest in, management interest in, or
enter into a joint venture or partnership with such system or
facilities to the extent that such system or facilities  only serve
incorporated or unincorporated-- `(i) places or territories that have
fewer than  50,000 inhabitants; and `(ii) are outside an urbanized
area, as defined by  the Bureau of the Census. `(E) Waiver: The
Commission may waive the restrictions of subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)
only if the Commission determines that, because of the nature of the
market served by the affected cable system or facilities used to
provide telephone exchange service-- `(i) the incumbent cable operator
or local exchange carrier would be subjected to undue economic
distress  by the enforcement of such provisions, `(ii) the system or
facilities would not be economically viable if such provisions were
enforced, or `(iii) the anticompetitive effects of the proposed
transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the
probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and
needs of the community to  be served. `(F) Joint use: Notwithstanding
subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a telecommunications carrier may
obtain within  such carrier's telephone service area, with the
concurrence of the cable operator on the rates, terms, and conditions,
the use of that portion of the transmission facilities of such a cable
system extending from the last multiuser terminal to the premises of
the end user in excess of the capacity that the cable operator uses to
provide its own cable services. A cable operator that provides access
to such portion of its transmission facilities to one
telecommunications carrier shall provide nondiscriminatory access to
such portion of its transmission facilities to  any other
telecommunications carrier requesting such access. `(G) Savings
clause: Nothing in this paragraph affects-- `(i) the authority of a
local franchising authority (in the case of the purchase or
acquisition of a cable operator, or a joint venture to provide cable
service) or a State Commission (in the case of the acquisition  of a
local exchange carrier, or a joint venture to provide telephone
exchange service) to approve or disapprove a purchase, acquisition, or
joint venture, or `(ii) the antitrust laws, as described in section 
7(a) of the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of
1995.'. (b) No Permit Required for Video Programming Services: Section
 214 (47 U.S.C. 214) is amended by adding at the end thereof the
following: `(e) Special Rule: No certificate is required under this
section for a carrier to construct facilities to provide video
programming services.'. (c) Safeguards: Within one year after the date
of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall prescribe regulations
that-- (1) require a telecommunications carrier that provides video
programming directly to subscribers to ensure that subscribers are
offered the means to obtain access to the signals of local broadcast
television stations identified under section 614 as readily as they
are today; (2) require such a carrier to display clearly and
prominently at the beginning of any program guide or menu of program
offerings the identity of any signal of any television  broadcast
station that is carried by the carrier; (3) require such a carrier to
ensure that viewers are able to access the signal of any television
broadcast station that is carried by that carrier without first having
to view  advertising or promotional material, or a navigational
device, guide, or menu that omits broadcasting services as an
available option; (4) except as required by paragraphs (1) through
(3),  prohibit such carrier and a multichannel video programming
distributor using the facilities of such carrier from discriminating
among video programming providers with respect  to material or
information provided by the carrier to subscribers for the purposes of
selecting programming, or in  the way such material or information is
presented to subscribers; (5) require such carrier and a multichannel
video programming distributor using the facilities of such carrier to
ensure that video programming providers or copyright holders (or both)
are able suitably and uniquely to identify their programming services
to subscribers; (6) if such identification is transmitted as part of
the programming signal, require a telecommunications carrier that
provides video programming directly to subscribers and a multichannel
video programming distributor using the facilities of such carrier to
transmit such identification without change or alteration; (7)
prohibit such carrier from discriminating among video programming
providers with regard to carriage and ensure that the rates, terms,
and conditions for such carriage are just, reasonable, and
nondiscriminatory; (8) extend to such carriers and multichannel video 
programming distributors using the facilities of such carrier the
Commission's regulations concerning network nonduplication (47 C.F.R.
76.92 et seq.) and syndicated exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.171 et seq.);
and (9) extend to such carriers and multichannel video  programming
distributors using the facilities of such carrier the protections
afforded to local broadcast signals in section 614(b)(3),
614(b)(4)(A), and 615(g)(1) and (2) of such Act (47 U.S.C. 534(b)(3),
534(b)(4)(A), and 535(g)(1) and (2)). (d) Enforcement: The Commission
shall resolve disputes under subsection (c) and the regulations
prescribed under that  subsection.  Any such dispute shall be resolved
with 180 days after notice of the dispute is submitted to the
Commission.  At that  time, or subsequently in a separate proceeding,
the Commission may award damages sustained in consequence of any
violation of this section to any person denied carriage, or require
carriage, or  both.  Any aggrieved party may also seek any other
remedy available under the law. (e) Effective Dates: The amendment
made by subsection (a) takes effect on the date of enactment of this
Act. The amendment made by subsection (b) takes effect 1 year after
that date. SEC. 203. CABLE ACT REFORM. (a) Change in Definition of
Cable System: Section 602(7) (47 U.S.C. 522(7)) is amended by striking
out `(B) a facility that serves only subscribers in 1 or more multiple
unit dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, unless
such facility or facilities uses any public right-of-way;' and
inserting `(B) a facility that serves subscribers without using any
public right-of-way;'. (b) Rate Deregulation:  




(1) Section 623(c) (47 U.S.C. 543(c)) is amended-- (A) by striking
`subscriber,' and the comma after `authority' in paragraph (1)(B); (B)
by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following: `(2) Standard
for unreasonable rates: The Commission may only consider a rate for
cable programming services to be unreasonable if it substantially
exceeds the national average rate for comparable cable programming
services provided by  cable systems other than small cable systems,
determined on a per-channel basis as of June 1, 1995, and
redetermined, and adjusted if necessary, every 2 years thereafter.'.
(2) Section 623(l)(1) (47 U.S.C. 543(l)(1)) is amended-- (A) by
striking `or' at the end of subparagraph (B); (B) by striking the
period at the end of subparagraph (C) and inserting a semicolon and
`or'; and (C) by adding at the end the following: `(D) a local
exchange carrier offers video programming services directly to
subscribers, either over a common carrier video platform or as a cable
operator, in the franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator
which is providing cable service in that franchise area, but only if
the video programming services offered by the carrier in that area are
comparable to the video programming services provided by the
unaffiliated cable operator in that area.'. (c) Greater Deregulation
for Smaller Cable Companies: Section 623 (47 U.S.C. 543) is amended by
adding at the end thereof the following: `(m) Special Rules for Small
Companies:  `(1) In general: Subsection (a), (b), or (c) does not
apply  to a small cable operator with respect to-- `(A) cable
programming services, or `(B) a basic service tier that was the only
service tier subject to regulation as of December 31, 1994, in any
franchise area in which that operator serves 35,000 or fewer
subscribers. `(2) Definition of small cable operator: For purposes of
this subsection, the term `small cable operator' means a cable
operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the
aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States
and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual
revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.'. (d) Program Access:
Section 628 (47 U.S.C. 628) is amended by adding at the end the
following: `(j) Common Carriers: Any provision that applies to a cable
operator under this section shall apply to a telecommunications
carrier or its affiliate that provides video programming by any means
directly to subscribers.  Any such provision that applies to 

a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an
attributable interest shall apply to any satellite cable programming
vendor in which such common carrier has an attributable interest.'.
(e) Expedited Decision-Making for Market Determinations Under Section

POLE ATTACHMENTS. Section 224  (47 U.S.C. 224) is amended-- (1) by
inserting the following after subsection (a)(4): `(5) The term
`telecommunications carrier' shall have the meaning given such term in
subsection 3(nn) of this Act, except that, for purposes of this
section, the term shall not include any person classified by the
Commission as a dominant provider of telecommunications services as of
January 1, 1995.'; (2) by inserting after `conditions' in subsection
(c)(1) a comma and the following: `or access to poles, ducts,
conduits, and rights-of-way as provided in subsection (f),'; (3) by
inserting after subsection (d)(2) the following: `(3) This subsection
shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable
television system solely to provide cable service. Until the effective
date of the regulations required under subsection (e), this subsection
shall also apply to the pole attachment rates for cable television
systems (or for any telecommunications carrier that was not a party to
any pole attachment agreement prior to the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995) to provide any telecommunications
service or any other service subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission.'; and (4) by adding at the end thereof the following:
`(e)(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after the date of
enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, prescribe regulations
in accordance with this subsection to govern the charges for pole
attachments by telecommunications carriers. Such regulations shall
ensure that utilities charge just and reasonable and
non-discriminatory rates for pole attachments. `(2) A utility shall
apportion the cost of providing space on a pole, duct, conduit, or
right-of-way other than the usable space among entities so that such
apportionment equals the sum of-- `(A) two-thirds of the costs of
providing space other  than the usable space that would be allocated
to such  entity under an equal apportionment of such costs among all
attachments, plus `(B) the percentage of usable space required by each
such entity multiplied by the costs of space other than the usable
space; but in no event shall such proportion exceed the amount that
would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such
costs among all attachments. `(3) A utility shall apportion the cost
of providing usable space among all entities according to the
percentage of usable space required for each entity. Costs shall be
apportioned between the usable space and the space on a pole, duct, 
conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space on a
proportionate basis. `(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1)
shall  become effective 5 years after the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995. Any increase in the rates for pole
attachments that result from the adoption of the regulations required
by this subsection shall be phased in  equal annual increments over a
period of 5 years beginning on the effective date of such regulations.
`(f)(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any
telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole,
duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it. `(2)
Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric service
may deny a cable television system or telecommunications carrier
access to its poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way, on 

a non-discriminatory basis where there is insufficient capacity and
for reasons of safety, reliability, and generally applicable
engineering purposes. `(g) A utility that engages in the provision of 
telecommunications services shall impute to its costs of providing
such services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate
company engaged in the provision of such services) an amount equal to
the pole attachment rate for which such company would be liable under
this section.'. SEC. 205. ENTRY BY UTILITY COMPANIES. (a) In General: 
(1) Authorized activities of utilities: Notwithstanding any other
provision of law to the contrary (including the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79a et seq.)),  an electric, gas,
water, or steam utility, and any subsidiary company, affiliate, or
associate company of such a utility, other than a public utility
company that is an associate  company of a registered holding company,
may engage, directly  or indirectly, in any activity whatsoever,
wherever located, necessary or appropriate to the provision of-- (A)
telecommunications services, (B) information services, (C) other
services or products subject to the  jurisdiction of the Federal
Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934 (47
U.S.C. 151 et seq.), or (D) products or services that are related or
incidental  to a product or service described in subparagraph (A),
(B), or (C). (2) Removal of sec jurisdiction: The Securities and
Exchange Commission has no jurisdiction under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79a et seq.) over a holding
company, or a subsidiary company, affiliate, or associate company of a
holding company, to grant any authorization to enforce any requirement
with respect to, or approve or  otherwise review, any activity
described in paragraph (1), including financing, investing in,
acquiring, or maintaining  any interest in, or entering into affiliate
transactions or contracts, and any authority over audits or access to
books and records. (3) Applicability of Telecommunications Regulation:
Nothing  in this section shall affect the authority of the Federal
Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, or the
authority of State commissions under State laws concerning the
provision of telecommunications services, to regulate the activities
of an associate company engaged in activities described in paragraph
(1). (4) Commission rules: The Commission shall consider and  adopt,
as necessary, rules to protect the customers of a public utility
company that is a subsidiary company of a registered holding company
against potential detriment from the telecommunications activities of
any other subsidiary of such registered holding company. (b)
Prohibition of Cross-Subsidization: Nothing in the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 shall preclude the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission or a State commission from exercising its
jurisdiction under otherwise applicable law to determine  whether a
public utility company may recover in rates the costs of any activity
described in subsection (a)(1) which is performed by  an associate
company regardless of whether such costs are incurred through the
direct or indirect purchase of goods and services from such associate
company. (c) Assumption of Liabilities: Any public utility company
that is an associate company of a registered holding company and that
is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to
its retail electric or gas rates shall not issue any security for the
purpose of financing the acquisition, ownership, or operation  of an
associate company engaged in activities described in subsection (a)(1)

utility company that is an associate company of a registered holding
company and that is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission
with respect to its retail electric or gas rates shall not assume any
obligation or liability as guarantor, endorser, surety, or otherwise
by the public utility in respect of any security of an associate
company engaged in activities described in subsection (a)(1) without
the prior  approval of the State commission. (d) Pledging or
Mortgaging Utility Assets: Any public utility company that is an
associate company of a registered holding  company and that is subject
to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail
electric or gas rates shall not pledge, mortgage, or otherwise use as
collateral any utility assets of the public utility or utility assets
of any subsidiary company thereof for the benefit of an associate
company engaged in activities described in subsection (a)(1) without
the prior  approval of the State commission. (e) Books and Records: An
associate company engaged in activities described in subsection (a)(1)
which is an associate company of a registered holding company shall
maintain books, records, and accounts separate from the registered
holding company which  identify all transactions with the registered
holding company and its other associate companies, and provide access
to books,  records, and accounts to State commissions and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission under the same terms of access,
disclosure, and procedures as provided in section 201(g) of the
Federal Power Act. (f) Independent Audit Authority for State
Commissions:  (1) State may order audit: Any State commission with
jurisdiction over a public utility company that-- (A) is an associate
company of a registered holding company, and (B) transacts business,
directly or indirectly, with a subsidiary company, affiliate, or
associate company of that holding company engaged in any activity
described in subsection (a)(1), may order an independent audit to be
performed, no more frequently than on an annual basis, of all matters
deemed relevant by the selected auditor that reasonably relate to
retail rates: Provided, That such matters relate, directly or
indirectly, to transactions or transfers between the public utility
company subject to its jurisdiction and the subsidiary company,
affiliate, or associate company engaged in that activity. (2)
Selection of firm to conduct audit:  (A) If a State commission orders
an audit in accordance with paragraph (1), the public utility company
and the  State commission shall jointly select within 60 days a firm
to perform the audit. The firm selected to perform the  audit shall
possess demonstrated qualifications relating to: (i) competency,
including adequate technical training and professional proficiency in
each discipline necessary to carry out the audit, and (ii)

certain that the audit is based upon an impartial consideration of all
pertinent facts and responsible opinions. (B) The public utility
company and the company engaged in activities under subsection (a)(1)
shall cooperate fully with all reasonable requests necessary to
perform the audit and the public utility company shall bear all costs
of having the audit performed. (3) Availability of auditor's report:
The auditor's report shall be provided to the State commission within
6 months after the selection of the auditor, and provided to the
public  utility company 60 days thereafter. (g) Required Notices:  (1)

associate companies: Within 10 days after the acquisition by a
registered holding company  of an interest in an associate company
that will engage in activities described in subsection (a)(1), any
public utility company that is an associate company of such company
shall notify each State commission having jurisdiction over the 
retail rates of such public utility company of such  acquisition. In
the notice an officer on behalf of the public utility company shall
attest that, based on then current information, such acquisition and
related financing will not materially impair the ability of such
public utility company to meet its public service responsibility,
including its ability  to raise necessary capital. (h) Definitions:
Any term used in this section that is defined in the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79a et seq.) has the same
meaning as it has in that Act. The terms `telecommunications service'
and `information service' shall have the same meanings as those terms
have in the Communications Act of 1934. (i) Implementation: Not later
than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal
Communications Commission shall promulgate such regulations as may be
necessary to implement this section. (j) Effective Date: This section
takes effect on the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 206. BROADCAST
REFORM. (a) Spectrum Reform:  (1) Advanced television spectrum
services: If the Commission by rule permits licensees to provide
advanced television services, then-- (A) it shall adopt regulations
that allow such licensees to make use of the advanced television
spectrum for the transmission of ancillary or supplementary services
if the licensees provide without charge to the public at least one
advanced television program service as prescribed by the Commission
that is intended for and available to the  general public on the
advanced television spectrum; and (B) it shall apply similar rules to
use of existing television spectrum. (2) Commission to collect fees:
To the extent that a television broadcast licensee provides ancillary
or supplementary services using existing or advanced television
spectrum-- (A) for which payment of a subscription fee is required  in
order to receive such services, or (B) for which the licensee directly
or indirectly  receives compensation from a third party in return for
transmitting material furnished by such third party, other than
payments to broadcast stations by third parties for transmission of
program material or commercial advertising, the Commission may collect
from each such licensee an annual  fee to the extent the existing or
advanced television spectrum is used for such ancillary or
supplementary services. In determining the amount of such fees, the
Commission shall take into account the portion of the licensee's total
existing or advanced television spectrum which is used for such
services  and the amount of time such services are provided. The
amount  of such fees to be collected for any such service shall not,
in any event, exceed an amount equivalent on an annualized basis  to
the amount paid by providers of a competing service on spectrum
subject to auction under section 309(j) of the Communications Act of
1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)). (3) Public interest requirement: Nothing in
this section  shall be construed as relieving a television
broadcasting station from its obligation to serve the public interest,
convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's review of any
application for renewal of a broadcast license for a television
station that provides ancillary or supplementary services, the
television licensee shall establish that all of its program services
on the existing or advanced television spectrum are in the public
interest. Any violation of the Commission rules applicable to
ancillary or supplementary services shall reflect upon the licensee's
qualifications for renewal of its license. (4) Definitions: As used in
this subsection-- (A) The term `advanced television services' means
television services provided using digital or other  advanced
technology to enhance audio quality and video resolution. (B) The term
`existing' means spectrum generally in use for television broadcast
purposes on the date of enactment of this Act. (b) Ownership Reform: 
(1) In general: The Commission shall modify its rules for multiple
ownership set forth in 47 CFR 73.3555 by-- (A) eliminating the
restrictions on the number of television stations owned under
subdivisions (e)(1) (ii)  and (iii); and (B) changing the percentage
set forth in subdivision (e)(2)(ii) from 25 percent to 35 percent. (2)
Radio Ownership: The Commission shall modify its rules  set forth in
47 CFR 73.3555 by eliminating any provisions limiting the number of AM
or FM broadcast stations which may be owned or controlled by one
entity either nationally or in a particular market. The Commission may
refuse to approve the transfer or issuance of an AM or FM broadcast
license to a particular entity if it finds that the entity would
thereby obtain an undue concentration of control or would thereby harm
competition. Nothing in this section shall require or prevent the
Commission from modifying its rules contained in 47 CFR 73.3555(c)
governing the ownership of both a radio and television broadcast
stations in the same market. (3) Local marketing agreement: Nothing in
this Act shall be construed to prohibit the continuation or renewal of
any television local marketing agreement that is in effect on the date
of enactment of this Act and that is in compliance with  the
Commission's regulations. (4) Statutory restrictions: Section 613 (47
U.S.C. 533) is amended by striking subsection (a) and inserting the
following: `(a) The Commission shall review its ownership rules
biennially  as part of its regulatory reform review under section
259.'. (5) Conforming changes: The Commission shall amend its rules to
make any changes necessary to reflect the effect of this section on
its rules. (6) Effective date: The Commission shall make the
modifications required by paragraphs (1) and (2) effective on the date
of enactment of this Act. (c) Term of Licenses: Section 307(c) (47
U.S.C. 307(c)) is  amended by striking the first four sentences and
inserting the following: `No license shall be granted for a term
longer than 10 years.  Upon  application, a renewal of such license
may be granted from time to time for a term of not to exceed 10 years,
if the  Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and
necessity would be served thereby.'. (d) Broadcast License Renewal
Procedures:  (1) Section 309 (47 U.S.C. 309) is amended by adding at
the end thereof the following: `(k)(1)(A) Notwithstanding subsections
(c) and (d), if the licensee of a broadcast station submits an
application to the Commission for renewal of such license, the
Commission shall grant the application if it finds, after notice and
opportunity for comment, with respect to that station during the
preceding term of its license, that-- `(i) the station has served the
public interest, convenience, and necessity; `(ii) there have been no
serious violations by the licensee  of this Act or the rules and
regulations of the Commission; and `(iii) there have been no other
violations by the licensee of this Act or the rules and regulations of
the Commission which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of
abuse. `(B) If any licensee of a broadcast station fails to meet the
requirements of this subsection, the Commission may deny the
application for renewal in accordance with paragraph (2), or grant
such application on appropriate terms and conditions, including
renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. `(2) If
the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
that a licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified in
paragraph (1)(A) and that no mitigating factors  justify the
imposition of lesser sanctions, the Commission shall-- `(A) issue an
order denying the renewal application filed by such licensee under
section 308; and `(B) only thereafter accept and consider such
applications  for a construction permit as may be filed under section
308 specifying the channel or broadcasting facilities of the former
licensee. `(3) In making the determinations specified in paragraphs
(1) or (2)(A), the Commission shall not consider whether the public
interest, convenience, and necessity might be served by the grant  of
a license to a person other than the renewal applicant.'. (2) Section
309(d) (47 U.S.C. 309(d)) is amended by inserting `(or subsection (k)
in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license)' after `with
subsection (a)' each place it appears. (3) The amendments made by this
subsection apply to applications filed after May 31, 1995. (4) This
section shall operate only if the Commission shall amend its
`Application for renewal of License for AM, FM, TV, Translator or LPTV
Station' (FCC Form 303-S) to require that, for commercial TV
applicants only, the applicant attach as an exhibit to the application
a summary of written comments and suggestions received from the public
and maintained by the licensee in accordance with section 73.1202 of
title 47, Code  of Federal Regulations, that comment on the
applicant's programming, if any, characterized by the commentor as
constituting violent programming. SUBTITLE B--TERMINATION OF
MODIFICATION OF FINAL JUDGMENT SEC. 221. REMOVAL OF LONG DISTANCE
RESTRICTIONS. (a) In General: Part II of title II (47 U.S.C. 251 et
seq.), as added by this Act, is amended by inserting after section 254
the following new section: `SEC. 255. INTEREXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS
SERVICES. `(a) In General: Notwithstanding any restriction or
obligation imposed before the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995 under section II(D) of the Modification
of Final Judgment, 

a Bell operating company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of a Bell
operating company, that meets the requirements of this section may
provide-- `(1) interLATA telecommunications services originating in
any region in which it is the dominant provider of wireline telephone
exchange service or exchange access service after the Commission
determines that it has fully implemented the competitive checklist
found in subsection (b)(2) in the area in which it seeks to provide
interLATA telecommunications  services, in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (c); `(2) interLATA telecommunications
services originating in any area where that company is not the
dominant provider of  wireline telephone exchange service or exchange
access service in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d);
and `(3) interLATA services that are incidental services in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (e). `(b) Specific InterLATA
Interconnection Requirements:  `(1) In general: A Bell operating
company may provide interLATA services in accordance with this section
only if that company has reached an interconnection agreement under
section 251 and that agreement provides, at a minimum, for
interconnection that meets the competitive checklist requirements of
paragraph (2). `(2) Competitive checklist: Interconnection provided by
a  Bell operating company to other telecommunications carriers under
section 251 shall include: `(A) Nondiscriminatory access on an
unbundled basis to  the network functions and services of the Bell
operating company's telecommunications network that is at least equal
in type, quality, and price to the access the Bell  operating company
affords to itself or any other entity. `(B) The capability to exchange
telecommunications  between customers of the Bell operating company
and the telecommunications carrier seeking interconnection. `(C)
Nondiscriminatory access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and
rights-of-way owned or controlled by the Bell operating company at
just and reasonable rates where it has the legal authority to permit
such access. `(D) Local loop transmission from the central office to
the customer's premises, unbundled from local switching or other
services. `(E) Local transport from the trunk side of a wireline local
exchange carrier switch unbundled from switching or other services.
`(F) Local switching unbundled from transport, local loop
transmission, or other services. `(G) Nondiscriminatory access to--
`(i) 911 and E911 services; `(ii) directory assistance services to
allow the  other carrier's customers to obtain telephone numbers; and
`(iii) operator call completion services. `(H) White pages directory
listings for customers of the other carrier's telephone exchange
service. `(I) Until the date by which neutral telephone number
administration guidelines, plan, or rules are established,
nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers for  assignment to the
other carrier's telephone exchange  service customers.  After that
date, compliance with such guidelines, plan, or rules. `(J)
Nondiscriminatory access to databases and associated signaling,
including signaling links, signaling service control points, and
signaling service transfer points, necessary for call routing and
completion. `(K) Until the date by which the Commission determines
that final telecommunications number portability is technically
feasible and must be made available,  interim telecommunications
number portability through remote call forwarding, direct inward
dialing trunks, or other comparable arrangements, with as little
impairment of functioning, quality, reliability, and convenience as
possible. After that date, full compliance with final
telecommunications number portability. `(L) Nondiscriminatory access
to whatever services or information may be necessary to allow the
requesting  carrier to implement local dialing parity in a manner that
permits consumers to be able to dial the same number of digits when
using any telecommunications carrier providing telephone exchange
service or exchange access service. `(M) Reciprocal compensation
arrangements on a nondiscriminatory basis for the origination and
termination of telecommunications. `(N) Telecommunications services
and network functions provided on an unbundled basis without any
conditions or restrictions on the resale or sharing of those services
or functions, including both origination and termination of
telecommunications services, other than reasonable conditions required
by the Commission or a State. For purposes of this subparagraph, it is
not an unreasonable condition for the Commission or a State to limit
the resale-- `(i) of services included in the definition of universal
service to a telecommunications carrier who intends to resell that
service to a category of customers different from the category of
customers  being offered that universal service by such carrier if the
Commission or State orders a carrier to provide the same service to
different categories of customers at different prices necessary to
promote universal  service; or `(ii) of subsidized  universal service
in a manner that allows companies to charge another carrier rates
which reflect the actual cost of providing those services to that
carrier, exclusive of any universal service support received for
providing such services in accordance with section 214(d)(5). `(3)
Joint marketing of local and long distance services: Until a Bell
operating company is authorized to provide interLATA services in a
telephone exchange area where that company is the dominant provider of
wireline telephone exchange service or exchange access service, or
until 36 months have passed since the enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, whichever is earlier, a
telecommunications carrier that serves greater than 5 percent of the
Nation's presubscribed access lines may not jointly market in such
telephone exchange area telephone exchange service purchased from such
company  with interLATA services offered by that telecommunications
carrier. `(4) Commission may not expand competitive checklist: The
Commission may not, by rule or otherwise, limit or extend the terms
used in the competitive checklist. `(c) In-Region Services:  `(1)
Application: Upon the enactment of the  Telecommunications Act of
1995, a Bell operating company or its affiliate may apply to the
Commission for authorization notwithstanding the Modification of Final
Judgment to provide interLATA telecommunications service originating
in any area where such Bell operating company is the dominant provider
of wireline telephone exchange service or exchange access service. The
application shall describe with particularity the nature  and scope of
the activity and of each product market or service market, and each
geographic market for which authorization is sought. `(2)
Determination by commission:  `(A) Determination: Not later than 90
days after  receiving an application under paragraph (1), the 
Commission shall issue a written determination, on the record after a
hearing and opportunity for comment,  granting or denying the
application in whole or in part.  Before making any determination
under this subparagraph,  the Commission shall consult with the
Attorney General regarding the application. In consulting with the 
Commission under this subparagraph, the Attorney General  may apply
any appropriate standard. `(B) Approval: The Commission may only
approve the authorization requested in an application submitted under
paragraph (1) if it finds that-- `(i) the petitioning Bell operating
company has fully implemented the competitive checklist found in
subsection (b)(2); and `(ii) the requested authority will be carried
out in accordance with the requirements of section 252, and if the
Commission determines that the requested authorization is consistent
with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  If the
Commission does not approve an application under this subparagraph, it
shall state the basis for its denial of the application. `(3)
Publication: Not later than 10 days after issuing a determination
under paragraph (2), the Commission shall publish in the Federal
Register a brief description of the determination. `(4) Judicial
review:  `(A) Commencement of action: Not later than 45 days after a
determination by the Commission is published under paragraph (3), the
Bell operating company or its subsidiary or affiliate that applied to
the Commission under paragraph (1), or any person who would be
threatened with loss or damage as a result of the determination
regarding such company's engaging in the activity described in its
application, may commence an action in any United States Court of
Appeals against the Commission for judicial review of the
determination regarding the application. `(B) Judgment:  `(i) The
Court shall enter a judgment after reviewing the determination in
accordance with section 706 of title 5 of the United State Code. `(ii)
A judgment-- `(I) affirming any part of the determination that
approves granting all or part of the requested authorization, or `(II)
reversing any part of the determination that denies all or part of the
requested authorization, shall describe with particularity the nature
and scope of the activity, and of each product market or service
market, and each geographic market, to which the affirmance or
reversal applies. `(5) Requirements relating to separate affiliate;
safeguards; and intralata toll dialing parity: `(A) Separate
affiliate; safeguards: Other than interLATA services authorized by an
order entered by the United  States District Court for the District of
Columbia pursuant to the Modification of Final Judgment before the
date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, a Bell
operating company, or any affiliate of such a company, providing
interLATA services authorized under this subsection may provide such
interLATA services in that market only in accordance with the
requirements of section 252. `(B) Intralata toll dialing parity:  `(i)
A Bell operating company granted authority to provide interLATA
services under this subsection shall provide intraLATA toll dialing
parity throughout that market coincident with its exercise of that
authority. If the Commission finds that such a Bell operating company
has provided interLATA service authorized under this clause before its
implementation of intraLATA toll dialing parity throughout that
market, or fails to maintain intraLATA toll dialing parity throughout
that market, the Commission, except in cases of inadvertent
interruptions or other events beyond the control of the Bell operating
company, shall suspend the authority to provide interLATA service for
that market until the Commission determines that intraLATA toll
dialing  parity is implemented or reinstated. `(ii) Except for
single-LATA States and States which have issued an order by June 1,
1995 requiring a Bell operating company to implement toll dialing
parity, a State may not require a Bell operating company to implement
toll dialing parity in an intraLATA area before a Bell operating
company has been granted authority under this subsection to provide
interLATA services in that area or before three years after the date
of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of  1995, whichever is
earlier.  Nothing in this clause precludes a State from issuing an
order requiring toll dialing parity in an intraLATA area prior to
either  such date so long as such order does not take effect until
after the earlier of either such dates. `(iii) In any State in which
intraLATA toll dialing parity has been implemented prior to the
earlier date specified in clause (ii), no telecommunications carrier
that serves greater than five percent of the Nation's presubscribed
access lines may jointly market interLATA telecommunications services
and intraLATA toll telecommunications services in a telephone exchange
 area in such State until a Bell operating company is authorized under
this subsection to provide interLATA services in such telephone
exchange area or until three years after the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, whichever is earlier. `(d)
Out-of-Region Services: Effective on the date of enactment  of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, a Bell operating company or its
affiliate may provide interLATA telecommunications services
originating in any area where such company is not the dominant
provider of wireline telephone exchange service or exchange access
service. `(e) Incidental Services:  `(1) In general: Effective on the
date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, a Bell
operating company or its affiliate may provide interLATA services that
are incidental to-- `(A)(i) providing audio programming, video
programming,  or other programming services to subscribers of such
company, `(ii) providing the capability for interaction by such
subscribers to select or respond to such audio programming, video
programming, or other programming services, to order, or control
transmission of the programming, polling or balloting, and ordering
other goods or services, `(iii) providing to distributors audio
programming or video programming that such company owns, controls, or
is licensed by the copyright owner of such programming, or by an
assignee of such owner, to distribute, or `(iv) providing alarm
monitoring services, `(B) providing-- `(i) a telecommunications
service, using the transmission facilities of a cable system that is
an affiliate of such company, between LATAs within a cable system
franchise area in which such company is not, on the date of enactment
of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, a provider of wireline
telephone exchange  service, or `(ii) two-way interactive video
services or Internet services over dedicated facilities to or for
elementary and secondary schools as defined in section 264(d), `(C)
providing a service that permits a customer that is located in one
LATA to retrieve stored information from, or file information for
storage in, information storage facilities of such company that are
located in another LATA area, so long as the customer acts
affirmatively to  initiate the storage or retrieval of information,
except that-- `(i) such service shall not cover any service that
establishes a direct connection between end users or  any real-time
voice and data transmission, `(ii) such service shall not include
voice, data, or facsimile distribution services in which the Bell
operating company or affiliate forwards customer-supplied information
to customer- or carrier-selected recipients, `(iii) such service shall
not include any service in which the Bell operating company or
affiliate searches for and connects with the intended recipient of
information, or any service in which the Bell operating company or
affiliate automatically forwards stored voicemail or other information
to the intended recipient, and `(iv) customers of such service shall
not be billed a separate charge for the interLATA telecommunications
furnished in conjunction with the provision of such service, `(D)
providing signaling information used in connection with the provision
of telephone exchange service or  exchange access service to another
local exchange carrier; or `(E) providing network control signaling
information to, and receiving such signaling information from, 
interexchange carriers at any location within the area in which such
company provides telephone exchange service or exchange access
service. `(2) Limitations: The provisions of paragraph (1) are 
intended to be narrowly construed. The transmission facilities used by
a Bell operating company or affiliate thereof to  provide interLATA
telecommunications under paragraph (1)(C) and subsection (f) shall be
leased by that company from  unaffiliated entities on terms and
conditions (including price) no more favorable than those available to
the competitors of that company until that Bell operating company
receives authority to provide interLATA services under subsection (c).
 The interLATA services provided under paragraph (1)(A) are limited to
those interLATA transmissions incidental to the provision by a Bell
operating company or its affiliate of  video, audio, and other
programming services that the company  or its affiliate is engaged in
providing to the public.  A Bell operating company may not provide
telecommunications services not described in paragraph (1) without
receiving the approvals required by subsection (c).  The provision of
services authorized under this subsection by a Bell operating company
or its affiliate shall not adversely affect telephone exchange
ratepayers or competition in any telecommunications market. `(f)
Commercial Mobile Service: A Bell operating company may provide
interLATA commercial mobile service except where such service is a
replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial
portion of the land line telephone exchange service in a State in
accordance with section 322(c) and with the regulations prescribed by
the Commission. `(g) Definitions: As used in this section-- `(1) Audio
programming services: The term `audio programming services' means
programming provided by, or generally  considered to be comparable to
programming provided by, a radio broadcast station. `(2) Video
programming services; other programming services: The terms `video
programming service' and `other programming services' have the same
meanings as such terms have under section 602 of this Act. `(h)
Certain Service Applications Treated As In-Region Service
Applications: For purposes of this section, a Bell operating  company
application to provide 800 service, private line service,  or their
equivalents that-- `(1) terminate in an area where the Bell operating
company is the dominant provider of wireline telephone exchange
service or exchange access service, and `(2) allow the called party to
determine the interLATA carrier, shall be considered an in-region
service subject to the  requirements of subsection (c) and not of
subsection (d).'. (b) Long Distance Access for Commercial Mobile
Services:  (1) In General: Notwithstanding any restriction or
obligation imposed pursuant to the Modification of final Judgment or
other consent decree or proposed consent decree prior to the date of
enactment of this Act, a person engaged in the provision of commercial
mobile services (as defined in section 332(d)(1) of the Communications
Act of 1934), insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be
required by court order or otherwise to provide equal access to
interexchange telecommunications carriers, except as provided by this
section.  Such a person shall ensure that its subscribers can obtain
unblocked access  to the provider of interexchange services of the
subscriber's choice through the use of an interexchange carrier
identification code assigned to such provider, except that the
requirements for unblocking shall not apply to mobile satellite
services unless the Commission finds it to be in the public interest.
(2) Equal access requirement conditions: The Commission may only
require a person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile
services to provide equal access to interexchange carriers if-- (A)
such person, insofar as such person is so engaged, is subject to the
interconnection obligations of section  251(a) of the Communications
Act of 1934, and (B) the Commission finds that such requirement is in
the public interest. SEC. 222. REMOVAL OF MANUFACTURING RESTRICTIONS.
(a) In General: Part II of title II (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.), as added
by this Act, is amended by inserting after section 255 the following
new section: `SEC. 256. REGULATION OF MANUFACTURING BY BELL OPERATING
COMPANIES. `(a) Authorization:  `(1) In general: Notwithstanding any
restriction or  obligation imposed before the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1995 pursuant to the Modification of Final
Judgment on the lines of business in which a Bell operating company
may engage, if the Commission authorizes a Bell operating company to
provide interLATA services under section 255, then that company may be
authorized by the Commission to manufacture and provide
telecommunications equipment, and to manufacture customer premises
equipment, at any time after that determination is made, subject to
the requirements of this section and the regulations prescribed,
except that neither a Bell operating company nor any of its affiliates
may engage in such manufacturing in conjunction with a Bell operating
company not so affiliated or any of its affiliates. `(2) Certain
research and design arrangements; royalty agreements: Upon adoption of
rules by the Commission under section 252, a Bell operating company
may-- `(A) engage in research and design activities related to
manufacturing, and `(B) enter into royalty agreements with
manufacturers of telecommunications equipment. `(b) Separate
Affiliate; Safeguards: Any manufacturing or provision of equipment
authorized under subsection (a) shall be conducted in accordance with
the requirements of section 252. `(c) Protection of Small Telephone
Company Interests:  `(1) Equipment to be made available to others: A 
manufacturing affiliate of a Bell operating company shall make
available, without discrimination or self-preference as to price,
delivery, terms, or conditions, to all local exchange carriers, for
use with the public telecommunications network, any telecommunications
equipment, including software integral  to such telecommunications
equipment, including upgrades, manufactured by such affiliate if each
such purchasing carrier-- `(A) does not manufacture telecommunications
equipment or have an affiliate which manufactures telecommunications
equipment; or `(B) agrees to make available, to the Bell operating
company that is the parent of the manufacturing affiliate  or any of
the local exchange carrier affiliates of such  Bell company, any
telecommunications equipment, including software integral to such
telecommunications equipment, including upgrades, manufactured for use
with the public telecommunications network by such purchasing carrier
or by any entity or organization with which such purchasing carrier is
affiliated. `(2) Non-discrimination standards:  `(A) A Bell operating
company and any entity acting on  its behalf shall make procurement
decisions and award all supply contracts for equipment, services, and
software on the basis of open, competitive bidding, and an objective
assessment of price, quality, delivery, and other  commercial factors.
`(B) A Bell operating company and any entity it owns or otherwise
controls, or which is acting on its behalf or on behalf of its
affiliate, shall permit any person to participate fully on a
non-discriminatory basis in the process of establishing standards and
certifying equipment used in or interconnected to the public
telecommunications network. `(C) A Bell operating company shall,
consistent with the antitrust laws, engage in joint network planning
and design with local exchange carriers operating in the same area of
interest.  No participant in such planning shall be allowed to delay
the introduction of new technology or the deployment of facilities to
provide telecommunications services, and agreement with such other
carriers shall not be required as a prerequisite for such introduction
or deployment. A Bell operating company shall provide, to  other local
exchange carriers operating in the same area of interest, timely
information on the planned deployment of telecommunications equipment,
including software integral  to such telecommunications equipment and
upgrades of that software. `(D) A manufacturing affiliate of a Bell
operating  company may not restrict sales to any local exchange 
carrier of telecommunications equipment, including software integral
to the operation of such equipment and related upgrades. `(E) A Bell
operating company and any entity it owns or otherwise controls shall
protect the proprietary  information submitted with contract bids and
in the standards and certification processes from release not
specifically authorized by the owner of such information. `(d)
Collaboration with Other Manufacturers: A Bell operating company and
its affiliates may engage in close collaboration with any manufacturer
of customer premises equipment or telecommunications equipment not
affiliated with a Bell operating company during the design and
development of hardware, software, or combinations thereof relating to
such equipment. `(e) Information on Protocols and Technical
Requirements: The Commission shall prescribe regulations to require
that each Bell operating company shall maintain and file with the
Commission full and complete information with respect to the protocols
and  technical requirements for connection with and use of its
telephone exchange service facilities. Such regulations shall require
each such Bell company to report promptly to the Commission any
material changes or planned changes to such protocols and
requirements, and the schedule for implementation of such changes or
planned changes. `(f) Additional Rules and Regulations: The Commission
may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as the Commission
determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section,
and otherwise to prevent discrimination and cross-subsidization in a
Bell operating company's dealings with its affiliate and with third
parties. `(g) Administration and Enforcement:  `(1) Commission
authority: For the purposes of administering and enforcing the
provisions of this section and the  regulations prescribed under this
section, the Commission shall have the same authority, power, and
functions with respect to any Bell operating company as the Commission
has in administering and enforcing the provisions of this title with
respect to any common carrier subject to this Act. `(2) Civil actions
by injured parties: Any party injured by  an act or omission of a Bell
operating company or its manufacturing affiliate which violates the
requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (c), or the
Commission's regulations implementing such paragraphs, may initiate an
 action in a district court of the United States to recover the full
amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation and
obtain such orders from the court as are  necessary to terminate
existing violations and to prevent  future violations; or such party
may seek relief from the Commission pursuant to sections 206 through
209. `(h) Application to Bell Communications Research: Nothing in this
section-- `(1) provides any authority for Bell Communications
Research, or any successor entity, to manufacture or provide
telecommunications equipment or to manufacture customer  premises
equipment; or `(2) prohibits Bell Communications Research, or any
successor entity, from engaging in any activity in which it is
lawfully engaged on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications
Act of 1995, including providing a centralized organization for the
provision of engineering, administrative, and other services
(including serving as a single point of contact for  coordination of
the Bell operating companies to meet national security and emergency
preparedness requirements). `(i) Definitions: As used in this
section-- `(1) The term `customer premises equipment' means equipment
employed on the premises of a person (other than a carrier) to
originate, route, or terminate telecommunications. `(2) The term
`manufacturing' has the same meaning as such term has in the
Modification of Final Judgment. `(3) The term `telecommunications
equipment' means equipment, other than customer premises equipment,
used by a carrier to provide telecommunications services.'. (b) Effect
on Pre-existing Manufacturing Authority: Nothing in this section, or
in section 256 of the Communications Act of 1934  as added by this
section, prohibits any Bell operating company from engaging, directly
or through any affiliate, in any manufacturing activity in which any
Bell operating company or affiliate was authorized to engage on the
date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 223. EXISTING ACTIVITIES. Nothing
in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, prohibits a Bell
operating company from engaging, at any time after the date of
enactment of this Act, in any activity authorized by an order entered
by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
pursuant to section VII or VIII(C) of the Modification of Final
Judgment, if such order was entered on or before the date of enactment
of this Act. SEC. 224.  ENFORCEMENT. (a) In General: Part II of title
II (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.), as added by this Act, is amended by
inserting after section 256 the following: `SEC. 257.  ENFORCEMENT.
`(a) In General: In addition to any penalty, fine, or other
enforcement remedy under this Act, the failure by a telecommunications
carrier to implement the requirements of section 251 or 255, including
a failure to comply with the terms of an interconnection agreement
approved under section 251, is punishable by a civil penalty of not to
exceed $1,000,000 per offense. Each  day of a continuing offense shall
be treated as a separate  violation for purposes of levying any
penalty under this subsection. `(b) Noncompliance with Interconnection
or Separate Subsidiary Requirements: `(1) A Bell operating company
that repeatedly, knowingly, and without reasonable cause fails to
implement an interconnection agreement approved under section 251, to
comply with the requirements of such agreement after implementing
them, or to comply with the separate affiliate requirements of this
part  may be fined up to $500,000,000 by a district court of the
United States of competent jurisdiction. `(2) A Bell operating company
that repeatedly, knowingly, and without reasonable cause fails to meet
its obligations under section 255 for the provision of interLATA
service may have its authority to provide any service suspended if its
right to provide that service is conditioned upon its meeting those
obligations. `(c) Enforcement by Private Right of Action:  `(1)
Damages: Any person who is injured in its business or property by
reason of a violation of section 251 or 255 may bring a civil action
in any district court of the United States in the district in which
the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to
the amount in controversy. `(2) Interest: The court may award under
this section, pursuant to a motion by such person promptly made,
simple interest on actual damages for the period beginning on the date
of service of such person's pleading setting forth a claim  under this
title and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period
therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for such
period is just in the circumstances. `(d) Payment of Civil Penalties,
Damages, or Interest: No civil penalties, damages, or interest
assessed against any local exchange carrier as a result of a violation
referred to in this section will be charged directly or indirectly to
that company's rate payers.'. (b) Certain Broadcasts: Section
1307(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by

otherwise prohibited, or broadcast by a radio or television station
licensed in a State in which such activities or the broadcast of such
activities are authorized or not otherwise prohibited.'. SEC. 225.
ALARM MONITORING SERVICES. Part II of title II (47 U.S.C. 251 et
seq.), as added by this  Act, is amended by inserting after section
257 the following new section: `SEC. 258. REGULATION OF ENTRY INTO
ALARM MONITORING SERVICES. `(a) In General: Except as provided in this
section, a Bell operating company, or any affiliate of that company,
may not  provide alarm monitoring services for the protection of life,
safety, or property. A Bell operating company may transport alarm
monitoring service signals on a common carrier basis only. `(b)
Authority To Provide Alarm Monitoring Services: Beginning 4 years
after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, a
Bell operating company may provide alarm monitoring  services for the
protection of life, safety, or property if it has been authorized to
provide interLATA services under section 255 unless the Commission
finds that the provision of alarm monitoring services by such company
is not in the public interest.  The Commission may not find that
provision of alarm monitoring services by a Bell operating company is
in the public interest until it  finds that it has the capability
effectively to enforce any requirements, limitations, or conditions
that may be placed upon a Bell operating company in the provision of
alarm monitoring services, including the regulations prescribed under
subsection (c). `(c) Regulations Required:  `(1) Not later than 1 year
after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, the
Commission shall prescribe
regulations--
`(A) to establish such requirements, limitations, or conditions as
are-- `(i) necessary and appropriate in the public interest with
respect to the provision of alarm monitoring services by Bell
operating companies and their affiliates, and `(ii) effective at such
time as a Bell operating company or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates is authorized to provide alarm monitoring services; and
`(B) to establish procedures for the receipt and review  of complaints
concerning violations by such companies of such regulations, or of any
other provision of this Act or the regulations thereunder, that result
in material financial harm to a provider of alarm monitoring services.
`(2) A Bell operating company, its affiliates, and any local exchange
carrier are prohibited from recording or using in any fashion the
occurrence or contents of calls received by providers of alarm
monitoring services for the purposes of marketing such services on
behalf of the Bell operating  company, any of its affiliates, the
local exchange carrier, or any other entity. Any regulations necessary
to enforce this paragraph shall be issued initially within 6 months
after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995.
`(d) Expedited Consideration Of Complaints: The procedures established
under subsection (c) shall ensure that the Commission will make a
final determination with respect to any complaint described in such
subsection within 120 days after receipt of the complaint. If the
complaint contains an appropriate showing that the alleged violation
occurred, as determined by the Commission in accordance with such
regulations, the Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of the
complaint, issue a cease and desist order to prevent the Bell
operating company and its subsidiaries and affiliates from continuing
to engage in such violation pending such final determination. `(e)
Remedies: The Commission may use any remedy available under title V of
this Act to terminate and to impose sanctions on violations described
in subsection (c). Such remedies may include, if the Commission
determines that such violation was willful or repeated, ordering the
Bell operating company or its affiliate to cease offering alarm
monitoring services. `(f) Savings Provision: Subsections (a) and (b)
do not prohibit  or limit the provision of alarm monitoring services
by a Bell operating company or an affiliate that was engaged in
providing those services as of June 1, 1995, to the extent that such
company-- `(1) continues to provide those services through the 
affiliate through which it was providing them on that date; and `(2)
does not acquire, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in
another entity engaged in providing alarm  monitoring services. `(g)
Alarm Monitoring Services Defined: As used in this section, the term
`alarm monitoring services' means services that detect threats to
life, safety, or property by burglary, fire, vandalism, bodily injury,
or other emergency through the use of devices that transmit signals to
a central point in a customer's residence,  place of business, or
other fixed premises which-- `(1) retransmits such signals to a remote
monitoring center  by means of telecommunications facilities of the
Bell operating company and any subsidiary or affiliate; and `(2)
serves to alert persons at the monitoring center of the need to inform
customers, other persons, or police, fire, rescue, or other security
or public safety personnel of the threat at such premises. Such term
does not include medical monitoring devices attached to individuals
for the automatic surveillance of ongoing medical conditions.'. SEC.
226.  NONAPPLICABILITY OF MODIFICATION OF FINAL JUDGMENT.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of any judicial order,
no person shall be subject to the provisions of the Modification of
Final Judgment solely by reason of having acquired commercial mobile
service or private mobile service assets or operations previously
owned by a Bell operating company or an affiliate of a Bell operating
company. TITLE III--AN END TO REGULATION SEC. 301. TRANSITION TO
COMPETITIVE PRICING. (a) Pricing Flexibility:  (1) In general: The
Commission and the States shall provide  to telecommunications
carriers price flexibility in the rates charged consumers for the
provision of telecommunications services within one year after the
date of enactment of this Act. The Commission or a State may establish
the rate consumers may be charged for services included in the
definition of universal service, as well as the contribution, if any,
that  all carriers must contribute for the preservation and
advancement of universal service. Pricing flexibility implemented
pursuant to this section for the purpose of  allowing a regulated
telecommunications provider to respond to competition by repricing
services subject to competition shall not have the effect of using
noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services. (2)
Consumer protection: The Commission and the States shall ensure that
rates for telephone service remain just,  reasonable, and affordable
as competition develops for  telephone exchange service and telephone
exchange access service. Until sufficient competition exists in a
market, the Commission or a State may establish the rate that a
carrier may charge for any such service if such rate is necessary for
the protection of consumers. Any such rate shall cease to be regulated
whenever the Commission or a State determines that it is no longer
necessary for the protection of consumers. The Commission shall
establish cost allocation guidelines for facilities owned by an
essential telecommunications carrier  that are used for the provision
of both services included in  the definition of universal service and
video programming sold by such carrier directly to subscribers, if
such allocation is necessary for the protection of consumers. (3)
Rate-of-return regulation eliminated:  (A) In instituting the price
flexibility required under paragraph (1) the Commission and the States
shall establish alternative forms of regulation for Tier 1
telecommunications carriers that do not include regulation of the rate
of return earned by such carrier as part of a plan that provides for
any or all of the following-- (i) the advancement of competition in
the provision  of telecommunications services; (ii) improvements in
productivity; (iii) improvements in service quality; (iv) measures to
ensure customers of non-competitive services do not bear the risks
associated with the provision of competitive services; (v) enhanced
telecommunications services for educational institutions; or (vi) any
other measures Commission or a State, as appropriate, determines to be
in the public interest. (B) The Commission or a State, as appropriate,
may apply such alternative forms of regulation to any other
telecommunications carrier that is subject to rate of  return
regulation under this Act. (C) Any such alternative form of
regulation-- (i) shall be consistent with the objectives of preserving
and advancing universal service,  guaranteeing high quality service,
ensuring just, reasonable, and affordable rates, and encouraging
economic efficiency; and (ii) shall meet such other criteria as the
Commission or a State, as appropriate, finds to be consistent with the
public interest, convenience, and necessity. (D) Nothing in this
section shall prohibit the  Commission, for interstate services, and
the States, for intrastate services, from considering the
profitability of telecommunications carriers when using alternative
forms of regulation other than rate of return regulation (including
price regulation and incentive regulation) to ensure that regulated
rates are just and reasonable. (b) Transition Plan Required: If the
Commission or a State adopts rules for the distribution of support
payments under section 253 of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended by this Act, such rules shall include a transition plan to
allow essential telecommunications carriers to provide for an orderly
transition from the universal service support mechanisms in existence
upon the date of enactment of this Act and the support mechanisms 
established by the Commission and the States under this Act or the
Communications Act of 1934 as amended by this Act. Any such transition
plan shall-- (1) provide a phase-in of the price flexibility
requirements under subsection (a) for an essential telecommunications 
carrier that is also a rural telephone company; and (2) require the
United States Government and the States,  where permitted by law, to
modify any regulatory requirements (including conditions for the
repayment of loans and the depreciation of assets) applicable to
carriers designated as essential telecommunications carriers in order
to more accurately reflect the conditions that would be imposed in a
competitive market for similar assets or services. (c) Duty to Provide
Subscriber List Information:  (1) In general: A carrier that provides
local exchange telephone service shall provide subscriber list
information gathered in its capacity as a provider of such service on
a timely and unbundled basis, under nondiscriminatory and reasonable
rates, terms, and conditions, to any person requesting such
information for the purpose of publishing directories in any format.
(2) Subscriber list information defined: As used in this subsection,
the term `subscriber list information' means any information-- (A)
identifying the listed names of subscribers of a carrier and such
subscribers' listed telephone numbers, addresses, or primary
advertising classifications, as such classifications are assigned at
the time of the establishment of service, or any combination of such
names, numbers, addresses, or classifications; and (B) that the
carrier or an affiliate has published,  caused to be published, or
accepted for publication in a directory in any format. (d)
Confidentiality: A telecommunications carrier has a duty to protect
the confidentiality of proprietary information of, and relating to,
other common carriers and customers, including common carriers
reselling the telecommunications services provided by a
telecommunications carrier.  A telecommunications carrier that
receives such information from another carrier for purposes of
provisioning, billing, or facilitating the resale of its service shall
use such information only for such purpose, and shall not use such
information for its own marketing efforts.  Nothing in this subsection
prohibits a carrier from using customer information obtained from its
customers, either directly or indirectly through its agents-- (1) to
provide, market, or bill for its services; or (2) to perform credit
evaluations on existing or potential customers. (e) Regulatory Relief:
 (1) Streamlined procedures for changes in charges, classifications,
regulations, or practices: (A) Section 204(a) (47 U.S.C. 204(a)) is
amended-- (i) by striking `12 months' the first place it  appears in
paragraph (2)(A) and inserting `5 months'; (ii) by striking
`effective,' and all that follows in paragraph (2)(A) and inserting
`effective.'; and (iii) by adding at the end thereof the following:
`(3) A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission a new or
revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice on a
streamlined basis. Any such charge, classification, regulation, or
practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective 7 days (in the
case of a reduction in rates) or 15 days (in the case of an increase
in rates) after the date on which it is filed with the Commission
unless the Commission takes action under paragraph (1) before the end
of that 7-day  or 15-day period, as is appropriate.'. (B) Section
208(b) (47 U.S.C. 208(b)) is amended-- (i) by striking `12 months' the
first place it  appears in paragraph (1) and inserting `5 months'; and
(ii) by striking `filed,' and all that follows in paragraph (1) and
inserting `filed.'. (2) Extensions of lines under section 214; armis
reports: Notwithstanding section 305, the Commission shall permit any
local exchange carrier-- (A) to be exempt from the requirements of
section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934 for the extension of any
line; and (B) to file cost allocation manuals and ARMIS reports
annually, to the extent such carrier is required to file such manuals
or reports. (3) Forebearance authority not limited: Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission
or a State to waive, modify, or forebear from applying any of the
requirements to which reference is made in paragraph (1) under any
other provision of this Act or other law. SEC. 302. BIENNIAL REVIEW OF
REGULATIONS; ELIMINATION OF  UNNECESSARY REGULATIONS AND FUNCTIONS.
(a) Biennial Review: Part II of title II (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.), as
added by this Act, is amended by inserting after section 258 the
following new section: `SEC. 259.  REGULATORY REFORM. `(a) Biennial
Review of Regulations: In every odd-numbered year (beginning with
1997), the Commission, with respect to its regulations under this Act,
and a Federal-State Joint Board established under section 410, for
State regulations-- `(1) shall review all regulations issued under
this Act, or under State law, in effect at the time of the review that
apply to operations or activities of providers of any
telecommunications services; and `(2) shall determine whether any such
regulation is no longer necessary in the public interest as the result
of meaningful economic competition between the providers of such
service. `(b) Effect of Determination: The Commission shall repeal any
regulation it determines to be no longer necessary in the public
interest. The Joint Board shall notify the Governor of any State of
any State regulation it determines to be no longer necessary in the
public interest. `(c) Classification of Carriers: In classifying
carriers  according to 47 CFR 32.11 and in establishing reporting 
requirements pursuant to 47 CFR part 43 and 47 CFR 64.903, the
Commission shall adjust the revenue requirements to account for
inflation as of the release date of the Commission's Report and Order
in CC Docket No. 91-141, and annually thereafter. This subsection
shall take effect on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications
Act of 1995.'. (b) Elimination of Unnecessary Commission Regulations
and Functions: (1) Repeal setting of depreciation rates: The first

audits under this section. While so employed or engaged in conducting
an audit for the Commission under this section, any such person shall
have the powers granted the Commission under this subsection and shall
 be subject to subsection (f) in the same manner as if that person
were an employee of the Commission.'. (3) Simplification of
federal-state coordination process: The Commission shall simplify and
expedite the Federal-State coordination process under section 410 of
the Communications  Act of 1934. (4) Privatization of ship radio

end thereof the following: `In accordance with such other provisions
of law as apply to Government contracts, the Commission may enter into
contracts with any person for the purpose of carrying out such
inspections and certifying compliance with those requirements, and
may, as part of any such contract, allow any such person to accept
reimbursement from the license holder for travel and expense costs of
any employee conducting an inspection or certification.'. (5)
Modification of construction permit requirement: Section 319(d) (47
U.S.C. 319(d)) is amended by striking the third sentence and inserting
the following: `The Commission may waive the requirement for a
construction permit with respect to a broadcasting station in
circumstances in which it deems prior approval to be unnecessary. In
those circumstances, a broadcaster shall file any related license
application within  10 days after completing construction.'. (6)
Limitation on silent station authorizations: Section 312 (47 U.S.C.
312) is amended by adding at the end the following: `(g) If a
broadcasting station fails to transmit broadcast  signals for any
consecutive 12-month period, then the station license granted for the
operation of that broadcast station expires at the end of that period,
notwithstanding any provision, term, or condition of the license to
the contrary.'. (7) Expediting instructional television fixed service
processing: The Commission shall delegate, under section 5(c)  of the
Communications Act of 1934, the conduct of routine instructional
television fixed service cases to its staff for consideration and

amended by inserting after section 259 the following new section:
`SEC. 260. COMPETITION IN PROVISION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE.
`(a) Regulatory flexibility: Notwithstanding section 332(c)(1)(A) of
this Act, the Commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or
any provision of this Act to a telecommunications carrier or service,
or class of carriers or services, in any or  some of its or their
geographic markets if the Commission  determines that-- `(1)
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure
that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations by, for,
or in connection with that carrier or service are just and reasonable
and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; `(2) enforcement
of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of
consumers or the preservation and advancement of universal service;
and `(3) forbearance from applying such regulation or provision  is
consistent with the public interest. `(b) Competitive Effect to Be
Weighed: In making the  determination under subsection (a)(3), the
Commission shall  consider whether forbearance from enforcing the
regulation or provision will promote competitive market conditions,
including the extent to which such forbearance will enhance
competition among providers of telecommunications services. If the
Commission determines that such forbearance will promote competition
among providers of telecommunications services, that determination may
be the basis for a Commission finding that forbearance is in the 
public interest. `(c) End of Regulation Process: Any
telecommunications carrier,  or class of telecommunications carriers,
may submit a petition to the Commission requesting that the Commission
exercise the  authority granted under this section with respect to
that carrier  or those carriers, or any service offered by that
carrier or carriers. Any such petition shall be deemed granted if the
Commission does not deny the petition for failure to meet the
requirements for forebearance under subsection (a) within 90 days
after the Commission receives it, unless the 90-day period is extended
by the Commission. The Commission may extend the initial 90-day period
by an additional 60 days if the Commission finds that an extension is
necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (a). The Commission
may grant or deny a petition in whole or in  part and shall explain
its decision in writing. `(d) Limitation: Except as provided in
section 251(i)(3), the Commission may not waive the unbundling
requirements of section 251(b) or 255(b)(2) under subsection (a) until
it determines that those requirements have been fully implemented.'.
SEC. 304.  ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS INCENTIVES. (a) In General: The
Commission and each State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over
telecommunications services shall encourage the deployment on a
reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability
to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary

greater  restraint in the content of programming for children. (6) A
report of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, dated May 1993,
indicates that there is an irrefutable connection between the amount
of violence depicted in the television programs watched by children
and increased aggressive behavior among children. (7) It is a
compelling National interest that parents be empowered with the
technology to block the viewing by their children of television
programs whose content is overly violent or objectionable for other
reasons. (8) Technology currently exists to permit the manufacture of
television receivers that are capable of permitting parents to block
television programs having violent or otherwise objectionable content.
SEC. 503. RATING CODE FOR VIOLENCE AND OTHER OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT ON
TELEVISION. (a) Sense of Congress on Voluntary Establishment of Rating
Code: It is the sense of Congress-- (1) to encourage appropriate

VII--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SEC. 701. SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. (a)
Findings: The Congress finds that-- (1) the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration of the Department of
Commerce recently submitted to the Congress a report entitled `U.S.
National Spectrum Requirements' as required by section 113 of the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923); (2) based on the best available
information the report concludes that an additional 179 megahertz of
spectrum will be needed within the next ten years to meet the expected
demand  for land mobile and mobile satellite radio services such as
cellular telephone service, paging services, personal communication
services, and low earth orbiting satellite communications systems; (3)
a further 85 megahertz of additional spectrum, for a  total of 264
megahertz, is needed if the United States is to fully implement the
Intelligent Transportation System currently under development by the
Department of Transportation; (4) as required by part B of the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 921 et seq.) the Federal Government will
transfer 235 megahertz of spectrum from exclusive government use to
non-governmental or mixed governmental and non-governmental use
between 1994 and 2004; (5) the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report
submitted to Congress under section 113 of the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act by
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration states
that, of the 235 megahertz of spectrum identified for reallocation
from governmental to non-governmental or mixed use-- (A) 50 megahertz
has already been reallocated for exclusive non-governmental use, (B)
45 megahertz will be reallocated in 1995 for both exclusive
non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-governmental use, (C)
25 megahertz will be reallocated in 1997 for  exclusive
non-governmental use, (D) 70 megahertz will be reallocated in 1999 for
both exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and
non-governmental use, and (E) the final 45 megahertz will be
reallocated for mixed governmental and non-governmental use by 2004;
(6) the 165 megahertz of spectrum that are not yet reallocated,
combined with 80 megahertz that the Federal Communications Commission
is currently holding in reserve for emerging technologies, are less
than the best estimates of projected spectrum needs in the United
States; (7) the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to
assign radio spectrum frequencies using an auction process expires on
September 30, 1998; (8) a significant portion of the reallocated
spectrum will  not yet be assigned to non-governmental users before
that authority expires; (9) the transfer of Federal governmental users
from certain valuable radio frequencies to other reserved frequencies
could be expedited if Federal governmental users are permitted to
accept reimbursement for relocation costs from non-governmental users;
and (10) non-governmental reimbursement of Federal governmental users
relocation costs would allow the market to determine the most
efficient use of the available spectrum. (b) Extension and Expansion
of Auction Authority: Section 309(j) (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) is amended--
(1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting in lieu thereof the
following: `(1) General authority: If mutually exclusive applications
or requests are accepted for any initial license or construction
permit which will involve a use of the electromagnetic  spectrum, then
the Commission shall grant such license or  permit to a qualified
applicant through a system of competitive bidding that meets the
requirements of this subsection. The competitive bidding authority
granted by this subsection shall not apply to licenses or construction
permits issued by the Commission for public safety radio services or
for licenses or construction permits for new terrestrial digital
television services assigned by the Commission to existing terrestrial
broadcast licensees to replace their current television licenses.';
(2) by striking paragraph (2) and renumbering paragraphs (3) through
(13) as (2) through (12), respectively; and (3) by striking `1998' in
paragraph (10), as renumbered, and inserting in lieu thereof `2000'.
(c) Reimbursement of Federal Relocation Costs: Section 113 of the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration Act (47
U.S.C. 923) is amended by adding at the end the following new
subsections: `(f) Relocation of Federal Government Stations:  `(1) In
general: In order to expedite the efficient use of  the
electromagnetic spectrum and notwithstanding section  3302(b) of title
31, United States Code, any Federal entity which operates a Federal
Government station may accept reimbursement from any person for the
costs incurred by such Federal entity for any modification,
replacement, or reissuance of equipment, facilities, operating
manuals, regulations, or other expenses incurred by that entity in
relocating the operations of its Federal Government station or
stations from one or more radio spectrum frequencies to any other
frequency  or frequencies. Any such reimbursement shall be deposited
in  the account of such Federal entity in the Treasury of the  United
States. Funds deposited according to this section shall be available,
without appropriation or fiscal year limitation, only for the
operations of the Federal entity for which such funds were deposited
under this section. `(2) Process for relocation: Any person seeking to
relocate a Federal Government station that has been assigned a
frequency within a band allocated for mixed Federal and non-Federal
use may submit a petition for such relocation to NTIA. The NTIA shall
limit the Federal Government station's operating license to secondary
status when the following requirements are met-- `(A) the person
seeking relocation of the Federal Government station has guaranteed
reimbursement through money or in-kind payment of all relocation costs
incurred  by the Federal entity, including all engineering, 
equipment, site acquisition and construction, and  regulatory fee
costs; `(B) the person seeking relocation completes all activities
necessary for implementing the relocation, including construction of
replacement facilities (if necessary and appropriate) and identifying
and obtaining on the Federal entity's behalf new frequencies for use
by the relocated Federal Government station (where such station is not
relocating to spectrum reserved exclusively for Federal use); and `(C)
any necessary replacement facilities, equipment modifications, or
other changes have been implemented and tested to ensure that the
Federal Government station is  able to successfully accomplish its
purposes. `(3) Right to reclaim: If within one year after the 
relocation the Federal Government station demonstrates to the
Commission that the new facilities or spectrum are not comparable to
the facilities or spectrum from which the Federal Government station
was relocated, the person seeking such relocation must take reasonable
steps to remedy any defects or reimburse the Federal entity for the
costs of returning the Federal Government station to the spectrum from
which such station was relocated. `(g) Federal Action to Expedite
Spectrum Transfer: Any Federal Government station which operates on
electromagnetic spectrum that has been identified for reallocation for
mixed Federal and non-Federal use in the Spectrum Reallocation Final
Report shall, to the maximum extent practicable through the use of the
authority granted under subsection (f) and any other applicable
provision of law, take action to relocate its spectrum use to other
frequencies that are reserved for Federal use or to consolidate its
spectrum  use with other Federal Government stations in a manner that
maximizes the spectrum available for non-Federal use. Notwithstanding
the timetable contained in the Spectrum  Reallocation Final Report,
the President shall seek to implement  the reallocation of the 1710 to
1755 megahertz frequency band by January 1, 2000. Subsection (c)(4) of
this section shall not apply to the extent that a non-Federal user
seeks to relocate or  relocates a Federal power agency under
subsection (f). `(h) Definitions: For purposes of this section-- `(1)
Federal entity: The term `Federal entity' means any Department,
agency, or other element of the Federal Government that utilizes radio
frequency spectrum in the conduct of its authorized activities,
including a Federal power agency. `(2) Spectrum Reallocation Final
Report: The term `Spectrum Reallocation Final Report' means the report
submitted by the Secretary to the President and Congress in compliance
with the requirements of subsection (a).'. (d) Reallocation of
Additional Spectrum: The Secretary of  Commerce shall, within 9 months
after the date of enactment of this Act, prepare and submit to the
President and the Congress a report and timetable recommending the
reallocation of the two frequency bands (3625-3650 megahertz and
5850-5925 megahertz) that were discussed but not recommended for
reallocation in the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report under section
113(a) of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration Organization Act. The Secretary shall consult with the
Federal Communications Commission and other Federal agencies in the
preparation of the report, and shall provide notice and an opportunity
for public comment before submitting the report and timetable required
by this section. (e) Broadcast Auxiliary Spectrum Relocation:  (1)
Allocation of spectrum for broadcast auxiliary uses: Within one year
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall allocate
the 4635-4685 megahertz band transferred to the Commission under
section 113(b) of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(b)) for broadcast
auxiliary uses. (2) Mandatory relocation of broadcast auxiliary uses:
Within  7 years after the date of enactment of this Act, all licensees
of broadcast auxiliary spectrum in the 2025-2075 megahertz band shall
relocate into spectrum allocated by the Commission under paragraph
(1). The Commission shall assign and grant licenses for use of the
spectrum allocated under paragraph (1)-- (A) in a manner sufficient to
permit timely completion of relocation; and (B) without using a
competitive bidding process. (3) Assigning recovered spectrum: Within
5 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall
allocate  the spectrum recovered in the 2025-2075 megahertz band under
paragraph (2) for use by new licensees for commercial mobile services
or other similar services after the relocation of broadcast auxiliary
licensees, and shall assign such licenses  by competitive bidding.
SEC. 702. RENEWED EFFORTS TO REGULATE VIOLENT PROGRAMMING. (a)
Findings: The Senate finds that: (1) Violence is a pervasive and
persistent feature of the entertainment industry. According to the
Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development, by the age of 18, children
will have been exposed to nearly 18,000 televised murders and 800
suicides. (2) Violence on television is likely to have a serious and
harmful effect on the emotional development of young children. The
American Psychological Association has reported that children who
watch `a large number of aggressive programs tend to hold attitudes
and values that favor the use of aggression  to solve conflicts'. The
National Institute of Mental Health  has stated similarly that
`violence on television does lead to aggressive behavior by children
and teenagers'. (3) The Senate recognizes that television violence is
not the sole cause of violence in society. (4) There is a broad
recognition in the United States  Congress that the television
industry has an obligation to police the content of its own broadcasts
to children. That understanding was reflected in the Television
Violence Act of 1990, which was specifically designed to permit
industry participants to work together to create a self-monitoring
system. (5) After years of denying that television violence has any
detrimental effect, the entertainment industry has begun to address
the problem of television violence. In the spring of 1994, for
example, the network and cable industries announced the appointment of
an independent monitoring group to assess  the amount of violence on
television. These reports are due out in the fall of 1995 and winter
of 1996, respectively. (6) The Senate recognizes that self-regulation
by the private sector is generally preferable to direct regulation by
the Federal Government. (b) Sense of the Senate: It is the sense of
the Senate that the entertainment industry should do everything
possible to limit the amount of violent and aggressive entertainment
programming, particularly during the hours when children are most
likely to be watching. SEC. 703. PREVENTION OF UNFAIR BILLING
PRACTICES FOR INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED OVER TOLL-FREE
TELEPHONE CALLS. (a) Findings: Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Reforms required by the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute
Resolution Act of 1992 have improved the reputation of the
pay-per-call industry and resulted in regulations that have reduced
the incidence of misleading practices that are harmful to the public
interest. (2) Among the successful reforms is a restriction on charges
being assessed for calls to 800 telephone numbers or other telephone
numbers advertised or widely understood to be toll free. (3)
Nevertheless, certain interstate pay-per-call businesses are taking
advantage of an exception in the restriction on charging for
information conveyed during a call to a  `toll-free' number to
continue to engage in misleading practices. These practices are not in
compliance with the  intent of Congress in passing the Telephone
Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act. (4) It is necessary for
Congress to clarify that its intent  is that charges for information
provided during a call to an  800 number or other number widely
advertised and understood to be toll free shall not be assessed to the
calling party unless the calling party agrees to be billed according
to the terms of a written subscription agreement or by other
appropriate means. (b) Prevention of Unfair Billing Practices:  (1) In
general: Section 228(c) (47 U.S.C. 228(c)) is amended-- (A) by
striking out subparagraph (C) of paragraph (7) and inserting in lieu
thereof the following: `(C) the calling party being charged for
information conveyed during the call unless-- `(i) the calling party
has a written agreement (including an agreement transmitted through
electronic medium) that meets the requirements of paragraph (8); or
`(ii) the calling party is charged for the  information in accordance
with paragraph (9); or'; and (B) by adding at the end the following
new paragraphs: `(8) Subscription agreements for billing for
information provided via toll-free calls: `(A) In general: For
purposes of paragraph (7)(C), a written subscription does not meet the
requirements of this paragraph unless the agreement specifies the
material terms and conditions under which the information is offered
and includes-- `(i) the rate at which charges are assessed for the
information; `(ii) the information provider's name; `(iii) the
information provider's business address; `(iv) the information
provider's regular business telephone number; `(v) the information
provider's agreement to notify the subscriber of all future changes in
the rates charged for the information; and `(vi) the subscriber's
choice of payment method,  which may be by direct remit, debit,
prepaid account, phone bill or credit or calling card. `(B) Billing
arrangements: If a subscriber elects, pursuant to subparagraph
(A)(vi), to pay by means of a  phone bill-- `(i) the agreement shall
clearly explain that charges for the service will appear on the
subscriber's phone bill; `(ii) the phone bill shall include, in
prominent  type, the following disclaimer: `Common carriers may not
disconnect local or long distance telephone service for failure to pay
disputed charges for information services.'; and `(iii) the phone bill
shall clearly list the 800 number dialed. `(C) Use of pins to prevent
unauthorized use: A written agreement does not meet the requirements
of this paragraph unless it requires the subscriber to use a personal
identification number to obtain access to the information provided,
and includes instructions on its use. `(D) Exceptions: Notwithstanding
paragraph (7)(C), a written agreement that meets the requirements of
this paragraph is not required-- `(i) for calls utilizing
telecommunications devices for the deaf; `(ii) for services provided
pursuant to a tariff that has been approved or permitted to take
effect by the Commission or a State commission; or `(iii) for any
purchase of goods or of services that are not information services.
`(E) Termination of service: On receipt by a common carrier of a
complaint by any person that an information provider is in violation
of the provisions of this section, a carrier shall-- `(i) promptly
investigate the complaint; and `(ii) if the carrier reasonably
determines that the complaint is valid, it may terminate the provision
of service to an information provider unless the provider supplies
evidence of a written agreement that meets the requirements of this
section. `(F) Treatment of remedies: The remedies provided in this
paragraph are in addition to any other remedies that are available
under title V of this Act. `(9) Charges in absence of agreement: A
calling party is charged for a call in accordance with this paragraph
if the provider of the information conveyed during the call-- `(A)
clearly states to the calling party the total cost per minute of the
information provided during the call and for any other information or
service provided by the provider to which the calling party requests
connection during the call; and `(B) receives from the calling party--
`(i) an agreement to accept the charges for any information or
services provided by the provider during the call; and `(ii) a credit,
calling, or charge card number or verification of a prepaid account to
which such charges are to be billed. `(10) Definition: As used in
paragraphs (8) and (9), the term `calling card' means an identifying

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND MONETARY RELIEF

Plaintiff, Proactive Media, Inc. publishers of the electronic
business daily Multimedia Wire, by counsel state and allege the
following claims against Defendant, The Walt Disney Company.

Jurisdiction and Venue

      1. This is an action for the willful violation of federally
registered copyrights owned by Proactive Media, Inc. and
protected under the 1976 Copyright Act, as amended. 17 U.S.C. s
101 et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant
to Sections 1338(a) of the Judicial Code of the United States. 28
U.S.C. Section 1338(a). Venue is appropriate as provided by 28
U.S.C. Sec. 1391(b)(2).

Overview

      2. This suit alleges regular and premeditated copyright
infringement by representatives of Disney Interactive Software,
an unincorporated division of The Walt Disney Company. Upon
information and belief, a senior executive of Disney Interactive,
David Rech, instructed his secretary to copy each day's single
paid-for copy of MMWIRE and had unauthorized duplicates
distributed to Disney executives throughout Disney offices in the
U.S. and Canada. It is alleged that this was done to avoid paying
additional subscription fees. At the time the infringement was
revealed (by an anonymous caller from within Disney), the number
of Disney personnel receiving infringing copies was in the
dozens.

Parties

      1. Plaintiff ProActive Media, Inc. (hereafter "PMI") is now
at and at all times relevant to this suit, a corporation
organized under the laws of the state of Maryland with a
principal place of business at 5601 Grosvenor Road, Bethesda,
Maryland 20814. PMI is in the business of publishing a daily
electronic newsletter known as Multimedia Wire ("MMWIRE").

      2. Defendant, The Walt Disney Company, is an entertainment
company which, upon information and belief, is a corporation
organized under the laws of Delaware. It maintains its principal
place of business at 500 South Buena Vista Street, Buena Vista,
California 91521.

Background Facts

      3. MMWIRE is an electronic business daily published by PMI.

      4. Christopher V. Sherman is President and founder of PMI.

      5. MMWIRE is a daily newsletter, prepared for the time-
pressed business reader, and devoted to the burgeoning field of
electronic and interactive entertainment. MMWIRE has a special
focus on gaming, on-line entertainment and CD-ROM based
technologies.

      6. MMWIRE provides the business reader with information
concerning acquisitions, sales, mergers, strategic alliances,
technology collaborations and other news and analysis. Readers
value the publication as providing original reporting on
important industry developments and as a source for commentary
and analysis of developments affecting this volatile industry.

      7. PMI staff begin work on MMWIRE at about 9:00 A.M. on the
day preceding a publishing day. This work continues throughout
the day with staff gathering information and finishing the
edition each night between 11:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M. The product
is then transmitted to a service bureau for mass fax and e-mail
distribution to the hundreds of subscribers who pay for this
timely access to information.

      8. PMI staff gather data from a growing network of contacts
and professionals in the industry who regularly share information
with the company. In addition, staffers scan a wide array of
sources including news and wire services, press announcements,
industry specific news feeds, and other standard news sources.
The network of individual sources established by Mr. Sherman and
his staff is the direct result of years of interviews and related
personal contact efforts. The MMWIRE staff has access to this
pool of individuals and institutions because it regularly
exchanges and shares information. PMI deems these resources to be
one of the most valuable aspects of the company. The newsletter
reflects a personalized approach to the news by including the
names of specific industry contacts for each story as well as
phone numbers for these individuals. MMWIRE is an information
service providing news to readers which in most cases has a very
short "shelf-life." Delivery is made each day by 7:00 A.M.
Eastern Standard Time and MMWIRE is one of the first publications
its readers consult each morning. In many cases, the news MMWIRE
reports will become a topic of discussion on very day it is
released. In fact, on July , the established daily Variety
reported that a key development involving the Dreamworks
multimedia outfit was first publicly reported by MMWIRE. It is in
part because of the time-sensitive nature of what MMWIRE delivers
that makes it so important that the company protect the
exclusivity and short term value of the publication. MMWIRE
readers pay a fair, but sizeable, subscription fee of
approximately $500 per year to have timely access to the news and
analysis MWIRE offers.

      9. MMWIRE was launched by Chris Sherman out of his home in
June of 1994. He has worked hard to build the subscription base
since that time. The company was founded using his personal
savings and continues to grow. Expansion has been steady and
recently culminated in national recognition of the contributions
MMWIRE has made to understanding the business developments
affecting the gaming and interactive entertainment industries.
"Wired" magazine's June edition included an article touting
MMWIRE as "required" reading for key players in the multimedia
business.

The Infringement

     10. On June 12, 1995, MMWIRE editor Sherman was working in
the editorial offices preparing the next day's edition when he
received a phone call.

      11. The caller made no introduction and immediately asked
who they were speaking to. Sherman identified himself by name and
indicated he was the editor of MMWIRE.

      12. The caller asked whether he (Sherman) would "be
interested in infringement" at her employer, Disney Interactive.
The caller relayed that she was "sick" of what she saw as a
"double standard", and expressed annoyance at the fact that
Disney regularly pursues others for infringement when Disney
itself was copying MMWIRE. Mr. Sherman was impressed by the fact
that this caller was calm and very deliberative in her speech.
There was no hesitation or uncertainty; she seemed to know
precisely what she was doing in contacting PMI and advising it of
what she saw as improper and illegal conduct. In this call, she
asked if Sherman would like to see David Rech's distribution
list. Mr. Sherman knew Mr. Rech as a subscriber to MMWIRE and a
senior executive of Disney Interactive. Sherman said he would be
very interested and the caller asked for the PMI fax number. It
was provided and the conversation ended.

      13. A few moments later, the PMI fax machine began printing
out a fax, a copy of which is attached to this Complaint as
Exhibit A. Sherman presumed this fax was from the anonymous
caller who had just warned about "infringement". The fax
consisted of two pages, on the first was the following: "Chris:
This is a copy of the distribution list from David Rech to his
associates. This has been going on since last year and the list
of names has been growing ever since." The second page of the fax
was captioned " MMWIRE Distribution List" and consisted of the
names and locations of thirty-five (35) individuals who,
according to the anonymous caller and page two of the fax, were
receiving illegal copies of MMWIRE.

      14. Sherman was very upset at this because Disney was
believed to be a valued subscriber to MMWIRE, but pays for only
four legitimate subscriptions. As of the June 12th call,
ProActive records reflected Disney as having the following
subscriptions and for each is listed the subscriber contact, the
designated destination for the newsletter, the desired delivery
method (E-mail or facsimile) and the subscription commencement
date. Notably, Disney was aware it required separate
subscriptions to separate destinations as evidenced by its Hong
Kong affiliate subscription.

      15. In examining the June 12th fax, Sherman noted its
origin from Los Angeles, California (based upon the area code),
and the transmittal legend on the fax indicates "Accounting Buena
Vista, Inc."

      16. From Sherman's knowledge of the multimedia industry, he
knew that Disney operates Buena Vista, Inc. as one of its
divisions. He concluded that the fax, and likely the anonymous
call as well, originated from within the accounting department of
Buena Vista, Inc.

      17. On the same afternoon as he received the fax, Sherman
decided to call the number listed on the top of the second page
captioned "MMWIRE Distribution List." Under this header was the
invitation "To be added to distribution please contact Tammy
R[....][FN1] 8223 4375." Sherman sought to confirm that there
really was a "Tammy R[....]." One of the reasons he did this was
because he was so shocked at the size of the distribution and the
comments of the anonymous caller, he thought some hoax or
practical joke might be being played on him.

      18. Sherman concluded that the number listed for Ms.
R[....] on page two of the fax was an internal exchange number
because there was no dialing prefix and the number of digits was
not the usual seven or ten. Using industry directories, Sherman
located and called the main number at Walt Disney. He asked to
speak with Ms. Tammy R[....] and his call was transferred. The
person answering the phone was a young woman who identified
herself as Tammy R[....]. Ms. R.'s existence as a Disney employee
confirmed to Sherman that the fax was authentic and that it had
indeed come from within Disney. Sherman also noted that the voice
of Ms. R. was not the same as the anonymous caller who sent the
fax. After Ms. R. identified herself, Sherman became nervous
about the seriousness of this situation and promptly ended the
call.

      19. That same afternoon, Sherman consulted with counsel.

      20. After discussions with Disney representatives failed,
this suit was filed.

COUNT I: COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

      21. Plaintiff repeats, realleges and incorporates by
reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 22.
Plaintiff, PMI, has created the copyrighted publication MMWIRE
for the exclusive use of its authorized subscribers.

      22. Plaintiff PMI in compliance with the Copyright Act of
the United States (17 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) as applied for and
received from the United States Copyright Office a certificate of
registration for MMWIRE. A true copy of which is appended hereto
and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit B.

      23. Plaintiff PMI has also applied for registration (on a
nonexpedited basis) of other copies of its daily newsletter.
These are pending and in process at the Copyright Office.

      24. Plaintiff PMI is the sole and exclusive copyright
proprietor and owner of the entire right, title and interest in
and to PMI's MMWIRE publication and all forms of it.

      25. Upon information and belief, PMI alleges that Disney
has without a basis in law or contract made unauthorized copies
of copyrighted MMWIRE publications to avoid compensating PMI
fairly for this use. Specifically, the infringement includes (1)
making unauthorized copies, for distribution in its Los Angeles,
California offices, and (2) making unauthorized copies and
transmitting and displaying these copies by virtue of its daily
facsimile transmissions of the Los Angeles copy of MMWIRE to
Canada and the central and eastern United States. It is further
alleged that the act of faxing the work constitutes actionable
copying as well.

      26. At no time has PMI authorized Disney to copy, store,
reproduce, make daptations of MMWIRE or otherwise utilize MMWIRE
in any way other than that llowed under applicable copyright law.

      27. Plaintiff PMI is entitled to recover from Disney all
damage suffered as a result of Disney's wrongful and willful
infringement of its copyrights, although at this time ProActive
is unable to ascertain the complete extent of the copying and the
use of its publication. It is believed that discovery will
provide additional information confirming the scope of damage
suffered by PMI.

      28. PMI is entitled to recover, at its election, damages
from defendants including the maximum statutory damages allowable
under the Copyright Act for this willful infringement and in
addition, seeks compensation for all attorneys fees and costs
expended in this action.

COUNT II: BREACH OF CONTRACT

      29. PMI repeats, realleges and incorporates for reference
the allegation contained in paragraph 1-30.

      30. By the terms of the subscription agreement between PMI
and Disney, Disney was an authorized recipient of the precise
number of copies for which it had contracted for and paid. It was
never authorized to make any other uses of the copyrighted work
and all copyrights were and continue to be expressly reserved to
PMI.

      31. Disney breached the terms of its contract with PMI by
exceeding the scope of permissible use of MMWIRE.

      32. PMI has been damaged by this breach in an amount to be
determined at trial.

RELIEF

      33. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays for the
following relief:

      a. The Defendants, their officers, agents, servants,
employees and all persons acting under their joint and several
direction, control, permission, license or acting in concert or
participation with them be enjoined and restrained perpetually
from i) violating or inducing others to violate or contributing
to the violations of PMI's copyrighted MMWIRE publication; ii)
using, copying, reproducing, making adaptations of or diversions
from or alterations to the MMWIRE publication in a manner which
exceeds the permitted fair use afforded Disney under the 1976
Copyright Act 107. 35 U.S.C. 107; and

      b. That Plaintiff be granted all relief allowed under
504(B) of the Copyright Act; or

      c. The Plaintiff be granted all relief allowed under 504(c)
of the Copyright Act; and

      d. The Plaintiff be awarded all damages suffered by virtue
of Defendant's intentional breach of its subscription contract
with Plaintiff; and

      e. The Defendant's be ordered to account and pay over to
Plaintiff all gains, profits and advantage derived or realized by
them individually and collectively from their violations of
Plaintiff's copyrights and their wrongful conduct as alleged
herein; and

      f. This Court award the Plaintiff, and the Defendant's be
ordered to pay the full costs of this action, including
reasonable attorneys fees as provided in 505 of The Copyright
Act; and

      g. This Court enter judgment against Defendant's in the
form of a $2 million punitive and exemplary award to deter others
from engaging in such willful and intentional violation of the
intellectual property rights of others; and

      h. The Plaintiff have such other further and different
relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

Final Verification

      I solemnly affirm under the penalties of perjury that the
contents of the foregoing paper are true to the best of my
knowledge, information and belief.

Defendants.        :

     I.   INTRODUCTION

     1.   The Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of
themselves and the thousands of subscribers to the Cincinnati
Computer Connection electronic bulletin board system, in order to
redress the violation of their civil rights by Hamilton County
Sheriff Simon L. Leis, Jr. and the other Defendants.

     2.   On June 16, 1995, the Hamilton County Regional Computer
Task Force (the "Task Force") raided at least five electronic
bulletin board systems in the Cincinnati area, in a search for
allegedly obscene materials.

     3.   During these raids, the Task Force seized the entire
computer network comprising the Cincinnati Computer Connection
BBS, a computer bulletin board service with thousands of
subscribers in Southern Ohio, Northern Kentucky, and beyond.
Robert Emerson owns and operates the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS.  The target of the raid was some 45 computer
image files allegedly stored on the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS.  According to the search warrant, the Task Force
already had obtained copies of these image files from the
Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.

     4.  In pursuit of these 45 image files,  the Sheriff and
Task Force raided and seized the entire bulletin board system.
In the process, Sheriff Leis and his Task Force seized the
private electronic mail and communications of thousands of
entirely innocent subscribers, they shut down an active,
thriving, electronic community of average citizens, and they
denied thousands of people access to their friends, neighbors,
and business associates.

     5.   The named Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of
themselves and the thousands of subscribers to the Cincinnati
Computer Connection and all those whose electronic communications
were seized and intercepted during the raid, in order to remedy
this violation of their civil rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, the
Ohio Constitution, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986 (18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq. and 2701 et seq.) and Ohio common
law. 

II.  JURISDICTION

     6.   This action seeks to enforce rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States and is brought
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1985.  Jurisdiction is based upon
28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343(3). The substantive federal claims are
brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 and 1985, and 18 U.S.C. 2707
and 2520.  Declaratory relief is sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
2201-2202.  Authority to hear the pendent state claims is
conferred by the Court's supplemental jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. 1367. This action does not raise novel or complex issues
of state law, and the state law claims do not predominate over
the federal law claims.

     7.   Venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio,
Western Division, under 28 U.S.C. 1391(b), because at least one
Defendant resides in this District and Division and because a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the
claims occurred within this District and Division.

III.  PARTIES

A.      PLAINTIFFS

     8.   PLAINTIFF STEVEN GUEST is a thirty-six year old
resident of Clermont County, Ohio.  Mr. Guest is a computer
consultant who uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to
send and receive electronic communications, to conduct his
consulting business, to exchange files with his business
partners, to access shareware, and otherwise to engage in
expressive and associational activity.

     9.   PLAINTIFF DENISE KELLEY is a sixty-nine year old
resident of Hamilton County, Ohio.  She is employed by the
Hamilton County Department of Human Services as an investigation
coordinator and serves as the chief union steward for AFSCME
Local 1768.  Mrs. Kelley, mother of three and grandmother of
seven, uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS for political
discussion, to download shareware files, to play some games, to
send and receive electronic mail communications across the
Internet, to "chat" with users, to write stories in an on-line
conference, and otherwise to engage in expressive and
associational activity.

     10.  PLAINTIFF BEN S. KELLEY is Mrs. Kelley's husband, a
seventy-six year old retired machinist who resides in Hamilton
County, Ohio.  Mr. Kelley, father of three and grandfather of
seven, uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and
receive electronic communications, play games, to read the
discussions going on in various conferences, and otherwise to
engage in expressive and associational activity.            11.
PLAINTIFF NELDA STURGILL is a registered nurse in a local
hospital who resides in Hamilton County.  In her thirties, Ms.
Sturgill uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and
receive electronic communications across the Internet, to access
shareware programs, to keep abreast of information through the
use of the Usenet newsgroups, and otherwise to engage in
expressive and associational activity.  Ms. Sturgill particularly
participates in the health-related conferences newsgroups, and
has exchanged recipes and ideas with people from Australia,
England and the United States.

     12.  PLAINTIFF DEBORAH CUMMINGS is a resident of Kenton
County, Kentucky.  Ms. Cummings uses the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS to send and receive electronic communications, to
conduct her business, and to otherwise engage in expressive and
associational activity.

     13.  PLAINTIFF RANDY BOWLING is a resident of Butler County,
Ohio.  Mr. Bowling suffers from a head injury that makes speaking
very difficult. Mr. Bowling uses the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS to send and receive electronic communications, to
supplement his limited ability to speak, and to discuss his head
injury and therapy, and to engage in the majority of his
expressive and associational activity.  Mr. Bowling also uses the
Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to facilitate his current
study of computer systems.

     14.  PLAINTIFF RICHARD KRAMER is a retired insurance agent
who resides in Butler County, Ohio.  Mr. Kramer, who uses a
wheelchair, uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send
and receive electronic communications, to supplement his
sometimes restricted access to more traditional fora for
expressive and associational activity, to access file-management
and utility shareware, and to study computer systems.

     15.  Each named Plaintiff is a citizen of the United States.

     16.  At all times relevant herein, Plaintiffs were users of
the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.

     Class Action Allegations

     17.  The named Plaintiffs are proper representatives of a
class within the meaning of Rule 23(a) and 23(b) (3) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

     18.  The members of the class are so numerous that the
joinder of all of them is impractical.  Upon information and
belief, the class consists of at least several thousand persons.
The exact size of the class is unknown because the Defendants
have seized and failed to return the computer and/or documentary
records needed to determine the exact number and identity of the
class members.

     19.  The members of the class should be readily identifiable
from records seized by the Defendants.

     20.  There are questions of law and fact common to the
class; their class claims predominate over any individual claims.
Each class member shares the same federal and state
constitutional protections of their right to speak, publish and
associate.  Each class member shares the same federal and state
constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and
seizures.  Each class member shares the same federal and state
rights protecting the privacy of their electronic communications
and subscriber records.

     21.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the
claims of the class.  All class members suffered a similar
violation of their common rights when the Defendants seized and
shut down the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS, and, upon
information and belief, reviewed their private electronic
communications and subscriber records.  As alleged in greater
detail above, the Plaintiffs' uses of the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS typify the uses of the class members generally.

     22.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect
the interests of the class.  As of June 16, 1995, each named
Plaintiff was a user of the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel experienced in
litigating federal and state civil rights lawsuits, including
class actions, and who are familiar with the technology involved
and experienced in litigating computer communications cases.  The
representative Plaintiffs know of no conflict of interest among
class members.  Plaintiffs will vigorously prosecute this action.

     23.  The class consists of all persons who, on June 16,
1995, were users, subscribers, or customers of the Cincinnati
Computer Connection electronic bulletin board service, and all
persons whose private electronic communications were resident on
the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS when it was seized by the
Defendants, but not including the actual provider of that
electronic bulletin board service.

     24.  Plaintiffs do not propose class notice at this time,
but belief that class certification and notice can and should be
achieved promptly.

IV.  FACTS

A.   The Cincinnati Computer Connection Community.

     33.  On June 16, 1995, and for many years before that, the
Cincinnati Computer Connection ("CCC") was a thriving community.
The bulletin board system ("BBS") provided a forum for its users
to speak and publish privately and publicly, to debate, to
associate and recreate, and to exchange ideas and information.
On June 16, 1995, the faces of the CCC subscribers were the faces
of Greater Cincinnati -- working men and women, retirees,
mothers, fathers, grandparents and children, Republicans,
Democrats and Independents.  The CCC community even included
subscribers from around the United States and overseas.

     34.  Many of the subscribers to the CCC BBS have made
personal acquaintances through the bulletin board community.
Subscribers have held dinner get-togethers to meet personally, to
socialize, and to discuss matters of interest to the BBS
community.  These meetings were organized by using the BBS
itself.

     35.  On June 16, 1995, the CCC community included thousands
of users and subscribers.  Because the CCC computers and
subscriber records remain in the hands of the Defendants, the
exact number remains unknown.

     36.  At all relevant times, the CCC BBS affected and
operated in the stream of interstate commerce.

B.      The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.

     37.  Each user or subscriber to the CCC BBS selected a
private password, which secured the privacy of his or her
account.  The subscriber contacted the CCC BBS by using his or
her personal computer, a modem, and a phone line.  The user's
computer would call the CCC BBS over a phone line, and after
"logging in" by using the confidential password, the user was
given access to the CCC BBS.  Once connected to the BBS, the
subscriber could do a whole range of things, including:

        i.      Private electronic mail or "e-mail."

     38.  The CCC BBS provided subscribers the ability to send
and receive private electronic communications, typically known as
e-mail.  A subscriber could compose private electronic messages
either before "logging on" to the CCC, or while connected to the
bulletin board system.  Just like First Class mail, e-mail
messages are addressed to a specific person, and are
confidential.

  
     39.  E-mail was sent and received in two manners on the CCC
BBS.  E-mail exchanged between persons who had accounts on the
CCC BBS was sent within the many conference areas on the BBS (see
below).  If the sender designated a conference message
"confidential," the message remained inaccessible to any user
except the designated recipient.  The CCC BBS also provided an
"Internet mail gateway."  This feature allowed subscribers to
send and receive confidential electronic communications from
persons who did not have an account on the CCC BBS, but who had
an Internet address.  This Internet mail gateway allowed the
users of the CCC BBS to send confidential electronic
communications to, and receive them from, tens of millions of
persons around the world.

     40.  This e-mail was not readily accessible to the public.
The users of the CCC BBS, and those who sent electronic mail to
the CCC BBS from the Internet, had a reasonable expectation of
privacy in those communications.

     41.  When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the
CCC BBS, they seized all of the private electronic communications
contained on the system, and cut off the subscribers' ability to
send and receive e-mail.

        ii.     Conference areas.

     42.  In addition to e-mail, the Cincinnati Computer
Connection provided its subscribers access to thousands of
"conferences."  These conferences, like the sections of a
library, are the main organizational units of the BBS.  Each
conference area had a name and a topic.  For example, the CCC BBS
had conference areas dedicated to writers, game players, and
computer professionals.  When a subscriber accessed the bulletin
board system, he or she could "enter" an conference area.  Once
in a conference area, the subscriber could read all the public
messages posted by other visitors to the conference, post public
reply messages or begin new public discussions on new topics.
The user could also send and receive private electronic
communications within the conference.  The CCC BBS provided
literally thousands of conferences for its users, including:

                a.      Local conference areas.

     43.  These conferences were unique to the CCC BBS, and
included discussions and debates on topics ranging from local and
national politics to sports and computers.  These conferences
were the heart of the local CCC community interaction.

                b.      Private local conference areas.

     44.  The CCC BBS also provided conference areas that were
restricted to particular users.  These restricted conference
areas were used by subscribers for confidential business
purposes, including exchanging confidential information.

                c.      BBS network conferences.

     45.  On June 16, 1995, the CCC BBS also provided to its
users "feeds" from networks of similar dial-up bulletin board
systems.  These networks provided dozens of additional conference
areas, and allowed the users of the CCC BBS to engage in
discussion on topics with users of a whole network of BBSs beyond
the subscribers to the CCC BBS.

                d.      Usenet newsgroups.

     46.  The CCC BBS also received, via satellite feed,
thousands of additional conferences from an Internet network
known as Usenet.  Usenet is essentially a  bulletin board system
for the Internet.  Usenet is organized into thousands of separate
"newsgroups" where people from all around the world can engage in
discussion and debate on a huge variety of topics, ranging from
computer science, philosophy, and law to pop music.  The CCC
subscribers could read and participate in these newsgroups.

     47.  When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the
CCC BBS, they seized all of the contents of all of these
thousands of conference areas, and denied the subscribers to the
CCC any access to the conferences.

        iii.    Live "chat."

     48.  The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS also featured
live chat "channels."  Similar to CB radio channels, the "chat"
function allowed subscribers to converse in "real time" with
other subscribers who were logged into the BBS.  One subscriber
could invite another person to chat, and the two subscribers
could exchange confidential messages by typing them in sequence
to each other.

     49.  When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the
CCC BBS, they shut down any chat taking place on the board and
seized any captured chat file sessions.

        iv.     Games.

     50.  The game areas on the CCC were very popular.
Subscribers could play a variety of on-line games against the
computer or against other subscribers.   Some "games" were more
like interactive creative writing, with different users of the
BBS taking on personas and interacting with each other in a
fictional world.

     51.  The Defendants' seizure of the bulletin board system of
course included seizure of all the games, and cut off the
subscribers' access to the games.

        v.      File transfer.

     52.  The CCC BBS offered its subscribers the ability to
"upload" computer files from their home computer to the bulletin
board system, and to "download" computer files from the bulletin
board to their home computers.  Computer files can consist of
anything from computer programs and other software, to the text
of written material (such as this Complaint), to picture files
and sound files.  The CCC BBS had an enormous library of computer
files for its users to access and use.  The Defendants seized
this entire library of thousands of computer files when they
seized the 45 allegedly obscene images they were after.

        vi.     The restricted adult file area.

     53.  Among the thousands of conferences on the CCC, there
was a single conference area dedicated to adult-oriented computer
image files.  Access to this area was extremely limited.  In
order to gain access to this conference, a subscriber was
required to verify his age and identity in person to the CCC
system operator, Mr. Emerson.  After verifying the subscriber's
age, Emerson would configure that user's account to give that
subscriber access to the adult file area.  Only after a
subscriber's age and identity was verified, and the subscriber's
account given access to the adult file area, would the existence
of the adult file area even appear on the user's screen when
logged in to the CCC.  The "menu" of choices available to a
subscriber who had not been verified and given access would not
even show that an adult file area existed.

     54.  Even for those with access to the restricted adult file
area, the adult image files could not be viewed "on-line."  In
order to view a file, a subscriber with access would have to log
onto the BBS, enter the restricted adult area, designate a file
for downloading, download that file to the user's home computer,
log off the system, and then run a separate computer  program on
the home computer that interprets the image and displays it on
the user's home computer screen.

     55.  The restricted adult file area comprised a very small
percentage of the material on the CCC BBS -- no more than 3%, and
upon information and belief far less than that.  The number of
users with access to this area was also very small -- no more
than 3% of the subscribers, and upon information and belief far
less than that.  Many, if not most, of the CCC subscribers had no
idea that an adult file area even existed.

     56.  Compared to the Cincinnati Computer Connection as a
whole, the adult file area was like a tiny, locked, and largely
unknown private room within a huge, bustling convention center.

C.   Defendants Obtain A Search Warrant And Go Trolling for   
Computer Porn.

     57.  On or about June 15, 1995, the Defendants applied to
the Municipal Court of Clermont Count for a search warrant for
the premises containing the CCC BBS computers.  Municipal Court
Judge James A. Shriver signed the search warrant at 11:30 p.m.
that evening.  Upon information and belief, Judge Shriver had
never reviewed an application for the search or for the seizure
of an electronic communication system such as the CCC BBS, and
had never issued a search warrant for such a system.  The search
warrant itself listed 45 particular image files, by name and
description, that were the target of the search.

     58.  The Defendants obtained an order sealing from public
scrutiny the search warrant affidavit that allegedly justified
their application for the search warrant.  Plaintiffs have not
obtained a copy of the affidavit or affidavits that allegedly
supported the search warrant.  However, upon information and
belief, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants failed to inform
Judge Shriver of the following material facts:  (1) that the CCC
BBS was a forum for protected speech, publication and
association, and that the Defendants intended to shut down that
forum and seize all the publications contained on that forum; (2)
that the CCC BBS contained thousands of private electronic
communications to and from the subscribers of the CCC BBS, and
that the Defendants intended to shut down that communication
system, and seize, intercept and read these private
communications; (3) that the electronic communications Defendants
sought were protected by federal and state law from interception,
seizure and disclosure; and (4) that the Defendants had no
probable cause to believe that these private communications of
the thousands of subscribers to the CCC BBS were relevant to any
investigation of any alleged criminal activity.

D.   Defendants Shut Down the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS
and Indiscriminately Seize Everything On It.

     59.  On June 16, 1995, purportedly acting under the
authority of the search warrant signed by Judge Shriver, the
Defendants seized the entire CCC BBS.  The Defendants made no
effort to limit their seizure to materials or information related
to the alleged offense under investigation; rather, they seized
the entire system, shutting it down completely.  If not for a
significant personal financial commitment by Mr. Emerson after
the raid, the CCC BBS would have been permanently shut down.

     60.  As of the date of this filing, the Defendants have made
no effort to return to the Plaintiffs or any other user of the
CCC BBS their private electronic communications, or to assure
that such communications reach their intended recipients.  Upon
information and belief, the Defendants have already, or have
every intention to, read the private electronic communications of
the CCC BBS subscribers.

     61.  The Defendants made no effort to limit the scope of
their seizure. Prior to the raid, the Defendants knew the exact
file names of the computer image files they were searching for.
In fact, the Defendants had already obtained those files prior to
the raid.  The Defendants consciously chose not to use means at
their disposal that would have allowed for a limited search and
seizure of evidence relevant to the alleged offense.  The
Defendants consciously refused to use narrower means of obtaining
their investigative objectives that would have protected the
privacy of the subscribers' communications and the integrity of
their forum.

     62.  The Defendants knew, or should have known, that the CCC
BBS was a forum for protected speech, publication and
communication.  The Defendants knew, or should have known, that
the CCC BBS contained materials being published electronically
that were protected by the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.  The Defendants knew, or
should have known, that the  BBS contained the private electronic
communications of its users, and that such communications were
not readily accessible to the public.  The Defendants knew, or
should have known, that the users of the CCC BBS had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their electronic communications.

     63.  Reasonable law enforcement officers in the position of
the Defendants, with the information available to the Defendants,
would have known that the CCC BBS was a forum for speech,
publication and communication protected by the First Amendment
and the Ohio Constitution, and that the electronic communications
on the CCC BBS were protected by the Fourth Amendment, the Ohio
Constitution and federal statutory law from search and seizure
and interception unless the officers had probable cause to
believe that those communications were relevant to the law
enforcement inquiry.

V.   FIRST CLAIM -   FIRST AMENDMENT
     (FREEDOM OF SPEECH, PRESS, AND ASSOCIATION)

     64.  The allegations in paragraphs 1-63 are incorporated
herein by reference.

     65.  At all relevant times, the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS published, in electronic form, magazines,
periodicals, non-fiction, fiction, images and other materials
protected by the First Amendment.

     66.  The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS was a forum for
speech, publication and association protected by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.

     67.  The Plaintiffs and the class members at all relevant
times used the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to exercise
their constitutional rights to speak, publish and associate.

     68.  The Defendants' search, seizure, and retention of the
Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS, and the materials contained
on the BBS, violated the Plaintiffs' and class members' clearly
established constitutional rights to speak, publish and
associate.

     69.  The Defendants' seizure and retention of computer
hardware and software used by Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS
constituted a prior restraint on the Plaintiffs' constitutional
rights of freedom of speech, of the press, and of association.

     70.  Defendants knew or reasonably should have known that
their conduct violated the Plaintiffs' and the class members'
clearly established First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,
freedom of the press, and freedom of association.

     71.  Defendants acted with intent to violate, or with
reckless indifference to, the Plaintiffs and class members'
clearly established First Amendment rights to freedom of speech,
freedom of the press, and freedom of association.

     72.  At all relevant times, Defendants were acting under
color of state law.

     73.  The Defendants' actions have caused the Plaintiffs and
class members a real and palpable fear that their future
electronic communications will be seized and reviewed by law
enforcement agents, without justification or excuse.  As a
result, the Plaintiffs and class members have suffered a distinct
and actual diminution of their willingness to speak, publish and
associate freely and openly without fear of government intrusion
and reprisal.

     74.  As a direct result of Defendants' conduct, the
Plaintiffs and class members have suffered a distinct and actual
restriction on their freedom of speech, press and association.

     75.  As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the
Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages, attorneys' fees, and
costs.

VI.  SECOND CLAIM - OHIO CONSTITUTION ARTICLE I, SECTION 11   
(FREEDOM TO SPEAK, WRITE, PUBLISH, AND ASSOCIATE)

     76.  The allegations in paragraphs 1-75 are incorporated
herein by reference.

     77.  In the same manner that the Defendants' actions

and class members' clearly established right to speak, write,
publish, and associate guaranteed by Article I, Section 11 of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio.

     78.  The Defendants' actions have caused the Plaintiffs and
class members a real and palpable fear that their future
electronic communications and publications will be seized and
reviewed by law enforcement agents, without justification or
excuse.  As a result, the Plaintiffs and class members have
suffered a distinct and actual diminution of their willingness to
speak, publish and associate freely and openly without fear of
government intrusion and reprisal.

     79.  As a direct result of Defendants' conduct, the
Plaintiffs and class members have suffered a distinct and actual
restriction on their freedom of speech, press and association.

     80.  As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the
Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages, attorneys' fees, and
costs.

VII. THIRD CLAIM - FOURTH AMENDMENT
     (FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES)

     81.  The allegations in paragraphs 1-80 are incorporated
herein by reference.

     82.  The Plaintiffs and class members had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their private electronic communications
and subscriber records resident on the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS.

     83.  The Defendants' actions violated the Plaintiffs' and
class members' clearly established right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution and 42 U.S.C. 1983.

     84.  The search and seizure at the location of the
Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS was a illegal and unwarranted
general search.

     85.  The search and seizure of the Cincinnati Computer
Connection BBS was not authorized by a valid warrant particularly
describing the place to be searched and the things to be seized.

     86.  The search warrant did not authorize the seizure of the
Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS or any of its contents,
including the Plaintiffs' and class members' private electronic
communications and subscriber records.

     87.  The search warrant failed to establish probable cause
to believe that any of the Plaintiffs' or the class members'
private electronic communications was relevant to a legitimate
law enforcement inquiry.

     88.  The search warrant failed to establish probable cause
to believe that the Plaintiffs' and class members' private
electronic communications contained evidence of the offense
listed in the search warrant, or any offense, for that matter.

     89.  The Defendants knew, or reasonably should have known,
that their conduct violated the Plaintiffs' and class members'
clearly established constitutional right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures.

     90.  The Defendants acted with intent to violate, or with
reckless indifference to, the Plaintiffs' and class members'
clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.

     91.  At all times relevant herein, Defendants were acting
under color of state law.

     92.  As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the
Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages, attorneys' fees, and

(FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES)

     93.  The allegations in paragraphs 1-92 are incorporated
herein by reference.

     94.  In the same manner that the Defendants' actions

Fourth Amendment, the Defendants' acts violated the Plaintiffs'
and class members' clearly established right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by Article I,
Section 11 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.

     95.  As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND


     Now comes plaintiff, Bob Emerson, d/b/a Cincinnati
Computer Connection who for its complaint against
defendants, states as follows:

                    PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

     1.   This is an action under the laws and Constitution
of the United States alleging that state law enforcement
officials from various jurisdictions in Southwest Ohio and
Northern Kentucky acting in concert as part of a "Regional
Computer Crimes Task Force," unlawfully and
unconstitutionally seized computer equipment, files, and
communications in furtherance of a campaign to impose a
prior restraint on the computer transmission of non-obscene
adult oriented forms of expression presumptively protected
by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

                        JURISDICTION

     2.   Jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by 18
U.S.C. Section 2707, 28 U.S.C. Section 1331, 28 U.S.C. Section
1343, 28 U.S.C. Section 2201, 28 U.S.C. Section 2202, 42 U.S.C.
Section 1983, 42 U.S.C. Section 1985, 42 U.S.C Section 1988,
and 42 U.S.C. Section 2000aa.

     3.   This is a suit authorized by law to redress
deprivations under color of state law of rights, privileges,
and immunities secured by the First, Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution, the First
Amendment Privacy Protection Act, and Title II of the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act.

     4.   Venue in this Court is appropriate as the various
acts complained of occurred within the Western Division of
the Southern District of Ohio.

                           PARTIES

     5.   Plaintiff Bob Emerson, an individual who resides

information stored on the bulletin board itself.

     17.  Plaintiff has been operating CCC since 1982 and
has developed a list of monthly subscribers numbering in the
thousands, who pay a set fee for access to the bulletin
board.  CCC offers its subscribers the ability to send and
receive electronic mail (hereinafter "e-mail"), to
participate in on-line discussion groups, to utilize and
download software, to engage in computer games, and to
receive newspapers and periodicals of general as well as
highly specialized interest.  Included among the various
information and service options offered to subscribers of
CCC is non-obscene adult oriented material.  This category
of material represents approximately three (3) percent of
the total informational material and resources offered by
CCC to its subscribers.  Access to the non-obscene adult
oriented material on the CCC bulletin board is restricted to
a limited number of adult subscribers who requested such access.

     18.  Commencing sometime prior to June 16, 1995,
defendants, under color of state law and pursuant to and in
their official capacities for and on behalf of their
respective jurisdictions, conspired together and with others
unknown, and therefore not named as defendants, to violate
plaintiff's rights and privileges guaranteed to him by the
First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States
Constitution, the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act,
and Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act by
designing and implementing a campaign characterized by
harassment, express and implied threats of criminal
prosecution, and mass seizures of computer equipment and
information.  This campaign was initiated by defendants for
the purpose of causing plaintiff, and others, to cease
transmitting and/or receiving non-obscene adult oriented
material via computer technology.

     19.  Sometime on or about June 16, 1995, pursuant to
and part of this campaign, defendants, under color of state
law, sought a search warrant authorizing the search of all
computer equipment and accessories necessary for the
operation of CCC and authorizing the wholesale and
indiscriminate review of all computer electronic
communications transmitted to and from plaintiff and CCC's
subscribers including, but not limited to, e-mail and
personal correspondence that was stored in or exchanged in
electronic form by means of CCC's equipment and software.
At the time defendants made application for the
aforementioned search warrant, defendants knew or should
have known that no reasonable grounds existed to believe
that the contents of the e-mail and personal correspondence
sought were relevant or material to any on-going criminal
investigation.

     20.  On June 16, 1995, pursuant to and part of this
campaign, defendants, under color of state law, obtained and
executed a search warrant providing for the search of
plaintiff's personal residence for all computer equipment
and accessories necessary for the operation of CCC as well
as for all electronic communications transmitted to and from
CCC's subscribers including, but not limited to, e-mail and
personal correspondence that was stored in or exchanged in
electronic form by means of CCC's equipment and software. 

     21.   As a further part of this campaign, following the
execution of the aforementioned search warrant, defendants
seized and physically removed from plaintiff's residence
virtually the entire inventory of computer equipment and
accessories owned by plaintiff and necessary for the
operation of CCC.  Included among the numerous equipment and
accessories seized by defendants were computer hardware,
video display units, printers, software, data drives, and
internal or external information storage units.  As a
consequence of defendants' actions in removing the
aforementioned computer equipment and accessories,
defendants necessarily seized information transmitted to and
from CCC and its subscribers, including, but not limited to,
e-mail and correspondence stored or exchanged in electronic
form.  As a further consequence of these actions defendants
seized plaintiff's entire inventory of non-obscene adult
related material as well as all other forms of expressive
material.

     22.  At the time defendants sought, obtained, and
executed the aforementioned search warrant and seized all of
the computer equipment and accessories related to the
operation of CCC, as well as much of the information
provided by CCC to its subscribers which was contained in
such equipment, defendants knew or should have known:

i.   that items seized included work product and
documentary material containing mental
impressions, conclusions or theories of
individuals who authored or created such
materials for the purpose of disseminating
same to the public;

ii.  that the information seized included e-mail
and personal correspondence transmitted to
and from plaintiff and CCC's subscribers;

iii. that the information seized included
expressive material protected under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
States Constitution that cannot be seized
without a prior judicial determination of
probable obscenity;

iv.  that the mass seizure of this computer
equipment and information would have a
devastating impact on the plaintiff's
business;

v.   that the mass seizure of this computer
equipment and information would prevent
plaintiff from transmitting any information,
including expressive material protected under
the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution;

vi.  that the search warrant under which authority
defendants ostensibly based their actions did
not by its terms authorize the seizure of any
materials or information;

vii. that there were less intrusive means of
obtaining the information defendants sought
to inspect for potential violations of state
law, and that such means, if utilized, would
have permitted  plaintiff to continue to use
and derive the economic benefit of his
computer equipment;

viii.  that there were less intrusive means of
obtaining the information defendants
sought to inspect for potential
violations of state law, and that such
means, if utilized, would have permitted
plaintiff to continue to receive and
transmit constitutionally protected
speech;

ix.  that there were less intrusive means of
obtaining the information defendants sought
to inspect for potential violations of state
law, and that such means, if utilized, would
have preserved the privacy interests of
plaintiff and his subscribers in the e-mail
and personal correspondence that was stored
in or exchanged in electronic form via CCC's
equipment and software; and

x.   that it was not necessary to physically seize
and remove the information sought or any of
the computer equipment owned by plaintiff
because defendants at all times were capable
of retrieving or "downloading" information
exchanged or stored in plaintiff's computer
equipment and by such means preserving said
information for any legitimate law
enforcement purpose determined by defendants.

     23.  Defendants' activities were conducted
purposefully, in bad faith, in conscious and reckless
disregard of plaintiff's federal and constitutional rights
to privacy, to free speech, and to be free from unreasonable
searches and seizures, and with the intention to intimidate
plaintiff from his continued exercise of free expression and
to impose a prior restraint on the transmission of
presumptively protected forms of expression by plaintiff and
others by permanently removing from circulation non-obscene
adult oriented and other forms of expression and by
physically removing and retaining the computer equipment and
software by which computer-generated forms of expression are
transmitted.

     24.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants'
actions, as previously described, plaintiff has suffered and
will continue to suffer damage to his business and
professional reputation in the following regards:

i.   plaintiff has lost the use of computer
equipment valued at approximately $45,000.00;

ii.  plaintiff has been forced to replace computer
equipment at the cost of approximately
$45,000.00;

iii.  plaintiff has lost revenue from subscribers
in the amount of approximately $28,000.00 per
month;

iv.  plaintiff has suffered a temporary and
permanent loss of a portion of his subscriber
base;

v.   plaintiff has lost good will associated with
the operation of a legitimate and lawful
computer service; and

vi.  plaintiff has been prevented from
transmitting presumptively protected material
to his subscribers.

     25.  Further, unless defendants are preliminarily and
permanently enjoined from continuing to engage in a campaign
to intimidate plaintiff, to chill the exercise of his
constitutional rights, and to impose a prior restraint upon
the distribution of presumptively protected forms of
expression, plaintiff will continue to suffer violations of
his constitutional rights, thereby incurring irreparable
injury for which plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.

Petitioners,

V.

AMERICA ONLINE, INC., a foreign corporation
doing business in Illinois,

Respondent.

Return Date: September 26, 1995


NO. 95L 013509

CALENDAR  B

DISCOVERY
VERIFIED PETITION FOR DISCOVERY

Petitioners, ARNOLD B. BOWKER ("Bowker"), JOHN A. JOSLIN ("Joslin"),
and the CARIB INN (collectively, "Petitioners"), through their
attorneys, Levin & Funkhouser, Ltd., pursuant to Illinois Supreme
Court Rule 224, and for their Verified Petition For Discovery (the
"Petition") to Respondent, AMERICA ONLINE, INC., a foreign corporation
doing business in Illinois ("AOL"), state as follows: 

INTRODUCTION

1.   This is an action for discovery before suit to identify
responsible persons and entities.  The Petitioners intend to file a
suit, sounding in defamation and false light invasion of privacy,
against the persons and/or entities responsible for the origination
and dissemination of statements through the use of AOL's subscriber
services, electronic bulletin boards and electronic mail, which
statements falsely impute negligent or criminal actions and other
misconduct to the Petitioners. 

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2.   Petitioners Bowker and Joslin are United States citizens and
current residents of Bonaire, Netherlands-Antilles.  Bowker operates
the Carib Inn, a tropical resort and scuba diving facility (the "Inn")
located in Bonaire.  Joslin is a scuba diving instructor for the Inn. 

3.   The Inn attracts hundreds of guests and divers from the Midwest
because of its superb reputation for scuba diving and hospitality, by
maintaining a good relationship with Illinois scuba diving shops,
placing advertisements in nationally distributed scuba diving and
resort magazines, and through the posting of messages by the Inn and
its patrons on various electronic bulletin boards on the Internet. 
The Inn also has a three-page advertisement placed on the Internet
through the World Wide Web. Approximately 6-10% of the Inn's guests
and divers over the past year originated from the state of Illinois. 

4.   On information and belief, AOL is a Delaware corporation doing
business in Illinois.  On information and belief, AOL sells
subscriptions and/or memberships to computer users who shop and
interact with other computer users, including residents of Illinois,
through AOL's electronic bulletin boards on the Internet. 

5.   On information and belief, AOL maintains a membership list and
can otherwiseidentify current and past subscribers who utilized its
services to post individual messages on its bulletin boards.  In
addition, on information and belief, AOL maintains payment records for
its subscribers and members to further identify those who have used
its services. 

6.   Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court
Rule 224(a)(ii) as this is a Court in which the action or proceeding
might be brought, as well as a county in which the Respondent from
whom discovery is sought transacts business. 

BACKGROUND FACTS

7.   On or about June 3, 1995, an unknown subscriber or member of AOL
(or someone utilizing that person's subscription or membership) posted
at least one defamatory and libelous statement on AOL's electronic
bulletin board devoted to scuba diving, accusing Petitioners of
various unsafe business practices and commission of a crime. (A copy
of the original posting is attached hereto as Exhibit A.) The AOL
subscriber's charges of misconduct and unsafe business practices, were
false, malicious and made with the intent to injure Petitioners'
reputations and rights of privacy, including among other things, the
loss of business opportunities and emotional distress. 

8.   On July 30, 1995, Bowker and Joslin became aware of the libelous
statements through correspondence from a frequent patron of the Inn
who had read the message that had been posted on AOL's bulletin board.
 On several occasions, Bowker has corresponded with the party(s) who
allegedly posted the original message in order to secure a retraction
and to refute the false and libelous allegations.  To date, however,
Petitioners have been unable to ascertain the identity of the AOL
subscriber(s) or member(s) who transmitted the original and subsequent
messages in order to halt such activities and sue for damages. 

9.   The messages posted on AOL's scuba diving bulletin board are
accessible from every state in the United States, and the defwnatory
message has been accessed in Illinois. It is unknown at this time, how
many citizens of this State have read the posted material or
corresponded through electronic mail with the unknown subscfiber(s) or
member(s) of AOL and decided not to come to the Inn because of the
malicious and false accusations that were made. 

10.  Petitioners seek discovery from AOL, requesting AOL to produce
complete copies or printouts of computer screens and other documents
revealing subscriber information, applications for membership and
payment records which could enable Petitioners to identify and locate
those individuals and/or entities responsible for the posting of the
defamatory material and other messages on AOL's bulletin boards or in
electronic mail. 

WHEREFORE, Petitioners, Arnold B. Bowker, John A. Joslin, and the
Carib Inn, pray that this Court enter an order compelling the
discovery requested herein from Respondent, America Online, Inc. 

Respectfully submitted,

EXHIBIT

From: Jenny TRR

My husband and I visited the Carib Inn last month.  Since I'm a little
new at diving needless to say diving with a stoned instructor was a
little scarry. We left after three days and went to Sand Dollar. I
won't mention his name but he's the only white instructor there.  Sand
Dollar was super nice.

            IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                    June 30, 1995

maximize user control over the information received by
individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet and
other interactive computer services;

  `(4) remove disincentives for the development and

and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment
by means of computer.

  `(c) Protection for `Good Samaritan' Blocking and Screening of
Offensive Material: No provider or user of interactive computer
services shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any
information provided by an information content provider. No
provider or user of interactive computer services shall be held
liable on account of--

restrict access to material that the provider or user
considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy,
excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable,
whether or not such material is constitutionally protected;

content providers or others the technical means to restrict
access to material described in paragraph (1).

Case No. 971047

"CLASS ACTION" COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, DECEIT, TO ENJOIN
UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND RESTITUTION



Comes now Stephen Hagen individually, as a private attorney
general, and on behalf of all other similarly situated persons,
alleging:

1) Stephen E. Hagen is an individual residing in the City of Palo
Alto, County of Santa Clara, State of California.

2) Defendant America Online, Inc. is, and at all times herein
mentioned was, a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and doing business in the State of
California.

3) The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
partnership, associate or otherwise of Defendant sued herein as
DOES 1 through and including 20, are unknown to Plaintiff, who
therefore sues said Defendants by such fictitious names. Plaintiff
will amend this Complaint to show the true names and capacities of
said Defendants when the same  have been ascertained. Plaintiff is
informed and believes and on such basis alleges, that each of such
fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for
the occurrences herein alleged, negligently or otherwise, in that
Plaintiff's damages herein alleged were proximately caused by
them.

4) Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on such basis alleges,
that at all times herein mentioned, each of the Defendants was,
and now is, the agent, servant, employee, and/or other
representative of each of the remaining Defendants, and in doing
the things herein alleged, were acting in the scope, purpose and
authority of such agency, service, employment, and/or other
representative capacity with the permission, knowledge, consent
and ratification of each of the remaining Defendants acts. Any
reference hereinafter to "Defendants", without further
qualification, is meant by Plaintiff to refer to each Defendant
named above including the DOE Defendants.

CLASS ALLEGATIONS

5) This action is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 382 on behalf of the class. The class is composed of all
present customers within the United States of the on-line services
provided by Defendants, and all past customers within the United
States of the on-line services provided by Defendants, who have
been damaged by the actions of Defendants as hereinafter alleged.
Each class member has or had an account with America Online, and
has been a member of America Online at some time during the four
years preceding the filing of this Complaint and has accessed the
system and been improperly billed for additional time and/or
charges as result of Defendants' practices described herein.

6) This class is so numerous that joiner of all member would be
impracticable. The factual question of whether America Online
breached the contract with its members, misrepresented to members
the manner in which they would be billed for the use of
Defendants' services, the accuracy and completeness of the
information provided to a member regarding the services and
charges for services, and the nature and extend of the Defendants'
unfair business practices with regard to billing of members are
common to the class. Also common to the class are the legal issues
of whether or not Defendants' billing practices constitute a
breach of contract, whether America Online, in its standardized
written and/or on-line material misrepresented or improperly
disclosed the manner is which a member would be billed for the
time he or she used the AOL Service and whether the Defendants'
conduct and practices violate the Unfair Trade Practices Act,
Business & Professions Code Section 17200, et seg. and laws
related to unfair business practices.

7) The claims of the named Plaintiff are typical of the claims of
all class members, all of whom who have been subjected to
Defendant's business practices. The named Plaintiff is a
representative party who will fairly and adequately protect the
interest of the class by vigorously litigating this suit through
attorneys who are skilled and experienced in class action,
consumer protection and unlawful business practice litigation.

8) Questions of law and fact, as to all member of the class,
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,
and a class action is superior to any other method for the fair
and efficient adjudication of this controversy.

FACTS

9) The America Online Service ("AOL Service") operated by America
Online, Inc ("AOL") is a computer on-line interactive information,
communication and transaction service.

10) In order to become a member and use the AOL Service, a
prospective customer must use a personal computer, together with
software provided by AOL ("AOL Software") and a modem or similar
communications device to dial and connect to the AOL Service using
telephone lines. The sequence and requirements of the procedures
presented on-screen, the process and requirements for transferring
between different areas of the AOL Service, and the information
available to a user during any on-line session, are determined by
the AOL Software.

11) The AOL Software is available in versions which are compatible
with popular personal computer operating systems, including
Microsoft DOS and Windows and Apple Macintosh. Regardless of the
type of operating system, the text information and time
information presented on-screen by a computer using the
appropriate version of the AOL software is identical in all
material respects.

12) A new user must complete an initial registration process, in
which the prospective member provides certain information
(including account billing and credit card information) to the AOL
Service. This information must be provided before the prospective
customer may review the terms and conditions of use and membership
of the AOL Service ("T & C").

13) After providing the necessary information, the user is offered
the opportunity to accept the T & C by selecting the appropriate
"button" presented on the computer screen. The actual T & C are
not presented in the normal course of the registration process.
However, the user is permitted to review the T & C immediately
prior to accepting them, if he or she so desires.

14) A customer declining the T & C must terminate the registration
process, and cannot complete the sign-up process. Upon accepting
the T & C, a new member may continue with the on-line session
following the initial registration process. In future sessions,
the member is required by the AOL Software and the AOL Service to
complete only a simplified sign-on procedure. A copy of the T & C
as of July 13, 1995 is attached as Exhibit A.

15) A member who has connected to the AOL Service using the AOL
Software can access and view additional information relating to
the T & C and billing / member account status during an on-line
session (the "Online Information"). A member can view the Online
Information only after selecting from one or more menus and/or one
or more files provided by the AOL Software and/or the AOL Service.
The Online Information includes the current T & C, charges and
billing information, and elapsed time for the on-line session.

16) The AOL Software also provides access to an on-screen window
which displays information about the elapsed time of an ongoing
session ("Online Clock"). The Online Clock can be viewed during an
on-line session by selecting the appropriate file from an
on-screen menu. The Online Clock indicates the current time (in
hours, minutes, and seconds). The Online Clock also indicates the
duration of the current on-line session, in the following manner:

a. Immediately after the on-line session has started, the Online
Clock indicates "You have been on-line for less than one minute."

b. After one minute has passed following the start of the on-line
session, the message indicates "You have been on-line for 1
minutes (sic)."

c. After an additional minute has passed from the start of the
on-line session, the message then indicates "You have been on-line
for 2 minutes."

A copy of the screen image of the Online Clock is attached as
Exhibit B.

This manner used by the AOL Software in presenting elapsed time
information is the same for longer intervals, such that the time
presented is always the number of whole minute which have elapsed,
excluding any seconds.

17) At the end of each on-line session using the AOL Service, a
message ("Ending Message") is presented indicating that "Your time
for this session was _____", and stating the time of the session
in hours, minutes, and seconds. A true and accurate copy of the
screen image of the Ending Message is attached hereto as Exhibit
C.

18) A monthly bill for the AOL Service is charged to each member's
credit card account. The charge for membership in the AOL Service
is based on a standard monthly billing rate, which entitles the
member to use the AOL Service for up to the specified amount of
on-line time per month without further charge ("free time"). After
the "free time" in any monthly billing period has been used by the
member, an additional charge is made for time spent on-line beyond
the "free time". As of July 13, 1995, the standard monthly billing
rate was $9.95/month (including 300 minutes of "free time"), and
the charge for additional on-line time was $2.95/hour.

19) The only information provided in the T & C or the Online
Information regarding how charges are actually calculated using
the time information from a particular session is the statement
"You will be charged for your extra time on America Online in
one-minute increments." No explanation or disclosure is provided
regarding how the one-minute increments are determined, or how the
number of seconds indicated for a session beyond whole minutes are
rounded to reach the one minute increments.

20) In fact, contrary to the information provided at the end of
each on-line session in the Ending Message, the amount of time
billed for is always rounded upwards to the next whole minute,
regardless of the number of seconds. Thus, a session lasting one
second more than a whole minute is billed for an additional
minute, as is any session lasting any number of additional seconds
beyond a whole minute. In addition, contrary to the information
provided in the Online Information, any session time consisting of
a number of whole minutes and forty-six or more seconds is rounded
upward an additional minute. Thus, a session lasting two minutes
and forty-six seconds (00:02:46) is billed as four minutes, as is
any session lasting up to and including three minutes (00:03:00).
The same pattern applies to any calculation of time for billing
purposes, regardless of the number of minute in the session.

21) In fact, contrary to the information provided by the Online
Clock, the number of minutes in a session which are billed by the
AOL Service is always one minute more than the time indicated by
the Online Clock. A member terminating any on-line session
immediate after checking the Online Clock will always be billed
for one minute more than shown.

22) In calculating charges for additional time beyond the "free
time", the AOL Service does not charge by totaling such time and
applying the hourly charge stated in the T & C and Online
Information to the total additional time. Instead, the AOL Service
calculates the charge for each individual session, and ten adds
the total for these charges to determine the amount billed. Thus,
after using up the "free time", a member billed for ten sessions
of six minute duration each (totalling 60 minutes) would be billed
for $3.00 (10 x $.30/session) rather than $2.95. This method of
charging for time is not explained or disclosed in the T & C or
the Online Information, and results in an effective hourly rate
which is greater than specified in the Online Information.

23) The AOL Software and Defendants' practices in operating the
AOL Service are designed by Defendants to cause members of the AOL
Service to incur additional and unnecessary charges for on-line
time through one or more of the following means:

a. Mandatory downloading of image files which have not been
requested by a member and are not needed for such member's use of
the AOL Service.

b. Continuing to bill for connection time though delays caused by
the AOL Software in accessing the AOL Service and in the manner in
which a member must disconnect from the AOL Service.

c. Billing a member for on-line time spent accessing AOL Service
areas which have been designated as "free" areas.

d. Failing to refund unearned membership charges to member who
have terminated use of the AOL Services.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Breach of Contract)

24) Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by this reference
each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through and
including 23 of this Complaint as if set forth verbatim.

25) On or about February 3, 1995 at City of Palo Alto, Santa Clara
County, State of California, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into
a written agreement relating to access the AOL Service by
Plaintiff. Pursuant to the agreement in accordance with the T & C
and the Online Information, Plaintiff became a member of America
Online and AOL represented that he would be billed for the time he
used the AOL Service. Consistent with such agreement, the Online
Clock indicated the amount of time spend on-line, and at the end
of each session the minute and seconds of the time of use would
appear on screen.

26) Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Defendants agreed to
perform all conditions, covenants and promises on its part to be
performed in accordance with the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing. The Defendants agreed not to deprive, frustrate or deny
Plaintiff the benefit of his contractual rights.

27) Plaintiff has performed all conditions, covenants and promises
required by him on his part to be performed in accordance with the
terms and condition of the contract.

28) Commencing on or about March 3, 1995, Defendants breached the
contract by charging for time that Plaintiff did not use the
system. On or about May 19, 1995, Plaintiff discovered that he was
only being billed in minutes and that the seconds did not appear
on the billing statement even though they appeared on the screen
after each session of use.

29) In May of 1995 Plaintiff learned that the Defendants breached
the agreement by billing for time which the Plaintiff did not use
the system, contrary to the representations, express and implied,
or the Online Information and the Ending Message. Plaintiff
learned that the Defendants round any seconds over and above a
whole minute to the next minute and also round sessions upward an
additional minute when the number of seconds beyond whole minutes
is forty six or more.

30) As a result of Defendants' breach of contract, Plaintiff and
each member of the class he represents is entitled to recover all
amounts improperly billed to and paid for by the Plaintiff and all
class members.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Fraud)

31) Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by this reference
each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through and
including 30 of this Complaint as if set forth verbatim.

32) On or about February 3, 1995, in the City of Palo Alto, County
of Santa Clara, State of California, Defendants made the following
standardized written representations to Plaintiff and made the
representations before and after said date of the class of persons
to which Plaintiff is a member in Defendants T & C. Defendants
represented that a member would be billed for the time he or she
used the AOL Service and that time spent in "free" areas would not
be charged to the member.

33) The representations made by Defendants were in fact false. The
true facts were that America Online would bill for any time over a
minute by rounding to the next minute and that some of the time
spent in "free" areas would be charged to the member. In addition,
AOL also bills for a further additional minute to the time for any
session when the number of seconds beyond who minutes exceeds
forty-six seconds (01:46) is round to three minutes four, two
minutes and forty-seven seconds (02:47) is rounded to four
minutes, continuing in a similar manner for other times.

34) When Defendants made these representations to Plaintiff, as
well as the class of persons whom he represents, they knew them to
be false and made these representations with the intention to
deceive Plaintiff and to induce members of the public as well as
Plaintiff to act in reliance on these representations in the
manner hereinafter alleged or with the expectation that they would
so act.

35) At the time these representations were made by the Defendants
and the time Plaintiff and the class members took the actions
herein alleged, Plaintiff and the class he represents, were
ignorant of the falsity of Defendants' representations and
believed them to be true. In reliance on these representations,
Plaintiff and the class members were induced to and did become
members of AOL and used the AOL service.

36) At all times relevant to this action, Defendants, as a
provided of an electronic commercial service was obligated to
provide to consumer such as Plaintiff and class members with whom
it contracts to provide service, at the time it contracts to
provide the service and annually, on or before June 30th of each
year thereafter with the name, address and telephone number of the
provider of service and any charges to the consumer posed by the
provided for the use of the service. See Civil Code Section
1789.3.

37) Prior to and at the time Plaintiff and each class member
contracted with America Online, it failed to accurately and
completely disclose the charges to the consumer imposed by AOL,
Inc. for use of the AOL Service. Defendants did not disclose to
consumers that they would be charged for each minute of service
with any portion of service rendered over and above a  minute
rounded to the next full minute, or that an additional minute
would be charged for any session where the number of seconds
beyond whole minutes exceeded forty-five.

38) The suppression of this fact regarding the billing was likely
to mislead Plaintiff and the class member and did is fact mislead
Plaintiff and the class in light of the other representations made
concerning the billing, such as the screen showing the minute and
seconds of use at the end of each session, and the presentation of
information by the Online Clock of the time of a session as always
less than would be billed at the time of presentation of such
information. The representations and failures to disclose
information and suppression of information herein alleged to have
been made by Defendant were made with the intent to induce
Plaintiff and other members of the class which he represents to
act in the manner herein alleged in reliance thereon.

39) Plaintiff and the class members, at the time these failures to
disclose and suppression of facts occurred, and at the time
Plaintiff and the class took the action herein alleged, was
ignorant of the existence on the facts which Defendants suppressed
and failed to disclose. If Plaintiff had been aware of the
existence of the facts not disclosed by Defendants regarding its
billing practices, Plaintiff would not have as he did, become a
member of America Online and used the AOL Service and authorized
payment via credit card of the charges for such services.

40) As a proximate result of the fraudulent conduct of Defendants
as herein alleged, Plaintiff and class members were induced to
join America Online and spend sums of money for the AOL Service by
logging on to the system and using it. As a result of such acts,
Plaintiff and the class he represents has been damaged in the sum
of currently unknown but subject to proof at time of trial.

41) The aforementioned conduct of Defendants was an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact now
to the Defendants with the intention on the part of Defendants of
thereby depriving Plaintiff and the class of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury and was despicable conduct that
subjected Plaintiff and the class to a cruel and unjust hardship
and conscience disregard of Plaintiffs' rights so as to justify an
award of exemplary and punitive damages.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of Business & Professions Code Section 17200, et seg.
"Unfair Trade Practices Act")

42) Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by this reference
each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through and
including 41 of this Complaint as if set forth verbatim.

43) Plaintiff files this Third Cause of Action acting as a private
attorney general to challenge Defendants' business practices. The
Unfair Trade Practices Act defines unfair competition to include
any "unfair", "unlawful" or "deceptive" business practice.
Business & Professions Code Section 17200. The Act provide for
injunctive relief and restitution for violations. Id. Section

use, as resulted in the unlawful, unfair and unjust collection and
garnering of payments from members of the AOL Service for services
which were not use. The member were to be billed for the time
utilizing the service yet the Defendants are charging for time
which the member did not use the system.

44) Plaintiff requests that this court enjoin these practices and
exercise its ancillary jurisdiction pursuant to the Unfair Trade
Practices Act as well as its inherent equitable jurisdiction to
effectuate full and complete relief, ordering Defendants to made
restitution to all persons whom have suffered from such acts.

45) The Defendants' practices of charging for time which the
consumer does not utilize the AOL system, failing to notify
consumers that they will be billed for time they do not use the
services and rounding all portions of a minute to the next minute
violate Business & Professions Code Section 17200.

46) Pursuant to Business & Professions Code Section 17200, et
seg., Plaintiff is entitled to enjoin these practices and to
obtain restitution of all funds obtained by reason of these
unlawful, unfair and/or deceptive practices. Plaintiff
individually and on behalf of the members of the general public
who are, have been, or may be subjected to these unfair, and
unlawful business practices or Defendants request injunctive
relief and such other orders as may be necessary to restore to any
person, interest, money or property which may have been acquired
by Defendants by means of such unfair and unlawful business
practices pursuant to Business & Professions Code Section 17203.
Additionally, Plaintiff requests injunctive relief to restrain
Defendants from perpetrating these wrongs complained of herein in
the future. Plaintiff is also entitled to recover reasonable
attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays judgment as follows:

1) That this court certify this case as a class action;

2) That this court award the named Plaintiff damages according to
proof at time of trial;

3) That this court award damages to the member of the class;

4) That Defendants and all persons acting through or for them be
permanently enjoined from engaging in deceptive and unfair
practices in connection with its billing of members such as
charging for time not used on the system by a member, and that it
will provide accurate information regarding billing and contract
terms to the consumer in connection with provision of the AOL
Services;

5) That the Defendants be ordered to restore to each member of the
public who has paid for time improperly billed by Defendants and
all other improper charges, plus interest thereon at the rate of
10% per annum;

AFFIDAVIT OF WILLARD MCDOWELL


STATE OF CONNECTICUT )
                     :  ss .:
COUNTY OF FAIRFIELD  )


WILLARD MCDOWELL, being duly sworn, deposes and says:

1. I submit this affidavit in support of the motion by Prodigy
Services Company ("Prodigy") for reargument and/or renewal in
connection with the Court's Order, dated May 23, 1995 (the
"Opinion"), granting plaintiffs Stratton Oakmont, Inc. and
Daniel Porush partial summary judgment on their claims in this
action. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein.

 2. The manner in which plaintiffs presented my deposition
testimony to the Court in connection with their motion for
summary judgment was misleading. Plaintiffs took excerpts out of
context to erroneously suggest that I stated with personal
knowledge that Prodigy exercised a "management function" over
its Board Leaders. As I explain below, this is not the
case.[FN1]

 3. I was employed at Prodigy between approximately 1989 and
February 1995. I gave testimony in this matter in December 1994.

 4. Until approximately December 1993, I was assigned to the
Customer Services department at Prodigy, where I was responsible
for addressing, among other things, billing disputes and
technical problems. The latter, for example, would have included
those situations where a member found he was unable to log onto
the system, or where a member was having trouble understanding
some aspect of the service.

 5. In approximately December 1993, I became a Member Security
Officer. My responsibilities in that position were to
investigate fraud and other related problems that arose on the
network. For example, I would have been called to investigate
the use of phony identification numbers or the theft of a
member's identification number.

 6. I left Prodigy's employ in February 1995.

 7. Neither of my positions at Prodigy involved any significant
interaction with the Board Leaders. I did not report to,
supervise, direct or control the Board Leaders in connection
with the performance of their duties. My understanding of the
function of the Board Leaders, and knowledge of the interaction
between the Board Leaders and Prodigy, was based (and is today
still based) only upon hearsay, not first-hand knowledge or
experience. I explained this to plaintiffs' counsel at my
deposition.

 8. Nevertheless, at my deposition, plaintiffs' counsel tried to
elicit from me testimony about whether Prodigy controls or
directs the activities of the Board Leaders. I assumed that
Prodigy performed a management function over the Board Leaders.
However, I specifically advised plaintiffs' counsel that this
was just speculation and that it was not based upon my own
personal knowledge. (McDowell Tr. at 78-79).

 9. It was improper for plaintiffs' counsel to represent to the
Court (either explicitly or implicitly) that I was speaking with
first-hand knowledge when I testified about Prodigy's
interaction with its Board Leaders. In fact, I was not.

 10. Plaintiffs' counsel tried to do the same thing concerning
the authority of the Board Leaders. Counsel repeatedly asked me
about Prodigy's guidelines and whether, for example, Board
Leaders had the ability and the authority to delete certain
types of notes.[FN2] Again, I had (and still have) no first-hand
knowledge concerning the authority of the Board Leaders and
what, if any, type of communications are improper under the
guidelines. When I answered counsel's questions, I made clear
that I was speculating. (McDowell Tr. at 78-80, 162-64).
Plaintiff have wrongly represented to the Court that I spoke on
these matters with first-hand knowledge.

 11. Finally, plaintiffs' attempted to attach some significance
to the fact that I used the word "editor" when referring to the
Board Leaders. The terms "board leader" and "board manager" were
also used throughout the deposition. I was unaware that these
terms carried any legal significance and would not have used the
terms loosely if I had. The proper term is "board leader."

 12. I hope that this affidavit clarifies the record of my
previous testimony for the Court.

 WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, Prodigy's motion
for reargument and/or renewal in connection with the plaintiffs'
summary judgment motion should be granted, and summary judgment
in plaintiffs' favor should be denied.

/s/WILLARD MCDOWELL

Sworn to before me this 5th day of July, 1995.

Notary Public


ENDNOTES

 1. The relevant portions of my deposition transcript are
attached hereto as Exhibit A and identified herein by "McDowell
Tr. at" followed by the page citation.

 2. I am aware that Board Leaders have the physical capacity,
using the technology that Prodigy makes available to them, to
delete notes from the bulletin boards.

Upon the foregoing papers, it is ordered that this motion by

Plaintiffs for partial summary judgment against Defendant PRODIGY

SERVICES COMPANY ("PRODIGY") is granted and this Court

determines, as a matter of law, the following two disputed

issues as follows:



(i) the PRODIGY was a "publisher" of statements concerning

Plaintiffs on its "Money Talk" computer bulletin board for the

purposes of Plaintiffs' libel claims; and,



(ii) that Charles Epstien, the Board Leader of PRODIGY's "money

Talk" computer bulletin board, acted as PRODIGY's agent for the

purposes of the acts and omissions alleged in the complaint.



At issue in this case are statements about Plaintiffs made by an

unidentified bulletin board user or "poster" on PRODIGY's "Money

Talk" computer bulletin board on October 23rd and 25th of 1994.

These statements included the following:



(a) STRATTON OAKMONT, INC. ("STRATTON"), a securities investment

banking firm, and DANIEL PORUSH, STRATTON'S president, committed

criminal and fraudulent acts in connection with the initial

public offering of stock of Solomon-Page Ltd.;



(b) the Solomon-Page offering was a "major criminal fraud" and

"100% criminal fraud";



(c) PORUSH was "soon to be proven criminal", and,



(d) STRATTON was a "cult of brokers who either lie for a

living or get fired."



Plaintiffs commenced this action against PRODIGY, the owner and

operator of the network on which the statements appeared, and

the unidentified party who posted the aforementioned statements.

The second amended complaint alleges ten (10) causes of action,

including claims for per se libel. On this motion, "in order to

materially advance the outcome of this litigation" (Zamansky

affidavit, par. 4), Plaintiffs seek partial judgment on two

issues, namely:



(1) whether PRODIGY may be considered a "publisher: of the

aforementioned statements; and,



(2) whether Epstien, the Board leader for the computer bulletin

board on which the statements were posted, acted with actual and

apparent authority as PRODIGY's "agent: for the purposes of the

claims in this action.



By way of background, it is undisputed that PRODIGY's computer

network has at least two million subscribers who communicate

with each other and with the general publisher population on

PRODIGY's bulletin boards. "Money Talk" the board on which the

aforementioned statement appeared, is allegedly the leading and

most widely read financial computer bulletin board in the United

States, whose members can post statements regarding stocks,

investments and other financial matters. PRODIGY contracts with

Bulletin Board Leaders, who, among other things, participate in

board discussions and undertake promotional efforts to encourage

usage and increase users. The Board Leader for "Money Talk" at

the time the alleged libelous statements were posted was Charles

Epstien.



PRODIGY commenced operations in 1990. Plaintiffs base their

claim that PRODIGY is a publisher in large measure on PRODIGY's

stated policy, starting in 1990, that it was a family orientated

computer network. In various national newspaper articles

written by Geoffrey Moore, PRODIGY's Director of Market Programs

and Communications, PRODIGY held itself out as an online

service that exercised editorial control over the content of

messages posted on its computer bulletin boards, thereby

expressly differentiating itself from the competition and

expressly likening itself to a newspaper. (see, Exhibits I and

J to Plaintiffs' moving papers.) In one article PRODIGY stated:



"We make no apology for pursuing a value system that reflects

the culture of the millions of American families we aspire to

serve. Certainly no responsible newspaper does less when it

chooses the type of advertising it publishes, the letters it

prints, the degree of nudity and unsupported gossip its editors

tolerate."



(Exhibit J.)



Plaintiffs characterize the aforementioned articles by PRODIGY

as admissions (see, Battner v Pokoik, 81 AD2d 572, app. dsmd. 54

NY2d 750) and argue that, together with certain documentation

and deposition testimony, these articles establish Plaintiffs'

prima facie case. In opposition, PRODIGY insists that its

policies have changed and evolved since 1990 and that the latest

article on the subject, dated February, 1993, did not reflect

PRODIGY's policies in October, 1994, when the allegedly libelous

statements were posted. Although the eighteen month lapse of

time between the last article and the aforementioned statements

is not significant, and the Court is wary of interpreting

statements and admissions out of context, these considerations

go solely to the weight of this evidence.



Plaintiffs further rely upon the following additional evidence

in support of their claim that PRODIGY is a publisher:



(A)promulgation of "content guidelines" (the "Guidelines" found at

Plaintiffs' Exhibit F) in which, inter alia, users are requested

to refrain from posting notes that are "insulting" and are

advised that "notes that harass other members or are deemed to

be in bad taste or grossly repugnant to community standards, or

are deemed harmful to maintaining a harmonious online community,

will be removed when brought to PRODIGY's attention"; the

Guidelines all expressly state that although "Prodigy is

committed to open debate and discussion on the bulletin boards,



(B) use of a software screening program which automatically

prescreens all bulletin board postings for offensive language;



(C) the use of Board Leaders such as Epstien whose duties

include enforcement of the Guidelines, according to Jennifer

Ambrozek, the Manager of Prodigy's bulletin boards and the

person at PRODIGY responsible for supervising the Board Leaders

(see Plaintiffs' Exhibit R, Ambrozek deposition transcript, at

p. 191); and



(D) testimony by Epstien as to a tool for Board \Leaders known

as an "emergency delete function" pursuant to which a Board

Leader could remove a note and send a previously prepared

message of explanation "ranging from solicitation, bad advice,

insulting, wrong topic, off topic, bad taste, etcetera."

(Epstien deposition Transcript, p. 52).



A finding that PRODIGY is a publisher is the first hurdle for

Plaintiffs to overcome in pursuit of their defamation claims,

because one who repeats or otherwise republishes a libel is

subject to liability as if he had originally published it.

[Cianci v New York Times Pub. Co., 639 F2d. 54, 61; Restatement,

Second Torts Section 578 (1977).] In contrast, distributors

such as book stores and libraries may be libel for defamatory

statements of others only if they knew or had reason to know of

the defamatory statement at issue. [Cubby Inc. v. CompuServe

Inc., 776 F. Supp. 135, 139; see also Auvil v CBS 60 Minutes,

800 F. Supp. 928, 932.] A distributor, or deliverer of a

defamatory material is considered a passive conduit and will not

be found liable in the absence of fault. [Auvil supra, see also

Misu v. Mooney, 124 Misc2d 95 (claims against printer of weekly

newspaper containing allegedly libelous articles dismissed in

absence of any evidence that printer knew or had reason to know

of the allegedly libelous nature of the articles). However, a

newspaper, for example, is more than a passive receptacle or

conduit for news, comment and advertising. [Miami Herald

Publishing Co. v Tornillo, 418 US 241, 258.] The choice

material to go into a newspaper and the decisions made as to the

content of the paper constitute the exercise of editorial

control and judgment (Id.), and with this editorial control

comes increased liability. (See Cubby, supra.) In short, the

critical issue to be determined by this Court is whether the

foregoing evidence establishes a prima facie case that PRODIGY

exercised sufficient editorial control over its computer

bulletin boards to render it a publisher with the same

responsibilities of a newspaper.



Again, PRODIGY insists that its former policy of manually

reviewing all messages prior to the posting was changed "long

before the messages complained of by the Plaintiffs were

posted." (Schneck affidavit, par. 4.) However, no

documentation or detailed explanation of such a change, and the

dissemination of news of such a change, has been submitted. In

addition, PRODIGY argues that in terms of sheer volume - -

currently 60,000 messages a day are posted on PRODIGY bulletin

boards - - manual review of messages is not feasible. While

PRODIGY admits that Board Leaders do not function as "editors".

Furthermore, PRODIGY argues generally that this Court should not

decide issues that can directly impact this developing

communications medium without the benefit of a full record,

although it fails to describe what further facts remain to be

developed on this issue of whether it is a publisher.



As for legal authority, PRODIGY relies on the Cubby case, supra.

There the defendant CompuServe was a computer network providing

subscribers with computer related services or forums including

an online general information service or "electronic Library".

One of the publications available on the Journalism Forum

carried defamatory statements about the Plaintiff, and

electronic newsletter. Interestingly, an independent entity

named Cameron Communications, Inc. ("CCI") had "contracted to

manage, review, create, delete, edit, and otherwise control the

contents for the Journalism Forum in accordance with editorial

and technical standards and conventions of style as established

by CompuServe". The Court noted that CompuServe had no

opportunity to review the contents of the publication as issue

before it was uploaded into CompuServe's computer banks.

Consequently, the Court found that CompuServe's product was, "in

essence, an electronic for-profit library" that carried a vast

number of publications, and that CompuServe had "little or no

editorial control" over the contents of those publications. In

granting CompuServe's motion for summery judgment, the Cubby

court held:



A computerized database it is functional equivalent of a more

traditional news vendor, and the inconsistent application of a

lower standard of liability to an electronic news distributor

such as CompuServe than that which is applied to a public

library, bookstore, or newsstand would impose an undue burden on

the freeflow of information.



(776 F. Supp. 135, 140.)



The key distinction between CompuServe and PRODIGY is twofold.

First, PRODIGY held itself out to the public and its members as

controlling the content of its computer built an boards.

Second, PRODIGY implemented this control through its automatic

software screening program, and the Guidelines which Board

Leaders are required to enforce. By actively utilizing

technology and the man power to delete notes from its computer

built an boards on the basis of offensiveness and "bad taste",

for example, PRODIGY is clearly making decisions as to content

(see, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, supra), and such

decisions constitutes editorial control. (Id.) that such

control is not complete and in enforced both as early as the

notes arrive and as late as a complaint is made, does not

minimize or eviscerate the simple fact that PRODIGY has uniquely

arrogated to itself the role of determining what is proper for

its members to post and read on its built an boards. Based on

the forgoing, this Court is compelled to conclude that for the

purposes of plaintiffs' claims in this action, PRODIGY is a

publisher rather than a distributor.



An interesting comparison may be found in Auvil v CBS 60 Minutes

(supra), where apple growers sued a television network and local

affiliates because of an alleged defamatory investigative report

generated by the network and broadcast by its affiliates. The

record established that the affiliates exercised no editorial

control over the broadcast although they had the power to do so

by virtue of their contract with CBS, they had the opportunity

to do so by virtue of a three hour hiatus for the west coast

time differential, that had the technical capability to do so,

and they in fact had occasionally censored network programming

in the past, albeit never in connection with "60 Minutes". The

Auvil court found:



It is argued that these features, coupled with the power to

censor, triggered the duty to censor. That is a leap which the

Court is not prepared to join in.



* * *



time editorial boards at local stations throughout the country

which possess sufficient knowledge, legal acumen and access to

experts to continually monitor incoming transmissions and

exercise on-the-spot discretionary calls or face &75 million

lawsuits at every turn. That is not realistic.



* * *



More than merely unrealistic in economic terms, it is difficult

to imagine a scenario more chilling on the media's right of

expression and the public's right to know.



(800 F. Supp. at 931-932.) Consequently, the court dismissed

all claims against the affiliates on the basis of "conduit

liability", which could not be established therein absent fault,

which was not shown.



In contrast, here PRODIGY has virtually created an editorial

staff of Board Leaders who have the ability to continually

monitor incoming transmissions and in fact do spend time

censoring notes. Indeed, it could be said that PRODIGY's

current system of automatic scanning, Guidelines and Board

Leaders may have a chilling effect on freedom of communication

in Cyberspace, and it appears that this chilling effect is

exactly what PRODIGY wants, but for the legal liability that

attaches to the censorship.



Let it be clear that this Court is in full agreement with Cubby

and Auvil, Computer bulletin boards should generally be regarded

in the same context as bookstores, libraries and network

affiliates. [See Edward v. DiLello, Functional Equivalency and

Its application to Freedom of Speech on Computer Bulletin

Boards, 26 Colum. J. Law & Eoc. Probs. 199, 210-211

(1993).] It is PRODIGY's new policies, technology and staffing

decisions which have altered the scenario and mandated the

finding that it is a publisher. PRODIGY's conscious choice, to

gain the benefits of editorial control, has opened it up to a

greater liability to CompuServe and other computer networks that

make no such choice. For the record, the fear that this Court's

finding of publishers status for PRODIGY will compel all

computer networks to abdicate control of their built an boards,

incorrectly presumes that the market will refuse to compensate a

network for its increased control and the resulting increased

exposure. [See, Eric Schlachter, Cyberspace, The Free Market

and The Free Marketplace of Ideas: Recognizing Legal

Differences in Computer Bulletin Board Functions, 16 Hastings

Communication and Entertainment L. J., 87, 138-139.] Presumably

PRODIGY's decision to regulate the content of its bulletin

boards was in part influenced by its desire to attract a market

it perceived to exist consisting of users seeking a "family

-oriented" computer service. This decision simply required that

to the extent computer networks provide such services, they must

also accept the concomitant legal consequences. In addition,

the Court also notes that the issues addressed herein may

ultimately be preempted by federal law if the Communications

Decency Act of 1995, several versions of which are pending in

Congress, in enacted. [See, Congressional Quarterly US S 652,

Congressional Quarterly US HR 1004, and Congressional Quarterly

US S 314.]



The Court now turns to the second issue presented here, of

whether Epstein was PRODIGY's agent for the purposes of the acts

and omissions alleged in the complaint. Agency is a legal

relationship which results from the manifestation of consent of

one person to allow another TO act on his or her behalf and

subject to his or her control, and consent by the other to so

act. [Maurillo v Park Slope U-Haul, 194 AD2d 142; Restatement

(second) of Agency s1.] The starting point for an agency

analysis in this case in the "Bulletin Board Leader Agreement"

("the Agreement" found as Exhibit A to Opposition Affidavit of

William C. Schneck) between PRODIGY and Epstein. This

Agreement sets forth eleven specific responsibilities expected

of a Board Leader including (I) the posting of a minimum of 120

notes on the bulletin board each month: (II) working with

member Representatives; (III) providing monthly reports and

(IV) following any additional procedures provided by PRODIGY.

The Agreement also requires prior PRODIGY approval of all

promotional EFFORTS. In addition, the Agreement contains the

following language. Although you will not be a Prodigy

representative, your actions as Board Leader will still reflect

on Prodigy.



                                        ***



You will be solely responsible for all of your actions as a

Board Leader. While Prodigy will certainly support your actions

as a Board Leader and a general matter (so long as they are not

in breach of this Agreement), we will not assume any liability

for anything you do (or fail to do) as a Board Leader. You

hereby indemnify and agree to hole Prodigy harmless from and

against all claim cost, liabilities judgments . . . arising out

of or in connections with anything you do . . .



                                        ***



Being a Board Leader does not make you a Prodigy Services

Company employee, representative or agent, and you agree not to

claim or suggest that you are one.



Prodigy relies on this language to extricate itself from any

alleged agency relationship with Epstein. However, Talismanic

language does not determine an agency relationship. [Matter of

Shulman Transport Enterprises, Inc., 33 B.R.383, 385, aff'd 744

F2d 293.] The Court must look to the substance of the

relationship. (Id.) Where one party retains a sufficient

degree of direction and control over another, a principal-agent

relationship exists. [Garcia v Herald Tribune Fresh Air Fund,

Inc., 51 Ad2d 897.] In addition, whether one is an independent

contractor is not determinative of whether one is an agent.

[Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Stokely-Van Camp Inc.,

522 F2d 369; Ackert v Ausman, 29 Miso2d 962 aff'd 20 AD2d 850.]



As to the substance of the relationship between PRODIGY and its

Board Leaders, PRODIGY Security Officer McDowell testified that

Board Leaders are required to follow the Guidelines and that

PRODIGY performs a "management function" with respect to the

activities of the Board Leaders. (McDowell deposition

transcript p. 78, found at Exhibit S to the moving papers.)

Furthermore, Epstein's Supervisor, Jennifer Ambrozek, testified

that PRODIGY reviews the Guidelines with Board Leaders, who are

then required to enforce the Guidelines. (Ambrozek deposition

transcript pp. 23 and 191, found at Exhibit R to the moving

papers.) Board Leaders are also given a 28 page "Bulletin Board

Leader Survival Guide" (Exhibit O to the moving papers), dated

October 1994, wherein many technical terms and procedures are

explained, and the following caveat is given:



IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SOMETHING IS OR WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO,

LEAVE IT ALONE UNTIL YOU CAN ASK.



Where the facts are not disputed the question of agency should

be resolved by the court. [Plymouth Rock Fuel Corp. v Leucadia

Inc., 100 AD2d 842.] This is such a case. The aforementioned

testimony by PRODIGY employees and documentation generated by

PRODIGY, together with the Guidelines themselves, cannot be

disputed by PRODIGY and leave no doubt that at least for the

limited purpose of monitoring and editing the "Money Talk"

computer bulletin Board, PRODIGY directed and controlled

Epstein's actions. In reaching this conclusion the Court has

taken care not to rely on any testimony by Epstein, inasmuch as

it is the conduct of the principal which must create the

impression of authority, not the conduct of the agent. [See

Ford v Unity Hosp., 32 NY2d 464, 473.] Based on the foregoing,

the Court holds that Epstein acted as PRODIGY's agent for the

purposes of the acts and omissions alleged in the complaint.

<P>After Ross Perot was excluded from the presidential debates, the Reform Party filed 
suit September 23, 1996 against the Federal Elections Commission and the Commission 
on Presidential Debates demanding that Perot be allowed to participate. According to the 
suit, the exclusion of Perot and his running mate will result in "incalculable damage to 
their campaign." Perot argues, "Declaring the election essentially over for all 
candidates but two before a single debate takes place will only deepen the nation's 
cynicism about government." The suit also claims that the Commission on Presidential

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTIVE 
RELIEF 

NOW COME Plaintiffs Ross Perot, Pat Choate and Perot '96, Inc., by and through 
counsel, and complain against Defendants as follows: 


INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiffs bring this action against Defendants to enjoin the Commission on 
Presidential Debates' ("CPD") violation of Federal Election Commission ("FEC") 
regulations, the Federal Election Campaign Act, and the Constitutional guarantees of free 
speech, free association, equal protection and due process. Plaintiffs also bring this action 
to compel the CPD to apply fairly, objectively and lawfully its Candidate Selection 
Criteria for participation in the 1996 general election debates. The failure of CPD to 
comply with FEC regulations and to enforce its own criteria is a neutral and non-partisan 
way have resulted in the exclusion of Plaintiffs Ross Perot and Pat Choate from the 1996 
presidential debates, thereby causing incalculable damage to their campaign. Determining 
the participants in the debates is a critical public function that will shape the American 
people's ability to make meaningful and informed balloting decisions for President and 
Vice President. In 1988 and 1992, exit polls showed that more voters based their 
balloting decision on the debates than on any other single factor. In 1992, for the first 
time the television audience increased for each consecutive debate, culminating in 91 
million viewers for the third and final presidential debate. In the CPD's own words: 
"These events have become central education forums which Americans expect, watch, 
and value." 

2. Declaring the election essentially over for all candidates but two before a single debate 
takes place will only deepen the nation's cynicism about government. The FEC has 
unlawfully delegated control over debate selection criteria to the five Democratic and five 
Republican members of the CPD, who, in turn, have forsworn their obligation to apply 
only objective candidate selection criteria and instead automatically certified the 
Democratic and Republican nominees and then forced all other to run a gauntlet of 
subjective and arbitrary criteria. Plaintiffs ask this Court to vindicate their most essential 
political rights and ensure that the American people have access to a meaningful political 
debate and a meaningful electoral choice. The Democratic and Republican parties should 
not be permitted to consolidate their monopoly on the political process by closing off the 
presidential debates to Plaintiffs Ross Perot and Pat Choate. 


THE PARTIES

3. Plaintiff Ross Perot ("Perot") is a natural born citizen of the United States, is qualified 
under the United States Constitution to hold the offing of President of the United States 
of America, and is the candidate of the Reform Party for that office. The Reform Party is 
a political association of affiliated voters who have established Reform Parties in the 50 
states. Perot's campaign has received approximately $29 million in pre-election funding 
from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, based upon Perot's polling approximately 
19% of the votes cast in the 1992 presidential election. Perot is on the ballot as a 
candidate for President in the 50 states and the District of Columbia for the general 
election to be held November 5, 1996. 

4. Plaintiff Pat Choate ("Choate") is a natural born citizen of the United States, is 
qualified under the United States Constitution to hold the office of Vice President of the 
United States of America, and is the running mate of Perot. 

5. Plaintiff Perot' 96, Inc., ("Perot '96") is a duly incorporated campaign committee with 
its principal office in Dallas, Texas. It exists in accordance with Federal Election 
Commission rules and regulations for the purpose of serving as the authorized general 
election campaign committee of Perot 

6. Defendant Commission on Presidential Debates ("CPD") is a non-profit corporation 
organized under the laws of the District of Columbia It is recognized as exempt from 
taxation under Sec. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. From its inception, the CPD 
has been co-chaired by Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., and Paul G. Kirk, Jr., Chairmen of the 
Republican and Democratic National Committee, respectively, at the time of CPD's 
organization. Membership on the CPD is and has always been restricted to, and divided 
equally among, representatives of the Democratic and Republican parties. All 
communications of the CPD carefully note Messrs. Fahrenkopf's and Kirk's status as 
former Republican and Democratic party chairmen. At all times relevant herein, 
Defendant CPD, through the conduct of its agents, employees, and/or directors, has acted 
under the color of authority of state law, to the unlawful detriment of Plaintiffs as 
hereinafter alleged. 

7. Defendant Federal Election Commission ("FEC") is an administrative agency of the 
United States Government created pursuant to the Federal Election Commission Act (the 
"Act"), 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c. 


JURISDICTION, VENUE AND STANDING

8. Plaintiffs have jurisdiction and venue in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331, 2 
U.S.C.Sec. 437g(a)(8)(A), 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201, and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. Venue is 
proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1391. There is now existing between the 
parties hereto an actual, justiciable controversy in respect to which Plaintiffs are entitled 
to have a declaration of rights and further relief, including permanent injunctive relief, 
because of the facts, conditions, and circumstances hereinafter set forth 

9. Plaintiffs have standing as aggrieved parties injured by the violation of the Act as more 
fully set forth herein. 

10. In 1985, the respective chairmen of the Democratic and Republican National 
Committees executed an agreement stating that the major parties would work together to 
sponsor presidential debates, and replace the debates sponsored by the League of Women 
Voters with nationally televised joint appearances conducted between the presidential and 
vice presidential nominees of the "two major political parties." 

11. Fifteen months later, the major parties issued a joint press release, as well as parallel 
separate press releases, announcing the incorporation of the CPD. The releases declared 
that the CPD was a "bi-partisan" organization and that it was formed to implement joint 
sponsorship of general election debates by the national Republican and Democratic 
Committees "between their respective nominees." 

12. In July 1987, the CPD formed an advisory committee to formulate criteria for 
selecting candidates other than those  of the Democratic and Republican parties. The 
committee recommended that the CPD invite only candidates who had a "realistic 
chance" of winning the general election. 

13. By July 1988, a year later, the CPD had not formulated any criteria to assess the 
"realistic chance" standard recommended by the advisory committee.  Rather, the CPD 
simply invited the Democratic and Republican candidates to debate without requiring that 
they apply, while third-party candidates were offered no application procedure 
whatsoever, 

14. In the Fall of 1988, after a prolonged dispute over debate sponsorship between the 
League of Women Voters and the CPD,a compromise was reached under which they 
agreed to alternate sponsorship The League withdrew, however, when the Bush and 
Dukakis campaigns presented the League with a script for every detail of the staging of 
the debates,ranging from selection of questioners to the color of the timer lights on the 
podiums. The League explained its withdrawal by stating that to hold itself out as an 
independent sponsor of such a production would make it "an accessory to the 
hoodwinking of the American public." 

15. After the League' withdrawal, the CPD became the sole sponsor of the 1988 debates. 
It followed the exact specifications of the Bush and Dukakis campaigns, which the 
League of Women Voters had refused to do.  The CPD functions as a partisan, albeit bi-
partisan, political committee, a committee affiliated with Democratic and Republican 
national committees and the campaign committees of their party nominees for president.  
The CPD acts as a production company for direct and in-kind contributions to the major 
parties.  These contributions are subsidized by the United States Treasury through tax 
deductible contributions to the CPD by large business corporation, foundations and other 
parties who either are barred from contributing at all to federal candidates, or who are 
subject to contribution ceilings.  These contributions made to the CPD, and by the CPD 
to the Republican Democratic candidates, violate prohibitions against corporate 
contributions generally and against contributions to major party candidates in the general 
election who have accepted payments from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. 

16.  In 1992, Ross Perot was invited to participate in the presidential debates by the Bush 
and Clinton campaigns pursuant to an agreement between those campaigns which offered 
Perot, and the CPD, the opportunity to participate on a "take it or leave it basis."  On 
October 5, 1992, the Clinton and Bush campaigns submitted the agreement to the CPD, 
inviting it to sponsor the debates subject to the terms of the debate agreement, including 
the understanding that Perot would be invited to participate in the debates. The CPD then 
asked its Advisory Committee to evaluate Perot's participation under the CPD's criteria 
for third-party and independent candidates. By letter of the CPD to the Clinton and Bush 
campaign dated October 6, 1992, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, the 
CPD accepted the invitation to sponsor the debate subject to various conditions and 
understandings, one of which was as follows: 


"The Commission has determined, pursuant to the recommendation of its non-partisan 
advisory committee on candidate selection, that H. Ross Perot and Adm. James Stockdale 
should be invited to participate the October 11 and 13, 1992 debates, respectively. The 
Commission will make its candidate participation determination regarding the October 15 
and 19 debates after the initial debates. The Commission understands that, if it 
subsequently determines not to invite Mr. Perot to additional debates under its 
sponsorship, you each reserve the right to seek an alternative sponsor for these debates." 


17. The Bush and Clinton campaigns responded to the CPD that if it did not extend the 
invitation to Perot for every debate, under the terms of the Bush/Clinton debate 
agreement they would find another debate sponsor. Ross Perot accepted the invitation to 
the debates pursuant to the Bush/Clinton debate agreement on October 6, 1992. Within 24 
hours the CPD capitulated advising the Bush and Clinton campaigns by letter of October 
7, 1992, a copy of which is attached hereto Exhibit B, as follows: 


"The Commission has determined that H. Ross Perot should be invited to participate in 
the October 11, 15 and 19 presidential debates and that Admiral James Stockdale should 
be invited to participate in the October 13 vice presidential debate." 


18. As the result of concerns raised about organizations staging presidential debates in 
1988 and 1992, the FEC adopted new regulations ("Debates Regulations"), effective 
March 13, 1996, which require every organization staging a presidential debate to comply 
with simple, straightforward candidate-selection guidelines, namely: 


"For all debates, staging organization(s) must use pre-established objective criteria to 
determine which candidates may participate in a debate.  For general election debates, 
staging organization(s) shall not use nomination by a particular political party as the sole 
objective criterion to determine whether to include a candidate in a debate." 


11 C.F.R. Sec. 110.13(c).

19.  Notwithstanding the mandate of this particular regulation, the CPD has insisted in 
applying its subjective Candidate Selection Criteria For 1996, adopted by the CPD on 
September 19, 1995, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C. These are virtually 
the same as the criteria used in 1992, as the CPD has publicly noted. 

20.  In its introductory statement to the criteria, the CPD states that the "goal" of the 
debates is: 


"[T]o afford the members of the voting public an opportunity to sharpen their views of 
those candidates from among whom the next President or Vice President will be selected.  
In light of the huge number of declared candidates in any given  presidential election, the 
Commission has determined that its voter education goal is best achieved by limiting 
debate participation to the next President and his or her principal rival(s)." 


21.  Pursuant to this criteria, the CPD automatically extends an invitation to the 
respective nominees of the two major parties.  Specifically, the CPD's selection criteria 
states: 


"A Democratic or Republican nominee has been elected to the Presidency for more than a 
century.  Such historical prominence and sustained voter interest warrants the extension 
of an invitation to the respective nominees of the two major parties to participate in the 
Commission's 1996 debates." 


22. The FEC Debates Regulation make no distinction between major and nonmajor 
parties as to application of the criteria to be applied in selecting candidates to debate. The 
Same "objective criteria" is to be applied to all. However, the criteria applied by the CPD 
contain a separate set of guidelines that are subjective, and are applied only in 
determining which "nonmajor" party candidates will be invited to participate in the 
debates.  The CPD states that it has developed such "nonpartisan criteria" for the purpose 
of "further[ing] the educational purposes of the debates," and identifying "nonmajor party 
candidates, if any,... who properly are considered to be among the principal rivals for the 
Presidency."  If that is so, the educational purpose is best fulfilled by having Perot, who is 
clearly deemed by the public as "among the principal rivals for the Presidency," in the 
debates. 

23.  The thrust of the subjective criteria is to invite only those third-party candidates who, 
in the opinion of the CPD, are considered to be among the principal rivals for the 
presidency.  However, the CPD acknowledges in the introduction to its selection criteria 
for nonmajor party candidates that such criteria "contemplate no quantitative threshold" 
for debate inclusion: 


"Rather, the Commission will employ a multifaceted analysis of potential electoral 
success, including a review of (1) evidence of national organization, (2) signs of national 
newsworthiness and competitiveness, and (3) indicators of national enthusiasm or 
concern, to determine whether a candidate has a sufficient chance of election to warrant 
inclusion in one or more if its debates." 


24.  Perot satisfies all objective CPD criteria for inclusion in the debates, and also all 
(impermissible) subjective criteria outlined above.  Perot '96 is a national organization. 
Ross Perot is deemed newsworthy and competitive as a "principal rival for the 
Presidency," and his campaign evidences national enthusiasm and concern, perhaps best 
demonstrated by the public outcry at the CPD's arbitrary decision and widely publicized 
public opinion polls showing a vast majority of voters believe that the decision was 
wrong and unfair. 

25.  In violation of FEC regulations, the CPD extended invitations to President Clinton 
and Senator Dole to participate in its debates solely on the basis of their nomination by 
the Democratic and Republican parties.  No subjective criteria of "realistic chance of 
winning the election" was applied to either Senator Dole or President Clinton, and no 
pundits were polled on the issue. 

26.  Based on information and belief, representatives of the CPD have had ongoing 
substantive communications with representatives of the Clinton campaign, the Dole 
campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, 
regarding the staging of the 1996 debates.  All members of the CPD are current or former 
Democratic or Republican officeholders or persons closely associated with those parties.  
Since it inception, CPD membership has been divided equally and exclusively between 
representatives of the two major parties. 

27.  Prior to the CPD announcement of its decision regarding exclusion of Perot, a 
representative of Perot '96, Russell Verney, requested of the CPD that persons other than 
those with direct and substantial ties to the Democratic and Republican parties be 
included in the deliberation and decision-making processes of the CPD. See letter of R. 
Verney, dated September 9, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit D.  The CPD refused this 
request.  Mr. Verney also requested the opportunity to address the CPD, which request 
was denied. 

28.  On September 17, 1996, the CPD issued a press release excluding all third party 
candidates, including Perot, from the debates.  See Press Release dated September 17, 
1996, attached hereto as Exhibit E. The CPD also released a letter from its Advisory 
Committee setting forth the rationale for the decision.  See letter of R. Neustadt to CPD 
dated September 17, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit F. 

29.  The CPD communicated its decision to representatives of the Clinton and Dole 
campaigns before it was communicated to the public, to Perot '96, or to Perot. 

30.  Perot and Choate have been wrongfully denied the opportunity to participate in the 
CPD sponsored presidential debates in 1996. 


CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I
Statutory Action Against FEC

31.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraphs 1 
through 30. 


The CPD's Violation of Debates Regulations 

32.  In October 1992, in response to concerns raised about the staging of presidential 
debates in 1988 and 1992, the FEC heard testimony and received proposals for amending 
the Debates Regulation.  Subsequently, the FEC promulgated amendments to the 
regulations, which became effective on March 13, 1996, 60 Federal Register 64260 
(December 14, 1995), adding the "pre-established objective criteria" requirement and the 
prohibition against using "nomination by a particular political party as the sole objective 
criterion," as set forth in full at paragraph 18 hereinabove. Hence, this is the first election 
cycle in which these amendments are in effect. 

33.  The CPD has violated the prohibition in 11 C.F.R. Sec. 110.13(c) against selecting 
debate participants solely based upon party affiliation.  The CPD Candidate Selection 
Criteria For 1996 provide that the CPD automatically will extend "an invitation to the 
respective nominees of the major parties."  The CPD did, in fact, extend invitations to 
President Clinton and Senator Dole to participate in its debates solely on the basis of their 
being the respective nominees of the two political parties that founded the CPD. No other 
criteria were applied to either major party candidacy. 

34.  The CPD has also violated the provision in 11 C.F.R. Sec. 110.13(c) requiring that 
the criteria used to select candidates to participate in debates must be "objective." The 
selection criteria include both objective and subjective elements.  Perot met all of the 
elements that are objective.  However, the Republican and Democratic representatives on 
the CPD excluded Perot by claiming that he did not, in their view, satisfy the elements 
that are subjective. 

35.  The selection criteria at issue are unquestionably subjective.  For example, under the 
heading "Evidence of National Organization" the CPD plainly states:  "This criterion also 
encompasses more subjective indicators of a national campaign..." Similarly, the category 
"Signs of National Newsworthiness" calls for an analysis of the opinions of media 
managers, editors, columnists, journalists and pundits.  In essence, the CPD seeks to 
delegate part of its decision-making authority over the debates to the news media, whose 
professional role is to cover the news, not to shape it.  Under the heading, "Indicators of 
National Public Enthusiasm or Concern," the CPD proposes to rely upon findings of 
"significant" public opinion polls and reported attendance at meetings and rallies across 
the country.  The data considered and the interpretation of its significance invite 
subjective judgments. "Significant public opinion poll" is not defined.  The methodology 
of the polls is not prescribed, nor the questions to be asked, nor what results are 
considered determinative or indicative of a "greater than theoretical change of election."  
The criteria apparently are sufficiently flexible to permit CPD Directors to unanimously 
conclude that polls showing an overwhelming preference among voters that three 
candidates, including Perot, be included in the debates is insufficient to establish who the 
"principal rivals for the Presidency" are in the eyes of the public.  Polls can interpreted 
many ways and the question posed so as to minimize the impact of independent 
candidates and third parties. 

36.  The CPD's refusal to invite Perot and Choate to participate in the debates is in 
violation of its own criteria for determining who is to be invited.  Taking the three-
pronged subjective criteria, CPD's stated objectives, and removing its bipartisan bias, the 
criteria to determine who the "principal rivals for the Presidency" are and who possess a 
greater than "merely theoretical chance" meriting inclusion should be put this way: (1) 
Who is influencing debate?; (2) Who do the voters believe are the principal candidates?; 
(3) Who does the public believe should be in the debates? These evaluations too would 
involve subjective judgments, but they would make excluding Perot more difficult. 

37.  Through partisan application of impermissible subjective criteria, the CPD has 
illegally excluded the candidates of the Reform Party.  It also selected the major party 
candidates based solely upon their party affiliation. The CPD has violated the Debates 
Regulations mandate that only "pre-established objective criteria" are to be used in 
determining debate eligibility. 

38.  In addition to violating the provisions of 11 C.F.R. Sec. 110.13(c), prohibiting the 
selection of debate participation selection based solely upon party affiliation and 
eligibility not based on "pre-established objective criteria", the CPD has violated 11 
C.F.R. Sec. 110.13(a). That subsection provides that a staging organization may not 
"endorse, support or oppose political candidates or political parties."  The CPD's biased 
support for the two major parties is memorialized and operationalized in the historic and 
current composition of the CPD, and in the CPD's double standard for selection of debate 
participants. The Democratic and Republican candidates are invited automatically.  All 
third party and independent candidates, however, are subject to a separate set of rules - 
the significance of their candidacies is scrutinized using a predominantly subjective 
selection criteria.  This institutionalized double standard makes the CPD an organization 
which "supports" two political parties, and which "opposes" all others. 


Illegal Contributions and Expenditures by CPD 

39.  Because of the CPD's violations of Sec. 110.13(a) and (c), it does not qualify for the 
exemption from the prohibition on corporate contributions to federal candidates contained 
in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b by virtue of the Debates Regulation.  Section 441b of Title 2, 
U.S.C., prohibits any corporation from making "a contribution or expenditure in 
connection with any election at which presidential and vice presidential electors... are to 
be voted for..."  The CPD is a corporation; as well, it receives substantial contributions 
from corporations which it uses to pay the costs of its presidential debates program.  
Accordingly, the contributions the CPD has received from corporations for its debates 
program are illegal; the expenditures it has made for its debates program are likewise 
illegal.  It has failed to observe any of the legal requirements governing corporations 
engaging in political action. 

40.  The CPD has also violated 2 U.S.C. Secs. 433(a) and 434(a), which require political 
committees to register with the FEC and to file periodic reports. 

41.  FECA defines a "political committee" as "any committee, club association, or other 
group of persons which received contributions aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a 
calendar year or which makes expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a 
calendar year." 2 U.S.C. Sec 431(4)(A). 

42.  The CPD receives contributions in excess of $1,000 per election cycle, and makes 
expenditures in excess of $1,000 per election cycle, to serve the interest and purposes of 
the major party candidates and the major parties. 

43.  A "contribution" is defined as "any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of 
money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any 
election for Federal office."  2 U.S.C. Sec. 431(8)(A)(i). 

44.  An "expenditure" is defined as "any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, 
deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of 
influencing any election for Federal office."  2 U.S.C. Sec. 431 (9)(A)(i). 

45.  Once an organization is deemed a "political committee," it must submit to a number 
of FEC regulations, including the registration and reporting requirements derived from 2 
U.S.C. Secs. 433(a) and 434(a). 

46.  The granting to the CPD of an exemption from taxation under Internal Revenue Code 
Sec. 501(c)(3) (improperly so, Plaintiffs would contend) does not pre-empt the 
independent responsibility of the FEC, operating under a different statutory scheme than 
the IRS, to determine that the CPD is a corporation or political committee making illegal 
campaign contributions and expenditures, and that it has failed to register and file reports 
with the agency as required by law. 

47.  The CPD purports to be a nonpartisan voter education organization.  This self- 
characterization is demonstrably false.  The foregoing recitation of facts demonstrates 
that the CPD is a functional subsidiary of two permanent political committees, the 
Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee.  Moreover, in 
each election cycle it coordinates its debate program activities with two other political 
committees, - the respective committees of the presidential nominees of the Democratic 
and Republican Parties. 

48.  The CPD allows the major party candidates to dictate all of the details of the staging 
of debates.  The CPD allows the major party candidates to determine whether or not any 
third party candidates are included in the debates, and, if so, who they will be.  In 1992, 
the CPD deferred to an agreement between the major party candidates to include Perot in 
all three debates.  In 1996, there is no agreement between the major party candidates to 
include Perot in the debates, and the CPD, therefore, has excluded him. 

49.  The decision-making of the CPD is not independent, but is heavily influenced, if not 
totally dictated by the political interests and calculations of major party candidates and 
major party national committees - something it does not even bother to deny. The CPD 
receives contributions and makes expenditures for the "purpose of influencing any 
election for Federal office," namely, the election of the President of the United States.  It 
influences the election of the President by vesting control over the staging of debates and 
the decision whether to include third party candidates in the hands of the major parties 
and the major party candidates, to the extent they can reach agreement on those points.  It 
was created for this sole purpose and it has functioned to this day with this as its sole 
purpose. 


FEC Enforcement of CPD's Violations

50.  Any person who believes there has been a violation of any statute or regulation over 
which the FEC has jurisdiction may file a complaint with the agency. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 
437g(a)(1); 11 C.F.R. Sec. 111.4(a).  The Enforcement Division of the FEC Office of 
General Counsel dockets the private complaint as a Matter Under Review ("MUR") and 
is required to take steps to determine the merits. 

51.  Any complainant dissatisfied with the action the FEC takes in response to the 
complaint is entitled to petition this Court for judicial review of the agency's action or 
inaction. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437g(a)(8)(A).  In such a proceeding, this Court is empowered to: 


"declare that the dismissal of the complaint or the failure to act is contrary to law, and 
may direct the Commission to conform with such declaration within 30 days, failing 
which the complainant may bring, in the name of such complainant, a civil action to 
remedy the violation involved in the original complaint." 


2 U.S.C. Sec. 437g(a)(8)(C). Pursuant to this provision, the Court has equitable power "to 
remedy the violation" for the FEC's "failure to act."  The statute does not limit the Court 
to the scope of administrative remedies and sanctions that the agency would be able to 
impose acting independently of a court order. 

52.  Section 437g provides that in the usual case, the civil action by an aggrieved 
complainant will not be filed until after either (a) the FEC has dismissed the complaint, or 
(b) 120 days have passed since the filing of the complaint and the FEC has made no 
determination.  However, this Court may, in the exercise of its equitable powers and for 
the purpose of fulfilling the purpose and intent of the statute, waive the exhaustion of 
remedies requirement and shorten the timeline in order to prevent the statutory right of 
action from becoming a futile exercise because of delay. 

53.  Perot '96 duly filed a verified complaint with the FEC on September 20, 1996 
("FECA Complaint"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit G.  The FEC has 
made no determination with respect to the complaint and under its practices and 
procedures it would not in the ordinary course of business make a determination until 
after the substantial impending harm described in the FECA Complaint will be realized 
and irreparable harm suffered by Plaintiffs. 

54.  The FECA Complaint accurately sets forth that the CPD has knowingly and willfully 
violated (and continues to violate) the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 ("FECA") 
and the regulations promulgated by the FEC to implement FECA, including, but not 
limited to, 2 U.S.C. Secs. 441b, 433, and 11 C.F.R. Secs. 110.13(a) and (c). 

55.  An order directing the FEC to impose monetary sanctions on the CPD is plainly an 
inadequate remedy for their reparable harm that the CPD's violations of FECA have 
caused Plaintiffs. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order directing the FEC to order the 
CPD either to extend an invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in its 
debates, or else to cancel any debates staged by the CPD. 


COUNT II
Private Right of Action Against CPD

56.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraphs 1 
through 55. 

57.  In FECA, Congress created a private right of action to bring a civil action in this 
Court to obtain an order or judgment directly against a violator of FECA. 

58.  The filing of an administrative complaint with the FEC against the violator is a 
prerequisite for exercising the private right of action.  Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Sec. 
437g(a)(8), in the usual case there is a five step process: 


a. The party files the administrative complaint; 

b. The FEC either dismisses the complaint or makes no determination on the complaint 
within 120 days; 

c. The complainant petitions the United States District Court for the District of Columbia 
for judicial review of the FEC dismissal or inaction; 

d. The court declares that the dismissal of the complaint or the failure to act is contrary to 
law, and directs the FEC to comply with the declaration within 30 days; and 

e. The FEC fails to comply with the declaration within 30 days. 


59.  At the end of this process "the complainant may bring, in the name of such 
complainant, a civil action to remedy the violation involved in the original complaint." 2 
U.S.C. Sec. 437g(a)(8)(C). 

60.  Under basic principles of statutory construction and the inherent powers of the 
federal courts to ensure the effectiveness of their judgments and exercise of equitable 
powers, the statutory exhaustion requirements set forth above are not unwaivable 
limitations on judicial review. Rather, they set conditions that may be excused when 
insistence on exhaustion would threaten grave harm to the party seeking review and 
would not sensibly serve the purposes Congress envisioned in establishing that condition. 

61.  Plaintiffs have duly filed an administrative complaint with the FEC.  If Plaintiffs are 
denied the opportunity to invoke their private right of action at the present time, then the 
Court will be unable to grant them timely relief before the holding of the presidential 
debates, and any subsequent relief the Court might grant would be wholly inadequate. 

62.  In the instant case, administrative and preliminary judicial procedures set forth in the 
statute are inadequate and to exhaust them would be futile.  Those procedures should be 
waived by this Court, and this Count II should be deemed a private action against the 
CPD pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437g(a)(8)(C). 

63.  The illegal conduct of the CPD, as set forth in Count I, threatens Plaintiffs with 
immediate and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  The 
public interest will be served by the entry of injunctive relief, directing the CPD to invite 
Perot and his running mate to participate in the debates, on grounds that they have 
satisfied the objective criteria established by the CPD, or, in the event the Court deems 
application by the CPD of subjective criteria to have been permissible, on grounds that 
Plaintiffs have satisfied the CPD's objective and subjective criteria. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order directing the CPD either to 
extend an invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in its debates, or else to 
cancel any debates staged by the CPD. 


COUNT III
Constitutional Right of Action Against FEC 

64.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraphs 1 
through 63. 

65.  There exists in this nation a constitutional right of citizens to create and develop new 
political parties. Norman v. Reed, 504 U.S. 279 (1992).  Indeed, competing ideas and 
governmental policies are the core of the electoral process and the First Amendment 
freedoms of speech and association.  The right of individuals to associate for the 
advancement of their political beliefs and to create new political parties are fundamental 
rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. 

66.  The First Amendment also guarantees that the government shall be neutral and 
nonpartisan in political affairs.  As stated by the former Chief Judge Abner Mikva of the 
District of Columbia Court of Appeals:  "The government of any democracy, let alone 
one shaped by the values of our Constitution's First Amendment, must avoid tilting the 
electoral playing field, lest the democracy itself become tarnished."  The federal 
government's duty of neutrality in electoral affairs also flows from the due process clause 
of the Fifth Amendment. 

67.  FECA and its implementing regulations require (with exceptions not applicable here) 
that corporations which sponsor federal candidate debates must be nonpartisan and they 
must stage debates in accordance with nonpartisan principles.  Most notable among these 
nonpartisan principles required of corporate debate sponsors is the use of pre-existing 
objective criteria to select candidate debate participants.  This year, CPD has utilized 
subjective selection criterion and has not been reigned in, as required, by FEC. 

68.  From the formation of the CPD in 1987 through the present, overwhelming evidence 
has accumulated as to the partisan, political character of the CPD.  The subjective 
selection criteria which CPD has adopted in three successive election cycles demonstrates 
that such criteria are designed principally to keep third-party candidates out of 
presidential debates.  Meanwhile, CPD's criteria include enough subjective loopholes so 
that when the extraordinary situation arises that the major parties desire to have a third 
party candidate in the debates, that goal can be accomplished as well. The automatic 
inclusion of the candidates of the Democratic and Republican Parties, and the use of a 
subjective "realistic chance" of winning standard solely to measure candidates from other 
parties, has resulted in this case in a de facto exclusion of Perot from the debates. 

69.  The FEC's failure to enforce the nonpartisanship requirements of the Debates 
Regulations against the CPD, and its failure to deem the CPD to be a "political 
committee," is a lapse in enforcement by the FEC that violates the a federal agency's 
constitutional duty to remain neutral in election contests.  Moreover, FEC's partisan 
enforcement/nonenforcement actions to support the interest of the Democratic and 
Republican Parties, to the disadvantage of candidates from other parties, is a violation of 
Plaintiffs' rights under the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.  The FEC's 
nonenforcement in these circumstances constitutes an impermissible "tilting of the 
electoral playing field." 

70.  The continuing operation of CPD as a debates sponsoring organization using its 
current selection criteria to exclude the significant Reform Party candidacy of Perot from 
the debates is a structural inequality in the election process that would cease to exist but 
for the failure of the FEC to enforce its Debates Regulations and other FEC mandates.  
The failure and refusal of the FEC to take any steps toward stopping the CPD from 
illegally using corporate funds to sponsor debates on behalf of the major parties or 
forcing the CPD to conduct its debates in accordance with FEC regulations, constitutes an 
unconstitutional exercise of discretion, resulting in violation of Plaintiffs' fundamental 
constitutional rights under the First and Fifth Amendments. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order directing the FEC to order the 
CPD either to extend an invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in the 
debates, or to cancel any debates staged and sponsored by the CPD, and for such other 
and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. 


COUNT IV
FEC Ultra Vires Regulations and Corresponding CPD Violation of FECA 

71.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraph 1 
through 70. 

72.  The FEC has promulgated a regulation that is wholly outside of the statutory 
authority conferred on it by FECA. FECA categorically bans any contributions or 
expenditures by corporations in connection with any election to any political office, and 
makes specific definitional exemptions only in several unrelated areas.  2 U.S.C. Sec. 
441b.  However, in violation of this clear statutory language and intent, the FEC has 
promulgated the Debates Regulations that purport to allow corporations to make 
contributions and expenditures in connection with candidate debates.  These regulations 
are wholly ultra vires and constitute, by definition, invalid administrative lawmaking and 
a violation of the separation of powers.  The FEC itself took the position in 1975 that it 
was illegal under FECA for corporations to spend money on (or raise corporate money 
for) bipartisan debates which excluded other candidates. 

73.  Because these regulations are unconstitutional, any and all expenditures, made by the 
CPD are illegal under FECA.  Likewise, all contributions to the CPD from corporations 
for the purposes of intervening in the presidential debates are illegal. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order prohibiting any further 
expenditures by, or corporate contributions to, the CPD for the purposes of intervening in 
the 1996 presidential campaign, including sponsoring campaign debates. 


COUNT V
CPD Violation of Equal Protection in the Electoral Process 

74.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraph 1 
through 73. 

75.  Because the CPD's entire capacity to sponsor presidential debates campaigns is based 
on an ultra vires FEC regulation, the CPD has unlawfully been delegated the FEC's 
administrative authority over campaigns and has become a de facto state factor for 
constitutional purposes. By assuming the critical public function of sponsoring the only 
televised nationwide presidential debates in the 1996 presidential campaign, the CPD is 
engaging in state action. 

76.  The CPD has violated the Equal Protection guarantee of neutrality in the electoral 
process by applying a double standard that automatically qualifies the Democratic and 
Republican presidential nominees for debate inclusion but subjecting other party 
nominees to a lengthy series of tests, some of them objective, but most of them subjective 
and arbitrary.  This bifurcated mode of selection constitutes a per se violation of Equal 
Protection, destroying neutrality in the political process, applying the laws unequally, and 
enforcing unconstitutional bias against third parties and independent candidates generally, 
and against Perot specifically. 

77.  The CPD has violated the Equal Protection guarantee of neutrality in the electoral 
process by subjecting candidates nominated by parties other than the Democrats and 
Republicans to an arbitrary, irrational, subjective and thoroughly political process of 
selection for the candidate debates.  This process has enforced unconstitutional bias 
against third parties and independent candidates generally, and against Perot specifically. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order directing the CPD to either 
extend an invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in the debates, or to 
cancel any debates stages and sponsored by the CPD, and for such other and further relief 
as this Court deems just and proper. 


COUNT VI
CPD Violation  of First Amendment
Freedoms of Speech and Association

78.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraphs 1 
through 77. 

79.  As a de facto state actor, the CPD's exclusion of Plaintiffs Perot and Choate from the 
limited public forum of nationally televised presidential debates constitutes viewpoint-
based First Amendment discrimination since they would have been certified 
automatically by the CPD to participate had they been the nominees of the Democratic or 
Republican Parties, regardless of their standing in the polls, opinions of journalists, 
reviews by pundits, and so on.  Thus, the CPD is unconstitutionally excluding Plaintiffs 
Perot and Choate from a limited public forum on the basis of their choice to associate 
with the Reform Party rather than the Democratic or Republican Parties. 

80.  The CPD's exclusion of Perot and Choate from the presidential debates violates First 
Amendment freedoms and association because it discriminates based on political party 
membership and thus constitutes an unlawful viewpoint-based discrimination. 

81.  The CPD's exclusion of Perot and Choate from the debates impinges on the right of 
the Plaintiffs to participate in the electoral process, violates their right to speak and 
associate freely, and imposes an impermissible prior restraint on Plaintiffs.  Yet, the 
decision advances no rational public interest, much less a compelling one. 

82.  the CPD's criteria for including and excluding nonmajor party presidential candidates 
are unconstitutionally vague, allowing for the kind of arbitrary and discriminatory 
enforcement and interpretation that occurred here. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order directing the CPD to either 
extend an invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in the debates, or to 
cancel any debates stages and sponsored by the CPD, and for such other and further relief 
as this Court deems just and proper. 


COUNT VII
CPD and FEC Violation of Procedural Due Process 

83.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference herein the allegations of paragraphs 1 
through 82. 

84.  The CPD an FEC have violated Plaintiffs' procedural due process rights by depriving 
them of their constitutionally protected liberty interests in political speech and association 
without providing them adequate notice, a fair hearing, a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard with regard to the candidate selection process, or the right to appeal. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray this Court enter an order directing the CPD and FEC to 
either extend an invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in the debates, or 
to cancel any debates staged and sponsored by the CPD, and for such other and further 
relief as this Court deems just and proper.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION,
999 E Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20463

Plaintiff,

v.

THE CHRISTIAN COALITION.
(Ralph E. Reed, Jr., Registered Agent)
1801-L Sara Drive
Chesapeake, VA 23320,

Defendant.

Civil Action No.


COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE AND
OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF


Jurisdiction

1. This action seeks declaratory, injunctive and other appropriate
relief pursuant to the express authority granted to the Federal Election
Commission ("Commission" or "FEC") by the Federal Election
Campaign Act of 1971, as amended ("the Act") (codified at 2 U.S.C.
Sections 431 et seq.).

2. This court has jurisdiction over this suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Section 1345 as an action brought by an agency of the United States
expressly authorized to sue by an Act of Congress. See 2 U.S.C.
Sections 437d(a)(6) and 437g(a)(6)(A).


Venue

3. Venue is properly found in the District of Columbia in accordance
with Section 437g(a)(6)(A) as defendant The Christian Coalition can
be found or transacts business in this district.


Parties

4. Plaintiff Federal Election Commission is the independent agency
of the United States government with exclusive primary jurisdiction
over the administration, interpretation and civil enforcement of the
Act. See generally 2 U.S.C. Sections 437c(b)(1), 437d(a), and
437g. The Commission is authorized to institute investigations of
possible violations of the Act 2 U.S.C. Sections 437g(a)(1) and (2),
and has exclusive jurisdiction to initiate civil actions in the United
States district courts to obtain judicial enforcement of the Act. 2
U.S.C. Sections 437c(b)(1) and 437d(e).

5. Defendant The Christian Coalition ("Christian Coalition" or "the
Corporation") is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia and transacts business in this district.
Christian Coalition has affiliated state organizations, which are
separately incorporated and over which it exercises control. Dr.
Marion G. ("Pat") Robertson is Chairman of the Board of Directors
of Christian Coalition. Dr. Ralph E. Reed, Jr. is the Executive
Director of Christian Coalition and also is a member of the Board of
Directors.


Administrative Proceedings

6. On February 27, 1992, the Democratic Party of Virginia filed a
complaint with the Commission alleging that defendant Christian
Coalition had violated the Act. The complaint was designated by the
Commission as Matter Under Review ("MUR") 3475 for
administrative purposes. On March 2 1992, the Commission notified
Christian Coalition that the complaint had been filed and provided
defendant with a copy of the complaint in MUR 3475. On March 18,
1992, Christian Coalition filed a response to the complaint with the
Commission. See 2 U.S.C. Section 437g(a)(1).

7. On March 19, 1992, the Democratic Party of Virginia submitted a
supplement to its complaint in MUR 3475. On March 23, 1992, the
Commission notified Christian Coalition that the supplement had
been filed and provided defendant with a copy of the supplement in
MUR 3475. Christian Coalition filed a response to the supplement
with the Commission on May 11, 1992.

8. On September 15, 1992, the Commission, by the affirmative votes
of at least four of its members, found reason to believe in MUR 3475
that defendant Christian Coalition violated provisions of the Act, and
initiated an investigation into those violations. Defendant was notified
of the Commission's actions by letter dated September 28, 1992. See
2 U.S.C. Section 437g(a)(2).

9. On October 21, 1992, the Democratic National Committee filed a
complaint with the Commission alleging that Christian Coalition had
violated the Act. The complaint was designated by the Commission
as MUR 3669 for administrative purposes. On October 27, 1992, the
Commission notified Christian Coalition that the complaint had been
filed and provided defendant with a copy of the complaint in MUR
3669. Christian Coalition filed a response to the complaint with the
Commission on January 4, 1993. See 2 U.S.C. Section 437g(a)(1).

10. On July 20, 1993, the Commission, by the affirmative votes of at
least four of its members, merged MURs 3475 and 3669, found
reason to believe that defendant Christian Coalition violated
provisions of the Act, and initiated an investigation into those
violations. Defendant was notified of the Commission's July 20,
1993 actions by letter dated July 27, 1993. 2 U.S.C. Section
437g(a)(2).

11. On October 22, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit held that the Commission, as then
constituted with two non-voting ex officio members selected by
Congress, see 2 U.S.C. Section 437c(a)(1), violated the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. FEC v. NRA
Political Victory Fund, 6 F.3d 821, 821 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ("NRA"),
cert. dismissed for want of jurisdiction, 115 S.Ct. 537 (1994).
Specifically, the court of appeals held that Congress exceeded its
authority by placing the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the
House of Representatives, or their designees, on the Commission as
ex officio members without the right to vote. 6 F.3d at 824. Thus, it
concluded that the Commission, as then structured, lacked authority
to prosecute an enforcement suit.

12. Following the NRA decision, the Commission voted on October
26, 1993 to reconstitute itself as a six-member commission without
ex officio members, thereby conforming with the court of appeals'
decision. The Commission also adopted procedures for revoting or
ratifying decisions pertaining to open enforcement matters.

13. On April 5, 1994, the Commission, by the affirmative votes of at
least four of its members, again found reason to believe that
defendant Christian Coalition violated provisions of the Act.
Defendant was notified of the Commission's actions by letter dated
April 7, 1994. 2 U.S.C. Section 437g(a)(2).

14. The Commission's General Counsel notified defendant Christian
Coalition by letter dated July 28, 1995, that the General Counsel was
prepared to recommend that the Commission find probable cause to
believe that violations of the Act by defendants had occurred, and
provided defendants with a brief stating the position of the General
Counsel on the factual and legal issues of the case. See 2 U.S.C.
437g(a)(3). Christian Coalition filed a response with the Commission
on September 15, 1995.

15. On September 26, 1995, the Commission, by the affirmative
votes of at least four of its members, found probable cause to believe
that defendant Christian Coalition violated provisions of the Act and
thereafter endeavored for a period of not less than thirty (30) days to
correct such violations by the informal methods of conference,
conciliation and persuasion, and to enter into conciliation agreements
with defendants. Defendant was notified of the Commission's
September 26, 1995 actions by letter dated October 2, 1995. See 2
U.S.C. Section 437g(a)(4)(A)(i)

16. Unable through informal methods to secure an acceptable
conciliation agreement, the Commission, on May 7, 1996,
determined, by the affirmative votes of at least four of its members,
to authorize the initiation of this civil suit for relief in federal district
court against defendant. See 2 U.S.C. Section 437g(a)(6). Defendant
Christian Coalition was notified of the Commission's May 7, 1996
action by letter dated May 9, 1996.

17. The Commission has satisfied all of the jurisdictional
requirements under the Act that are prerequisites to filing this action


Relevant Law and Statutory Provisions

18. 2 U.S.C. Section 441b, a provision of the Act, prohibits
corporations from making contributions or expenditures from
corporate treasury funds in connection with federal elections.

19. 2 U.S.C. Section 431(8)(A)(i) provides that the term
"contribution" includes "any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or
deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the
purpose of influencing any election for Federal office."

20. For the purposes of 2 U.S.C. Section 441b, the terms
"contribution or expenditure" also "include any direct or indirect
payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money, or
any services, or anything of value . . . to any candidate, campaign
committee, or political party or organization, in connection with any
election" to Federal office. See 2 U.S.C. Section 441b(b)(2).

21. 2 U.S.C. Section 431(17) of the Act defines the term
"independent expenditure" to mean "an expenditure by a person
expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified
candidate which is made without cooperation or consultation with
any candidate, or any authorized committee or agent of such
candidate, and which is not made in concert with, or at the request or
suggestion of, any candidate, or any authorized committee or agent
of such candidate."

22. 2 U.S.C. Section 434(c)( 1 ) requires that any person other than
a political committee who makes an independent expenditure in
excess of $250 during a calendar year file a statement with the
Commission providing information, such as the name of the
candidate for whom the expenditure is being made, whether the
expenditure is in support of, or in opposition to the candidate listed,
and whether the expenditure was made in cooperation, consultation,
or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate or
any authorized committee or agent of such candidate See 2 U.S.C.
Section 434(c)(2).


First Cause of Action

23. Paragraphs 1 through 22, inclusive, are incorporated herein by
reference.

24. During the campaign periods prior to the 1990 1992 and 1994
federal elections, Christian Coalition made expenditures, directly
from its corporate treasury and/or through its subordinate state
affiliates, to influence the election of candidates for federal office.
The Corporation coordinated, cooperated, and/or consulted with the
campaigns of these candidates before making these expenditures and,
therefore, they do not qualify as "independent expenditures under 2
U.S.C. Section 431 (17). These expenditures, discussed below,
constitute in-kind contributions to the candidates and campaigns for
federal office by a corporation in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section 441b.


In-kind Contributions to Bush-Quayle '92 Primary and Bush-Quayle
'92 General Election Committees

25. Bush-Quayle '92 Primary Committee, Inc. was the authorized
political committee of President George Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle during their 1992 campaign for the nomination of the
Republican Party for President and Vice-President of the United
States. Bush-Quayle '92 General Committee, Inc. was the authorized
political committee of President George Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle for their 1992 general election campaign. See 2 U.S.C.
Sections 431(4)-(6).

26. Christian Coalition, acting in coordination, cooperation, and/or
consultation with the Bush-Quayle '92 Primary Committee, Inc. and
the Bush-Quayle '92 General Committee, Inc. made expenditures for

1992 elections for President and Vice President. In addition,
Christian Coalition, acting in coordination, cooperation and/or
consultation with the Bush-Quayle '92 General Committee, Inc.
made expenditures for the preparation and distribution of
approximately 28 million voter guides in connection with the 1992
election for President and Vice-President of the United States.

27. The expenditures described in paragraph 26 constitute in-kind
contributions by the Corporation in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section
441b.


Helms for Senate Committee

28. Helms for Senate was the authorized campaign committee of
Senator Jesse Helms for his 1990 campaign for election to the United
States Senate from the State of North Carolina. 2 U.S.C. Section
431 (5).

29. Christian Coalition, acting in coordination, cooperation, and/or
consultation with Helms for Senate, made expenditures directly
and/or through its state affiliate to produce and distribute
approximately 750,000 voter guides in connection with Senator
Helms' November 1990 general election campaign. Acting in
coordination, cooperation, and/or consultation with Helms for
Senate, Christian Coalition additionally made expenditures directly
and/or through its state affiliate to make approximately 29,800
telephone calls as part of a get-out-the-vote telephone bank operation
in connection with the November 1990 general election in North
Carolina.

30. The expenditures described in paragraph 29 constitute in-kind
contributions by the Corporation to Helms for Senate in violation of
2 U.S.C. Section 441b.


Oliver North for U.S. Senate Committee

31. The Oliver North for U.S. Senate Committee, Inc. was the

32. Christian Coalition, acting in coordination, cooperation, and/or
consultation with the Oliver North for U.S. Senate Committee, Inc.
made expenditures directly and/or through its state affiliate to produce
and distribute approximately 1,750,000 voter guides in connection
with the 1994 general election campaign in Virginia. Christian
Coalition, acting in coordination, cooperation, and/or consultation
with this committee also made expenditures directly and/or through
its state affiliate for voter identification and get-out-the vote-efforts in
connection with the 1994 general election campaign in Virginia.

33. The expenditures described in paragraph 32 constitute in-kind
contributions by the Corporation to the Oliver North for U.S. Senate
Committee, Inc. in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section 441b.

distribute approximately 240,000 voter guides in connection with this
election.

36. The expenditures described in paragraph 35 constitute in-kind
contributions by the Corporation to the Inglis for Congress
Committee in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section 441b.


J.D. Hayworth for Congress Committee

37. J.D. Hayworth for Congress was the authorized campaign
committee of J.D. Hayworth in connection with his 1994 campaign
for election to the United States House of Representatives from the
Sixth District of Arizona. See 2 U.S.C. Section 431(5).

38. Christian Coalition, acting in coordination, cooperation, and/or
consultation with J.D. Hayworth for Congress, made expenditures
directly and/or through its state affiliates for voter identification and
get-out-the-vote efforts in connection with the 1994 general election
in the Sixth District of Arizona. In addition, Christian Coalition,
acting in coordination, cooperation, and/or consultation with J.D.
Hayworth for Congress, made expenditures directly and/or through
its state affiliates to produce and distribute approximately 200,000
voter guides in connection with this election.

39. The expenditures described in paragraph 38 constitute in-kind
contributions by the Corporation to J.D. Hayworth for Congress in
violation of 2 U.S.C. Section 441b.


Second Cause of Action

40. Paragraphs 1 through 22, inclusive are incorporated herein by
reference.

41. The National Republican Senatorial Committee ("NRSC") was
and is a political committee as defined by 2 U.S.C. Section 431 (4).
The NRSC is a national party committee dedicated to the election of
Republican candidates to the United States Senate.

42. During 1990, Christian Coalition, acting in coordination,
cooperation, and/or consultation with the NRSC, made expenditures
directly and through its state affiliates to produce and distribute
between five and ten million voter guides in seven states in
connection with the November 1990 federal elections for the United
States Senate.

43. The expenditures described in paragraph 42 constitute in-kind
contributions by the Corporation to NRSC in violation of 2 U.S.C.
Section 441 b.


Third Cause of Action

44. Paragraphs 1 through 22, inclusive, are incorporated herein by
reference.

45. In three instances discussed in more detail below, Christian
Coalition made corporate expenditures directly and/or through its
state affiliates for public communications expressly advocating the
election or defeat of clearly identified candidates for federal office.

46. Christian Coalition, through its subordinate state affiliate in
Montana, made expenditures in excess of $250 during a calendar
year for a two day conference open to the public held during January
1992. At this conference, Dr. Ralph Reed expressly advocated the
defeat of United States Representative Pat Williams. Thus, the
conference costs were independent expenditures by Christian
Coalition in opposition to the candidacy of Representative Pat
Williams, in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section 441 b. In addition, the
Corporation violated 2 U.S.C. Section 434(c) by failing to report the
costs of the conference as an independent expenditure in opposition
to the candidacy of Representative Pat Williams.

47. During 1994, Christian Coalition made expenditures in excess of
$250 during a calendar year for the preparation and distribution of a
direct mail package entitled "Reclaim America" which included, inter
alia, a cover letter and a scorecard.

48. The cover letter, signed by Pat Robertson, asserted that the
enclosed scorecard would be an important tool for affecting the
outcome of the upcoming elections. It stated: "This SCORECARD
will give America's Christian voters the facts they will need to
distinguish between GOOD and MISGUIDED Congressmen ...."
The scorecard listed and characterized multiple issues upon which
votes had been taken in the United States Senate in 1992, 1993 and
1994, and in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1993 and 1994. It
stated the Corporation's position on each bill or amendment
involved. Each senator's and representative's votes were listed as a
"++" or a "-", followed by percentages. The scorecard stated: "A
score of 100% means the Congressman supported Christian
Coalition position on every vote. A score of 0% means the
Congressman never supported a Christian Coalition position."

49. The title, "Reclaim America," the format and content of the
scorecard, and the content of the cover letter together constituted
express advocacy of the election or defeat of clearly identified
candidates for federal office. The Corporation's expenditures for this
mailing constituted independent expenditures on behalf of the
candidates who received high scores on the scorecard, and against
the candidates who received low scores, which violated 2 U.S.C.
Section 441b. The Corporation also violated 2 U.S.C. Section
434(c) by failing to report the costs of this program as independent
expenditures.

50. Prior to the July 9, 1994 primary election in Georgia, Christian
Coalition, through its subordinate state affiliate in Georgia, made
expenditures in excess of $250 during a calendar year for the
preparation and distribution of a combination Congressional
Scorecard and cover letter, which stated in part: "The only incumbent
Congressman who has a Primary election is Congressman Newt
Gingrich - a Christian Coalition, Inc. 100 percenter." The cover letter
encouraged the reader to take the scorecard to the voting booth. The
combination of the cover letter and scorecard constituted express
advocacy of the re-election of United States Representative Newt
Gingrich. Therefore, the expenditures in connection with this mailing
constituted independent expenditures by Christian Coalition that
violated 2 U.S.C. Section 441b. Christian Coalition also violated 2
U.S.C. Section 434(c) by failing to report the costs of this mailing as
independent expenditures.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

In the Matter of
The Christian Coalition

MUR 3669

STATEMENT OF REASONS

COMMISSIONER SCOTT E. THOMAS
VICE CHAIRMAN JOHN WARREN MCGARRY
COMMISSIONER DANNY LEE MCDONALD

Though much will be said and written about the part of this case the
Federal Election Commission ("the Commission") took to court, the
real story is what got swept under the Commission's carpet. On July
30, 1996, the Commission filed suit against the Christian Coalition
for making corporate contributions in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section
441b. Unfortunately, this action only came after the Commission
split and failed to act upon the General Counsel's legal
recommendation to file suit against the Christian Coalition for failing
to register and report as a political committee in violation of 2 U.S.C.
Sections 433 and 434.

We agree with the General Counsel that the Christian Coalition,
which has raised and spent over a million dollars on behalf of federal
candidates, must register with the Commission and publicly report
and fully disclose its federal campaign activity--just as any other such
entity would have to register and report with the Commission.
Although Commissioners Aikens and Elliott argue that the Christian
Coalition is simply an issue advocacy group, the record clearly
establishes that the Christian Coalition-unlike other so-called "issue
groups"- seeks to influence issues and public policy through the
election of candidates to public office. We believe that the evidence
detailing the purpose and breadth of the Christian Coalition's federal
campaign activity is both overwhelming and irrefutable.

The Christian Coalition has every right to be involved in the political
process as citizens and voters. In so doing, however, they must still
play by the same rules as everyone else.

I.

The Federal Election Campaign Fund Act of 1971, as amended ("the
Act"), defines a "political committee" as "any committee, club,
association, or other group of persons which receives contributions
aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a calendar year or which
makes expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a
calendar year." 2 U.S.C. Section 431(4). In construing this statutory
term, the Supreme Court has held that an organization is not a
political committee unless, in addition to crossing the $1,000
statutory threshold of federal contributions or expenditures, the
organization is under the control of a candidate or its major purpose
is the nomination or election of candidates to any public office. See
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 79 (1976); FEC v. Massachusetts
Citizens for life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 252, 262 (1986)("FEC v.
MCFL"). Thus, once an organization has received more than $1,000
in expenditures or made more than $1,000 in expenditures and has
met the major purpose test, it becomes a political committee pursuant
to Section 431. Any organization that qualifies as a political
committee must register with the Commission and file periodic
reports of all its federal election receipts and disbursements for
disclosure to the public. 2 U.S.C. Sections 433 and 434. A political
committee is subject to limits when making expenditures in
coordination with a candidate, but may make unlimited expenditures
on behalf of a candidate if no coordination is involved. 2 U.S.C.
Sections 441a(a)(1)(A), (2)(A), (7)(B)

The Act also prohibits "any corporation whatever" from making any
contributions or expenditures in connection with any federal election
and prohibits any candidate or committee from knowingly accepting
such a prohibited contribution or expenditure. 2 U.S.C. Section
441b. In FEC v. MCFL, supra, the Supreme Court interpreted
Section 441b to mean that expenditures for communications not
coordinated with a candidate's campaign must constitute "express
advocacy" to be subject to the Section 441b prohibition. Thus, a
corporation may use its treasury funds to make nonpartisan,
independent communications to the general public, including voter
registration, GOTV materials, telephone banks, and nonpartisan
voter guides. If, however, any of these activities expressly advocate
the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or are
undertaken in coordination with a federal candidate, thereby losing
their independence, the corporate expenditures for those
communications constitute violations of 2 U.S.C. Section 441 b.

The Act allows corporations to use their treasury funds to operate a
separate segregated fund for political purposes. 2 U.S.C. Section
441b(b)(2)(c). The fund may solicit contributions from the
corporation's stockholders, executive and administrative personnel,
members, and the family members of such individuals. 2 U.S.C.
Section 441b(b)(4). Such a fund is a political committee and, like
other political committees, is subject to the Act's registration and
reporting requirements. See 2 U.S.C. Sections 431(4)(B), 433, 434.
A separate segregated fund's expenditures which are coordinated
with candidates are subject to contribution limits, but non-
coordinated expenditures have no limits.

For whatever reason, the Christian Coalition has chosen not to
establish a separate segregated fund, as have other corporations, to
carry out its political goals. Nor has it characterized itself as a
"political committee" in its own right. Thus, it has long avoided any
disclosure of its funding. At the same time, though subjecting itself
to the ban of Section 441b, it has asserted that none of its actions
qualify as coordinated or "express advocacy" activity. It has claimed
the best of all worlds, in other words.

On February 27,1992, the Chairman of the Democratic Party of
Virginia filed a complaint with the Commission against the Christian
Coalition and the Bush-Quayle '92 Primary Committee ("Bush-
Quayle Committee") with respect to an appearance and address by
Vice President Quayle in November, 1991, at a political forum and
workshop sponsored by the Christian Coalition. The complaint also
alleged that the Christian Coalition is a "political group active in
national politics, and especially active in supporting Republican
candidates." Later, the Commission received an amendment to the
complaint alleging that the Christian Coalition was also active in the
1990 re-election campaign of Senator Helms in North Carolina. This
matter was designated MUR 3475.

The Office of General Counsel prepared a report for Commission
consideration that contained a factual and legal analysis of the
allegations presented in the complaint as well as responses to the
complaint received from the Bush-Quayle Committee and the
Christian Coalition. On September 15, 1992, the Commission
unanimously approved the General Counsel's legal recommendations
with respect to the Christian Coalition and found reason to believe
that the Christian Coalition violated 2 U.S.C. Sections 433, 434 by
failing to register and report as a political committee and Section 441b
for using corporate funds to make contributions to federal candidates.
The Commission based its finding on Christian Coalition 1990 and
1991 activities, which included voter guide and get-out-the-vote
("GOTV") programs in North Carolina, and the Coalition's
November, 1991 forum in Virginia which was entitled "The Road to
Victory." The Commission unanimously approved these
recommendations by a vote of 6-0 and authorized the General
Counsel to conduct an investigation of the matter.

On October 21,1992, the Democratic National Committee filed a
complaint with the Commission similarly alleging that the Christian
Coalition has "engaged in avowedly and predominantly partisan-and
therefore impermissible-get-out-the-vote efforts, which it has
conducted in coordination both with individual Republican candidates
and with the national Republican committees." The complaint
asserted that these activities violated Section 441b because they
involved "illegal corporate expenditures made to benefit particular
candidates and political parties" and that the Christian Coalition failed
to comply with the registration and reporting requirements of
Sections 433 and 434. In support of these allegations, the complaint
pointed to Christian Coalition campaign activity in the states of North
Carolina, New York, Montana, South Carolina, Florida and
Pennsylvania. This complaint was designated MUR 3669.

On July, 20, 1993, the Commission voted to merge MUR 3669 and
MUR 3475 and made additional findings. The Commission found
reason to believe that the Christian Coalition violated 2 U.S.C.
Sections 441a(a), 441a(f) and 434(b) by making excessive in-kind
contributions to federal campaigns and not reporting them, and by
accepting excessive contributions from the National Republican
Senatorial Committee and not reporting them. Later, on April 4,
1994, the Commission revoted its reason to believe findings in order
to conform to the court's opinion in FEC v. National Rifle
Association Political Victory Fund, 115 S. Ct. 537 (1994).

In the aftermath of the reason to believe findings, the Office of
General Counsel conducted a thorough and comprehensive
investigation of the Christian Coalition's political activities. The
General Counsel's Office reviewed thousands of pages of material
received in response to document requests and interrogatories as well
as over 120 video and audio tapes. The General Counsel's Office
also conducted 17 formal depositions and a number of informal
interviews.

After completing and reviewing the results of this investigation, the
General Counsel recommended that the Commission find probable
cause to believe either that (1) the Christian Coalition is a political
committee, with corresponding registration and reporting obligations
and limitations on its receipts and contributions to other committees;
or, in the alternative (2) that the Christian Coalition is an incorporated
entity which has made and failed to report prohibited contributions to
political committees and candidates. On September 26,1995, the
Commission voted to approve these probable cause
recommendations.

When the statutorily required attempts at conciliation failed, the
Commission authorized the Office of General Counsel to file a civil
suit for relief against the Christian Coalition in United States District
Court in connection with MUR 3669. Unlike the probable cause
findings, however, there were not four votes to proceed on the
alternative legal theories in litigation. Commissioners Aikens and
Elliott voted to proceed only on the prohibited corporate contribution
theory and not on the political committee theory.


II.

In a 192 page brief reviewing the results of its investigation into the
political activities of the Christian Coalition, the General Counsel's
Office exhaustively details the overwhelming evidence supporting its
legal conclusion that the Christian Coalition is a political committee
and should publicly disclose its campaign activity. It is not our
purpose here to repeat, discuss and analyze each and every piece of
evidence examined in that brief. We simply seek to highlight several
of the more compelling pieces of evidence and explain why we
believe it leads to the irrefutable conclusion that the Christian
Coalition has been operating as a federal political committee within
the meaning of 2 U.S.C. Section 431 (4)

As we explain above, an organization must meet two criterion in
order for it to be considered a federal political committee. First, it
must receive contributions or make expenditures in excess of $1,000
for federal election races. Second, a major purpose of the
organization must be the nomination or election of candidates for any
public office. The record in this matter indicates that the Christian
Coalition easily satisfies both standards.


A.

The federal political activity of the Christian Coalition far surpasses
the $1,000 threshold of federal activity statutorily required for
political committee status. Based upon the evidence developed in its
investigation, the Commission unanimously found probable cause to
believe that the Christian Coalition made prohibited contributions in
the amount of at least $1,450,420 in violation of 2 U.S.C. Section
441b. This included in-kind contributions totaling at least (a)
$980,000 to the 1992 Bush-Quayle campaign; (b) $52,000 to the
1990 Helms for Senate Committee; (c) $61,000 to the Oliver North
for Senate Committee; (d) $4,200 to the 1992 Inglis for Congress
Committee; (e) $3,500 to the 1994 Hayworth for Congress
Committee; and (f) $325,000 to the National Republican Senatorial
Committee in 1990. In addition, the Christian Coalition accepted a
$64,000 contribution from the NRSC for use in the Coalition's 1990
voter guide campaign.

The record plainly establishes that the Christian Coalition has
received contributions or made expenditures aggregating well in
excess of $1,000. Moreover, the factual record shows that this
federal activity was not simply the result of some unintended activity
with federal consequences or an isolated incident occurring in just
one election cycle. Rather, the General Counsel's investigation
indicates that the Christian Coalition conducted this federal activity in
the 1990, 1992, and 1994 election cycles-the first three election
cycles following the Coalition's creation in 1989. Based on this high
level of federal financial activity, the Coalition has more than met the
statutory definition of "political committee" found at 2 U.S.C.
Section 431 (4)(A). The next question, then, is whether the
Coalition's "major purpose" is campaign activity.


B.

In Buckley v. Valeo, supra, the Supreme Court expressed concern
that the Act's definition of political committee "could be interpreted to
reach groups engaged purely in issue discussion." 424 U.S. at 79.
The Court did not want an issues organization that inadvertently
spent over $1,000 on a federal candidate to be suddenly forced to
register and report its activities as a federal political committee. To
avoid such a result, the Court stated that an organization's major
purpose must be for the nomination or election of candidates in order
for that organization to be subject to the reporting obligations and
contribution limitations of a political committee.

Although the Christian Coalition asserts that its major purpose as an
organization is simply to discuss issues and influence legislation, the
record establishes that the Christian Coalition is decidedly not a
group "engaged purely in issue discussion." Id. Indeed, the record
shows that the Christian Coalition seeks to achieve legislative success
and political power through the election of like-minded candidates to
federal office. Moreover, the Coalition has sought to accomplish its
political goals through the building of a political organization on a
precinct level which is more akin to a political party than an issue
advocacy group.

Just as the Republican or Democratic Party seeks to advance its own
and its supporters' ideology through the nomination and election of
candidates, so too does the Christian Coalition. It seeks to promote
its views and obtain political power through the electoral process.
The Christian Coalition's self-described objective, as voiced
repeatedly by its leadership at Coalition conferences and political
training sessions, is to elect candidates at the local, state and federal
level for the purpose of advancing its ideology. By its own
admission,the Christian Coalition proposes to influence elections and
unabashedly declares that it intends to become the most powerful
political organization in the country by the year 2000.

Based on the overwhelming evidence before us, we conclude that the
Christian Coalition's major purpose is the nomination or election of
candidates to elective public office. The General Counsel's Probable
Cause Brief painstakingly details the many Christian Coalition
statements and actions which lead to this conclusion. See General
Counsel's Brief at pages 13-162. Particularly compelling are
statements made by the Christian Coalition itself-both by its
leadership publicly and by the organization in its written materials.

In a recruitment and training video produced in 1991 and entitled
"America at a Crossroads." Dr. Marion "Pat" Robertson, founder
and chairman of the Christian Coalition, described well the political
purposes and election-related goals of the Christian Coalition when
he stated:


I believe that the Christian Coalition will be the most powerful
political force in America by the end of this decade.

What is the mission of this organization? It is simply this. To restore
Godly principles and Godly men and women to the government of
the United States and every one of the fifty states.

To do this, we will achieve each of the following goals:

We will develop the ability to elect majorities in the U.S. Congress
and the legislatures of at least thirty states, as well as the city
councils, the city school boards and other local bodies.

We will become the decisive voice in at least one of the two major
political parties.

We will build strong organizations in every state and Congressional
district in America.

We will recruit at least 10 trained political activists in every one of
America's approximately 175,000 precincts.

We will have more trained grassroots activists than both political
parties combined and more than any other organization on the left or
the right of the political spectrum.

We will reach 30 million voters for pro-family and conservative
causes and candidates.

We will know who our supporters are, where they live, how they
vote, and we will be able to get them to the polls on election day.

We will open an effective lobbying office with a research staff and a
model legislative staff in Washington, DC, and then in each of the
fifty states.

We will publish a monthly national newspaper, The Christian
American, with a circulation of 10 million copies each month.

If the pro-family Roman Catholics and the conservative evangelicals
will unite together, there is no candidate we cannot elect anywhere in
the nation, and there is no cause in which we cannot be victorious.


General Counsel's Brief at 42-43 (emphasis added). The Christian
Coalition certainly has the right to seek to "restore Godly principles
and Godly men and women to the government of the United States
and every one of the fifty states" by developing the ability to elect
majorities in the United States Congress and the various state
legislatures, just as the Republican Party has the right to seek to
restore Republican principles and Republican men and women to the
United States Government and the states through the election
process. However, just as the Republican Party must follow the
campaign finance law and report its financial activity as it seeks to
accomplish its political goals, so too must the Christian Coalition.

At the 1991 "Road to Victory Conference," Dr. Robertson, gave a
speech entitled "How to Turn America Back to God" in which he
similarly discussed the mission and goals of the Christian Coalition.
Once again, the election of candidates as well as the raising of money
to influence those elections, were the central goals of the Christian
Coalition:


Now what's the program? I have big goals.... There are 175,000
precincts in America. The precincts are where politics gets done,
where the people live. Precincts, as you know, are neighborhoods. I
want to see, by the end of this decade, ten keen, active members of
the Christian Coalition in every single precinct of America, that's
175,000 activists.

Now the next thing we're looking at in the Christian Coalition is
money. . You don't win elections if you don't have some money.

This year we will finish out with $5 million.... The goal in 1994 is
$48 million. And the goal by the year 2000 is to have four times the
current budget of the Republican National Committee which is $250
million.

Ralph, . . . your salary will remain the same. This money has to go
for candidates, not for administration.

The next goal is to elect conservative, pro-family majorities in the
legislatures of at least 35 of the states of the United States of
America. And then when we get that we'll go on to fifty. We want to
clean house on those.

The next we're looking forward to in 1992 is a conservative majority
in the United States Senate.

We want to strive for the election of a conservative pro-family
majority in the United States House of representatives by 1996. We
might see it sooner, but 1996 is attainable.

Next, of course, we want to see the White House in pro-family
Christian hands at least by the year 2000, if the Lord permits.


General Counsel's Brief at 41 (emphasis added).

In this speech, the Chairman and founder of the Christian Coalition
went on to discuss the selection and use of issues by the Christian
Coalition as a means of winning elections. Dr. Robertson
demonstrated how the Christian Coalition must broaden its issues
agenda in order to increase the Coalition's political influence and the
electability of the candidates it supported:


What would happen if we had trained people in the precincts who
would take the trouble to ask their neighbors and friends and people
in the block of their precinct what their interests are? Not to go to
them and say "We are the pro- life people" or "We are the church
people." But to say, "What are your interests, what is it that concerns
you?" And then to have the candidate address those issues and write
back and to say, "My worker in your precinct told me that you are
concerned about potholes! And I want you to know that I am the
pothole candidate. I guarantee you that if I am elected I'll take care of
potholes for you. "

By the end of this decade I want the Christian Coalition-it's a doable
thing- to have a databank of 50 million voters according to their
interests. And we can send letters. You've probably seen this
already. In this senatorial race that we won [a state senate race in
Virginia], we did this to 15,000 voters and Ralph personalized forty
different paragraphs-to the gun owners, the hunters, this group, the
other group, the senior citizens, he had something, and the candidate
spoke to them on all those issues.


General Counsel's Brief at 102-103 (emphasis added). Once again,
as Dr. Robertson's speech demonstrates, the Christian Coalition's
central motivation is winning elections. It seeks to advance certain
common aims by electing candidates who will pursue those aims
once in office. It is also prepared to advance other issues-even
pothole repair-if that is what it takes to help elect its candidates.

At this same 1991 conference, Ralph Reed, Executive Director of the
Christian Coalition, reiterated the organization's emphasis on
supporting and electing specific candidates to public office:


Folks, I really need your attention for this panel, because there
probably isn't an opportunity in this country that exceeds our
opportunity this year to elect more people like Jesse Helms and Bill
Dannemeyer to the United States Senate.


General Counsel's Brief at 42 (emphasis added). Likewise, in an
address to the Montana Coalition's "God's Building an Army"
conference in January, 1992, Ralph Reed advocated the defeat of
U.S. Representative Pat Williams in connection with the 1992
election for the U.S. House of Representatives in that state:


If we will move forward in unity and if we will be persistent, victory
will be ours.

It will be ours in Montana and it will be ours all across America....
We're going to see Pat Williams sent bags packing back to Montana
in November of this year and I'm going to be here to help you do it.


General Counsel's Brief at 87 (emphasis added).

The political mission, purposes, and goals articulated at the 1991
Conference were echoed at later Christian Coalition conferences and
meetings.

For example, in his speech to the Coalition's 1992 "Road to Victory"
Conference, Dr. Robertson once again described the dominant role
he sought for the Christian Coalition in American politics:


[B]efore the end of this decade the Christian Coalition is going to be
the most powerful political organization in the entire United States of
America. And with that in mind our goal is not too immodest. Before
the end of this decade I want to see us with pro-family legislators
holding a majority of the legislatures and the governors' offices in at
least thirty-five of our states. I want to see a clear-cut majority of the
members of the House of Representatives that are going to be like
Tom Delay and Dick Armey and those like him. And the same with
the United States Senate.

And obviously I would like to see a conservative, pro-family
President elected in 1992,1996, 2000 and beyond. We don't ever
want to give up the White House anymore.


General Counsel' Brief at 46-47 (emphasis added). Significantly, the
Coalition defines the election of state legislators, governors,
Representatives (including specific Representatives), the Senate and
the White House as its "goal." Given these electoral goals and its
vision of being the "most powerful political organization in the entire
United States of America," we find it difficult to fathom the Coalition
as a group "engaged purely in issue discussion." Buckley, 424 U.S.
at 79.

Printed materials of the Christian Coalition confirm the spoken views
of its leaders and likewise indicate that the Coalition's major purpose
is to promote and implement its beliefs through winning elections. As
the Coalition's current Training Seminar Manual explains:


Politics is a game of numbers. If you get more votes than your
opponent, you win. One of the reasons Christian efforts often fall
short at the ballot box is that we fail to recognize that there is more to
politics than just being on the right side of an issue. Being right is
important, but to influence public policy in a democratic system, we
not only have to be right, we have to be capable of ensuring that our
candidates and issues will be victorious.


General Counsel's Brief at 53-54 (emphasis added).

In addition to the words and declarations of its leadership, the actions
of the Christian Coalition provide further evidence that its major
purpose is the nomination and election of candidates. The
investigation in the instant matter revealed numerous instances of
cooperation, consultation and coordination by the Christian Coalition
in order to support specific federal candidates and political party
committees. For example, executive director Ralph Reed's service on
the Bush Quayle campaign's "pro-family steering committee" gave
him direct access to and input into campaign strategy concerning how
to reach "pro-family" voters. Similarly, President Bush and Dr. Pat
Robertson held meetings in early 1992 to discuss the Bush-Quayle
campaign. Having offered political advice to the Bush- Quayle
campaign, and having received information regarding the Bush-
Quayle campaign strategy through the involvement of its leadership
in the campaign, the Coalition distributed approximately 28 million
voter guides and made hundreds of thousands of get-out-the-vote
telephone calls in connection with the 1992 Presidential election
campaign.

Another example of coordination and support between the Christian
Coalition's leadership and a specific federal candidate's campaign is
found in the Coalition's support of the 1990 Helms for Senate
campaign. Indeed, Ralph Reed is quoted at the 1991 Road to Victory
Conference as having stated:


I had access to internal tracking and I knew Senator Helms was
down by eight points. So Pat called me up and said, quote, 'We have
got to kick into action.' Bottom line is, five days later we put three-
quarters of a million voter guides in churches across the State of
North Carolina and Jesse Helms was re-elected by 100,000 votes out
of 2.2 million cast.


General Counsel's brief at 67 n.33 (emphasis added).

Coordination between the leadership of the Christian Coalition and
the campaigns of federal candidates resulted in contributions to or
expenditures on behalf of a number of federal candidates over the
years. They included not only the Bush-Quayle '92 Primary and
General Committees and the Helms for Senate Committee in 1990,
but also the Oliver North for U.S. Senate Committee in 1994, the
Inglis for Congress Committee in 1992, the Hayworth for Congress
Committee in 1994, the NRSC in 1990, and both the NRSC and the
National Republican Congressional Committee in 1991. The
Coalition's contributions to these candidates and committees alone
totaled over $1.4 million.

The Christian Coalition's ultimate goal, like that of a political party,
is to obtain control of the levers of government so that it may then put
into operation its policies and philosophies. The Coalitions' public
statements, written materials, and actual election-related activities all
demonstrate that its major purpose is to influence federal elections.
The evidence is overwhelming and the conclusion inescapable.
Accordingly, we voted to approve the General Counsel's legal
recommendation to file suit against the Christian Coalition for failing
to register and report its activities as a political committee.


III.

Despite all the evidence described and discussed in the General
Counsel's Probable Cause Brief (and the above discussion only
highlights a small portion of that evidence), Commissioners Aikens
and Elliott voted against pursuing the Christian Coalition as a political
committee. Relying on Akins v. Federal Election Commission, 66
F.3d 348 (D.C.Cir. 1995) reh'g denied, 74 F.3d 287 (D.C.Cir.
1996)("Akins"), they essentially argue that the Christian Coalition is
primarily a lobbying organization and its campaign related activities
are undertaken simply as a minor adjunct to its lobbying efforts.1 In
support of this, they point to the fact the Christian Coalition has set
legislative priorities, lobbies Members of Congress on legislation of
concern, hires lobbyists with experience, and has hired directors of
training and education, of voter education, of communication, of
information systems, and of government affairs. Although conceding
that "some [Coalition] activity might fall within the Act,"
Commissioners Aikens and Elliott conclude that "there is no evidence
that the majority of its [the Coalition's] activity falls within the Act."
Statement of Commissioners Aikens and Elliott at 6.

We think Commissioners Aikens and Elliott's reasoning fails for
several reasons. First, they seem to argue that "major purpose" is
arrived at as a matter of simple mathematical calculation, i.e., if an
organization's expenditures for campaign activity exceeds 50% of the
organization's overall budget, only then is the organization's major
purpose considered to be campaign related. Their approach ignores
the wealth of evidence that the primary objective of the Christian
Coalition is to influence elections. Whenever legislation or lobbying
is mentioned as an objective, it is a lesser goal. The organizational
structure by precinct level, the constant references to voters and
elections, and the statements of Christian Coalition leaders leave no
doubt about the major purpose of the respondent.

Second, Commissioners Aikens and Elliott's argument that the
Christian Coalition engages in a number of other activities, thus
proving that its "core purpose" is not the election or defeat of federal
candidates, goes too far. Under this theory, many federal political
committees could avoid disclosure simply by adding a lobbying
office, a government affairs office, and a public affairs office.
Indeed, the Republican and Democratic national party committees
could readily contend that they do not have to register as political
committees because they too engage in many activities other than
those on behalf of candidates for elective office. Like the Christian
Coalition, the national party committees also seek to influence
legislators and public opinion and have public relations and
government affairs offices. Just as it would be unthinkable,
however, to exempt the national party committees from public
disclosure on such a basis, so too the Christian Coalition should not
be exempted from its disclosure responsibilities on such grounds.
Public disclosure is far too important to be so easily evaded.

Disclosure is the cornerstone of the Federal Election Campaign Act
and the primary duty and responsibility of the Federal Election
Commission. Commissioners Aikens and Elliott have shaken that
foundation by shielding the scale and force of the Christian
Coalition's federal campaign activity from public scrutiny.


IV.

In a speech given before the Christian Coalition of Montana,
Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed described the
Coalition's political campaign strategy, relying on the book The Art
of War by Sun Tzu, a philosopher and warrior of ancient China. The
speech sets forth in stark terms the Christian Coalition's objective of
winning a "war fought with ballots" and the importance of "secrecy"
in successfully waging that war:


The first strategy and in many ways the most important strategy for
evangelicals is secrecy. Sun Tzu says that what you have to do to be
effective at war and that's essentially what we're involved in, we're
involved in a war. It's not a war fought with bullets, it's a war
fought with ballots. But he essentially says that what you got to do is
move secretively, move quietly, move at night and don't telegraph
your position.... What I'm suggesting to you is that to be effective
you must be secretive, you must paint your face and travel at night.
You must move underground and don't stick your head out of the
foxhole until the sun is beyond the horizon.... At every moment
disguise your position and your truth from the enemy because the
minute you stick your head up, you can be shot. It's a little bit like
what was talked about today with respect to infiltrating the party,
maybe infiltrate is the wrong word, but, in any event, influence the
party, is that you don't necessarily want to show up and be identified
as such because then you're an easy target to everybody else who's
there who doesn't share your values.

General Counsel's Brief at 45-46 (emphasis added).


By failing to find that the Christian Coalition is a political committee,
Commissioners Aikens and Elliott have guaranteed that the Coalition
will continue to wage its "war fought with ballots" in the darkness
and secrecy it has sought. As a result of their votes in this matter, the
Christian Coalition will not have to register and fully report its federal
campaign activity. The public will never really know where the
Coalition gets or how it spends its money. Meanwhile, the Christian
Coalition will continue to "travel at night" and "move secretively"
toward its goal of becoming "the most powerful political force in
America." Statement of Ralph Reed, Id. and Statement of Pat
Robertson, General Counsel's Brief at 42.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

In the Matter of
Christian Coalition

MUR 3669

Statement of Reasons

Commissioner Joan D. Aikens
Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott

On September 26, 1995, the Commission, by a vote of 4-2, found
probable cause to believe that the Christian Coalition violated 2
U.S.C. Sections 441a(a), 441 a(f), 433 and 434 of the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended [the Act]. These
probable cause findings were based on a theory advanced by the
Office of the General Counsel [OGC] that the Christian Coalition is a
political committee within the meaning of the Act. On that same date,
the Commission, by a vote of 6-0 also found probable cause to
believe that the Christian Coalition violated 2 U.S.C. Section 441b
by making prohibited in-kind contributions to federal candidates or
campaigns. This Statement of Reasons by the declining
Commissioners sets forth our reasons for finding OGC's theory that
the Christian Coalition is a political committee to be insupportable.


I

The primary debate in this case centers around the definition of
"political committee" and the application of the "major purpose" test.
On September 29, 1995, three days after the Commission vote in the
Christian Coalition case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia rendered an opinion having significant precedential
implications for all matters involving the major purpose test, and
particularly for this matter involving the Christian Coalition. In
Akins, et al. v. Federal Election Commission, 66 F.3d 348 (D.C.
Cir. Sept. 29, 1995), the court noted:


We recognize that the Act has a broad definition of political
committee; Congress intended to "address broadly the problem of
political campaign financing," and wanted to "promote full disclosure
of campaign-oriented spending" with [the Federal Election Campaign
Act]. [Citation omitted]. The Commission, however, has construed
the words 'political committee' narrowly and applied a major purpose
standard in determining whether AIPAC was a political committee.
Under this narrow interpretation, gleaned from case law, an
organization is not a political committee unless, in addition to
crossing the $1,000 threshold, it is under the control of a candidate
or its major purpose is the nomination or election of a candidate.
Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79, 96 S. Ct. at 663; FEC v. Massachusetts
Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238, 252 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 616, 624-25 n.
6 (1986). Accord FEC v. Machinists NonPartisan Political League,
655 F.2d 380, 391-92 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 897, 107
S.Ct. 397, 70 L.Ed.2d 213, (1981). A more expansive definition
would be constitutionally dangerous due to interference with
"fundamental First Amendment interests." Buckley, 424 U.S. at 23;
96 S.Ct. at 636; Machinists, 655 F.2d at 392.


Akins at p.353. We agree. We further agree with the Akins court that
the concern of the major purpose test "is the core purpose of the
organization itself, not the individual expenditure or contribution."
Id. at 355.

The history of the Akins case is pertinent to our discussion. The
court noted:


The FEC investigated the allegations and after a substantial
investigation, the General Counsel issued a report regarding
AIPAC's corporate expenditures, campaign-related activities and
political activities. While the FEC found that AIPAC has made
contributions that likely crossed the $1,000 threshold, it concluded
that AIPAC is not a political committee under the statute because its
campaign-related activities constitute only a small portion of its
overall activities and are not AIPAC's major purpose. The FEC
stated that AIPAC is primarily a lobbying organization interested in
promoting U.S.-Israel relations and its campaign-related activities are
undertaken as an adjunct to its lobbying efforts. Adopting the
General Counsel's recommendations, the Commission found that
there was no probable cause to believe that AIPAC was a political
committee in violation of the disclosure and reporting requirements of
sections 433 and 434 of the Act. The Commission did find probable
cause to believe that AIPAC violated section 441b, which restricts
expenditures and contributions by corporations, but unanimously
voted to take no action.

Akins at 350. In this case, however, the Office of the General
Counsel did an about face, recommending that the Commission find
probable cause to believe that the Christian Coalition is a political
committee, without adequately investigating or analyzing whether its
campaign-related activities were undertaken as an adjunct to the "core
purpose" of the organization.

In our view, application of the major purpose test requires at least an
assessment of an organization's significant activities. Indeed, the
nomenclature provided by the Supreme Court for the test, i.e. major
purpose, supports our view. Absent comparison it is impossible to
separate the major purpose from adjunct activity and, therefore,
impossible to determine whether the "core purpose" of the
organization is the election of specific federal candidates. If the "core
purpose" of an organization is not the election of specific federal
candidates there exists no constitutionally valid reason to interfere
with First Amendment political speech by labeling an organization a
political committee, with the attendant reporting requirements and
other limitations under the Act.

Contrary to OGC's position, there is strong evidence suggesting that
the "core purpose" of the Christian Coalition is not the election or
defeat of particular federal candidates. The Christian Coalition is a
non-stock, non-profit corporation existing and operating under
section 501 (c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. Article 3 of its
Articles of Incorporation provide:


The principal purpose of the corporation is to encourage active
citizenship among people professing the Christian faith. Other
purposes are to support and uphold values and moral principles that
accord with the holy Bible; to defend religious freedom; to enunciate
an interpretation of the United States Constitution which is in
accordance with the original intention of the framers of the United
States Constitution; and to promulgate and teach concern for the
sanctity of life, traditional family values, an economic system which
fosters individual self reliance, opposition to tyranny, and faith in
God.


According to the deposition of Mr. Ralph Reed, Executive Director
of the Christian Coalition, taken by the FEC on March 28, 1995, one
important method by which these purposes are achieved is by
organizing a legislative presence in all 50 state capitals and in
Washington, D.C. in order to represent Christians at every level of
government. Reed Depo, p. 48. The extent of this legislative activity
goes beyond self-serving statements and is apparent in the
organization's infrastructure, directorships and personnel hiring
practices. Here are some examples taken directly from the deposition
transcripts:


* Mr. Reed discusses the purpose of leadership schools as "user
friendly" training workshops that "would teach people the nuts and
bolts of contacting their legislators" and "learning to track a bill
through their local state legislature or city council. Reed Depo, p. 49.
Concerning the December 1994 Board of Directors meeting, Mr.
Reed testified that the Board discussed setting the legislative priorities
of the Christian Coalition among such issues as: H.R. 6, an
education bill (Id., p. 75); a lobbying reform bill (Id., p. 76); the
Hyde amendment (prohibiting the taxpayer funding of abortion
through the Medicaid program) (Id., p. 77); the Contract with
America (Id., p. 77); and other legislative issues related to the budget
(Id., p. 77).

* Mr. Reed also discussed the organization's efforts in lobbying
members of Congress concerning legislation pending before
Congress "such as the legislative calendar, when certain bills will
come up and when they will be voted on" (Id., p. 82). Mr. Reed
stated that in discussions with conservative Democrats and the
Democratic Caucus he discussed issues such as welfare reform and
also supported the version of the balanced budget amendment
sponsored by Congressman Charlie Stenholm when the Republican
Balanced Budget Amendment was defeated in the House (Id., p. 84).

* The Christian Coalition's directors include the national field
director, Mr. Gribbin, who was "one of the top lobbyists at the
National Federation of Independent Businesses and had an extensive
knowledge of Capitol hill, of the legislative process, and of how to
influence legislation with a grassroots network." (Id., p. 91). Mr.
Gribbin developed the citizen action seminar, a relatively new
program that has been in existence for only about a year, and is a
citizen alternative to the leadership schools. (Id., p. 95). The citizen
action seminar curriculum "includes how to organize your
neighborhood, how to set up a moral or family concerns ministry in
your local church, how to contact your elected representatives, how
to identify other pro-family citizens who share your values in your
neighborhood and community." (Id., p. 97).

* Another director is Chuck Cunningham, the director of voter
education. Mr. Cunningham came from the National Rifle
Association and was responsible primarily for state legislative issues
there (Id., pp. 99-100). Mr. Reed notes that Mr. Cunningham also
has legislative and lobbying responsibilities vis-a-vis the
organization. (Id., p. 100).

* There are also directors of training and education, of voter
education, of communication, of information systems, and of
government affairs. The director of governmental affairs is Ms. Heidi
Scanlon, "her job is to communicate with the grassroots people in the
field about which legislation is pending before Congress about which
we have an interest and to encourage them to contact members of
Congress whose votes will be critical to the passage or defeat of that
legislation. (Id., p. 105). Additionally, Mr. Wittman acts as a
lobbyist and as director of the legislative affairs office and is
"primarily responsible for overall legislative strategy and for working
with members and staff on Capitol Hill on legislative matters of
importance to the Christian Coalition. (Id., p. 107). Mr. Reed notes
that "Ms. Scanlon has primary responsibility for overseeing the
grassroots, and Mr. Wittman has primary responsibility for
overseeing the internal strategy, the drafting of legislation, the
working, day-to-day, of the legislative process." (Id., p. 108). Mr.
Reed notes that two or three additional people have been hired in the
legislative office. (Id., p. 111).

* Mr. Reed also discusses the role that the district coordinator or
director plays. As described by Mr. Reed, "Their role is twofold.
First of all, they have primary responsibility for activating telephone
trees and a grassroots network on behalf of federal legislation
pending before the Congress in the event that the representative from
their district is considered a critical vote." (Id., p.190). As stated by
Mr. Reed, if you are going to influence the votes of legislators, you
have to have an organization in their district. (Id., p.190)


These examples indicate that the major purpose of the Christian
Coalition is "to encourage active citizenship among people professing
the Christian faith," and that, as suggested by Dr. Reed, the
organization's legislative and campaign- related educational activities
constitute only a small portion of its overall activities and are not the
Christian Coalition's major purpose. This is consistent with Article 3
of the Christian Coalition's Articles of Incorporation which set forth
the means by which it may achieve its purposes:


The corporation is empowered to achieve its purposes by all lawful
means, including but not limited to education, the publication and
distribution of literature, citizenship mobilization, the advocacy of
public policy, and representation before public bodies.


II.

We do not disagree that there is evidence suggesting that the
Christian Coalition engaged in prohibited campaign-related activity.
We argue, however, that engaging in prohibited activity does not
change the major purpose of the Christian Coalition. In fact, OGC
notes that since the onset of the investigation in this case, the
Christian Coalition has modified its programs in an attempt to focus
less on election related matters. This is not a negative, but a positive,
and indicates the organization's willingness to move away from
prohibited activity, a move which would not be contemplated if that
activity was its major purpose.

The operating budget for the Christian Coalition for 1994 was
roughly $21 million and the same level was anticipated for 1995. The
Christian Coalition has approximately 1.6 million members and is
incorporated in virtually every state of the union. With an
organization of this size, diversity of interests and grassroots focus,
it is hardly surprising that some activity might fall within the Act, but
there is no evidence that the majority of its activity falls within the
Act.

To prove that the Christian Coalition is itself a political committee,
we believe the "major purpose" test should have been more fully
developed. This could have been accomplished by extending the
depositions to the Chief Financial Officer, Judy Liebert, as well as to:
Mr. Whitman, lobbyist and director of the legislative affairs office;
Ms. Scanlon, director of the governmental affairs office; Mr.
Cunningham, the director of voter education, and; Mr. Gribbin, the
national field director. These individuals could have addressed the
percentage of the operating budget allocable to the activities alleged to
be prohibited as well as their view of the principal purpose of the
Christian Coalition.

We favor the approach taken in the Akins case, and believe that any
violations fall within 2 U.S.C. Section 441b. Complicating the
Counsel's analysis is that to date the Commission does not have
regulations which define the major purpose test, and explain how it
will be applied. Absent regulation, issue oriented groups like the
Christian Coalition are not on sufficient notice of the Commission's
interpretation of the "major purpose" test, and can not identify, "with
ascertainable certainty, the standard which we expect such groups to
conform." See, General Elec. Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 53 F.3d 1324,
1329 (D.C. Cir. 1995).

For the above stated reasons, we cannot find that the major purpose
of the Christian Coalition is the election or defeat of Federal
candidates. Therefore, the Christian Coalition, in our opinion, is not
a Federal political committee.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

In the Matter of
Christian Coalition

MUR 3669

STATEMENT OF REASONS

(for Probable Cause to Believe a violation of law has occurred)

Commissioner Trevor Potter

There is no question that the Christian Coalition as an organization,
and its members as individuals, have the constitutional right to
engage in the political process. Every citizen and organization
involved in electoral activity should be commended for that civic
participation: in today's world it is often difficult to find citizens who
will spend the time such participation requires. However, the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended ("the Act"), requires
disclosure of such activity if it meets certain threshold levels and if it
is in connection with a federal election. The law also restricts the
sources and the magnitude of money utilized in federal elections. For
instance, the Act prohibits corporate contributions in federal
elections, while limiting individual contributors to a contribution of
$1,000 per election per candidate, and multicandidate political
committees ("PAC") to $5,000 per election per candidate.

Here, the evidence shows overwhelmingly that there has been a
multi-year, multi-election, nationwide effort by the Christian
Coalition to elect federal candidates without any disclosure of that
spending, or the sources of its funding. I do not dispute that there are
also legislative purposes for some of the Christian Coalition's
activities. However, the evidence in the record demonstrates that it is
first and foremost an organization with a distinctly electoral purpose.
It has a nationwide precinct level grass-roots organization, which in
many ways resembles a national political party apparatus. To achieve
the Christian Coalition's public policy agenda it has chosen to
coordinate activity with, and promote, specific political party
organizations and candidates. This approach has brought the
Coalition's activities within the definition of "expenditure" as defined
by the Act.

In the Christian Coalition's training video tape entitled "Four Keys to
Victory", founder and Chairman Pat Robertson clearly outlines the
importance of motivating people at the precinct level to find and
support candidates who share the views of the Coalition in order to
ensure ultimate "victory." He then states that his goal is that by the
end of the decade "the Christian Coalition will be the most powerful
political organization in the United States." The purpose of that
power, he says, is control of at least thirty state legislatures; majority
control of the United States House and Senate; and the election of a
U.S. President. To repeat, such political activity by U.S. citizens is
entirely legitimate and the cornerstone of a democracy. However, the
requirement that such activity be reported and disclosed to the public
is also entirely legitimate, and is the cornerstone of the federal
election laws.

The crux of this enforcement action is that the Christian Coalition
should play by the same rules as everyone else in the political
battlefield -- or at least every other interest group which supports and
opposes candidates for federal office. Perhaps the activity engaged in
by the Christian Coalition the last several years would have been
perfectly legal if done through a political committee which disclosed
its sources of income and its expenditures. However, by denying the
public such information the Christian Coalition has operated in
violation of the law, using the advantage provided by its illegal
activity to advance its political goals. The extent of the activity
cataloged in the Office of the General Counsel's investigation clearly
shows that the primary purpose of the Christian Coalition is to serve
as a political organization with the goal of electing candidates it
supports. Given that status, there is no blanket waiver from the
provisions of the Act that allows the Christian Coalition to avoid it's
otherwise clear responsibility to register and report federal political
activity.

Whether this matter is ultimately resolved by conciliation agreement
or by Court order, I believe that the public interest will only be
served by full disclosure of spending by the Christian Coalition to
date, and assurance that the organization will abide by the law in the
future.

ENDNOTE

1. In Akins, the D.C. Circuit upheld the Commission's no probable
cause to believe finding that AIPAC had violated sections 433 and
434 by failing to register and report as a political committee. The
activities and organization of AIPAC, however, are vastly different
than that of the Christian Coalition. Unlike the Christian Coalition,
for example, there was no evidence that AIPAC had made over $1.4
million in contributions to federal candidates: had organized in
precincts in order to target voters; or had indicated, either in written
materials or in statements by its leadership, that its goal was to
become "the most powerful political force in America" and elect
majorities in the U.S. Congress and the legislatures of at least thirty
states, as well as the city councils, the city school boards and other
local bodies."

SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS

DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT

AS INTRODUCED ON MAY 7, 1996

BY

REPS. BOB BARR (GA), STEVE LARGENT (OK),
JIM SENSENBRENNER (WI), SUE MYRICK (NC), ED
BRYANT (TN), BILL EMERSON (MO), HAROLD
VOLKMER (MO), IKE SKELTON (MO)

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) does two things.
First, it provides that no State shall be required to give
effect to a law of any other State with respect to a same-
sex "marriage."  Second, it defines the words "marriage"
and "spouse" for purposes of Federal law.

The first substantive section of the bill is an exercise of
Congress' power under the "Effect" clause of Article IV,
section 1 of the Constitution (the Full Faith and Credit
Clause) to allow each State (or other political
jurisdiction) to decide for itself whether it wants to grant
legal status to same-sex "marriage."  This provision is
necessary in light of the possibility of Hawaii giving
sanction to same-sex "marriage" under its state law, as
interpreted by its state courts, and other states being
placed in the position of having to give "full faith and
credit" to Hawaii's interpretation of what constitutes
"marriage."  Although so-called "conflicts of law"
principles do not necessarily compel such a result,
approximately 30 states of the union are sufficiently
alarmed by such a prospect to have initiated legislative
efforts to defend themselves against any compulsion to
acknowledge same-sex "marriage."

This is a problem most properly resolved by invoking
Congress' authority under the Constitution to declare
what "effect" one State's acts, records, and judicial
proceedings shall have in another State. Congress has
invoked this authority recently on two other occasions; in
the Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980, which
required each State to enforce child custody
determinations made by the home State if made
consistently with the provisions of the Act; and in the
Full Faith and Credit for child Support Order Act of
1994, which required each State to enforce child support
orders made by the child's State if made consistently with
the provisions of the Act.

The second substantive section of the bill amends the
U.S. Code to make explicit what has been understood
under federal law for over 200 years; that a marriage is
the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and
wife, and a spouse is a husband or wife of the opposite
sex. The DOMA definition of marriage is derived most
immediately from a Washington state case from 1974,
Singer v. Hara, which is included in the 1990 edition of
Black's Law Dictionary. More than a century ago, the
U.S. Supreme Court spoke of the "union for life of one
man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony."
Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 45 (1985).

DOMA is not meant to affect the definition of "spouse"
(which under the Social Security law, for example, runs
to dozens of lines). It ensures that whatever definition of
"spouse" may be used in Federal law, the word refers
only to a person of the opposite sex.

RE: Ethics Complaint Against Speaker Newt Gingrich
and Request for Reopening the Matter of Donald Jones

Dear Chairwoman Johnson:

This letter constitutes a formal ethics complaint against
House Speaker Newt Gingrich based on new allegations of
improper conduct, and a call to the House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct ("Ethics Committee") to
reopen the matter of Donald Jones. Three recent news
articles cite statements by Speaker Gingrich that raise new
questions about possible violations of federal law and
House Rules by Speaker Gingrich in the Donald Jones
case. These new statements by the Speaker, reported by
Ron Call, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the
Associated Press, call into serious question the
thoroughness of the investigation by the House Committee
on Standards of Official Conduct into our November 15,
1995 ethics complaint against Speaker Newt Gingrich,
which was officially transmitted to the Ethics Committee
by Representative George Miller1.

We are writing to urge the Committee to investigate
these new allegations which have not been previously
reviewed. Furthermore, we urge the Committee to reopen
the investigation of our previous complaint in light of
these new statements by Speaker Gingrich, as well as the
transparent failure of the Ethics Committee to interview
important witnesses in the Donald Jones case. We strongly
urge -- given the investigative failures of the Ethics
Committee in this Donald Jones matter -- that any
investigation into this new complaint and the Donald Jones
matter be conducted by special counsel.

A: Did Speaker Gingrich Violate Federal Law and House
Rules Prohibiting the Use of Official Resources for
Unofficial Purposes?

An April 2, 1996 article in the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution reported that "Gingrich said that Jones spent
95 percent of his time on a limited project -- the Earning
by Learning reading program for at-risk children..."2
Similarly, an Associated Press article reported that:


House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Monday that a
Wisconsin businessman whose use of his congressional
office was criticized by the House ethics committee spent
nearly all his time on a reading program for children....

Rep. Gingrich said...[that Jones] was actually working on
the Speaker's Earning by Learning program...3

Earning By Learning is a non-profit organization with
no official ties to the United States House of
Representatives. Speaker Gingrich's comments suggest
that he may have improperly allowed Donald Jones to use
the Speaker's official resources for unofficial purposes.
Federal law broadly prohibits such misuse of official
resources for unofficial purposes. 31 U.S.C. Section
1301(a) states that:

Appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for
which the appropriations were made except as otherwise
provided by law.

Similarly, the House Ethics Manual states that:

No outside organization may use official funds or
resources, including House office space, the frank, and
staff time.4

The House Ethics Manual also states that:

Official and unofficial activities must remain absolutely
separate. By statute as well as regulations of the
Committee on House Administration, official resources
may not be used to assist the work of an outside
organization.5

In the "investigation" of the Donald Jones matter, did the
Ethics Committee determine whether Donald Jones used
official resources in support of Earning By Learning?
Did Donald Jones use a desk, office space, or secretarial
help in the Speaker's offices? Did he use official
photocopiers or fax machines for Earning By Learning
activities? Was this matter ever investigated? If not, why
not? If the matter was not investigated, the Ethics
Committee surely must now conduct such an
investigation. That investigation, to surmount minimal
standards of thoroughness and credibility, must include
questioning, under oath, Speaker Gingrich, Donald Jones,
Daniel Meyer, and any other witness possessing material
information about the activities of Donald Jones within
the offices of Speaker Gingrich.

B: Did Speaker Gingrich Provide Improper Favors and
Benefits to Donald Jones?

Speaker Gingrich's comments as reported in the April 2,
1996 article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution indicate
that Donald Jones contacted parties in New Zealand, on
behalf or Republicans in Congress, regarding
privatization issues. The article states that "Gingrich said
Jones' role was limited to helping Republicans make some
basic contacts with New Zealand, which recently had
embarked on privatization efforts Republicans wanted to
observe." Damon Chappie and Juliet Eilperin of Roll Call
wrote that:

Speaking to business leaders in his district, Gingrich said
on Monday that as far as telecommunications issues
worked on by Jones, "his primary contribution was to get
in touch with New Zealand, whose government had
recently" embarked on a privatization effort.6

Did Donald Jones personally benefit from making these
New Zealand contacts through the Speaker's office? While
Donald Jones was making New Zealand contacts for the
Congressional Republicans, and enjoying the privilege of
possessing an official Congressional ID card, he was also
trying to establish a $13 million fiber optic cable network
in New Zealand. According to a June 16, 1995
Information Access Company Newsletter

Cyberstar Networks, is preparing to issue tenders for a
$13 million fibre optic cable network in the Nelson
region in the north west of New Zealand's South
Island....Cyberstar founder, Donald Jones, was reportedly
in New Zealand last month for meetings with the prime
minister.7


The April 4 Roll Call article reported that:

Jones, in fact, traveled to New Zealand last May and met
with senior government officials, including Prime
Minister Jim Bolger. A spokeswoman for the New
Zealand embassy here confirmed that Jones had met with
Bolger "several times" in 1995, including during a trip by
Bolger to the United States. Cyberstar sought and
received network operator status from New Zealand's
Commerce Ministry.

Were any of Jones's business ties for Cyberstar
Networks made through calls from the Speaker's office?
How did Donald Jones represent himself in those business
conversations with New Zealand authorities? Did Speaker
Gingrich allow Jones to exploit for personal gain the
stature of the office of the Speaker of the House of
Representatives?

During the same period that Jones was a volunteer in the
Speaker's office, and was trying to complete his cable deal
in New Zealand, he was selected to testify before the
Senate Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of
the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Jones said to
the Senate subcommittee:

My company, Cyberstar, is in the advanced stages of
developing full service fiber optic cable television
networks in New Zealand....The Cyberstar team, of which
I am the Leader of Change, is excited about investing in
the New Zealand telecommunications industry and the
opportunities it presents.8


That plan to build a full service fiber optic network has
collapsed, according to an October 20, 1995 article in the
Information Access Company's Newsletter.

If Gingrich allowed Donald Jones -- who has contributed
at least $125,000 to the Republican Party and $25,000 to
GOPAC -- to use the Speaker's office to improve his own
stature and further his business dealings in New Zealand,
that is an improper use of the Speaker's office for private
benefit, as well as an improper favor provided to an
important campaign contributor. Similarly, if the Speaker
allowed Donald Jones to ostensibly run an international
business out of the Speaker's office, that, too, is a misuse
of official resources for non-official, commercial
purposes.

C. Did Speaker Gingrich Mislead the House Committee
on Standards of Official Conduct Regarding Donald
Jones's Activities?

The March 29, 1996 Ethics Committee letter to Speaker
Gingrich stated that the Speaker "office took caution to
ensure that Mr. Jones performed no official duties..."9
Roll Call reported on February 26, 1996 that "Gingrich
and Jones both deny that Jones acted as anything other
than an 'informal advisor'..."10

However, the Roll Call and Atlanta
Journal-Constitution articles strongly suggest that Jones
did in fact perform official duties within the Speaker's
office by contacting New Zealand government officials on
behalf of Congressional Republicans who were interested
in telecommunications privatization issues.

Do the Speaker's comments contradict the Speaker's
statement to the Ethics Committee about the Jones matter?
Since the Speaker's statement in the Donald Jones matter
has not been publicly released, we do not know contents
of the statement. But we assume it reflects the
Committee's conclusion that the Speaker's "office took
caution to ensure that Mr. Jones performed no official
duties..." If Speaker Gingrich misled the Ethics
Committee about Mr. Jones's role and activities within the
Speaker's office, then he has likely violated House Rule
43, Clause 1, which states that:

A Member, officer, or employee of the House of
Representatives shall conduct himself at all times in a
manner which shall reflect creditably on the House of
Representatives.


The House Committee of Standards of Official Conduct
has previously disciplined a House Member for making
false statements to the Ethics Committee.11

Similarly, does the Speaker's statement to the Ethics
Committee describe the extent of Donald Jones's activities
in Gingrich's offices on behalf of Earning By Learning?
If not, why did the Speaker omit this key fact?


We strongly urge the Ethics Committee to publicly
disclose the Speaker's statement in the matter of Donald
Jones, so that citizens can independently evaluate its
accuracy, completeness, and veracity.


D: Failure of the Ethics Committee to Interview Parties
Knowledgeable About Jones's Activities in Gingrich's
Office, and Other Investigative Failures

Paul Davis, the attorney representing Donald Jones's
former partners, sent a letter to you, Chairwoman
Johnson, and to Ethics Committee Ranking Minority
Member Jim McDermott on March 6, 1996, conveying
the willingness of his clients to provide testimony about
Jones's activities within the Speaker's office. That letter
stated that his clients:  believe that a full review of this
record will reveal a pattern of conduct emanating from
within the office of a member of Congress that has
damaged their civil interests. My client[s] have
information that will help to ensure that their actions are
not cast in a false light and that the Members of your
Committee are not mislead in their investigation of the
case involving Donald G. Jones. They are willing to
cooperate in appropriate ways to ensure that the truth is
revealed.12

On April 4, Roll Call reported that subsequent to the
March 6 letter:

Davis told Roll Call that he was contacted by Rep. Jim
McDermott (D-Wash.), the ethics panel's ranking
member, who inquired about the evidence Davis had.
McDermott told Davis to collect the information and send
it to ethics Chairwoman Nancy Johnson (RConn). Davis
said he prepared a packet and sent it to Johnson but never
received any communication from her or the ethics
committee staff.

The packet sent by Davis to you, Chairwoman Johnson,
contained, according to Ron Call, "evidence, including
documents and phone records, that demonstrated that
Jones was working on telecommunications issues for the
Speaker." It also contained a cover memorandum that
stated:

My clients are prepared to provide information
concerning the business activities of Mr. Jones during the
period that he was operating out of the office of Speaker
Gingrich. In effect, they are prepared to provide specific
substantiation for claims included in the attached Jones
memo.13

The failure of the Ethics Committee to request and
receive testimony from Davis's clients, Tim Brown and
Jeff Coleman, calls into question the thoroughness of the
Ethics Committee investigation into the Donald Jones
matter. Why did you not ask Brown and Coleman for
their testimony? Will you immediately receive and
consider their testimony? If not, why not?

On April 22, Roll Call reported on the contents of a new
Donald Jones memorandum:

Donald Jones, a Wisconsin telecommunications
entrepreneur who was granted Congressional staff
privileges by House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga) last
year, cited the business interests of a family that has
contributed heavily to the Speaker in a briefing to
Gingrich on government regulation of the Internet.

Jones, whose controversial role as a quasi-Gingrich
staffer advising the Speaker on matters on which he had a
business interest...wrote in a memo that he told the
Speaker "about concerns that entrepreneurs have making
investments facing the possibility of government controls
and cited Cam, Atlanta, and MindSpring."

Cam refers to Campbell Lanier, a Georgia
telecommunications mogul....Lanier and his family have
been generous to Gingrich, providing more than $56,000
over the past fiver years to Gingrich's campaign and
GOPAC...14

Apparently, the Ethics Committee did not obtain this
memorandum until after it had issued its March 29 ruling
in the Donald Jones matter. Why did the Ethics
Committee fail to uncover it?

Equally enigmatic is the failure of the Ethics Committee
to obtain the notes of House leadership meetings on
telecommunications legislation and the Speaker's meetings
with telecommunications executives to determine whether
in fact Donald Jones was a participant, or present at the
meetings. How could the Ethics Committee possibly
evaluate Donald Jones's claim to have attended these
meetings on telecommunications legislation without
reviewing contemporaneous notes of the meetings?

According to the March 29, 1996 Ethics Committee
letter to Speaker Gingrich, "the Committee...considered
your [Gingrich's] response of December 22, 1995, which
included an affidavit of Donald Jones, and letters from
Daniel Meyer and Jack Howard of your staff." However,
Adam Clymer of the New York Times noted that, aside
from this submitted testimony, "no one was questioned,
and no documents were requested."15 The Committee's
failure to question witnesses or request documents
seriously undercuts the credibility of the Ethics
Committee "investigation" of the Donald Jones matter.
We believe you owe the American people a complete
explanation and accounting for what appears to be a
slipshod "investigation" in this case.

This is not the first time that this House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct has been criticized for
failure to thoroughly investigate credible leads regarding
the Gingrich ethics complaints. This House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct has repeatedly faltered and
stumbled in its duties to undertake professional, impartial,
non-partisan investigations in the ethics complaints
brought against House Speaker Newt Gingrich. These
failings include:


*  Incompetent sluggishness. On June 29, 1995, Adam
Clymer wrote in the New York Times that:

With less than a week until the deadline its head had set
for disposing of the charges against Speaker Newt
Gingrich, the House ethics committee has yet to question
many of the most obvious witnesses about a college course
Mr. Gingrich taught, a book contract or other allegations
of misconduct.

Spokesmen for the political action committee Mr.
Gingrich headed and the college where he taught a course
that has been criticized as an illegal, partisan use of tax-
exempt funds said no information had been sought from
them. So did a publisher who publicly charged that the
original S4.5 million deal for Mr. Gingrich's book was
improper, and a business organization from which Mr.
Gingrich was accused of improperly soliciting
personnel.16


*  Violating Committee precedent. Ethics Committee
rules state that if the Committee, by a majority vote, finds
that an ethics complaint "merits further inquiry, it shall
adopt a Resolution of Preliminary Inquiry."17 But last
year the Committee began some type of inquiry regarding
Gingrich's book deal with HarperCollins Publishers
without having approved an official "preliminary inquiry
" Was this done to save the Speaker from the
embarrassment of an Ethics Committee vote in favor of a
preliminary inquiry?


*  Failure to authorize outside counsel to investigate
ethics complaints. Even though it is standard procedure
for the House Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct to hire outside counsel to investigate ethics
complaints concerning possibly serious violations of
federal law or House Rules, this Committee has been most
unwilling to take such action regarding Speaker Gingrich.
Only one part of one complaint against Speaker Gingrich
has been sent to special counsel for investigation. Such
reticence in employing outside counsel, combined with
what appears to be an incomplete investigation by Ethics
Committee members and staff in the Donald Jones matter,
has dramatically undercut the credibility of the ethics
process in the Gingrich case. Why has Speaker Gingrich
received such special treatment before the Ethics
Committee?


*  Narrow mandate of outside counsel. The Ethics
Committee has only authorized special counsel to
investigate one charge: whether Speaker Gingrich has
misused 501(c)(3) foundation resources for political
purposes. The narrowness of this mandate, given the long
list of other serious charges against Speaker Gingrich
currently and formerly pending before the Committee, is
a blight upon the notion of the self-regulation of
Congressional ethics.


*  Manifest unwillingness of the Ethics Committee to
receive documents related to the Gingrich case. When
Representative David Bonior attached over 8,000 pages of
evidence to a December 14th, 1995 ethics complaint
against the Speaker, the Ethics Committee rejected the
complaint without explanation, and resumed the
documents.18 The complaint was refiled and is still
pending. Given the performance of the Ethics Committee
in the Gingrich case, this complaint must be sent to special
counsel for investigation. Any attempt by the Committee
to perform an internal investigation of this complaint in
lieu of a special counsel investigation is entirely
unacceptable.


*  Failure to thoroughly investigate bulk sales of the
Speaker's book Juliet Eilperin of Roll Call wrote on
November 13, 1995:

After making initial inquiries into the bulk sales of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's (R-Ga) book "To Renew
America" more than a month ago, the ethics committee is
no longer probing the matter, the panel's chair told Roll
Call last week.


In an interview Thursday, ethics committee Chairwoman
Nancy Johnson (R-Conn) said the panel didn't find any
information of interest at this point" on the bulk-sales
issue.

"The issue was raised," Johnson said. "The staff did
some work on it. At this point, it's not being pursued."

Interviews by Roll Call with the five organizations that
have been publicly identified as having purchased bulk
orders of Gingrich's book found that none of them were
contacted by ethics staffers or Members as part of the
probe.19


*  Failure to thoroughly investigate the activities of Joe
Gaylord in the Speaker's offices. The Ethics Committee
wrote Speaker Gingrich that:

the Committee has found that your use of Mr. Joseph
Gaylord was in violation of House Rule 45...Specifically,
the Committee found that Mr. Gaylord's activities during
the transition of interviewing prospective staff violate our
rules and that his regular, routine presence in
congressional offices, while in and of itself not a violation
of House rules, creates the appearance of the improper
commingling of political and official resources.20


The Committee merely found that Joe Gaylord's
activities preceding the 104th Congress were a violation
of House Rule 45. Elizabeth Drew, in her book
Showdown, strongly suggests that Gaylord's was
performing official duties during the 104th Congress. She
writes:


A close Gingrich associate said, "Joe is really the chief
of staff,"....A close associate said, "Joe Gaylord has line
authority for everything in Newt's life." Another said,
"Gaylord has complete control over Newt's schedule" --
and then he added "along with Dan Meyer."... Gaylord
was Gingrich's chief political strategist, and was also
known to chair substantive meetings on matters of interest
to Gingrich. A close associate said, "Newt delegates to
Joe, and Joe calls other members of Newt's staff end gives
instructions. Joe sits in staff meetings where he's present
and Newt is not, and the next ranking person is Dan
Meyer."...When there was a substantive issue that
involved politics -- and few didn't -- Gaylord was often in
the room....In 1995, aware that eyes were on his role,
Gaylord's physical presence was reduced, but not his
influence.21

Another passage in Showdown describes a meeting on
the House Republican Medicare legislative proposal:

Gingrich had been deeply involved in the details of the
Republican proposal. On September 11, a meeting in
Gingrich's office with the relevant subcommittee
chairmen and Gingrich advisers, including Joe Gaylord,
had gone on until 1:45 AM., where the group went
through the proposal line by line.22

The Ethics Committee made no mention of this evidence
of Gaylord's official activities during the 104th Congress
in its letter to the Speaker. Apparently, the Ethics
Committee did not uncover this evidence in its
investigation into the Joe Gaylord matter.

*  Inept procedures. When Speaker Gingrich gave
testimony last year to the Ethics Committee about his
book deal with Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins
Publishers, the Committee had not completed a thorough
investigation of that matter. How could Committee
members know what to ask Speaker Gingrich about the
circumstances surrounding the book deal with Murdoch
without having conducted a thorough investigation first?
Such procedures are highly irregular. Usually, an
investigator questions the "target" just before a thorough
investigation is nearly completed.

Given these failures of the Ethics process in the Gingrich
cases, we request that the Ethics Committee release the
statements of Speaker Gingrich, Daniel Meyer, Donald
Jones, and Jack Howard regarding the Donald Jones case,
so that the public can independently assess the veracity
and completeness of their statements.

E: The Ethics Committee has Repeatedly Criticized
Speaker Gingrich's Conduct

When considering what level of sanction is appropriate
in this case, the Committee should bear in mind that it has
repeatedly criticized Gingrich for violations of House
Rules or other blameworthy conduct:

*  Regarding the activities of Donald Jones within the
Speaker's offices (1996): Based on this Committee's
construction of House Rule 45, Mr. Jones' participation in
your office as an "informal advisor" did not comply with
applicable guidelines issued by this Committee governing
interns or volunteers.23

*  Regarding the book contract with Rupert Murdoch's
HarperCollins Publishers (1995):

- ...the Committee strongly questions the appropriateness
of what some could describe as an attempt by you to
capitalize on your office. As recent events demonstrate,
existing rules permit a Member to reap significant and
immediate financial benefit which appears to be based
primarily on his or her position. At a minimum, this
creates the impression of exploiting one's office for
personal gain. Such a perception is especially troubling
when it pertains to the office of the Speaker of the House,
a constitutional office requiring the highest standards of
ethical behavior.24

*  Regarding the activities of Joseph Gaylord in the
Speaker's offices (1995):

- ...the Committee has found that your use of Mr. Joseph
Gaylord was in violation of House Rule 45, which
prohibits the use of unofficial resources for official
purposes.25

*  Regarding the use of the House Floor for commercial
purposes (1995):

- ...the Committee has found a misuse of the House
Floor....The House Floor should not be used for
commercial purposes, and since a caller to this number
was offered only the option of buying a set of tapes, the
Committee finds the use of a 1-800 number to be an
improper solicitation.26

*  Regarding the use of the House floor to advertise a
GOPAC meeting (1995):

- ...the Committee has found a similar violation in your
references on the House Floor in 1990 regarding a
nationwide town meeting sponsored by GOPAC.27

*  Regarding the Marathon Travel mailing (1990):

The Committee concludes that you were remiss in your
oversight and administration of your congressional office,
which gave rise to the improper correspondence cited in
the complaint. Accordingly, you are directed to
immediately take steps to preclude recurrence of the type
of improper activity here involved. You are further
placed on notice that a future recurrence of improper use
of mail and resources may result in more severe
Committee action.28

*  Regarding the financial disclosure of a real estate
transaction (1990):

The Committee has also determined that the acquisition
of certain real estate with your daughter, as well as the
underlying liability you incurred, should have been
reported on your Financial Disclosure Statements for the
appropriate calendar years.29

Incredibly, given this history of violations of House
Rules and other improper conduct by Speaker Gingrich,
the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
has yet to apply any sanction to Speaker Gingrich.

F: Conclusion

The House Ethics Committee has a responsibility to the
American public to conduct thorough investigations of
possible violations of federal law or House Rules by
House Members. Failure to conduct thorough
investigations undercuts the legitimacy and moral
authority of the Congress.

As it stands, the House Ethics Committee's
"investigation" into the Donald Jones matter is incomplete
and transparently inadequate. Given Speaker Gingrich's
contradictory statements about Donald Jones's activities
within the Speaker's office, and the apparent failure to
receive testimony from Tim Brown and Jeff Coleman or
to question anyone in the case, the House Ethics
Committee must immediately take steps to complete the
investigation into the Donald Jones matter. The
Committee must send this new complaint and our
November 15, 1995 complaint to special counsel for
investigation. Anything less will further jeopardize the
future of the self-regulation of Congressional ethics.

Lastly. by failing to punish Speaker Gingrich for his
various wrongdoings, the Ethics Committee sets an
extremely bad precedent. The import is this: that
members of Congress who repeatedly break rules will
escape unscathed from Ethics Committee action. Such a
precedent is highly destructive to the House Ethics
Committee, and to the Congress.

Sincerely,

Gary Ruskin
