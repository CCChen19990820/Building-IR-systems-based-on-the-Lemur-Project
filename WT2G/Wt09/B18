<h1><center>That astonishing microchip</center></h1>

IT MAY be hard to believe, but it is less than 20 years since this newspaper was introducing readers to the existence of the integrated circuit, then still exotic, and predicting that it would change the world. It did, and in pretty short order. The world's appetite for chips has so far been almost as abundant as the silicon from which they are made.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout this period, chip technology has evolved rapidly, more or less in conformity with the exponential growth in power predicted by Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel, America's leading chip maker. Every time engineers seem close to bumping against the technology's limits, they find some new way to make circuits smaller, faster and cheaper. As a result, the chips that were exotic yesterday are now the commonplace components not just of the computer but also of the car, the camera and the cash card. By common consent it has been the most productivity-enhancing, life-changing technological revolution since the harnessing of steam power in the 18th century or, in the 19th, of electricity itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also by common consent, this revolution also has much further to go. But if the revolution in microelectronics is not yet faltering, there are signs of two big changes.
</p><p><b>Hogs</b>
<br>One is taking place inside the semiconductor business itself. For much of the industry's short life, making chips has been a licence to print money. The first half of the 1990s was especially lucrative; sales last year topped $150 billion. Since Christmas, however, demand has fallen below expectations. Bad news in any industry, this is catastrophic in one where a single factory can cost more than $1 billion to build. The world's most advanced manufacturers are, it seems, no less vulnerable than farmers to the " hog cycle"; extrapolating from the present, they get the future wrong.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although chip makers have got supply and demand out of kilter before, there are grounds for expecting a much bigger impact this time around on the shape of the industry (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). And as the industry changes, so the way people think about chips should change, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For too long, governments have invested the industry with a special mystique. A decade ago, the United States got into a panic when Japanese chip makers seemed to be getting the better of American ones. The chip, it was argued, was at the heart of the digital age, and America had therefore to make its own. Likewise, some Asian tigers still see in chip making not just a way to make money, but also a short-cut to a higher-technology economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this view is, at best, out of date. Like steel, chips have become just any other commodity. From the point of view of national economies, it matters little where they are made, provided that they are available to be cheaply bought. What matters more is how they are subsequently used.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which is, of course, the second big change. For the first 20 years or so of microelectronics, the applications for the new technology seemed obvious. Computers shrank, then moved from the basement to the desktop to the wristwatch, which will soon doubtless be able to phone the nearest restaurant as well as announce that it is time for lunch. Intelligence, of a sort, became distributed: a car's brakes may now "think" quite hard about how to avert a skid. It was microchips that made Ronald Reagan's "star wars" dream almost feasible; maybe you really could track and destroy hundreds of thousands of fast-moving objects in space. The potential applications seemed as boundless as the human imagination.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the imagination does have bounds. Arguably, part of the industry's present plight is the result of computational power having briefly outstripped useful applications for it. A case in point is the reluctance of people to buy Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95. Though it simplifies and prettifies what appears on the computer's monitor, this program requires more memory than most home computers currently possess. The chip industry hoped that this would propel demand for its own products, but a lot of consumers seem to have decided, for now at least, to forgo the marginal improvement the software provides.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taken alone, the fate of this product is nothing more than a straw in the wind, a function of one firm's decisions about timing and pricing. But a lot of other straws are bending the same way. Having initially been transformed by microelectronics, the consumer-electronics industry must now struggle to dream up new "killer applications" as lucrative as personal stereos and video recorders. There are branches of science in which it is not too fanciful to wonder whether researchers have run out of sound ways to use all the computation at their fingertips. With "genetic algorithms", computers are more or less asked to crunch numbers aimlessly in the hope of something interesting popping up. It is telling that economists have so far found the precise productivity benefits of information technology difficult to pin down and measure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can people ever run out of new uses for computers? For a while, perhaps, but not for long. If anything, the computer is right now in the early throes of a new phase of its revolution, as it becomes more an instrument of communication, less one of computation. It is, after all, only in the past few years that microelectronics has invented what amounts to a whole new dimension of commerce and discourse. You do not have to be a nerd or a mystic to see that historians will look back upon the emergence of "cyberspace" as a turning point no less decisive than the advent of the computer itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A machine that transforms communication impinges far more radically on people's lives than one that transforms computation. Why mass media, when information can be consumed in individualised packets? Must workplaces be "places" at all? The next limiting factor is not going to be the ability to imagine the future, or to invent it; many people think they can imagine it all too well. It is their willingness to embrace it that will matter most.

<h2>An edgy peace</h2>
After four years of strife, <b>Sarajevo</b> <b>was reunited</b> in accordance with the Dayton peace plan. But when Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation took over the last of the city's Serb suburbs, most residents fled--under pressure from Serb nationalists hostile to the notion of a multi-ethnic Bosnia. Meanwhile, transatlantic tension is again rising, as the Europeans refuse to back American plans for arming Bosnia's Muslims, and the Americans have yet to provide any money for economic reconstruction.<p>Britain blocked the latest European plans to develop an embryonic cross-border European police force, <b>Europol</b>, arguing that the European Court of Justice should not be allowed to settle disputes involving the new force.<p>The British government's scientific advisers admitted for the first time that <font size=-1>BSE</font>--better known as <b>"mad cow disease"</b>--may be transmitted to humans through infected beef. The government promised stricter controls on the beef industry and more money for scientific research.<p>Germany's main opposition party, the Social Democrats, demanded that unlimited immigration of <b>ethnic Germans</b> from the former Soviet Union, where up to 2m may still live, should be stopped.<p>The Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, voted to reassert "the legitimacy" of <b>the Soviet Union </b>and to denounce the 1991 treaty that set up the Commonwealth of Independent States. The votes, which have no direct constitutional force, were condemned by President Boris Yeltsin.<p>The Swedish parliament approved <b>Goran Persson</b>, a former finance minister, as the country's prime minister to replace Ingvar Carlsson, who has retired.<p>
<h2>For sure</h2>
Senator Bob Dole clinched the Republican nomination for the <b>presidency </b>with a convincing sweep of mid-western state primaries. The press worried intensely about his age and state of health. His only remaining rival, Pat Buchanan, promised to continue to fight for "the rights of the unborn" and for American workers.<p>General <b>Colin Powell </b>ruled out running for "any elective office", thereby squashing speculation that he would be Mr Dole's running-mate.<p><b>Ross Perot </b>announced that he would run for the presidency if supporters of his Reform Party asked him to. He would, however, prefer to see his party led by "George Washington II", assuming he could find him.<p>Trade ministers from all western-hemisphere countries but Cuba met in Cartagena, Colombia, to discuss pan-American <b>free trade</b>. At the World Trade Organisation in Geneva, the <font size=-1>EU</font>, backed by Mexico and Canada, denounced the United States' new law on investment in Cuba; a formal dispute may follow. In Florence, Central American foreign ministers met <font size=-1>EU</font> ones, to upgrade links; the region gets more aid from <font size=-1>EU</font> countries than from the United States, but two-way trade is only $5 billion a year.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>Three <b>Colombian</b> <b>ministers </b>were named for investigation in the drug-money scandal relating to last year's presidential election. One of them, the country's foreign minister, Rodrigo Pardo, resigned "temporarily".<p><b>Guatemala's</b> <font size=-1>URNG </font> rebels and army began a truce, after 35 years of fighting.<p>

<h2>Bar the shouting</h2>
A war of words broke out between America and China over <b>Taiwan</b>. After a Chinese demand that American warships stay clear of the Taiwan Strait, the defence secretary, William Perry, said that America "has the best damned navy in the world, and no one should ever forget that." Taiwan asked America to sell it weapons to break any possible blockade by the Chinese.<p>The Bangladeshi prime minister, Khaleda Zia, agreed to an opposition demand for a <b>neutral government </b>to oversee a future general election, but she refused to step down immediately.<p>The Indian government, burdened by a corruption scandal, will hold a <b>general election </b>in late April and May.<p>China's parliament, the National People's Congress, passed a law stating that <b>defendants are innocent </b>until proven guilty.<p>Australia's <b>Labor Party</b> elected Kim Beazley as its new leader, to replace Paul Keating, who led his party to defeat in the recent general election.<p>
<h2>Underwhelmed</h2>
<b>Zimbabwe's </b>President Robert Mugabe, 72, was re-elected for another six years. He took 93% of the votes, but in a turnout of only 32%.<p><b>Sierra Leone</b> got a civilian president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, after four years of army rule. Declared winner, he said the soldiers would hand over by end-March.<p>Mathieu K&eacuter&eacutekou, <b>Benin</b>'s old dictator, thrown out through the ballot box in 1991, appeared to have been brought back by voters disillusioned with President Nic&eacutephore Soglo. But the result remains unclear.<p><b>Sudan</b>, which may soon face <font size=-1>UN</font> sanctions for harbouring men suspected of trying to assassinate Egypt's president last year, also held a general election at which the president and most of his cabinet were re-elected.<p>South Africa's president, <b>Nelson Mandela</b>, was granted a divorce from <b>Winnie</b> after 38 years of marriage.<p>The cycle of violence in <b>Bahrain</b> continued with a hotel bombed and large-scale arrests. The government's new security measures are expected to include a special court to try protesters.<p>

<h2>Fighting the flab</h2>
<P>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Europe's largest car maker seems to have recovered from a bad spell of several years. Though still some way off its best year, <b>Volkswagen</b> more than doubled its net profits in 1995 to DM336m ($234m) on worldwide sales up 10%, and said it would sharply raise its dividend. But its French counterpart, <b>Renault</b>, saw net profits sag by 41% to FFr2.14 billion ($429m). Commercial-vehicle sales jumped but its car-making unit sunk from a profit of FFr289m to an operating loss of FFr1.7 billion, putting the French government's hopes of privatising Renault in jeopardy.<p>America's <b>Rockwell </b>is seeking a buyer for its aerospace and defence businesses, valued at some $3.5 billion, as the country's defence industry continues to consolidate rapidly; both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are said to be interested in buying.<p>The German government said <b>Airbus Industrie </b>would have to turn itself from a loose consortium into an efficient, commercial company before it would consider subsidies to develop new planes. A&eacuterospatiale, the consortium's French member, appeared to welcome the idea even though it could suffer most.<p>Workers and managers were close to settling the strike at two of <b>General Motors</b>' parts factories in Dayton, Ohio. The strike, which began on March 5th over job security and the outside supply of some parts, had affected nearly all <font size=-1>GM</font>'s 29 American factories and some 175,000 workers. It was the firm's most damaging in 25 years.<p>Swedish-Swiss <b>ABB</b>, one of Europe's most admired companies, is suspected by European Union investigators of participating in an alleged price-rigging cartel in the European market for district heating.<p>Sweden's Wallenberg industrial empire expects to raise between SKr15.5 billion ($2.3 billion) and SKr18.5 billion with the sale of a 50% stake in <b>Scania</b>, the world's most profitable lorry maker, in a stockmarket flotation.<p><b>The Russians and Americans may produce a joint </b><b>supersonic passenger jet</b>, based in part on the Tupolev-144, freshly out of mothballs, whose maiden flight was in 1968 and which resembles a larger version of the Franco-British Concorde.<p>
<h2>Trades and swaps</h2>
<p>Shaking off the previous week's upsets not only in America's markets but worldwide, the <b>Dow Jones </b>soared to a new record before dropping back after Digital Equipment warned of a poor outlook for computer sales.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The <b>London Stock Exchange</b> is moving after all to a system of electronic order-driven trading, in place of its present market-making system. This was the change advocated by Michael Lawrence, its former chief executive, whose dismissal in January was blamed by many on the power of the exchange's market-making members.<p>World <b>financial regulators </b>met in Florida and agreed to share information on unusual trades, in an effort to prevent another shock like the collapse of Britain's Barings bank last year.<p>Nine former executives at <b>Barings </b>have been barred from working in the City for up to three years by the Securities and Futures Authority. But Peter Baring, chairman of the group, and Andrew Tuckey, chairman of the investment-banking unit, were cleared by the authority.<p>
<h2>Muscle flexing</h2>
Managers of Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, asked the pension fund's board to approve an international <b>corporate governance</b> programme. The $97 billion fund would pressure the foreign firms in which it invests to be more responsive to shareholders.<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>The Japanese economy </b>grew at its fastest rate in five years, an expansion boosted by stronger than expected consumer spending. In the last quarter of 1995, <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew by 0.9%, giving an annualised rate of 3.6% that more than doubles many estimates of growth, despite a shrinking trade surplus.<p>There were fresh rumours in <b>Argentina </b>that Domingo Cavallo would resign. Wrong again. But he did cut taxes to boost the economy, still saying that <font size=-1>GDP</font> would grow by about 5% this year.<p>Brazil's government announced an 8 billion <i>real </i>($8.1 billion) bail-out of <b>Banco do Brasil</b>, the country's largest bank.<p>
<h2>Kids' stuff</h2>
<p><b>Michael Jackson</b> and <b>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Saud</b>, a Saudi businessman whose interests include large stakes in Citicorp, Euro Disney and Canary Wharf, are forming a global entertainment company, Kingdom Entertainment, that will focus on " family values".<p>Britain's General Electric has found a successor to<b> Lord Weinstock</b>, who has now been managing director for 33 years and is to retire later this year. He is George Simpson, chief executive of Lucas Industries, a British engineering group which recorded a 38% jump in first-half profits to &#163;61.6m ($95.9m).<p>In a bid to placate unions opposed to privatisation, the French government said it would retain control of <b>France T&eacutel&eacutecom</b> while hoping to convert the state utility into a corporation with its own capital. But as Europe's telecoms giants come closer to liberalisation, even that step upsets the unions. They threatened to strike.<p><p></p>

<h1>When the chips are down</h1>
<p><b>The semiconductor business, one of the world's largest industries, is about to go through a period of wrenching change</b></p>

<p>FOR most of the 1990s, the chip industry has seemed like one of the most extraordinary money-making machines ever devised. Demand soared; the power of the chips themselves soared; and prices rose or stayed stable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result was a bonanza for chip makers which outweighed the experience of the mid-1980s, when price wars split the business in two, driving many American firms out of the mass-production end of the industry making memory chips and forcing them to concentrate on higher value-added chips such as micro-processors. It also outweighed the late 1980s, when Japanese firms (which concentrate on memory chips) lost billions during a trade war with America. The past few years have been richer than all those tough years combined.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bankers Trust calculates that profit margins for Taiwan's chip makers, for example, rose from 16% in 1990 to nearly 60% in 1995. Last year, the number of memory chips sold rose 40% and the memory-chip business probably made profits of nearly $30 billion on revenues of $55 billion. Some fabrication plants have been making nearly $1 billion in net profits each year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What was just as extraordinary was that this period seemed to overturn a basic rule of the chip business which says that the power of a chip doubles every 18 months and, as a corollary, prices halve (originally, it was every year: the rule was expounded as long ago as 1965 by Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, an American chip maker). More power for less money was the combination that made semiconductors the business that transformed business. Yet in the early 1990s, with personal-computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>) demand skyrocketing and memory chips in short supply, the price of these basic chips climbed to three times their cost of production and stayed there, defying every established pattern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, last December, it all started to go wrong. First, prices started to tumble. The market price of the most common kind of memory chip, which had been as high as $13 in November 1995, began dropping by more than $1 a month as <font size=-1>PC </font>makers dumped excess stocks after disappointing sales during the Christmas season. By March the price was down to around $9 (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>; for comparison, a state-of-the-art micro-processor can cost $1,000).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In January, things got worse. The Semiconductor Industry Association reported that its so-called " book-to-bill" ratio had dropped to 0.92, its lowest point since 1985. That meant that for every $100-worth of chips the industry was making, it was only taking orders for $92-worth of new ones. It was the first time since 1989 that the indicator had gone below 1.0. At first, the industry shrugged off that figure as an anomaly. Then came February's number: 0.90. For businessmen accustomed to soaring sales, this sort of slump is enough to send them to the window ledge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suddenly, manufacturers are scrambling to postpone planned expansion. Micron, America's largest memory-chip producer, says it will delay completion of a $2.5 billion fabrication plant in Utah. Fujitsu of Japan has announced it will delay the start of a similar plant in Britain. A consortium of American and Asian firms has scrapped plans to build another plant in Taiwan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cutbacks are needed. Profits for the five big Japanese chip makers had been expected to grow 55% this year; instead, analysts reckon, they will grow 15%. In the past six months, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, a measure of the share prices of American chip makers, has dropped 45%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For users of chips--which now means everyone from purchasers of <font size=-1>PC</font>s to manufacturers of cars and pop-up toasters--the fall in chip prices must be welcome. Chips are now everywhere--there are some 200 billion in use, installed in everything from computers and telecommunications to greetings cards. The average American house has 50 chips in consumer goods from the microwave oven to the door chime; a new <font size=-1>BMW </font>may have more than 50. Automotive semiconductors alone are a $5 billion market. All these businesses will benefit--albeit, in many cases, marginally--as their components become cheaper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So will other firms. Firms such as South Korea's Samsung and Japan's <font size=-1>NEC</font> have used their semiconductor factories as cash cows to bankroll expansion into everything from <font size=-1>PC</font>s and cars to aerospace. If memory-chip prices continue to fall, the cash cows will run dry, exposing the real costs of money-losing or inefficient parts of the conglomerates, which could force the parent firms to pull back from some markets altogether. This is bad news for them, of course, but good for competitors, who no longer have cross-subsidisation from semiconductors to worry about. And consumers everywhere should benefit in the long run because production and investment will no longer be skewed by profits from chips.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to leave the argument there, and to say that no one need worry about falling semiconductor prices, is to under-estimate how much a shake-out in the chip industry would matter in its own right. The reason has to do with the sheer size of the business. Worldwide semiconductor sales passed $150 billion last year, three times what they were a decade ago. Chips in all their varieties now make up some 15% of the world equipment market, up from 7% in the mid-1980s. By mid-1997, if the growth rates of 1995 were to continue, America's chip manufacturers (which are, remember, mainly in the luxury end of the business) would be bigger than its steel industry; by 2000, they would be as big as aerospace. Mr Moore has facetiously remarked that, on these trends, the world's semiconductor market would be bigger than the world's <font size=-1>GDP</font> by 2040. Upheavals in such an industry matter.
</p><p><b>Wheel of misfortune</b><br>(see <a href="sf2.gif">table</a>)<br>So why have prices suddenly plunged? And might they go on falling?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All industries have downturns. But semiconductor firms have good reason to fear theirs more than most. The chip market tends to be highly unstable, partly because there are few industries that involve such massive fixed costs and partly because demand for chips can change rapidly, while a new fabrication plant can take a year or more to build.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The long lead times needed to build a plant mean that the supply of chips tends to be sticky: that is, it does not adjust smoothly to price changes or to changes in demand. Normally, manufacturers tend to reduce the output of goods for which demand and price are falling. But last year's investment in chips will produce a big extra supply just as prices are slumping. This will push prices even lower.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The volatility of the chip market is compounded by manufacturers' high fixed costs. New fabrication plants ("fabs") can cost well over $1 billion, and the biggest will cost more than $2 billion within a year or two. State-of-the-tech fabs become obsolete in three to five years; staying ahead in such a business requires a large chip maker to spend vast sums simply to keep up with technology. Last year semiconductor firms spent $30 billion on new fabrication capacity. Intel, America's largest chip manufacturer, spent $3 billion alone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To recoup its investment, a semiconductor firm will want to run the plant as near to full capacity as possible. This means it might not cut production even when demand drops, producing a glut and even lower prices. Conversely, when demand rises, there may be no spare capacity in existing plants, leading to a shortage and soaring prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, such market instability is a characteristic that the high-tech chip business shares with that most basic of industries, agriculture. Farming is also a commodity business in which supplies adjust stickily to demand because of long lead times (the months it takes to grow a crop or fatten an animal for market). Farmers must fix next year's output on this year's prices, leading to unstable price swings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Volatile prices have long been used to justify government intervention in agriculture (to smooth out price fluctuations). Such intervention has occurred in the chip market, too--and made matters worse.
</p><p><b>Sinking the chip</b>
<br>In the 1980s, when <font size=-1>IBM</font> launched the <font size=-1>PC</font> revolution, Japanese firms had both the technical skills to design new chips and the money to build new plants. They started selling chips cheaply into America, causing American firms to cry foul and to accuse the Japanese of "dumping" chips at below the cost of production. The American government took up their cause, imposing steep import tariffs on Japanese chips and some consumer-electronic hardware.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strategy backfired. By 1987 all but two big American firms had left the memory-chips business for higher-value microprocessing. Meanwhile, the tariffs had helped drive up the cost of memory chips by nearly 300%, harming chip purchasers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With America mostly out of the memory market, and Japan reining in output to avoid worsening the trade row (and because its economy was beginning to slow anyway), the result was another overshoot, this time the other way. Demand outstripped supply and prices soared. Hence the artificially inflated chip prices of the early 1990s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Markets, like nature, abhor a vacuum. South Korean firms such as Samsung and the <font size=-1>LG </font>Group (then Lucky Goldstar) looked at high memory-chip prices and saw a chance to make a killing. Designing chips is a research-intensive job. But making them is largely a matter of buying the equipment and building a "clean room" in which to put it. The Koreans started building their own fabs, financed by the deep pockets of the <i>chaebol--</i>the family-owned conglomerates of which they are part. Last year, South Korea overtook Japan as the largest producer of memory chips, just as Japan had overtaken America ten years earlier.
</p><p><b>The chip cyclist returns</b>
<br>Given the experience of the Japanese, it might seem foolhardy for the South Koreans to bet so much of their expansion on memory chips. But they, and others like them, may have thought the industry had changed and its cycles had been tamed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chip makers are now in closer contact with their customers than they once were. With a direct link to a <font size=-1>PC </font>makers' inventory system, a chip maker can use "just-in-time" manufacturing techniques to keep supplies tied more closely to demand. Electronics firms have cut their average chip inventory from 11 weeks in 1985 to just three, which should, in theory, restrain massive over-supply. The industry is geographically dispersed. In the 1980s, almost all of it took place in America or Japan, making chips sensitive to the yen/dollar exchange rate. Today, new entrants are flooding in from Asia (notably South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong). And chips are now being used in more industries than before, making suppliers--apparently--less sensitive to any one business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, as the current downturn shows, these changes have not proved enough to flatten out the chip cycle. Surges of investment continue, regardless of what is happening to inventory-control systems. Though new producers are starting up, America and Japan still have nearly 80% of the world market between them. Above all, the spread of chips into new markets is not what it seems. True, chips are found in thousands of different devices these days. But chip manufacturers still make most of their money from just one industry: computers. Dan Hutcheson, president of <font size=-1>VLSI</font> Research, a California-based consultancy firm, reckons that computers account for some 60% of semiconductor revenues. Mobile telephones account for perhaps another 10%. Nothing else comes close.
</p><p><b>Fear Windows</b>
<br>So, ubiquitous or not, chips remain vulnerable to the fortunes of the computer business. Both the recent slump in memory-chip prices and the plunge in the book-to-bill ratio have their roots in changes affecting the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry. Those changes stem primarily from the rise of Microsoft, a software company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In their 15 years of existence, <font size=-1>PC</font>s have evolved in fits and starts. Bursts of activity followed the invention of processor chips, made by Intel. Intel started with the 8086 chip, then the 80286, then the 80386, each separated by about three years. Each was faster than the previous generation, and sold a lot of new <font size=-1>PC</font>s. But the number and value of chips in those machines stayed about the same. Then came Microsoft's Windows operating system, introduced in the late 1980s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Windows required 4m bytes of memory to run well, twice as much as most <font size=-1>PC</font>s then had. As the system took off, new <font size=-1>PC</font>s were made with at least that much memory, doubling the growth in demand for memory chips. Last year, Microsoft released Windows 95, which needed twice as much memory again. As <font size=-1>PC</font> users groaned under the hype surrounding the new program, chip makers were slavering at the thought of the extra demand it required.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But nothing happened--or not much. Companies have been slow to buy Windows 95, partly because of associated hardware costs, partly because it is not clear to them how to use the extra software power, and partly because Microsoft has another, more powerful, operating system, called Windows <font size=-1>NT</font>, in the wings. The result is that many firms have decided to wait and see whether to upgrade--and are buying nothing in the meantime. This has not only hurt memory chips, but has also slowed demand at the higher-value-added end of the business, micro-processing. Intel's latest processor, the Pentium Pro, runs efficiently only under one of the two new versions of Windows. In this respect, though the chip business may no longer be monolithic, different parts of it are affected similarly by changes in computing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chip makers hope that their computer-driven woes are temporary. If <font size=-1>PC</font> sales begin to pick up soon, the "book to bill" ratio might rise above 1.0 and the free fall in prices might slow (though, with new capacity coming on stream, prices are likely to keep going down).
</p><p><b>Chip shape?</b></b>
<br>But even if this happens, the big problem--the heart-stopping price of a new fabrication plant--remains. Chip makers are running up against the physical limits of the technology itself: transistors on a state-of-the-art chip are now packed so closely together that they are near the point beyond which electrons tunnel through insulating walls and individual atoms become obstacles. Engineers may be able to get around this hurdle but the cost is likely to be astronomical. Meanwhile, the law of diminishing returns seems to be setting in. Between 1984 and 1990, the cost of a fabrication plant doubled but chip makers were able to triple the performance of a chip (measured by the number of components packed on to a sliver of silicon). They are unlikely to do as well next time. The next generation of fabs will see costs double again by 1998, but this is likely to produce only a 50% improvement in performance. What, then, can firms do?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer is three things:
<li> Team up. Writing recently in <i>Scientific American</i>, a monthly journal, the founders of <font size=-1>VLSI </font>Research calculate that rising costs will soon make chip manufacturing unaffordable for single firms. Increasingly, chip makers are sharing the costs of a new fab with customers, competitors, even countries. <font size=-1>IBM </font>and Toshiba are building a fab together, as are Motorola and Siemens; all four are working together on design. Texas Instruments started with a deal with the Italian government for a new fab, then tied up with Taiwan's Acer, Japan's Kobe Steel and a Singaporean consortium. The alliances have saved it more than $1 billion in capital costs over the past few years.
<li> Subcontract manufacturing. Other firms are dealing with the problem of expensive fabs by not having one at all. These so-called "fabless" firms design the chips, then contract the manufactuer of them out to a "foundry" (a factory without its own design operation). The advantage for the fabless firms is that they can get into the chip business without having to spend billions on manufacture. The foundries still face the problems of the investment cycle, of course, but at least they can mix and match customers to help spread the risk of any one customer going sour. Fabless chip firms make up just 1% of the market today, but are expected to have 5% by 2000. In the meantime, foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing are booming.
<li> Specialise. One of the advantages of separating design from production is that it lets companies exploit technology niches while leaving the cost of manufacturing to a contractor. As Intel has faced more competition in the micro-processor business, it has diversified, producing some 30 different kinds of 486 chips, compared with just two versions of its first processor. Toshiba is doing the same with memory chips.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Firms that survive to produce chips in five or ten years' time are likely to have adopted one or all of these strategies. But chip makers' immediate concern is simply to survive the next year or two as new entrants flood into the market. Mr Hutcheson reckons that Taiwan's chip makers, for instance, may soon discover that the profits that lured them in are no longer there. Likewise for some of the South Korean firms, such as Samsung, that have expanded most aggressively. The memory-chip market, he says "has never been for the weak of heart" . A lesson to remember in the good times: the bad times invariably return.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?827532000,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>GP fundholding</b></p>
<h1>Too little change</h1>
<p><b>According to the Audit Commission, one of the key elements of the government's health reforms is not yet working</b></p>

<p>"FUNDHOLDING"--the freedom of <font size=-1>NHS</font>-employed family doctors to manage their own budgets--is "one of the great successes" of the government's controversial <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms, according to Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary. At the beginning of 1996, there were 2,200 fundholding general practicescontrolling &#163;3 billion of health-care spending. By next month, 15,000 practices (one in two) will be managing their own fixed budgets to pay for primary care, drug costs and non-urgent hospital treatment. <font size=-1>GP</font> fundholders boast that they have improved patient care, introduced new methods of treatment, and shortened hospital waiting times.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But how far are these claims justified? A two-year inquiry to be published shortly by the Audit Commission, a government agency which reviews public spending, provides scant comfort to the scheme's champions, which include this newspaper. Some details of the report, the most extensive examination so far of the fundholding experiment, were first leaked earlier this month to the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, a medical weekly. Since then <i>The Economist</i> has seen a draft of the entire report.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It concludes that most fundholding doctors have secured "few measurable benefits to patients". Instead, fundholders themselves have garnered a fair part of such benefits as have been achieved. On average 60% of the scheme's savings have been used to improve surgery premises. Though patients benefit from this, some doctors have done even better, pocketing higher prices for their practices when they sell them to other doctors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These findings will embarrass ministers who claim that the government's <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms--designed to create an "internal market" by splitting "purchasers" and "providers" of health care--have revolutionised the delivery of services to patients. But the Audit Commission's findings will delight Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who have argued that the administrative costs of fundholding outweigh whatever benefits it has produced. Labour is committed to ending fundholding.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most common complaint against fundholding is that it is creating a two-tier health service. If only that were so. In fact, the Audit Commission's report finds that average hospital waiting times for patients of fundholders were not significantly shorter than those for non-fundholding practices. The commission acknowledges the scheme's considerable potential to improve delivery of primary health services, but says that most doctors are failing to exploit its possibilities. Instead they continue to purchase the same products and services in the same quantities from the same hospitals and drug companies as in the past. In short, little has changed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few fundholders, the report says, possess the information needed to improve the lot of their patients. Most do not know the average waiting time to see a hospital specialist or the length of the queue for particular specialities. The commission also found no evidence that fundholders prescribe drugs more economically--by using, for example, generic instead of branded versions--than other doctors. Most fundholders also failed to save money by greater use of day surgery for minor operations instead of hospital treatment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Audit Commission is particularly critical of health authorities, which employ <font size=-1>GP</font>s, for failing to monitor the performance of fundholders. Some 15% of <font size=-1>NHS</font> spending is already controlled by fundholders but financial oversight of this spending is patchy, according to the report.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than one in five fundholders overspent their budgets in 1993-94. But, whereas fundholding practices are allowed to keep surpluses from their budget, and use the extra money in subsequent years, there is no mechanism for health authorities to claw back deficits. This lack of financial discipline is highlighted by the commission's report. Only 13% of the 1,308 fundholders surveyed had received any response to the financial reports they filed monthly with the health authority. Half of the fundholders interviewed by the commission had not been visited by their health authority during the previous year. The report condemns this as inadequate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most damning aspect of the report is the spotlight it puts on the costs of fundholding. Staff, equipment and computing costs swallowed &#163;232m in the first five years of the scheme, the equivalent of two additional hospitals. But this is only part of the additional cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local health authorities estimate that it costs them &#163;5,900 a year to deal witheach fundholder. The Audit Commission quotes the estimate of one hospitaltrust that it costs four times as much to negotiate contracts with 13 fundholding practices, accounting for 4% of the trust's income, as it does with the local health authority, accounting for 91% of its income. The <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms were bound to raise administrative costs--if only because there was little administration, and thus financial transparency, before them. But these numbers look excessive set against the lack of measurable benefits for patients which the commission has found.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Amid so much bad news, it is easy to overlook the good. The report accepts that fundholding has led to improved communication between <font size=-1>GP</font>s, hospitals and hospital doctors. This must be of benefit to patients. It also notes that some innovative fundholders have introduced real improvements for their patients, such as local physiotherapy services. One fundholder switched orthopaedic operations to a different hospital, thereby saving his practice &#163;40,000 a year. But, says the commission, there are simply too few such examples.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The message that comes loud and clear from the Audit Commission is that the additional costs of fundholding can be justified only if real benefits to patients can be secured. The commission believes this is possible. The scheme has considerable potential, it says, arguing that the principle of devolving control over purchasing decisions to <font size=-1>GP</font>s should, eventually, produce a more efficient and responsive <font size=-1>NHS</font>. But the potential of fundholding, the commission says, has yet to be realised.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission makes no specific recommendations about how to do this. But it is clearly wrong that there are few sanctions against those practices which either overspend or underspend by large amounts. Deficits should not automatically be made good; nor should decisions over profit levels be left to the sole discretion of fundholders. Health authorities, which are responsible for most purchasing decisions, cannot entirely abdicate their responsibility for primary health care. They need closely to monitor both the clinical and financial performance of all fundholding practices, encouraging the spread of the best techniques. As the Audit Commission points out, the <font size=-1>NHS</font> has barely begun the first steps on a huge programme of change. The right incentives are not yet in place.

<p><b>Divorce law</b></p>
<h1>Tears at bedtime</h1>


<p>(See <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>)<br>LIKE the impulse to probe a painful tooth, divorce law appears to be irresistible to legislators. Rich countries all over the world have been tinkering with ways to make divorce better, or at least less awful. In Britain, a divorce bill proposed by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, receives its second reading in the House of Commons on March 25th, after a rough passage through the House of Lords. If it passes, it will be the fourth change to the divorce laws since 1969. And it will not be the last. On March 21st, the cabinet met to discuss the Lords' last-minute amendment, requiring equal pension rights. The government would prefer not to deal with the complexities of pension-splitting in this bill, but knows it cannot wish it away. The issue is particularly sensitive in Britain, because job-based pensions predominate; in Europe, where state pensions are more important, it has been fairly simple--though expensive--to extend equal pension rights to all adults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain differs from other developed countries in two other important respects. Three-quarters of British divorces are fault-based: one partner accuses the other of adultery, cruelty or unreasonable behaviour. In many of these, one partner agrees to carry the blame in order to get a quick divorce (a two-year wait is required for a no-fault divorce). With a good lawyer and an uncrowded court schedule, a determined couple can get a divorce in three months.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Continental Europe and all other English-speaking countries have already moved towards a norm of no-fault divorce; in those countries where fault is retained, such as France, it is used sparingly. Defenders of fault say that it acts as a deterrent to frivolous divorce; sceptics wonder why, then, so many British couples seem eager to assign fault--and why Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain is also unusual in that divorce is possible--and not uncommon--before arrangements about finances, custody and child support have been agreed to. This, too, would change under the bill: no deal, no divorce. In some ways, then, Britain is swimming with the tide. But in others, Lord Mackay's controversial reforms set Britain somewhat apart. The first is that, under his bill, there would be no distinction between contested and uncontested divorces, as there is now. France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal and most other European countries (except some in Scandinavia) maintain some kind of distinction between divorces in which both spouses want to end a marriage, and those in which only one does. Typically, where there is an unwilling spouse, he or she can delay a divorce, but not deny it indefinitely. Critics of Lord Mackay's bill argue that removing this distinction undermines the principle that marriage is binding: it makes matrimony the only form of contract that one party can breach without penalty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second provision that would make Britain different from many of its European neighbours concerns mediation. The legislation recommends using counsellors, rather than lawyers, to reach a settlement, in order to make divorce less nasty. Just as getting rid of fault eliminates the need to tell, or make up, outrageous stories about the "guilty" spouse, getting rid of the lawyers (some of the time, anyway) is supposed to minimise conflict.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although mediation is presented as voluntary, in practice it may often be mandatory. About three-quarters of divorces are sought by women; three-quarters of these use legal aid. To the extent that legal-aid money is instead used for mediation, the effect could be to limit legal assistance. Feminists fear that more women than men would be hurt by this. Perhaps, but feminist-friendly Australia and Canada have long emphasised mediation, and are happy with it. New Zealand has gone furthest of all. Its state mediation service is free to all couples; the government claims a high rate of reconciliation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, mediation seems an English-language phenomenon, perhaps a response to the ferociously confrontational nature of Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Nowhere in continental Europe (except a few Swiss cantons) has come out as strongly as Britain in favour of mediation. Although Germany encourages the practice, Belgium actually removed a requirement to mediate in 1994. Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands work on the principle that, if a couple wants to split, the partners should work out the details by themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third point of difference between Britain and the rest is that Lord Mackay is using divorce reform explicitly to assert the value of marriage. Reducing the trauma of divorce presents opportunities to save salvageable marriages, which he argues is the state's duty and in its interest. And yet by treating all divorce alike and putting a larger burden on the couple to come to terms, Britain would be moving in a distinctly Scandinavian direction. The Scandinavians, though, do not share Lord Mackay's view of marriage. They see it as a voluntary arrangement between two individuals, and divorce as an individual right that should be easy to exercise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One issue no country has come to grips with is that a large minority of divorced fathers lose interest in their children. In Britain, two years after divorce about 40% of fathers have stopped visiting regularly; and Sweden is not alone in reporting that the proportion of men paying child support is slipping. Such paternal aloofness can damage children in ways that show up in their behaviour, schooling and health. Through the much-hated Child Support Agency, Britain seeks to enforce the collection of child support, but the divorce bill goes no further in defining parental obligations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other countries are experimenting with ways to instil the idea that post-divorce fatherhood means more than sending a cheque. Germany's proposed family law stresses that the non-custodial parent (almost always the father) retains legal responsibility; it also appeals to parents to respect their child's desire to see the absent parent. Australia's new family law encourages couples to draw up detailed "parenting plans". A number of countries, including Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, promote "joint responsibility" arrangements that assert both parents' legal responsibility for their children. It is too early to say whether such legal remedies have had any effect. In practice, mothers are still likely to do most of the work, with occasional assistance from dad.

<p><b>Competition policy</b></p>
<h1>An unholy mess</h1>


<p>THOSE who dislike the government's approach to competition policy, ranging from the Labour Party to consumer organisations, say it is muddle-headed, weak and contradictory. The critics are about to be handed a perfect example of regulatory chaos.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Department of Trade and Industry (<font size=-1>DTI</font>) is on the point of abandoning a criminal investigation of Unilever's subsidiary, Birds Eye Wall's, for misleading the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (<font size=-1>MMC</font>). The <font size=-1>DTI</font> has been forced to abandon its investigation by the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s refusal to accept that it was misled by Birds Eye Wall's when it cleared the company of unfair trading practices in its 1994 inquiry into the &#163;250m market for wrapped ice cream.This market for the goodies sold direct from shops' freezer cabinets, known in the trade as "impulse ice cream", is dominated by Wall's, which has a 66% share of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s position is causing considerable friction in Whitehall, with officials from the Office of Fair Trading (<font size=-1>OFT</font>) in open disagreement with it. The <font size=-1>DTI</font> is also at loggerheads with the <font size=-1>MMC</font> because the agency has refused to supply transcripts of oral evidence given to it. These are needed to make an assessment of whether a prosecution could succeed. Officials believe the <font size=-1>MMC</font> is taking such an obdurate line because it fears that a prosecution would raise embarrassing questions about its handling of the case and the thoroughness of its procedures. The <font size=-1>MMC</font> has issued a formal statement to <i>The Economist</i> claiming that it had "co-operated fully" with the <font size=-1>OFT</font>'s and <font size=-1>DTI</font>'s investigations. Other Whitehall sources do not agree.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This internecine Whitehall dispute stems from a year-long investigation conducted by the <font size=-1>OFT</font> into complaints that an <font size=-1>MMC</font> inquiry into wrapped ice cream sales in 1994 had been derailed by false evidence. Two months ago, the <font size=-1>OFT</font> concluded that there was a <i>prima facie </i>case that Birds Eye Wall's had "knowingly or recklessly misled" the <font size=-1>MMC</font>. This is an offence under Section 93B of the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Penalties on conviction range from a fine to two years in prison, though no company has yet been prosecuted under the law.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The row arises from undertakings given by Birds Eye Wall's that retailers were "under no contractual obligation whatsoever" to obtain supplies of Wall's ice cream exclusively from the company's concessionaires. In response to the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s concerns about its trading practices, Slaughter and May, the company's solicitors, wrote on November 26th, 1993: "Steps have been taken that no pressure will be put on retailers." On November 30th of that year, the commercial director of Birds Eye Wall's, Alan Brown, was asked by the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s deputy chairman, Hans Liesner, what precise actions had been taken by the company. Mr Brown replied: "Instructions have gone to all the sales staff that no pressure should be put on retailers." However, last November Birds Eye Wall's admitted that no such instructions had, in fact, been given.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was on the basis of these assurances, nevertheless, that the <font size=-1>MMC</font> found that the company's trading practices were not operating against the public interest. But when the <font size=-1>OFT</font> began an investigation, it was sent copies of more than 50 contracts, some dated as late as last year, which required retailers to purchase Wall's ice cream only from one of the company's concessionaires. It was also given statements by several concessionaires confirming that the policy was backed by senior Birds Eye Wall's directors. At a very late stage in the <font size=-1>OFT</font>'s investigation, Birds Eye Wall's conceded that the company had inadvertently misled the <font size=-1>MMC</font>. It admitted that instructions to sales staff that retailers were free to buy Wall's ice cream from any wholesaler had not been sent out until after the publication of the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s report in March 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of this admission, together with the documentary evidence of the contracts, the <font size=-1>OFT</font> concluded that Birds Eye Wall's had misled the <font size=-1>MMC</font>. But at a meeting earlier this month of competition officials and lawyers called by the <font size=-1>DTI</font> to assess the evidence, Tony Nieduszynski, the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s secretary, insisted that the commission had not been misled. He claimed that since July 1990, retailers had not been required to buy their Wall's ice cream from the firm's concessionaires even if some of the authorised distributors had acted as if there were still such an obligation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced by this position and the refusal of the <font size=-1>MMC</font> to supply essential evidence, lawyers from the <font size=-1>DTI</font> have concluded that there is no basis on which a prosecution of Birds Eye Wall's can succeed. The decision, which is unlikely to be announced for some weeks, may provoke an application for judicial review of the decision by competitor companies such as Mars and Treats.

<html><head><title>Stay back, China</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></p><h1><center>Stay back, China</center></h1>THEY may be only war games this time, but the roar of China's guns and missiles in the seas close to Taiwan brings Asia to a dangerous turning-point. China's blatant attempt to intimidate Taiwan before its first democratic presidential election, on March 23rd, suddenly has East Asia's most populous power eyeball-to-eyeball with its fourth-largest economic power, with all the damage that an accidental clash or a military miscalculation could do to stability in the region. But China's challenge goes beyond that. It cannot safely be left unanswered.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By using force to press its claim to Taiwan--as, last year, to vast tracts of the South China Sea--China has once again served notice on its neighbours and on the United States, the country with the greatest influence in the region, that it now feels strong enough to play Asia's power game by its own rules and win. If China is allowed to get away with bullying Taiwan, the security of one of the world's most dynamic, and potentially richest, regions will be in jeopardy. Yet standing up more stoutly to an increasingly pushy China will take the sort of clear thinking and plain talking that China's neighbours prefer to avoid.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just that the East Asians are wary of attracting mighty China's wrath--though they are. They had hoped, as western governments had, that reforms at home, combined with fast-growing trade with the outside world, would give China a big enough economic stake in the region in general and in Taiwan in particular to want to avoid a bust-up. Renegade province though it supposedly is, Taiwan is, after all, one of the biggest investors in the mainland. But money-making has not proved enough of a distraction for the newly assertive China. Meanwhile, other pressures have been at work that now make the China-Taiwan tiff too dangerous to shrug off, as East Asia's governments are still trying to do, as an " internal" Chinese affair (see <a href="as1.html">pages</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As China has grown in weight and confidence, so has Taiwan. Its huge overseas trade (12th in the world) and vast foreign-exchange reserves (second only to Japan's) make it an economic power in its own right. More important, it will soon have a properly elected president with a legitimate claim to speak for Taiwan's 21m people. That government would be foolish to provoke China unnecessarily by declaring independence, but it cannot simply ignore popular will. To judge by opinion polls, there is as yet no majority in Taiwan for declaring independence (if only because that would certainly provoke a direct Chinese military attack), but there is even less support for unification with the mainland. Contrary to China's expectations, and no doubt to its even greater annoyance, this week's gunfire diplomacy will probably diminish one-China enthusiasm still further.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, China's leaders, locked in an unnerving--and seemingly never-ending--struggle to succeed Deng Xiaoping, have only China's visceral nationalism to fall back on as their justification for holding on to power. As China's economy has grown, so its armed forces have added new muscle. Although the end of the cold war brought a hope of greater peace in Asia than most countries, including China, have known for a couple of centuries, China has deliberately taken it as an opportunity to press its territorial claims by force.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The opportunity has no doubt looked all the more promising because America, preoccupied with domestic politics, has begun to scale down its military role in Asia. China's row with the Philippines last year over reefs in the South China Sea produced only a belated and barely audible squeak of protest from Washington. So when Taiwan started to push harder and more successfully for a higher profile around the world, China saw no reason not to shove forcefully back.</p><p><b>Drawing dragon claws</b><br>This time, to its credit, America has responded swiftly and prudently. By moving two aircraft carriers close to Taiwan, it has sent an unmistakable signal that it will not allow Taiwan to be toyed with at China's whim. If China steps up the harassment, America could do a lot more, from patrolling the Taiwan Strait to helping Taiwan get hold of more of the equipment, including missile defences, that it needs to protect itself. And if China is bent on war, America could muster enough firepower to disrupt any attempt either to blockade Taiwan or to invade it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet China may already feel it has achieved a lot. By firing even unarmed missiles close to Taiwan's main ports and forcing ships and aircraft to be rerouted, it has demonstrated the island's vulnerability. Judging by the pusillanimous response from most governments in the region, China may also have concluded that, come the next crisis, America would find even less support for a tough response.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there is plenty, well short of military action, that others could do to avert such a crisis. China's leaders may be in a mood to set territorial claims above economic needs in part because they calculate that using force against Taiwan would do China no lasting damage. The message therefore needs to be conveyed--and not just by America, but by East Asians and Europeans too--that a lunge for Taiwan or an attempt to strangle its economy would make China an economic as well as political outcast: such loutishness should immediately lose China the trading benefits it now enjoys and bar it from the world's economic and financial clubs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;East Asia's governments squirm when faced with such plain speaking. Yet helping America to hold China to the rules of peaceable behaviour is the only way to preserve the stability on which the region's continued prosperity depends. In the end, the best solution to the Taiwan problem for all concerned would be a political deal, negotiated between the two governments. But Taiwan points out, reasonably, that it will not negotiate under duress. And China will see the point of talking only if it is convinced that it stands to lose less by talking than by gunfire. By contrast, appeasing China over Taiwan will only feed China's appetite for trouble.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?826927200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="as1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>Chinese war games<p></h2>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>In a new threat to <b>Taiwan</b>,China conducted military exercises close to the island using live ammunition. But, as the United States moved two aircraft carriers close to Taiwan, the Chinese were reported to have assured the Americans that they did not plan to invade the island. The Chinese actions have been prompted by fears that Taiwan, regarded by them as a rebel province, may declare independence. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled.
<p>Popular support for <b>Ryutaro Hashimoto</b>,Japan's new prime minister, has fallen sharply in the two months since he took office as his government remains paralysed. A proposal to use government money to bail out a group of failed mortgage companies has proved deeply unpopular not only with the public but with opposition politicians, some of whom have staged a sit-in at the Diet blocking all progress on the budget, which includes the proposal to rescue the mortgage companies.
<p><b>King Norodom Sihanouk </b>said he was suffering from a brain tumour and might have to resign as Cambodia's head of state.</p>
<p>Tribesmen in the Indonesian province of <b>Irian Jaya </b>attacked an American-owned copper mine in Timika.
<h2>Europe's future</h2>
The European Union's 15 member countries made <b>opening bids</b> before the inter-governmental conference on Europe's future, due to start in Turin on March 29th. Britain said it wanted no extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers. Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg want a more federal Union. France called for greater powers for national parliaments to decide European issues. The European Parliament protested at its exclusion from the conference--and demanded more powers.</p>
<p>The British government suffered an embarrassing defeat in the European Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of a plan by the European Union to introduce a maximum <b>48-hour working week</b>. Britain had claimed exemption under the social clause; the court ruled that it came under health and safety.</p>
<p>Carl Bildt, the European Union's representative in <b>Bosnia</b>,said the Dayton peace plan is in danger of unravelling. He suggested that <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s implementation force should stay beyond 1996.</p>
<p>In Britain's worst lone massacre, a gunman in Scotland shot dead <b>16 children </b>aged five and six and their teacher in a primary school, and then shot himself. Another 12 children and two teachers were wounded.</p>
<p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>The winner of this month's Spanish general election, <b>Jose Maria Aznar</b>, leader of the conservative People's Party, continues to search for a working majority in parliament. After a meeting with Mr Aznar, the defeated Socialist leader, Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister for more than 13 years, said that he would not seek to keep his opponent from office.</p>

<p>With an eye on monetary union in 1999, the finance ministers of both Germany and France announced further limits on <b>public spending</b>. Sluggish economies have kept tax revenues low and unemployment handouts high.</p>
<p>Felix Habsburg-Lothringen, a son of the last emperor of Austria, provoked a row by secretly visiting the country, from which he is banned because he has not renounced his claim to the throne. "<b>Herr Habsburg</b> is provoking the republic," said a senior member of Austria's ruling Social Democrats.
<h2>Dole steams on</h2>
Senator Bob Dole triumphed in the <b>Super Tuesday </b>primaries, bringing his total of delegates to more than 700. Steve Forbes, the flat-tax candidate, decided to quit the race, but Pat Buchanan, the populists' friend, vowed to keep on fighting. Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House, urged all Republicans to unite. Mr Dole began to muse aloud about persuading Colin Powell, a retired general, to change his mind and be his running-mate.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill tightening <b>trade sanctions on Cuba</b>, and on others investing there. The European Union said it would complain to the World Trade Organisation. Canada and Mexico said they would lodge complaints through <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>. Most of Latin America reacted angrily. Cuba jeered.</p>
<p>Jack Kevorkian, the champion of <b>assisted suicide</b> and inventor of a suicide machine, was acquitted at his second trial of illegally helping patients to kill themselves. A few days earlier, a federal appeals court in San Francisco (whose decisions are binding on nine western states) ruled that there was a constitutional right to die.
<h2>Support for peace</h2>
In a bid to keep the Middle East peace process alive, Bill Clinton and Hosni Mubarak jointly chaired a<b> four-hour summit</b> on peace and terrorism at a Red Sea resort. Nearly 30 countries turned up, including European heads of government and representatives from the Arab Gulf states. Syria and Lebanon were notable absentees. In Israel after the summit, Mr Clinton committed $100m to an American-Israeli fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>Israel continued its tight blockade of the<b> West Bank and Gaza</b>, and said it would deport men directly connected to suicide-bombers.</p>
<p>Kuwait held a conference in London to remind people of the 600 <b>Kuwaiti prisoners </b>taken to Iraq after the 1990 invasion and still unaccounted for. Iraq fuelled new suspicions by temporarily barring <font size=-1>UN</font> inspectors from a building they wanted to see.</p>

<h2>Shares shake</h2>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Good news on American jobs confirmed <b>Wall Street's worst nightmare</b>--that the American economy was making a comeback. The biggest jump in 13 years in employment in February caused the Dow Jones to plunge by 3%, dragged down by the sharpest drop in Treasury-bond prices since the Gulf war as investors realised that interest rates, far from being cut, could now rise. A 2% jump in the Dow in the next session was the biggest one-day rise in five years, but shares remained jittery, and bond prices proved even more nervous. Asian shares, clipped by Wall Street, continued to react to Chinese war games off the coast of Taiwan.</p>
<p><b>Japan's current account </b>ran into deficit in January, the first in five years and not affected much by a change in the method of calculation. The &#165;1.9 billion ($18m) gap compares with a surplus of &#165;328.2 billion a year earlier. February is expected to be back in the black but the trend now is towards a more modest surplus.</p>
<p><b>Russia's Central Bank </b>said several of the country's big banks were in trouble. They include Natsionalny Kredit, which claimed last year to rank as Russia's 17th-biggest bank by assets; and Avtovazbank, where the central bank has taken temporary control. Sergei Dubinin, the central bank's chairman, said the banking system was caught up in a " long-lasting structural crisis".
<h2>Smoking gun</h2>
Brooke Group's Liggett broke ranks with the rest of America's dismayed <b>tobacco industry </b>and settled its part of a smoking-related lawsuit brought by five states, without either admitting or denying liability. The share prices of other tobacco firms fell.</p>
<p>The day after <b>Netscape </b>struck a deal with <b>America Online </b>to license Netscape Internet software, allowing <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s subscribers to surf the World Wide Web, <font size=-1>AOL</font> also agreed to distribute <b>Microsoft</b>'s Internet browser to 5m subscribers.</p>
<p>Shares in <b>Cable &amp; Wireless</b> rose nearly 7% after it confirmed that it had held merger talks with <b>British Telecom</b>. The talks are thought to have foundered on <font size=-1>BT</font>'s failure to agree a price for the rival telephone company which, before the news, had a stockmarket capitalisation of &#163;10 billion ($15.3 billion).</p>
<p>America's <b>Williamette</b> agreed to pay $1.6 billion for the remaining timber interests of <b>Hanson</b>, a British industrial conglomerate in the process of demerging. The deal includes 440,000 hectares (1.1m acres), mainly in the Pacific north-west region.</p>
<p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>South Africa's biggest firm, <b>Anglo American</b>, bought 5.9% of <b>Lonrho</b>, a British conglomerate.</p>

<p><b>Germany's chemicals giants</b> reported record profits in 1995 and big boosts in their dividends. The biggest, Hoechst, produced a net profit up 65% to DM2.25 billion ($1.57 billion)</p>
<p>Bahrain-based Investcorp is poised to sell its 51.8% stake in <b>Gucci</b>, whose latest net profits, for the year to end-January ($81.4m compared with $17.3m a year earlier), suggest that the Italian maker of swanky clothes has returned to form. Since last October's public offering by Investcorp of 48.2% of its stake, the price of Gucci shares has nearly doubled.
<h2>All change</h2>
In a big shake-up at America's largest mutual-funds company, <b>Fidelity Investments</b> shuffled 26 equity-portfolio managers--nearly a third of them--to boost poorly performing portfolios.</p>
<p><b>Unilever</b> announced a far-reaching change in its management structure, designed, it said, to separate strategic leadership from routine business operations. But the Anglo-Dutch consumer group said it had decided against a break-up.</p>
<p>Soci&eacutet&eacute G&eacuten&eacuterale, a French bank, asked the European Court of Justice to block the FFr45 billion ($8.9 billion) <font size=-1>EU</font>-approved rescue plan for <b>Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais</b>, a state-owned rival that landed in trouble after reckless expansion at the end of the 1980s. Soci&eacutet&eacute G&eacuten&eacuterale said that it is willing to drop its case if the aid is limited.</p>
<p>One Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais property is <b>MGM</b>. The reinvigorated Hollywod studio was officially put up for auction with the hope of fetching $1.5 billion-2.5 billion.
<h2>Going nowhere</h2>
<b>Alitalia</b>'s chairman, Renato Riverso, gave up his attempt to restructure the crippled state-owned airline, with a warning that there should be no sell-out to the unions. But his replacement, Fausto Cereti, and the new chief executive, Domenico Cempella, immediately resumed talks with unions as Alitalia confirmed its 1995 losses could come to 250 billion lire ($154m).</p>
<p>General Motors filed an <b>industrial-espionage lawsuit </b>in Detroit against Volkswagen alleging that a former purchasing executive at <font size=-1>GM</font>, Jose Ignacio Lopez, took quantities of secret documents with him when he defected to <font size=-1>VW</font>.</p>
<p>After flagging <b>car sales </b>in the latter half of 1995, new registrations in Western Europe rose nearly 9% in January and February over the same two months last year. Fresh incentives in France brought an 18% increase in car sales in France. Germany also saw a near 11% gain. Britain, with 2%, registered one of the lowest rises.</p>

<h1>Taiwan votes, China thunders</h1>

<p><font size=1>TAIPEI
</font></p><p>THE bomb shelters in Taipei are being cleared of rubbish, and yellow stickers have appeared with directions towards improvised sanctuaries. There is no panic yet in Taiwan, but many Taiwanese are taking the precaution of converting their money into dollars and most flights out of the country are fully booked. The government is propping up the local stockmarket to the tune of $200m a day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The source of the scare lies offshore in the Taiwan Strait, where China's military exercises reflect the rage of the Communist leadership in Beijing. China regards Taiwan as a rebellious province and fears it is moving towards a declaration of independence. Yet for all the alarm in Taiwan, the island is determinedly pressing ahead with its presidential election on March 23rd and seems likely to elect Lee Teng-hui, the main object of China's fury.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not only Taiwan that is on edge. Just two months ago America's navy called in to Shanghai, for its first visit to China in seven years. Now it is deploying the largest naval task-force it has assembled in the Pacific since the Vietnam war, including two aircraft carriers, in an effort to deter Chinese threats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The outside world, and indeed the Taiwanese, have consistently underestimated the lengths to which China is prepared to go in "striving for an early reunification of the motherland". Few thought that China's military exercises would extend to a partial blockade of Taiwan. When they did, calming voices murmured that the fuss would all die down after the Taiwanese election. Now, however, China is promising yet more, unspecified, war games after the election. After all, Mr Lee is odds-on to win.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nobody in authority, on either side of the strait, is willing to suggest that China is close to war with Taiwan, let alone with America. Even China's generals have admitted that their army lacks the means to wage a modern war against Taiwan. China has six times as many men under arms as Taiwan's 400,000, and ten times as many fighter aircraft and submarines. Yet Taiwan has a technological edge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A quarter of Taiwan's government budget is spent on its armed forces, with their electronic-surveillance devices, anti-aircraft and anti-ship defences, and modern (compared with China's Vietnam-era air force) fighters. It is reckoned that, were it to launch an invasion, China could land only 30,000 troops at a time, and without the benefit of air superiority. An attempted invasion would be horribly bloody.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Taiwan could probably stave off all but the most determined attack, the costs to the island would be severe. That is why Taiwan has long accompanied its high-tech deterrence with repeated assurances to the mainland that it is not set on a course of independence. Yet no one can be sure that China's actions will not get out of hand. China might choose, not an invasion, but a symbolic land-grab of one of Taiwan's many outlying islands. It might choose to turn a partial blockade into a full one: Taiwan, which relies upon open sea-lanes for its imports of oil, coal and steel, and for its exports of finished goods, would be hobbled overnight. Even a misguided missile, if it fell on Taiwan, could be expected to provoke a military response, with dangerous consequences for the region's peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China insists it has no ulterior motive other than to "struggle against the plot of splittism by some leaders" of Taiwan. Yet China's rhetoric risks boxing in its own leaders as much as it is meant to box in Taiwan's. President Jiang Zemin and his colleagues in Beijing used to assure Taiwan that only if certain unwelcome conditions were met would force be used against it. The two conditions most often cited were foreign intervention in Taiwan, and a declaration of Taiwanese independence. But China has recently begun to emphasise other much more subjective criteria, such as "civil chaos" in Taiwan. Chi Haotian, China's defence minister, even spoke recently of the need for the "liberation" of Taiwan--language not heard from a Chinese official for over a decade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China wants to secure its political goals by military threats. But such tactics may backfire. They have already provoked the foreign intervention that China is always warning against. And Chinese efforts to ward off Taiwanese independence may prove even more counter-productive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China has branded President Lee the "harlot of history" for his supposedly splittist tendencies. Its leaders appear intent on isolating Mr Lee--much as they earlier isolated Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten--with the pretence that only he thinks treacherous thoughts. Mr Lee may indeed meet China's splittist criteria, in that he wants more international recognition of Taiwan, including a seat at the <font size=-1>UN</font>. But he does so in response to the desires of the broad mass of Taiwan's electorate. And the more that China bullies Mr Lee, the more the voters are heading for the Lee camp. The greatest risk to regional peace is an Olympian clash between the 500-odd Communist diehards who run China and 21m turbulent free-thinkers in Taiwan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it is, the Chinese threat has displaced all other issues in Taiwan's presidential race. Indeed, of the three presidential candidates, only Mr Lee of the ruling Kuomintang speaks of anything other than relations with China and how to extricate Taiwan from the current crisis.
</p><p><b>No rush to go it alone</b></b>
<br>On the China issue, there are three attitudes. Mr Lee argues against making concessions to the mainland, just for the sake of rapprochement. His long-standing foreign minister, Fredrick Chien, put it most forcefully this week. China, he said,<ul><font size=-1>could not care less about world public opinion; that is a sign of a hegemonical power. It tries to dictate foreign policy to us; that's another sign of hegemonical power... The world today must not accommodate such a creature. No government can afford to conduct negotiations under duress.
</font></ul>Even so, Mr Chien argues for Taiwanese self-restraint.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peng Ming-min, the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, the biggest opposition group, is more inclined to give the finger to China and damn the torpedoes, which the party does not believe would be fired even if the island did declare independence. On March 12th Mr Peng's party boss, Shih Ming-teh, led two boatloads out to the rough waters on the edge of China's north-eastern target zone. Two acts of defiance followed. Mr Shih burnt Communist China's flag. And the stomach contents of the assembled members of the world's press rebuked gravity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lin Yang-kang, a former Kuomintang official, is the most pro-China of the three presidential candidates. Mr Lin and his running-mate, Hau Pei-tsun, once a military man, were booted out of the party last year. They now enjoy the support of the New Party, a splinter-group dedicated to reunification. But not even the New Party expects this to happen soon; its deadline is 50 years. Two parliamentary candidates who campaigned for election last December promoting the only formula that China will consider for reunification--" one country, two systems"--fared poorly, each winning barely 1,000 votes. So Mr Lin is careful to talk of a Chinese commonwealth in which neither side has the upper hand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those espousing wholesale independence are also finding it hard to gather votes. The Democratic Progressive Party's leaders have toned down their pro-independence line in recent months. They point out that Taiwan is already <i>de facto</i> independent, if only the rest of the world would recognise it as such. That is, in effect, what Mr Lee's Kuomintang also believes. The only real difference is whether the country should be called the Republic of Taiwan (the opposition party's wish) or the Republic of China.
</p><p><b>Any way out?</b>
<br>Joseph Wu, of the Institute of International Relations in Taipei, reckons that no more than a quarter of Taiwan's electorate is ardently for independence, and at most a quarter is for reunification. The great mass prefer the status quo: <i>de facto</i> independence coupled with a push for greater international recognition. That mass will vote for Mr Lee on March 23rd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Lee is indeed victorious, he will face a heavy responsibility. And quite how this private and stubborn man will behave, even his closest supporters dare not guess. Some believe that he will press ahead with his campaign to raise Taiwan's profile, regardless of the reaction on the mainland. But most people think he will have to try to reduce tensions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How might he achieve that? China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen, says that relations cannot improve unless Taiwan drops its bid for a <font size=-1>UN</font> seat and, by extension, its multi-billion-dollar policy of "pragmatic diplomacy". But it might well be political suicide for Mr Lee to bow to Mr Qian's will. Taiwanese know that China has, in the recent past, given the nod to formulas designed to give Taiwan the space it craves, for example, through its presence at meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Taiwan simply wants more of the same.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the Taiwanese have some cards to play. China, even as it waves its fist, still has its other hand out for Taiwanese investment. This strikes many Taiwanese as the height of cheek. Policymakers point out that there are plenty of other places in South-East Asia, and even in Eastern Europe, where Taiwanese could invest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The growing gap between the two societies, and between governments on either side of the Strait, will make it extremely difficult to restore calm. But it is clear that if the crisis is to be defused the two sides will have to start talking again. Cross-strait talks were rudely broken off by China last year, after Mr Lee made a "private visit" to America, to visit his old university.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there is a belief, even in Taiwan, that the talks, which had begun a few years earlier, were not being taken seriously enough by the Taiwanese side. They were meant to get down to details on such matters as fishing rights. China hoped they would then encompass bigger issues like sovereignty, but they got nowhere close. Even China's long-demanded "three links"--by air, by sea and by post--were not broached. It is possible that, if Taiwan were to make concessions on the "three links", tensions might ease.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Taiwanese may suspect that nothing short of reunification on China's terms will ever satisfy Beijing. But talking is probably still Taiwan's best option.

<h1>Is Taiwan really part of China?</h1>

<p>ONE sure way to baffle and shock any Chinese citizen is to quote what Mao Zedong had to say about Taiwan in 1936. "The immediate task of China", he said, was "to regain all its lost territories." But he added that that did not include Japanese-occupied Korea, which instead was promised "enthusiastic help in its struggle for independence." He went on: "the same thing applies to Taiwan."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many Chinese today, it is unbelievable that such an arch-nationalist should have spoken so cavalierly of independence for what is now an "inalienable part of China's sovereign territory". They have been brought up to regard the "division" of China as an historical accident: the arbitrary ceasefire line in an unfinished civil war, like the demilitarised zone across the Korean peninsula. This illusion is fostered by Taiwan's anomalous control of small islands just off the mainland coast, which prompted two crises in the 1950s, and may yet spark another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But when Mao spoke, his attitude was consistent with the way China had always dealt with Taiwan: as an afterthought. When, in 1623, China faced a Dutch demand for a trading post to match Portugal's at Macau, the Chinese official who ceded one by pointing at Taiwan thought he had pulled off a crafty ruse. He was fobbing the barbarians off with a disease-ridden haunt of pirates, home to some Chinese settlers, but outside any formal Chinese jurisdiction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dutch lost control of Taiwan in 1662, when Koxinga, a half-Japanese general, fled there from China with the military remnants of the Ming dynasty, as it crumbled in the face of the Manchu armies. The government of mainland China gained control of the island only in 1683, when it defeated Koxinga's son.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even after this victory, Taiwan was run more like a colony than a fully integrated part of China. The imperial powers had two main interests on the island: keeping down insurrection and importing its rice and sugar. For military and economic reasons, the authorities in Beijing began paying more attention to Taiwan in the second half of the 19th century, but it was only in 1887 that its status was upgraded to that of a full province. Eight years later, however, it became Japan's first colony. By the time Mao was speaking, Taiwan had been a Japanese colony longer than Korea had.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan dates from the 1943 Cairo Declaration, in which the allies decided what to do with Japan's empire after the war. Many Taiwanese, wistful for independence, regarded the nationalists as another occupying army, which was largely consistent with the army's behaviour after the Japanese surrender in 1945. To this day, one of the most significant divisons in Taiwan is between mainlanders who arrived with Chiang and "Taiwanese", most of whose forebears arrived centuries before.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At Cairo, the Americans had assumed that post-war China would be under Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists. When Chiang lost the civil war and was driven into Taiwan in 1949, he, like the Communists, was committed to the ideal of "Chinese reunification". As a result, the nationalists engaged in a war of diplomatic attrition with the Communists for recognition as the government of "China". They gradually lost the support of all their important allies and, in 1971, their seat at the United Nations. As countries switched diplomatic recognition to the mainland, the protocols they signed recognised Taiwan as "part of China".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese conviction that "Taiwan is part of China" may be relatively recent, but is nonetheless visceral. It seems to be based on geographic proximity, which is hardly an argument, ethnic kinship, which is not much stronger (is New Zealand, for example, an "inalienable" part of Britain?), and "international law", which seems to mean other countries' acquiescence in the formulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout Taiwan's history, its fate has been decided elsewhere. It was handed to the Dutch in talks in Fujian, to Japan after a war in Manchuria, and to China in Cairo. The effrontery of Taiwan's people in recent years has been to suggest they might have a say themselves.

<h1>Knocking knees</h1>

<p><font size=1>BANGKOK</font></p>
<p>IF AMERICA was hoping that its firmness over Taiwan would embolden China's Asian neighbours, it will have been disappointed. The response of most of South-East Asia would make an ostrich seem bold. Only Singapore's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, has discussed the crisis with any frankness, acknowledging its seriousness and suggesting that it might be defused if the Taiwanese drop their bid to join the <font size=-1>UN</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No country has criticised China and most of South-East Asia has striven to sound neutral. Thailand's foreign minister, Kasem Kasemsri, went further. "When a country conducts military exercises on its own territory to deter its province from breaking away," he asked, "would you oppose it?" Since its prime minister is making a visit to China later this month, Thailand is particularly keen to preserve good relations. It even took the unusual step on March 13th of trying to block a press conference in Bangkok to launch a report by Amnesty International on human-rights abuses in China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Indonesia, which like China may fear for its territorial integrity, there has even been some criticism of American actions<i>. Kompas</i>, one of Indonesia's largest newspapers, speculated that the United States might be more inclined to confront China because of disputes over human rights and intellectual property. If so, the paper concluded, "then the <font size=-1>US</font> action is deplorable." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, which have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea and have attracted pots of investment from Taiwan, refrained from outright condemnation of the exercises. They must hope that, if China ever rounds on them, the rest of Asia will react a little more boldly.

<p><b>Building societies</b></p>
<h1>Dial M for mortgage</h1>

<p>THE effects of the price war between the building societies, the banks and a new breed of telephone mortgage-sellers are beginning to be felt. Banks' share prices fell sharply on March 12th after the telephone-sales offshoot of Bradford &amp; Bingley cut its mortgage rate to just 5.99%, compared with most lenders' standard rate of 7.25%. But this is only the beginning. Among building societies in particular, costs will have to be reduced, branches closed and jobs cut before the war is over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Earlier this month, the Bank of England said it was worried that this competition was driving banks to accept dangerously thin profits. And a report last month by Bob Pannell, an economist at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, shows that home owners are increasingly fickle. In the two years to September 1995, remortgages (loans that are changed without the borrower moving home) rose from 11% to 28% of all mortgage lending. According to Mr Pannell, home owners increasingly think of mortgages as consumer goods bought on price, not brand loyalty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With several of the largest building societies about to be floated on the stockmarket or taken over, resulting in handouts worth hundreds of pounds for their customers, many home owners may be staying " loyal" to their present lender only until they collect this bounty. After that, they will transfer to a cheaper lender.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is likely to become harder still for the high-street branches of banks and building societies to fend off the new telephone-based mortgage sellers, such as Direct Line, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. Direct Line has already cut a swathe through the insurance industry with its cut-price policies. Selling mortgages over the telephone is cheap. An analysis last year by Merrill Lynch, an investment bank, found that Direct Line's staff could each sell 30-40 times as many mortgages as their equivalents in building-society branches.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, the telephone-based sellers have a tiny share of the market: Direct Line has lent only about &#163;350m, or less than 0.1% of Britain's total household mortgages. But this share will grow quickly: some building societies, including Bradford &amp; Bingley and Nationwide, have now decided to fight fire with fire and set up their own telephone-sales operations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the foreign banks which entered the British mortgage market in the 1980s only to get their fingers burnt as bad debts mounted, the new telephone-based sellers are concentrating on poaching the most creditworthy customers. They are also offering savings accounts. That will lessen their dependence on financial markets for funding, and in the process take a slice of the building societies' other main market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most building societies are highly profitable and have plenty of spare capital. This reduces the pressure on them to close branches in order to remain competitive. But their hands may be forced by the threat of takeover. Management at National &amp; Provincial agreed to takeover talks with Abbey National after realising that, whether they approved of the bid or not, their customers would probably accept the Abbey's terms, worth up to &#163;4,250 each. A new building-societies bill, to be published on March 18th, will not contain the further protection against hostile bidders that societies had campaigned for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The banks cut around 70,000 jobs between 1989 and 1994, and closed 18% of their branches. Though the building societies closed around 12% of their branches in the same period, their staff numbers continued to rise until 1993 as they entered new areas of business such as estate agency and life assurance. Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, admits that branches and jobs will continue to be cut, though he is unsure by how much. A glance at any of Britain's town centres shows the answer only too clearly: high streets containing a dozen or more branches of banks and building societies are not uncommon. That will change.

<p><b>Small businesses</b></p>
<h1>Don't help us</h1>

<p>IT WAS a bit of an anticlimax. A leaked letter between ministers had suggested that the government was about to abolish the employment rights of the millions of people who work for small firms. When John Major spoke to a gathering of business leaders on March 11th, he announced only a timid set of measures to aid small firms, including a promise that the government will pay its bills more promptly. The prime minister is still said to be wondering whether curbing workers' rights would result in more jobs in small firms (and more votes for the Tory party). If he decides to do more, he faces some difficulties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The European Court reminded him of one of these on March 12th: the government's power to liberalise Britain's labour laws is checked by its treaty obligations in the European Union. The court overruled Britain's attempt to avoid an <font size=-1>EU</font>-wide rule setting a maximum working week of 48 hours. A more surprising problem is that, whatever the economic merits of labour-law reform, many of its intended beneficiaries seem far from excited at the prospect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At his meeting with business leaders, Mr Major was given a report on what 800 small firms wanted from the government. They did grumble about employment rights, industrial tribunals and so on. But they did not call for them to be abolished. The government may be mistaking the weight that small firms attach to the issue. Of the 100 or so recommendations in the report, only 16 were calls for deregulation--and there were nine calls for more regulation, such as stricter laws on the disqualification of company directors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, Labour's proposed minimum wage is not as unpopular among employers as ministers hoped. Their attempts to stir a fuss over the issue at the Confederation of British Industry's conference last November fell flat. Some security and cleaning firms, for example, want a minimum wage, to stop them being undercut by rivals who pay their workers less. In a study of 174 small firms, carried out last year by Kingston University, 56% said a minimum wage of &#163;4 an hour (probably more than Labour would impose) would not harm them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Storey of Warwick University questions claims that cutting workers' rights and other "red tape" would create many new jobs. Mr Storey divides small firms into three categories. First are the "short life" firms--weak businesses, virtually doomed to fail whatever happens. Second are the "trundlers", firms whose owners are happy as things are and have no desire to expand. Finally, there are the "flyers" , the 4% or so of small firms that are both able and willing to grow quickly. This small proportion, says Mr Storey, creates about half of all new jobs. His research finds that these firms rarely complain that labour laws are holding them back.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for getting the owners of small firms to vote Conservative, the Kingston study brings more gloomy news for Mr Major. Only 14% of owners of small firms thought a Labour government would be bad for their business; 29% said it would help.

<h1>A mess on the Mersey</h1>

<p><font size=1>LIVERPOOL</font></p>
<p>IN THE old days of the hard left, Liverpool appeared to suffer from too many Labour councillors. Now its problem seems to be too few. Labour's slim grip on power in the city is one of the reasons why, on March 10th, the council voted to increase its council-tax bills by 4.5%, making the &#163;1,006 bill for properties worth &#163;68,000-88,000 the highest in the country for the third year running.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liverpool's councillors say that their tax rate for this property price-range is bound to be higher than other cities because they have fewer high-value, higher tax-paying properties. Some 68% of the city's houses are valued at less than &#163;40,000. But that cannot be the whole story: 64% of neighbouring Knowsley's properties are valued at under &#163;40,000, and although its economy is in as bad a shape as Liverpool's, and its council was in as much of a mess until recently, it set a proud &#163;774 tax rate for the band that gets hit for a grand in Liverpool.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main difference between Knowsley and Liverpool is that in 1988, Knowsley council's ruling Labour group, after purging the hard left from its ranks, decided that the council needed a new broom. The council appointed a chief executive, David Henshaw, who not only improved services but also persuaded councillors to cut the workforce by a third even though Knowsley's 15% unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ruling Labour group in Liverpool has cut around 20% of the council's workers since 1988, but, because of its own weakness, has found it hard to push the efficiency drive as far as Knowsley's. Whereas Labour holds 63 out of 66 seats in Knowsley, in Liverpool it has only 50 out of 99 seats, to the Lib Dems' 42. With Liverpool's jobless rate at 17%, councillors are understandably reluctant to increase it in case their own jobs are axed by vengeful voters. Even after the high tax rate was announced, crowds were outside city hall protesting at service cuts threatened in some areas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divisions in the Labour group make it even harder for the council to take tough decisions. Its leader, Harry Rimmer, survived a recent deselection attempt only after regional party officials intervened.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Councillors would find it easier to streamline local government if the private sector were to create lots of jobs. But the problem is circular. At Knowsley, where Mr Henshaw has reformed the planning department, the council took just three weeks in December last year to give a television-shopping company, <font size=-1>QVC</font>, permission to build a warehouse and telephone-service centre expected to employ 1,100 people. Liverpool's failure to pull in such prizes perpetuates its problems.

<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></p>
<h1><center>Israel's abyss</center></h1>

IS THE Middle East peace process slipping into history? It could be. The bomb that tore bodies apart in the heart of Tel Aviv on March 4th, after similar atrocities in Jerusalem, may have tipped the balance. Any scramble back to sanity will be extraordinarily difficult, even if the outrages stop. Israelis, traumatised by the slaughter of some 60 people, believe they have been cheated in their land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians. But the alternative is bleak: three years of courageous risk-taking undone, a cruel war of attrition, an end to Israel's hopes of normal relations with the Muslim world. The evil men behind the suicide-bombers can congratulate themselves. Seldom, it seems, has terrorism been more effective at achieving its ends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Palestinian-Israeli negotiation had reached a turning-point, the first interim stage all but completed, the search for a permanent solution about to begin. Most Israelis and most West Bankers and Gazans liked what was happening. Despite the acknowledged obstacles ahead--the status of Jerusalem, for instance--both sides believed that they would probably get there in the end. But now the process, always fragile, is cracking as Israeli public opinion, always volatile, starts to swing vehemently against it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first bus-bombing in Jerusalem on February 25th eliminated Shimon Peres's comfortable lead in the approach to Israel's election on May 29th. The Tel Aviv bomb cast doubt on his ability even to remain prime minister for the next three months (see <a href="ir1.html">page</a>). Another bomb would almost certainly do for him. And Labour's loss of power, whether it comes now or after the election, could spell the end of a peace process that has been identified with Mr Peres and his men since secret talks began in Oslo three years ago. Though Binyamin Netanyahu, the leader of the Likud opposition, now says that he would not reverse what has so far happened, his intention to leave things stuck as they are, allowing Palestinians municipal autonomy within self-contained cantons, makes barely better, or safer, sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Striving to protect his people and to save himself politically, Mr Peres is faced with the problem of not knowing where to strike or at whom--an impotence that adds to the national anger. Emergency measures to make Israel's cities more secure are the first, obvious necessity. This means not only more soldiers in the streets but the end, at least for the time being, of Mr Peres's hopes of Israelis and Palestinians living peaceably together: separation is now the ugly rule. Beyond this, Israeli soldiers are swarming into West Bank villages, punishing the families and neighbours of suicide-bombers and suspected terrorists. This has the vengeful smell of collective punishment, but its main purpose is to deter other would-be " martyrs" by showing that while they skip off to paradise their mothers will be homeless.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though Mr Peres, in a vote-tugging flourish, has given the army freedom to go where it will, it has so far restrained itself from plunging back into the Palestinian cities it withdrew from so recently. It should stick to this self-restraint if it can. Even if the soldiers were to track down their quarry, which they admit is difficult, their return would dilute Palestinian opposition to terrorism--and signal that the clock had been truly turned back from peace to no-peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if Israeli troops hold back, Yasser Arafat's men must do the job for them. Mr Arafat, who no less than Mr Peres stands or falls by the peace process, has outlawed all militia groups, made wide arrests and promised to co-operate fully with Israel "to wipe out terrorism". Yet he is not doing enough to satisfy the Israelis. Is this because he will not, or because he cannot? The statements made in the name of Hamas's military arm, Izzadin al-Qassam, offering conditional ceasefires just before a new bombing, were despicable, not worth a straw. But they do suggest that the movement is split, making its more lethal branches, perhaps protected by outsiders, even harder to get at.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where Mr Arafat does break ranks with the Israelis is in hesitating to take on Hamas's religious and political structure--though, in answer to Israeli pressure, his police have begun raiding schools and mosques. He would be wise to be careful, even though money for Hamas charities does indeed make its way to the militia, and to the sheikhs who preach martyrdom. It remains vital, in the interests of peace, for Mr Arafat to keep his lines open to Hamas's political leaders.
</p><p><b>No prospect pleases</b>
<br>The Arab-Israeli prospect, which had been smiling, is suddenly grim. But more and more Israelis, earlier opinions turned on their head by the terrorist mayhem, are arguing that "peace" with the Palestinians is the grimmest prospect of all, costing them more lives than the Palestinian uprising ever did. Israelis are giving up land but are not being allowed to live in peace. Moreover, whatever land-for-peace deal is finally struck, most of the world's Palestinians will remain dissatisfied, their eyes fixed on the bits of Israel-proper where their families once lived.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is true. Yet the alternative is worse. A frozen peace process will not freeze violence: on the contrary, the collapse of Palestinian hope would cut such restraints as there are. Nor would Israel be able to isolate itself from an area that it would, in effect, be reoccupying: the suicide-bombers who this week crossed into Israel and found their way into the centre of its cities showed the permeability of even sealed frontiers. And though the <i>intifada</i>, the three-year mass uprising in which youngsters armed with stones challenged the military occupiers, will not resume, a new version of Palestinian revolt, and Israeli reprisal, could be much nastier: grown-up men with grown-up arms, killing indiscriminately.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After a horrible two weeks, such a scene is no longer wholly remote. It can be avoided, but only if Israelis and Palestinians reflect clear-eyed on the choices before them. For this they need a period of calm. Let us hope they get one.

<h2>Peace on the rack</h2><p>Islamist suicide-bombers struck again, killing 19 people in Jerusalem and 13 in Tel Aviv, and imperilling the entire <b>Middle East peace process</b>. Fighting for political survival, Shimon Peres responded to widespread anger by sending Israel's army into the West Bank to punish the bombers' relatives, close Islamic institutions and catch as many militants as it could. Yasser Arafat's security forces made widespread arrests in the areas they control.
<p><b>Iranians </b>were due to go to the polls on March 8th to elect a new Majlis (parliament). No genuine challenge to the Islamic republic was allowed but reformists and conservatives, operating within the system, fought each other in an intense week-long campaign.</p>
<p>Muhammad Massari, a leading <b>Saudi dissident </b>living in London, half-won his appeal against the British government's trade-related attempt to deport him to Dominica. The government was ordered to think again.</p>
<p><b>Nelson Mandela</b> was pronounced "in excellent health" by doctors after undergoing medical tests at a clinic. Rumours about the health of the 77-year-old South African president had caused the currency to fall sharply.</p>
<p><b>Benin's</b> election went to a second round after President Nic&eacutephore Soglo almost tied with the former Marxist dictator, Mathieu K&eacuter&eacutekou.</p>
<h2>Spain's right wins</h2>
<p>Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the conservative People's Party, won <b>Spain's</b> <b>general election</b> on March 3rd, ending 13 years of Socialist rule under Felipe Gonzalez. The margin was narrower than expected and 20 seats short of a majority. Mr Aznar is trying to strike a deal with moderate Catalan nationalists to form a government.</p>
<p>Turkey's two main centre-right parties, Mesut Yilmaz's Motherland and Tansu Ciller's True Path, at last agreed to form a <b>coalition government</b>, excluding the Islamic-minded Welfare party, which won the most seats in December's general election. Under the agreement Mr Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller take it in turns to be prime minister.</p>
<p>Heavy fighting was reported around <b>Grozny, </b>the Chechen capital, after rebels launched a new offensive and retook parts of the city.</p>
<p>(<a href="wtw1.gif">See chart</a>)<br>The size of <b>Europe's population </b>is likely to stay the same over the next three decades, but the proportion of people over 60 will go up by a half, according to a study by the European Commission. Europe's median age, 36 today, is likely to hit 45 in 2025.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>Austria's</b> two main parties, to the left and right of centre, agreed to renew a coalition government under the present chancellor, Franz Vranitzky.</p>
<p>An opinion poll suggested that the French remain <b>split down the middle</b> over the future of Europe. A single European currency by 2000 is favoured by 49%, with 42% against. Asked if the date set for <font size=-1>EMU</font>--1999--should be postponed, 42% said yes, whereas 43% said "everything should be done" for the single currency to be brought in on time.
<h2>Here comes Bob</h2>
</p>
<p>Senator Bob Dole swept the board in the Republican <b>presidential primaries</b> in South Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, Colorado and several smaller states. His total of delegates looked unbeatable, and he was endorsed by the speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. Lamar Alexander abandoned the race and endorsed Mr Dole but Steve Forbes battled on. So too did Pat Buchanan, determined to keep his populist voice in the campaign, although he called Mr Dole's nomination "inevitable" .</p>
<p>Colombia was listed by the American government as a country not co-operating enough in the fight against <b>drugs</b>. It will forfeit American aid, as will Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran, Nigeria and Syria. Peru and Bolivia, named last year, were removed from the list.</p>
<p>The American Congress approved a bill tightening sanctions against <b>Cuba</b> by hitting foreign companies doing business there. Canada, the EU and Caribbean countries have protested against the measure.</p>
<h2>Oz turns right</h2>
<p>Australia's Labor Party was crushingly beaten by John Howard's Liberal-National coalition, giving the country its first <b>conservative government </b>for 13 years.</p>
<p>Holders of <b>Hong Kong passports </b>will be able to visit Britain without visas after the British colony is taken over by China next year, said Britain's prime minister, John Major, during a visit to Hong Kong this week.</p>
<p>Singapore has ordered organisations which provide links to the <b>internet</b> to block access to sexually orientated and politically sensitive material.</p>
<p>In a renewed campaign against <b>Taiwan</b>,China proposed to fire missiles in international waters close to the island's main ports. Taiwan appealed for help.</p>

<h2>Green shoots</h2><p>(<a href="wtw2.gif">See chart</a>)<br><b>American factory orders</b> rose 0.5% in January, faster than analysts had expected, after climbing 1.7% in December, an apparent sign that the economy may be returning to quicker growth.
<p><b>Growth in Japan</b> is likely to pick up this year, but only slowly, according to the Tankan survey of business sentiment conducted by the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>German<b> unemployment </b>rose by 107,000 in February to a new post-war seasonally-adjusted high of 3.97m. The unemployment rate, based on unadjusted figures, climbed from 10.8% to 11.1%.
<h2>Clinched</h2>
Two of Switzerland's leading pharmaceutical firms, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, are to merge to create a new company called <b>Novartis</b>. The new giant, the world's second-biggest drugs enterprise, will have a market capitalisation of SFr75 billion ($63 billion). In 1995 the combined sales of the partners amounted to SFr36 billion.</p>
<p>The profits of <b>Glaxo Wellcome</b>, the product of another big drugs merger last year, rose 30% before tax in 1995, to &#163;2.5 billion ($3.8 billion). But sales of its best-selling drug, Zantac, are falling, and its patent protection in America may lapse next year.</p>
<p>Kvaerner, a Norwegian ship builder, agreed to pay &#163;904m ($1.38 billion) for <b>Trafalgar House</b>, a loss-making British construction-to-shipping conglomerate, valuing Trafalgar at a 30% premium to its market value before the takeover.</p>
<p>Gordon and Anita Roddick, founders of <b>Body Shop International</b>, a British cosmetics group, abandoned plans to convert back into a private company, 12 years after they went public. The Roddicks, who disliked the City's " short-termist" attitudes, said that bank borrowings for a share buyback would have hit future growth.</p>
<p>America's Compaq said it was cutting prices on business desktop computers by as much as 20%, prompting Hewlett-Packard and Digital, two other computer manufacturers, to <b>cut prices</b> too. Before these discounts, price competition had largely been limited to the retail sector of the computer market.</p>
<p>Australia's richest man, <b>Kerry Packer</b>, passed the control of Publishing &amp; Broadcasting, his media company, to his 28-year-old son, James. Mr Packer will, however, remain chairman of Consolidated Press, a private company that controls about 45% of Publishing &amp; Broadcasting. In December <b>Rupert Murdoch</b>, boss of News Corp, another media group, appointed his 24-year-old son Lachlan deputy chief executive of the company's Australian operations.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>In Germany, <b>Escom</b>, one of Europe's largest computer companies, admitted it was asking shareholders and creditors to stump up DM100m ($68m), after losing DM125m in 1995, nearly three times the company's initial estimate. Escom blamed a sharp fall in prices for computer components such as microprocessors and memory chips, which made its stocks less valuable. Escom's share price fell 17% on the news.</p>
<p>Imperial Chemical Industries, the British chemicals, paint and explosives group, signalled the start of a<b> buying spree</b> by purchasing Bunge Paints, South America's biggest paint company, for $390m.</p>
<p><b>BT</b>, Britain's biggest telecoms company, complained to the Spanish competition authorities about the behaviour of <b>Telefonica</b>, Spain's state operator. <font size=-1>BT</font> accused Telefonica of using confidential information to lure its Spanish customers away with offers of lower prices.
<h2>Gold bears</h2><p>(<a href="wtw3.gif">See chart</a>)<br>After climbing to a six-year high of $415 per ounce in February, the price of <b>gold</b> fell to $393, as speculators abandoned the market to buy shares instead.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it would investigate the activities of <b>broker-group associations</b> in the trading pits of America's futures and commodity exchanges. The associations will be scrutinised for anti-competitive behaviour.
<h2>Networking</h2>
America's United Airlines may merge its computer-reservations system with Worldspan Travel Information Services, a rival system owned by Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines. This would create the biggest <b>airline-reservations network</b> in America.</p>
<p>International Lease, an American <b>jet-leasing</b> company, is expected to announce $6 billion in orders for new planes from Airbus and Boeing, two big manufacturers, underlining the recent strength of the world commercial plane market.</p>
<p><b>Russia </b>said that it was planning to raise its import tariffs by an average of 20%. But it has shelved plans to block imports of American poultry, following strong American protests.</p>
<p>An appeals court in America threw out a ruling blocking <i>Business Week </i>magazine from publishing details of <b>sealed court documents</b> relating to a suit between Procter &amp; Gamble, a consumer-products giant, and Bankers Trust, an investment bank that had sold the company loss-making derivatives contracts.</p>

<h1>The peace process at breaking-point</h1><p><font size=1>JERUSALEM</font></p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN peace, and the political lives both of Shimon Peres and of Yasser Arafat, on which at present it seems to depend, hang together by the slenderest of threads after the latest suicide-bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Peres is trying to rescue things by waging what he calls " total war" against Islamic militants without, he hopes, sweeping away Mr Arafat's infant self-government. The choice, says Mr Peres, is Mr Arafat's: if he commits his forces to the battle against Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Israel will not send its troops back into the Gaza strip and most West Bank towns. So long as that step is avoided, Mr Peres argues, the peace process can be kept alive and Mr Arafat's rule preserved. Perhaps, but as Palestinian opinion swings from revulsion at the bombings to anger at the new security measures, Mr Arafat is wholly insecure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Peres himself has not much choice. The Jerusalem bus-bomb on March 3rd, killing 19 people, revived all the Israeli anger of the previous week. Within a day, a Tel Aviv shopping mall was the target, and 14 more people were dead. In rural Palestinian areas, where Israel still has "overall security responsibility", male relatives of suspects were arrested by Israeli troops, and family homes were sealed, to be demolished after a summary legal process. Movement within the West Bank was barred except for a short break on March 7th to allow people to shop, and members of the Palestinian Council to go to Gaza for its first session. Six Islamic colleges and charities have been shut, including the Islamic University in Hebron; ten more institutions may be closed in Jerusalem. The cabinet is considering deporting Hamas activists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority, for its part, has arrested some 350 Islamist suspects, including four of the 13 men on Israel's "most wanted" list. Its security forces conducted house-to-house searches in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Gaza, where they raided the Islamic University, a Hamas bastion. Mr Arafat had some success in persuading Hamas's civilian leaders that they must call off terror or be outlawed as a political organisation. "In the name of God," said one in Jerusalem, "we implore you to stop these atrocious acts if only to preserve the achievements of the Palestinian people." A March 6th communiqu&eacute from Hamas's military arm, Izzadin al-Qassam, said it was willing to hand in its arms. But communiqu&eacutes have been contradictory--nor do the Israelis believe the bombers came from the mainstream militia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Arafat, say the Israelis, is not doing enough. The foreign minister, Ehud Barak, passed him a message, through the visiting president of the European Union's Council of Ministers, that he now had his "last chance" to make a convincing move against Islamic terrorism. Israeli officials feel that, despite all that has happened and the readiness of Mr Arafat's police to work together with Israeli troops, the Palestinian leaders still do not understand the depth of the crisis in Israel or the tenuousness of Mr Peres's authority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mood in Israel is so grim that one commentator could write in his newspaper that what Mr Peres needs, if he is to win the election on May 29th, is for Mr Arafat to hang half-a-dozen Hamas terrorists in Gaza's main square. The four suicide-bombings in ten days, taking at least 60 lives, have cast a pall of fear on the country, made worse when reports came out that the man who had driven the Tel Aviv bomber from Gaza was an Arab Israeli. Many people are afraid to take buses. Some are even afraid to drive their cars alongside buses. As a result, a wartime emptiness pervades the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old-timers hark back to the outbreak of the Yom Kippur war in October 1973, when Egypt and Syria launched a devastating surprise attack. Then too a dearth of intelligence information left Israelis feeling unprotected in the face of deadly blows. In an unvarnished report to the Knesset's defence committee on March 4th, the head of the Shin Bet security service admitted that he did not know where some of the bombers were coming from, and therefore could not strike at the men behind them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the Likud opposition, now soaring ahead in the opinion polls, the admission was electoral manna. Likud leaders have insisted throughout the peace process that withdrawal from Gaza and the big West Bank towns would leave Israel ignorant of what the Islamists were plotting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Labour government counters that there was terrorism when Israel occupied all the territories. The Palestinian Authority, co-operating with the Israelis, has in fact foiled some attacks, and even the Likud is not advocating a return to Gaza or Nablus. But this logic rings hollow when, day after day, cemeteries are filled with traumatised mourners.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politically, the question now is not whether Mr Peres will win the election, but whether his government can, or should, survive until then. The historical analogy for many Israelis is again a war: the tense waiting period in 1967 when the prime minister of the day, Levi Eshkol, was seen to be hesitant and began losing public confidence. Mr Peres, then secretary-general of an opposition party, Rafi, manoeuvred for the creation of a government of national unity. Eventually, his party chief, Moshe Dayan, was co-opted by a reluctant Eshkol as minister of defence, and went on to take much of the glory for the six-day war. Now Mr Peres finds himself in Eshkol's role.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His own old role is being played by Ariel Sharon, a former defence minister and Likud hardliner, who is campaigning for "a government of national emergency" to be installed for one year with an overarching mandate to fight terrorism. Mr Sharon has not pleased his party leader, Binyamin Netanyahu, who is loth to see the elections deferred and finds no reason to join Mr Peres's beleaguered government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sharon's many enemies, in Labour and the Likud, suspect that the old warrior is hoping for a short-cut back to power for himself (he lost the defence ministry in 1983, after two notorious massacres of Palestinians by Lebanese Christians in Israeli-held parts of Beirut). One more suicide-bomb, it is argued, could generate the kind of outcry that would oblige Mr Peres to step down. Mr Sharon, if he were in the government, might, at a pinch, become a panic-stricken public's choice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly to head off any such thing, senior Labour people are urging Mr Peres to appoint Mr Barak as defence minister, instead of continuing to hold that portfolio himself. Some are even saying, privately, that Mr Peres should stand down in Mr Barak's favour. As a former military man, Mr Barak might be better placed to win the election. But Mr Peres, glummer-looking than ever, is still determined to lead the fight himself: both against terrorists and against the Likud.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?826322400,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>National Health Service</b></p>
<h1>Emergency</h1>


<p>ANY number of complaints from doctors about the problems of the National Health Service can easily be ignored. A dead child cannot. On March 6th, an inquiry into the death of a ten-year-old boy with a brain haemorrhage who had been shuttled between hospitals blamed health-service management; the same day Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, announced new guidelines to ensure better use of intensive-care beds. The health service's problems will be underlined on March 13th, when the Audit Commission produces what is expected to be a highly critical report on accident and emergency facilities at hospitals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Public horror at the boy's death reflects a widespread belief that the health service's priority should be to look after people in an emergency. A series of similar failures suggests that this is what the health service is least good at these days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of the problem is that the demand for emergency services has risen unexpectedly. Emergency admissions rose by 13% in 1989-94. The pattern of demand, however, seems uneven. Some hospitals report much sharper rises. Kingston Hospital, for instance, says that if present trends continue, by the end of this year its emergency work will have increased by 50% since 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doctors have many theories to explain the increase in accident and emergency work. Some blame better drugs and equipment for generating demand: these days, for instance, anybody suspected of a heart tremor will be rushed into hospital for sensitive new tests and treatment. Patients are getting increasingly litigious, too, which may encourage <font size=-1>GP</font>s to get people off their hands by sending them to hospital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While demand for emergency services is going up, supply is being squeezed because of several developments in the health service. One is the general--and generally benevolent--pressure to use resources more efficiently.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Accident and emergency patients go into either intensive care or emergency beds. There are only 2,600 intensive-care beds in Britain. They are expensive, because they involve round-the-clock specialist care, so there is pressure on cost-conscious hospitals to keep their number down. A survey last year found that such beds were running at high occupancy levels--about 90%. This leaves little slack to cope with unexpected rises in demand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most emergency patients are put in what are classified as acute beds. Since 1991, 9,000 of these beds have been cut--7% of the total. The fall is partly an effect of trying to keep costs down, but mostly it is the result of medical advances, such as less invasive surgery, which reduce the need for long stays in hospital. Again, though, one side-effect is that there are higher occupancy rates and less slack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Normally, if acute beds are full and there is a rush of emergency admissions, beds which would otherwise be used for "elective" surgery, such as varicose veins or hip replacements, get used instead. But this means cancelling elective operations. The sticks and carrots of the internal market include financial rewards for hospitals if they hit certain targets for elective work--meeting the Patients' Charter target of making nobody wait for more than 18 months for surgery, or carrying out certain volumes of work. If they do extra emergency work, then, they may lose those bonuses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And extra emergency work does not pay for itself. Hospitals are paid for such work either through a block contract--a lump sum based on a fixed number of admissions--or through a contract that covers the full cost of admissions for a certain number, but pays less than the full cost of each extra patient above that. Either way, hospitals make a loss on extra emergency work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further problem is the burden placed on the health service by the government's failure to make proper provision for old people under the community-care programme. A survey of geriatricians carried out by the British Medical Association last year found that 77% of doctors reported difficulties in finding nursing-home places for their hospital patients. In January, Aintree Hospital in Merseyside was unable to discharge 56 patients because local authorities had run out of money to fund community care. Since it costs around &#163;135 a night for an acute bed in a hospital, and &#163;40 for a local nursing-home bed, this does not make a lot of sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No doubt hospitals could manage their resources better. But it would also help if the government ensured that its policies sent them the right signals.

<p><b>Scottish local government</b></p>
<h1>Cuts both ways</h1><p><font size=1>EDINBURGH</font></p><p>THE government is usually on bad terms with councils, and with Scotland as well, so it is not surprising that the issue of Scottish local-government finance is a wee bit tricky. This year is especially tough, though, because the government has reorganised Scottish councils. So troublesome has the issue become that, on March 7th, Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, announced an inquiry into the cost of local government in Scotland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In April, 29 new unitary councils will take over from the 62 two-tier regional and district councils. Although the government gave the new councils 2.9% more than the old councils to spend in this year, the reorganisation, which was supposed to cut costs, threw up some unexpected problems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Glasgow's new council, for example, found it was getting &#163;750m to cover spending programmes costing &#163;800m because the outgoing Strathclyde Regional Council had favoured Glasgow. A scheme to deal with this by diverting money from councils in the rest of the region to Glasgow reduced the gap from &#163;50m to &#163;20m. But still the Glaswegians complained.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a former Thatcherite hatchet-man, Mr Forsyth is surprisingly flexible; and he is unwilling to erode his party's modest support in Scotland. So on March 4th he dug out an extra &#163;38m from his budget to subsidise bills and raised council-spending ceilings by &#163;58m. Even so, Glasgow's councillors decided the next day, when they could make themselves heard above bawling protestors, to increase the council tax by 19% and cut 2,000 jobs. Other Scottish councils took similar decisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour smirked at the government's embarrassment. But the Tories' current problems with Scottish councils will pale into insignificance beside those Labour will face if it wins the next general election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish parliament that Labour plans to set up will have to find any extra money for local government (which Labour says was &#163;395m short this year) from the share of public spending (which Labour says will be tightly controlled) that it gets from the Treasury. That implies eating into other parts of the Scottish Office budget, or raising income tax in Scotland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The parliament, meanwhile, will get no help from Labour local authorities. This year's crisis is happening partly because councils ran down their reserves, built up debts and failed to make staff cuts to finance pay rises. They have passed these problems on to their successors, even though the leaders of the old and new councils are often the same people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On March 8th the Scottish Labour Party's conference in Edinburgh will revel in Mr Forsyth's discomfort. But some hard thinking will be needed if it is not to be a future target for the same demonstrators who have been barracking the Tories.

<h1>Home cheap home</h1>

GIVEN the number of false starts in the housing market in recent years, it is a rash economist who proclaims that the real thing is here at last. However, the Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, said on March 5th that its house-prices index rose by 0.9% in February, the seventh successive monthly increase. Bank of England figures show that mortgages worth &#163;3.6 billion were arranged in January, up 14% on a year earlier. And there is another good reason for optimism: a forecast by the <font size=-1>TSB</font> bank that by the end of this year, even though prices will continue to rise, houses will be at their most affordable since 1978.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>TSB</font>'s affordability index (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>) measures how much of a typical buyer's take-home pay is needed to meet the mortgage repayments on an average-priced home. So it takes into account taxes and interest rates as well as incomes and property prices. The <font size=-1>TSB</font> reckons the current cost is &#163;28.60 for each &#163;100 of a single earner's net pay, and forecasts that the figure will fall to &#163;25.70 this year. In fact, homes may be even more affordable than the index shows because it is based on lenders' standard mortgage rates and does not allow for the huge discounts and cashback deals that many are offering.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these are only the first signs of spring. Prices are still about 12% below their peak. Around 1m people are reckoned to have negative equity (mortgages larger than the current value of their homes), which makes it difficult for them to move house even if they want to. Estate agents should not crack open the Bollinger just yet.

<p><b>Local government</b></p>
<h1>Sale time</h1>

<p>ONE of Britain's largest local authorities is preparing to hand over its blue-collar services, from cleaning to housing maintenance, to a private company. This huge privatisation, which is likely to be announced in the next month, would be something to notice even if the council in question were deep-blue Conservative. When you consider that it is in fact Lambeth in south London, once a stronghold of far-left Labour politics, and where Labour is still the biggest party, it is little short of revolutionary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many councils have hived off services in a piecemeal way following the government's introduction of compulsory competitive tendering (<font size=-1>CCT</font>) for local-authority services from 1980 on. However, <font size=-1>CCT</font> has drawbacks, including bulky paperwork in preparing contracts with suppliers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lambeth, plagued by inefficiency and corruption, has hit on its novel approach in an attempt to break with the past. The council, with the support of the Department of the Environment, intends to transfer the provision of services to a company in which the authority will retain perhaps a 20% share. It hopes to model its relationship with the new company on the co-operative relationship between Marks and Spencer, a retailer, and its suppliers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new initiative symbolises the wind of change blowing through the council, now being turned upside down by a new chief executive, Heather Rabbatts. It follows the local elections of 1994, when Labour was rudely shocked to lose its majority. Liberal Democrats made 20 net gains on the council of 64, taking safe Labour seats where tenants on the council's neglected estates vented their frustration on local councillors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The council remains hung and without a political leader. Committees are chaired by rotation between the parties. Leadership comes from Ms Rabbatts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Rabbatts was recruited at a time when the council had "one of the worst reputations of any in the <font size=-1>UK</font>"--and that was a quotation from the advertisement for her job. "The organisation had ceased to exist. There is a consensus that Lambeth needs to be sorted," she says. Already she has replaced her top management team; taken 120 staff to court charged with benefit fraud; and forced staff to pass competency tests to keep their jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under previous management, the District Auditor who monitors the council had issued 17 public-interest reports on its shortcomings in 12 years. But in January, the auditor's annual management letter noted "a genuine commitment to securing beneficial change."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On March 6th, Lambeth decided to cut its council tax for next year by &#163;2 a week for a mid-range property. That will mean cuts in spending of &#163;33m on a budget of &#163;315m. Meanwhile adverts in local newspapers threaten court summonses, bailiffs and even prison for council-tax defaulters, marking the end of an era in which paying tax in Lambeth was optional--and its council was a national joke.

<p><b>The channel tunnel link</b></p>
<h1>Expensive ride</h1>


<p>IN JUNE 1990 Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher declared that not a penny of public money would go into a 70-mile high-speed rail line linking London with the channel tunnel. On February 29th John Major's government brushed that promise aside and announced that it would provide &#163;1.4 billion towards its &#163;3 billion cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And that is only part of the story. The total amount of public subsidy is still unknown because the government has refused, so far, to make available the cost-benefit analysis on which its decision was based. In any case, spectacular <font size=-1>U</font>-turns do not come cheap. London &amp; Continental Railways, the consortium that won the contract to build the line, has also been given the company which runs Eurostar trains between London and Paris and Brussels, as well as a valuable package of railway stations and land in London.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Labour Party estimates that these sweeteners, together with the direct subsidy, are worth &#163;5.7 billion. But this is almost certainly an exaggeration. The assets handed over to the consortium, such as Waterloo International and St Pancras stations, are worth a fraction of the amounts Labour attributes to them. The best proof of this is that the contract to build the line, which included the transfer of assets, was vigorously contested by four big groups of firms. The winning bid was the one which asked for the lowest level of subsidy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the total subsidy is clearly a lot more than the government cares to admit. Whatever it is, the government justifies heavy subsidies by arguing that the high-speed link will bring &#163;6 billion worth of benefits to the public. But this also looks like an exaggeration. Most of the benefit is said to take the form of quicker journey times, reduced overcrowding and improved reliability of rail travel to the continent. The rest comes from the expected regeneration of decrepit parts of London and benefits to passenger services in the south-east of England.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the Department of Transport admits that the passenger benefits are based on forecast figures provided by London &amp; Continental. Forecasts have a nasty habit of going wrong. In Eurostar's first year of operation, it carried only 3.5m passengers, barely a third of what it had forecast. And the high-speed link will shave only 30 minutes off the three-hour journey between London and Paris, which is difficult to translate into billions for consumers on even the most generous reckoning.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Starkie, a transport economist and adviser to the House of Commons Transport Committee, says that state aid to build the high-speed link raises serious competition issues. How can ministers justify subsidising international rail travel, he asks, when they object to Spain bailing out Iberia, its international airline? Robert Ayling, British Airways' boss, says that his firm will look closely at the rail deal to see whether the subsidies infringe <font size=-1>EU</font> or domestic laws. With so many unhappy voices, the government may be wondering what it is getting for its billions.

<html><head><title>In the mind of the terrorist</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></p><h1><center>In the mind of the terrorist</center></h1>THE bombs that mangled buses and bodies in Jerusalem this week, and in London in recent weeks, are the latest in a long line of terrorist violence. As well as their own local precedents, they follow a huge bomb in January in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, the devastation in Oklahoma City last year and the poison gas attack in Tokyo last March. The bombs in Britain and Israel are particular because they have damaged two peace processes--one barely begun, the other, in the Middle East, further advanced--in which democratic governments have been negotiating with people who straddle the murky divide between politics and violence. These bombs pose tricky questions. Does violence make such negotiation more urgent? Or does it disqualify the terrorist, and anyone associated with him, from the negotiating table?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The apparent position of democratic governments has been simple: we never bargain with terrorists. Simple in rhetoric, muddled in reality. In 1986 America blamed, then bombed, Libya for helping terrorists abroad, but later tried to ransom American hostages by selling arms to Iran. In France, the appeasement of terrorism became an art form as the government negotiated to free French hostages in Lebanon. Even Israel freed more than 700 Lebanese prisoners in 1985 in a not-publicly acknowledged swap for 39 American hostages. And Britain admitted, before the <font size=-1>IRA</font> announced its ceasefire in 1994, that it had been conducting secret talks with the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, which it had sworn never to do. The basic message, it turned out, was " we never, repeat, hardly ever, bargain with terrorists."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Popular opinion, too, is far from simple, for former terrorist groups have often later become respectable. The latest confusion-sowers are the African National Congress and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. This has encouraged what might be called the relativist view of terror: that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter; that what really distinguishes terrorist groups from liberation movements is the outcome. This is what presumably has been in the minds of Americans who have long raised money for the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and of American officials who have allowed Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing, to enter America and to raise further money there even though (unlike the <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s Yasser Arafat) he has not renounced violence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if, however, you feel clear that you do not want to talk to men of violence, a further complication arises. This is the emergence of apparent moderates who say they are willing to negotiate, on the promise of holding the bombers in check. That has been Mr Arafat's stated position, and it may be Mr Adams's. The <font size=-1>PLO</font> has been arresting and imprisoning leaders of Hamas, the main Islamic fundamentalist group in Israel's occupied territories, while Hamas itself seems to be divided, with most members suggesting that their main goal is not the extermination of Israel but the assertion of Islamic values in a future Palestinian state (<a href="ir2.html">see</a>). Yet many Israelis believe that continuing with peace negotiations will just encourage more bombs. In Northern Ireland the picture is muddier still: Mr Adams, whose influence over the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is as unknown as his membership of it, goes to meetings accompanied by a convicted terrorist, Gerry Kelly, who is thought still to be on the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s main decision-making body. Should respectable governments talk to such a man?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No democratic government, with elections to win and problems to solve, can find these questions easy. The moral calculations are hazardous; the practical ones even more so. A route map of sorts can, however, be drawn if you return to that basic, surely correct, democratic instinct: not to talk to terrorists. But then ask: why not?</p><p><b>The end, not the means</b><br>Plainly, the first answer is that to do so encourages further violence. Yielding to terrorism risks feeding it. Beyond that, however, the risk is that doing so transforms the government's objective from the examination of grievances towards the mere ending of violence. It establishes an unsustainable and unacceptable test of success: the cessation of killing. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> bombs London; therefore the British government must have failed. Hamas bombs Jerusalem; therefore the Israeli government must be blamed (though whether for moving too fast or too slowly depends on who is doing the blaming). In such thinking lies defeat, but also a terrible misconception.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An honest government must admit that terrorism often does expose a legitimate grievance (<a href="sf1.html">see</a>). That is not always so--in cases such as Oklahoma City or the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany in the 1970s terror may be used for no comprehensible rhyme or reason. Terrorism sponsored by another state, as often during the cold war or by Libya or Iran, is also in a different, now less common, category. But often, alas, a grievance does exist, as it certainly did in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, and in Israel.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The misconception, however, is that once a legitimate grievance has been dealt with, the violence will end. It will not. Indeed, the closer a government is to solving the grievance, the worse the terrorist violence may become. Partly, this is because terrorism develops a momentum of its own; some of its practitioners come to define themselves by it; some are driven by a passion that the rational calculations of democracy cannot defuse. But also, it is because a settlement rarely satisfies everyone. Compromises can make the extremists among the men of terror more desperate, not less.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The task for governments is to seek to shift such terrorists from a pigeonhole marked "legitimate grievance, illegitimate means" to one marked simply "criminal" . That is far from simple, as 25 years in Ulster and 50 in the Middle East have shown. The goal of policy, nevertheless, must be to be able to proceed as if the violence were a separate matter. Arguably, Israel and the <font size=-1>PLO</font> are close to that point, although a fearful number of Palestinians in the occupied territories have yet to accept, as Mr Arafat has, Israel's right to exist. The more the division between the two is how well either side manages to marginalise the criminals, rather than what, exactly, is being conceded, the closer true peace has really become.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The situation in Ulster is harder to gauge. There, the current issue is whether or not to include Sinn Fein in all-party talks. This week the British and Irish governments announced that such talks about a constitutional settlement will begin in June, and that any party clearly committed to non-violent methods can take part (<a href="br1.html">see</a>). Sinn Fein's position will remain ambiguous; no one will know for sure whether Mr Adams and his <font size=-1>IRA</font> associates genuinely intend to give up violence. Given that, the only real option is to talk to him on the assumption that he is indeed an ex-terrorist and not an active one, and that bringing him in to the constitutional fold therefore has a point.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The assumption may be proved wrong. No matter: its implications can still be pursued. The aim of the exercise is to win support for the constitutional settlement that Britain and Ireland have already outlined. Violence is a separate matter. If part of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, or a loyalist group, splits with mainstream republicans or unionists and resumes violence to try to seek something else, then so be it: the basics of the settlement are not negotiable. Terrorism may well not disappear, even once the ink is dry. But that is in its nature.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="sf1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>The Cuban thorn</h2>
Cuban MiGs shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft belonging to a <b>Cuban exile group</b>. The Cubans said the two had been in Cuban airspace at the time. The United States denied it, and got the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council to " strongly deplore" the attack. The <b>Helms-Burton bill</b>, tightening sanctions against both Cuba and others aiding, abetting and doing business there, was put on a fast-track through Congress. A once-reluctant Bill Clinton said he would sign the bill.
<p><b>Steve Forbes</b>, billionaire publisher and flat-tax enthusiast, won the Arizona Republican primary. He now leads the pack with 60 delegates, despite having been left for dead in New Hampshire. Bob Dole came second; Pat Buchanan was a close third.
<p>Mr Dole, trying to <b>revive his campaign</b>, dismissed his campaign pollster and demoted his chief strategist. His staff had divided over whether or not negative advertising was a good idea.<ro>
<h2>A clean sweep</h2>
A special court in India dealing with the country's political corruption scandal issued <b>arrest warrants</b> for ten politicians, including four who have recently resigned from the cabinet. L.K. Advani, a leader of the main opposition party, has also been named in an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>America's Export-Import Bank agreed to hold up <b>loans to China </b>while the State Department investigated reports that the Chinese had supplied Pakistan with nuclear technology.</p>
<p>Thousands of Tibetan farmers faced starvation as the <b>worst winter </b>in memory wiped out their herds of yaks and sheep.<ro>
<h2>Pinning it down</h2>
The British and Irish prime ministers, John Major and John Bruton, announced a formula to reach all-party talks on the future of <b>Northern Ireland</b>, which they promised would begin on June 10th. Hopes rose that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> might now restore its ceasefire. A fixed date for such talks has been a key demand of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing.</p>
<p>Mr Major's government won, by a single vote, a critical division in the House of Commons on the <b>Scott report</b>, which had severely criticised the government for its handling of defence exports to Iraq. No minister resigned over the issue, despite widespread demands for someone to take responsibility.</p>
<p>The <b>Princess of Wales </b>agreed to divorce Prince Charles, and said she would continue to be involved in all decisions concerning her children and would retain her title. Caught by surprise, the queen's spokesman said details "remain to be discussed."</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>President Jacques Chirac said that <b>France's armed forces </b>must become leaner and all-professional by 2001to be on a par with the "best in the world" . France's arms industry, he said, should be first in the world, or at worst second only to America's.</p>
<p>Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, declared there was no point in discussing a delay in the timetable for European economic and <b>monetary union</b>, let alone a change in the qualifications for joining it.</p>
<p>Negotiations in <b>Turkey</b> for a coalition government that would have brought an Islamic party to the fore collapsed. The two main centre-right parties, led by Tansu Ciller, who still heads Turkey's caretaker government, and Mesut Yilmaz, who failed to strike a deal with the Islamists, insist they are now close to agreeing upon a quite different-looking coalition.</p>
<p>Italy's caretaker prime minister, <b>Lamberto Dini</b>, created his own political party to compete in April's general election and said he will support the main centre-left block.</p>
<p>Opinion polls in Spain predicted that <b>Jose Maria Aznar</b>'s conservative People's Party would beat Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialist party, which has run the country for more than 13 years, in a general election on March 3rd.</p>
<p>Competing claims to jurisdiction over the Estonian church caused Patriarch Alexy II of Russia to suspend relations with the Archbishopric of Constantinople, threatening the Orthodox Church with its <b>worst schism since 1443</b>.</p>
<p>Poland rejected a Russian proposal to build a motorway across <b>northern Poland </b>linking Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave, with Belarus. The plan was mooted during a visit to Moscow by Alexander Lukashenka, president of Belarus, who wants closer ties with Russia. Belarus and Russia agreed to write off some of their debts to one another.<ro>
<h2>Bloody Middle East</h2>
Breaking a six-month respite, Hamas <b>suicide-bombers </b>killed 24 people in Jerusalem (injuring another 60), and one in Ashkelon, injuring 20. Shimon Peres demanded that Yasser Arafat crack down on the political as well as the military wing of Hamas.</p>
<p>Two sons-in-law of <b>Saddam Hussein</b> who had returned to Iraq believing that they had been pardoned for their defection to Jordan, were then murdered, along with other members of their family.</p>
<p>Voters in <b>Sierra Leone</b>'s towns went to the polls to elect a civilian government. Soldiers have run the country since 1985.</p>

Although the gap with Japan narrowed for the first time in five years, dropping nearly 10% to $59 billion, its deficit with China grew by 14.6% to $34 billion, and its surplus of $1.4 billion with Mexico in 1994 turned into a $16.2 billion deficit.</p><p><b>Growth in America </b>last year, at 2.1%, was at its most sluggish since the recession of 1990-91. It slowed in the fourth quarter to an annualised 0.9%, half the expected rate and down from 3.6% in the third quarter. January was better; retail sales fell only 0.3% despite heavy snows, and consumer confidence rose in February.</p><p>For the third year in a row, household spending in <b>Japan </b>declined, falling by 1.1% in 1995. But there was some good news: industrial production rose last year by 3.3%, and in January department-store sales rose 5.4%, the biggest rise in nearly five years.<ro><h2>Networking</h2>In the biggest merger yet between a Baby Bell and a cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> business, <b>US West</b> agreed to pay $5.3 billion for <b>Continental Cablevision</b> and assume $5.5 billion in debt to gain access to more than 4m potential new subscribers across 11 states. The merger is the first of its kind since sweeping changes in the law regulating America's telephone and television markets.</p><p><b>British Petroleum</b> and <b>Mobil</b> are responding to overcapacity in refining and a price war in petrol by merging their lubricants and refining operations in Europe, businesses with combined annual sales of $20 billion.</p><p>In a rare French demerger, <b>Chargeurs</b> is to split itself into two publicly quoted companies, with Path&eacute retaining the film, <font size=-1>TV</font> and newspaper operations, including a 17% stake in <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, and Chargeurs International running the textile and distribution businesses.</p><p><b>De Beers</b> strengthened an agreement with Russia to buy its rough diamonds. Previously, loopholes allowed Russia to keep many of the best gems for itself and to sell others direct to the world market, by-passing De Beers; under the new deal Russia could keep more stones, but of a wider quality. In exchange De Beers will pay Russia some $2 billion a year.</p><p><b>Kvaerner</b>, a Norwegian ship builder, is considering a bid for <b>Trafalgar House</b>,a loss-making British construction-to-shipping conglomerate.</p><p>California's <b>Silicon Graphics</b>, under pressure in its <font size=-1>PC</font> business, has decided to push into the higher end of the computer business. It is buying <b>Cray Research</b>, a struggling maker of supercomputers, for a modest $770m or so. This should create the world's leading supercomputer company.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>A Canadian publishing and travel firm, <b>Thomson</b>, is to pay $3.43 billion for West Publishing to expand its American legal-publishing operations.</p><p>Acquisitive <b>Heineken</b> completed its purchase of <b>Birra Moretti </b>from Belgium's Interbrew for around $170m to give the Dutch brewer the top spot in Italy with nearly 40% of the beer market.<ro><h2>Housekeeping</h2><b>Tokai Bank</b> of Japan will write off its &#165;800 billion ($7.7 billion) or so of bad loans in the current financial year. In the year to end-March it expects to declare a net loss of &#165;350 billion compared with a profit of &#165;21 billion the year before.</p><p>An American court found <b>Daiwa Bank</b> guilty of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, and imposed a $340m criminal fine. The Japanese bank had originally denied trying to conceal losses of more than $1 billion from regulators. It later changed its plea to guilty.</p><p>Britain's <b>Barclays Bank</b> declared a 12% rise in pre-tax profits last year to &#163;2.08 billion ($3.28 billion). But the markets were disappointed by a 5% drop in operating profits to &#163;2.25 billion, with operating costs up 9.4%. Barclays then spent &#163;306m on buying back 40m of its shares, equal to 2.5% of its total capital; a few months ago it bought back 25m shares.</p><p><b>Groupe Paribas</b>, a French bank holding company, announced losses of FFr4 billion ($802m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr1.7 billion in 1994. The loss was due to provisions against losses in property, industrial holdings and a retail-banking subsidiary.<ro><h2>Air currents</h2>State-owned <b>Sabena </b>of Belgium ousted the chief executive, Pierre Godfroid, and gave the job to Paul Reutlinger of <b>Swissair</b>, which took a 49.5% stake in the airline last summer. Sabena lost BFr530m ($18m) in 1995, after losing BFr1.2 billion the year before.</p><p>Philip Condit is to become the seventh chief executive in <b>Boeing</b>'s 80-year history, replacing Frank Shrontz, who will remain as chairman.</p><p>Germany's biggest shipbuilder won a stay of execution from its creditor banks. Over the next two months <b>Bremer Vulkan</b> will get a modest DM100m ($68m) or so--the group lost around DM1 billion last year--while management comes up with a restructuring plan.</p><p>Italy's <b>Gianni Agnelli</b> retired only two weeks before his 75th birthday as chairman of the Fiat industrial group.</p><p><b>Jimmy Lai</b>, a controversial Hong Kong publisher, sold for $189m his remaining 27% in Giordano, a fast-growing clothing chain he founded in 1980.

<html><head><title>What is terrorism?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><img src="sf.gif" alt="Section heading"><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></td></tr></table><h1>What is terrorism?</h1><p><b>The use of terror is more widespread and effective than is generally recognised</b></p><ro><p>JUNE 1914: a young man in Sarajevo steps up to a carriage and fires his pistol. The Archduke Ferdinand dies. Within weeks, the first world war has begun. The 1940s: the French resistance kill occupying troops when and how they can. June 1944: at Oradour-sur-Glane, in central France, German <font size=-1>SS</font> troops take revenge, massacring 642 villagers. August 1945: the United States Air Force drops the world's first nuclear weapons. Some 190,000 Japanese die, nearly all of them civilians. Within days the second world war has ended.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which of these four events was an act of terrorism? Which achieved anything? Which, if any, will history judge as justified? And whose history? Terrorism is not the simple, sharp-edged, bad-guy phenomenon we all love to condemn. No clear line marks off politics from the threat of force, threat from use, use from covert or open war. Who is or is not a terrorist? The suicide bomber, the rebel guerrilla, the liberation front, the armed forces of the state?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In practice, what act or person earns the label depends on who wants to apply it. To Ulster loyalists all <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence is terrorism; to Sinn Fein it is part of a legitimate war. To many Israelis, everyone from the suicide-bombers in Jerusalem or Ashkelon to the Hizbollah grenade-thrower in South Lebanon is a terrorist; to many Arabs during the 1982 Lebanon war, the worst terrorists in the Middle East were the--entirely legitimate, uniformed--Israel Defence Force.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the concept is not to vanish into all-embracing fudge, two distinctions can be drawn, though habitually they are not. Terrorism is indeed about terror; not just violence, but its use to spread terror. And the violence is aimed specifically at civilians.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Classical terrorism, ideological rather than territorial, reveals the niceties. Recent decades saw West Germany's Baader-Meinhof gang and Red Army Fraction murder prominent businessmen such as Alfred Herrhausen and J&uuml;rgen Ponto (bosses of Germany's two largest banks, Deutsche and Dresdner respectively). Italy's Red Brigades murdered Aldo Moro, a former prime minister. Its far right in 1980 blew up a train in Bologna station, killing 84 people. Which of these was truly terrorism? Arguably, only the last. It was an act of indiscriminate violence to terrorise citizens at large; the others were discriminate assassinations to win publicity and display power.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Likewise, lobbing mortar-bombs into a British army base in South Armagh may have deadly results, but it is guerrilla warfare. Planting a bomb that kills a dozen diners in a restaurant is terrorism. The suicide bomber in Jerusalem was a terrorist; the Hizbollah fighter in South Lebanon attacking Israeli army patrols is not.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even in the distinction between guerrilla warfare and terrorism, there are grey areas. The soldier in a tank is a military target. What about one in a jeep escorting civilian vehicles? Or returning on a bus from leave? A bus that may--and was, when a suicide bomber attacked it in Gaza last April--be carrying civilians too?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are, in contrast, distinctions often made that ought not to be. What is or is not "terrorism" does not depend on the badness or goodness of the cause, nor on whether those espousing it have the chance to express their demands democratically. When President James Garfield was assassinated in America in the same year, 1881, that a Russian terrorist group blew up Tsar Alexander <font size=-1>II</font>, the Russians wrote an open letter condemning Garfield's killers and arguing that:<ul><font size=-1>In a land where the citizens are free to express their ideas, and where the will of the people does not merely make the law but appoints the person who is to carry the law into effect, political assassination is the manifestation of despotism...Despotism is always blameworthy and force can only be justified when employed to resist force.</font></ul>Yet despotism does not justify throwing bombs into crowds (as the group sometimes did).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact is that a good cause may use terrorism just as a bad one may. South Africa has provided a clear example. The ending of white dominance was a plainly good cause. For the most part, the African National Congress used mass demonstrations and industrial sabotage to advance its cause. But the men who shot up a white church congregation or planted a bomb outside a cinema were terrorists in the purest sense of the word.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor does the terrorists' ultimate success or failure alter the truth. Menachem Begin got to lead a country; Yasser Arafat may do; Velupillai Prabhakaran, who leads the Tamil Tigers, probably will not. None of that changes the fact that Deir Yassin (a massacre of Palestinian villagers by Israelis fighting to establish their state), the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and this year's Tamil Tiger bomb in Colombo were all acts of terror.</p><p><b>The terror of the state</b><br><ro>So much for the underdogs. Can there be terrorist governments too? The Americans certainly think so when they accuse Libya or Iran of supporting international terrorism. In the cold war, international terrorists were used to wage war by proxy: the East German regime provided safe houses for Baaders and Meinhofs; the modern era's most notorious terrorist, the gun-for-hire Carlos the Jackal, made his career in this world of state-sponsored terrorism.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All that was diplomacy by terror. Can a recognised government also be guilty of terrorism against its own people?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes. Stalin used terror systematically to consolidate his power--random murders of Communist-Party members and army officers in the 1930s, massacres and exiles of smaller ethnic groups throughout his rule. Much of Latin America practised state terrorism in recent decades. The brasshat regimes of the day faced left-wing, sometimes terrorist movements. Many fought back with terror. And not just through paramilitaries or unacknowledged death squads. The infamous massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador in 1981 was the work of that country's regular army. The unit that did it had a cheerful song of its own, <i><ul><font size=-1>" Somos Guerreros"</font>:<br>We are warriors,<br>Warriors all!<br>We are setting out to kill<br>A mountain of terrorists.</font></ul>What in fact they killed was over 500 peasants; probably the worst "official" massacre in Latin America's recent history.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can regular armies, in regular war, be guilty of terrorism? The answer, surely, is yes. Look at the Japanese rape of Nanking in 1937, when not hundreds or thousands but ten of thousands of civilians were murdered, to terrorise the rest of China. Then go a step further. Can the armies of proud democracies be guilty too? A century ago, the rich world, with the rules of war that it claimed to use, would have called attacking civilians impermissable. The modern world has other ideas. The Allied bombing of Germany was aimed at civilians in the hope of shattering morale: in short, terror. The fire bombing of Tokyo and the atomic weapons that vaporised Hiroshima and Nagasaki were arguably aimed at government morale, not that of Japan's population. Their victims did not notice the difference.</p><p><b>Who kills and how?</b><br><ro>What use, one can ask, is a definition so wide that it can go from Stalin to the American air force? There are two answers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, it is a reminder that terrorism, historically, has been the tool of the strong, not the weak. Medieval armies, having taken a besieged town, would slaughter some or all of the citizens to encourage other towns to surrender faster. During India's struggle for independence, by far the worst terror was the Amritsar massacre in 1919, when British-officered troops shot up a political gathering, and carried on shooting until the bullets ran out; 379 civilians died (and it worked: the rebellious province of Punjab returned to order). In contrast, discriminate assassination was the typical weapon of the 19th-century anarchist and nihilist.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By and large, true random terrorism has come in the past 30 years, as in the Bologna train bomb, the recent nerve-gassing of the Tokyo metro by a religious cult, or the Oklahoma City bomb; all three crimes were aimed at no matter whom for a purpose so vague or Utopian as to seem irrelevant, except to the deranged. Even in this period most--not all--<font size=-1>IRA</font> killing was aimed at defined targets: soldiers, policemen, individual Protestant farmers in border areas. The Basque violence of <font size=-1>ETA</font> has often followed this pattern. Peru's Shining Path guerrillas are truer terrorists, but even they (mostly) prefer the tactics, honed by the Vietcong, of killing officials, not just (as in some infamous massacres) everyone in sight. Algeria's and Sri Lanka's terrorists today probably have the strongest claim to be called spreaders of true random terror.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second thing one can learn from the wide definition of terrorism is that the phenomenon is neither uniquely wicked, nor--still less--uniquely deadly. People fight with the weapons they have: knives, Semtex, rifles, fighter-bombers. All their users are alike convinced of their own righteousness, all kill and all their victims are equally dead. What they are not is equal in number. The Munich terrorists killed 11 Israelis; Israel's retaliation against the Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh, however justified, killed about 100 Arabs. The State Department has totted up the deaths due to international terrorism from 1968 through 1995. Its total, and it defines terrorism broadly, is 8,700 (<a href="sf1.gif">see chart</a> for other figures). Twenty-four hours of air raids killed six times as many civilians at Dresden in 1945. One is a crime, says international law, the other a legitimate act of war.</p><p><b>The response</b><br><ro>Is all this mere word-play? It is not. It crucially affects responses to terrorism.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One true difference between a terrorist group and a government is that the group is almost impossible to smash. You can destroy or seize a government's ability to make conventional war; you will never get every terrorist's last stick of dynamite or timing mechanism, and it requires wonderfully few terrorists to keep a civilised society on edge.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But many other imagined differences are less great than they might appear. It is a common error to suppose that because terrorism is not war, and because its weapons are not the full panoply of war, then the psychology of terrorists must be different too. Of course, there are plenty of curious specimens among terrorism's ranks: Carlos the Jackal, now in French hands, was not just any old gunman; or consider Abimael Guzman, an academic who until his capture in 1992 led Peru's Shining Path movement. Every terrorist must have personal devotion to the cause--he is, after all, risking his liberty, and often his life; not many reluctant army conscripts, drafted by a legitimate government, are likely feel the same way. And plainly, say those who know them, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and other groups include people who enjoy violence for its own sake.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But so do most armies. And most governments, once at war, can produce remarkable devotion to the national cause. In its own terms, a warring terrorist group, like a warring government, is "pursuing diplomacy by other means", even if its means of war are different. It too is subject to highs and lows, to war fatigue and collapses of morale, to premature celebration of a battle won as if it had been the war. It too can be threatened with a heavy hand; some of its members may be wooed with a lighter one.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Terrorists, like governments, may be rational: they are pursuing a policy they hope will succeed. And the more it works, the more vigorously they will pursue it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is always hard, when terrorism is just one element in a complex pattern of events, to identify its impact. But the world is manifestly a different place because of acts of terror. In 1948, the Israelis blew up the King David hotel, the administrative centre of the British rulers of Palestine. The atrocity helped persuade the British to leave.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Often, terrorists help advance a general cause, but not their own particular aims. That may be the case with the <font size=-1>IRA</font>. Irish Republican terrorism helped dramatise the nationalist cause throughout periods of discriminatory Protestant rule. And Britain has made concessions to the nationalists. In the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, the British accepted the right of the Irish Republic to a say in a province of the United Kingdom; in the two governments' Downing Street declaration of 1993 Britain said it had "no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland" . It is hard to imagine any other government saying such things of its own accord. Yet whether it was the <font size=-1>IRA</font> that brought this about, or persistent pressure from the Irish government and peaceful nationalists in the north, is debatable. The leader of the biggest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume, argues that <font size=-1>IRA</font> terrorism has been the main obstacle to a peaceful settlement in Ulster. If so, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> may also have harmed the nationalist cause.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And sometimes, terrorists can advance both a general cause and themselves. The <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s campaigns in the 1970s made the organisation the dominant representative of the Palestinians. They also helped solidify the Palestinians' own sense of their distinct identity, which until then had been relatively weak.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as terrorists make a difference to the world, so changes in the world make a difference to terrorists. It was not just their own weakness that led the British to quit India, or later Cyprus (whose <font size=-1>EOKA</font> gunmen, though damned as terrorists, were more like guerrilla fighters), or later still Kenya (where they faced a genuinely terrorist liberation movement). Weakness played its part, but so did a world view that said colonial empires had had their day. Much the same was true in South Africa. F.W. de Klerk, probably the last white president there, may not have been a more virtuous man than the architects of apartheid who preceded him. But he was and is a realist, who lived in different days and under different pressures.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In that case, a just cause plainly helped the terrorists. For Muslim countries the Palestinian cause was no less just. Western countries, guiltily aware of the horrors of Jewish history, disagreed, and it took 20 years of Israeli occupation and the <i>intifada</i>, the Palestinian uprising of 1987-90, to persuade them that the <font size=-1>PLO</font> too had a case. It is still not one that much impresses Americans; and though other westerners may have sympathy with Palestinian dreams of statehood, any movement that still seeks a quite different thing, the destruction of Israel, on top will--very rightly--find that its bombers face a western world united behind the Jewish state.</p><p><b>Like the rest of us--mostly</b><br><ro>In all this, what is different about dealing with terrorism? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not very much.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Any government has its own interests, its own pressures, its concessions it can make and those it cannot. It fights its conventional wars with tanks and aircraft, its small-scale wars--partly terrorist, mostly not--with intelligence men and small arms. It cannot, usually, zap the terrorists' territory as it could that of a hostile state. But its psychology will be much the same in the two cases--and so will that of its enemies. The terrorist or suicide bomber or gunman or fighter or liberation hero is not different from other men (men, <i>sic</i>; rarely have women played any notable part, any more than they have in old-fashioned war).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With one notable exception: the nutters, whether with a cause or no evident cause at all. The American way-out redneck who thinks he has to plant a bomb, when he could vote for Pat Buchanan, is beyond any but a psychiatrist's reach. So too elitist solipsists like the Baader-Meinhof mob, convinced that murder was justified because they knew all the answers and it was society that was out of step. Among the almost causeless, Italy's far right may have sought instability, but for what? That was never clear. And no known concession could have led Japan's Aum Shinrikyo cult to put aside its chemistry set.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is it coincidence that three of these four groups seem to specialise in the true terrorism, the random murder of civilians for terror's sake? Perhaps it is not.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="ir1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>After the bombs</h1>
<p><b>The revival of Islamist terrorism leaves Israel buffeted and Palestinians trapped. Our correspondents report; first, from Jerusalem </b></p>

<p>AS VICTIMS of Sunday's suicide-bomb attack in Jerusalem were being buried the next day, the wailing of sirens drowned the eulogies. A Palestinian driver, had deliberately run his car into a crowd of hitch-hikers in the north of the city and had been shot dead by passers-by. Or had it all been an accident? Police evidence, backed by a less-than-reliable statement from Hamas's military wing, strongly suggests that he had indeed meant to do what he did. But the confusion seemed to symbolise Israel's distraught condition as Islamist terrorism returned after a six-month respite. Twenty-four people had been killed by the bus-bomber in Jerusalem; one by another suicide-bomber in Ashkelon the same day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the 1994-95 bombings, the question after each incident was whether negotiations with the Palestinians could go on. This time, the negotiations, having produced an interim result, are on hold anyway, pending Israel's election on May 29th. The question now is the electoral impact of renewed terrorism. The prospects for the peace process depend on this. The right-wing Likud, while grudgingly accepting the present arrangements, remains implacably opposed to eventual Palestinian independence. The governing Labour Party is moving steadily towards a " two-state solution".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an opinion poll conducted within hours of the two bombings, the lead of Labour's Shimon Peres over the Likud's Binyamin Netanyahu swung from a previous nine points to just two. Maybe the pendulum will swing back, if there are no further attacks. But how far? One pollster, Mina Tsemach, points to a key block of what she calls "emotional voters" who had switched from Likud to Labour after the murder of Yitzhak Rabin last November. Now they seem to have switched back.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet one group, she notes, appears to be more constant than others: first-time voters, who have been politically galvanised by Rabin's assassination. "For them, peace is more important than anything," says Ms Tsemach. "Terrorism will not shift them."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In another way Israeli reaction is different from that provoked by earlier bombings. Then, thousands of people were ready to gather at the site, cursing the prime minister and his peace policy. Opposition politicians made a point of being photographed among the angry crowds. This time the demonstrators were few in number, and the politicians stayed away. "Now is a time for unity in mourning and unity in strength," said a newly statesmanlike Mr Netanyahu. Raucous recrimination no longer fits the national mood.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The superficial moderation of the public debate should not, however, give Mr Peres and his party cause for confidence. The fear and the fury engendered by earlier mass-killings are present again, albeit in more silent, sullen form. Instant polls cannot take the full measure of the emotional storm buffeting the soul of the nation. It is almost as if the shooting of Yitzhak Rabin and this week's bus-bombings were vying with each other for Israeli hearts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new terrorism has freed some right-leaning voters from the inhibitions that evolved after Rabin's murder by a far-right religious fanatic. It has also brought a dramatic closing of ranks. David Levy, a former foreign minister who left the Likud last year to form his own party, is now negotiating his way back. This deal, concluded in principle though still to be signed, comes after a similar pact between the Likud and Tsomet, another right-wing party, led by a former army commander, Rafael Eitan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Netanyahu is having to pay a heavy price in terms of safe slots on Likud's list of Knesset candidates. His reward is that Mr Eitan, and now Mr Levy, will not stand for the prime ministership, leaving him and Mr Peres to slug it out alone. There will be no later run-off, as there would have been in a multiple-horse race. Mr Netanyahu regards this as critical to his chances. The group that so often holds the key to Israeli elections, the ultra-orthodox, will turn out on May 29th to vote for their own Knesset candidates, and some will take the opportunity to vote for Mr Netanyahu at the same time. But would they bother to turn out a second time? Probably not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Mr Peres, the bombings and their political fall-out have been a nightmare come true. His opinion-poll ratings had slipped slightly in recent weeks, but the gap opened up by the Rabin murder had been so wide that he remained confident of victory. His strategy had been to follow as centrist and uncontroversial a course as possible. Now he has to demonstrate toughness, partly in order to convince middle-of-the-road Israelis that Yasser Arafat is a dependable partner in peace. In pursuit of this, he sent the army chief of staff, Lieut-General Amnon Shahak, to demand that the Palestinian Authority arrest a string of known Islamic activists in the Gaza Strip.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two suicide-bombers themselves, young Hamas supporters, came from the Hebron region, which is still under Israeli military rule--awkward for those who want to blame all outrages on Mr Arafat's incompetence or bad faith. But Israel insists, credibly enough, that the explosives, the orders and the religious inspiration all came from inside Gaza. So Mr Peres threatens to postpone the handover of most of Hebron to Palestinian rule, due at the end of March, unless Mr Arafat co-operates. Meanwhile, he has reimposed an indefinite closure of the border between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. He will be under strong pressure from his election managers to keep it closed until polling day.

His immediate response was to arrest 150 people for suspected links with Hamas's military wing,Izzadin el-Qassam. His police chief then ordered all Palestinians in the self-rule areas to hand in unlicensed weapons. But he has so far resisted Israeli and American pressure to go after Hamas, root and branch: to dismantle the Islamists' infrastructure of schools and charities which, says the Israeli government, camouflage their military operations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We want more stick and less carrot from Arafat. The process of co-opting has failed," says Martin Indyk, the American ambassador to Israel. Mr Arafat's stick-and-carrot policy towards Hamas has indeed been sabotaged by the new outrages. It had been showing slow, incremental results. For nearly a year, the Palestinian leader has been acting forcefully against Islamist activists. In Gaza, his security forces have arrested several hundreds of suspects, earning stern rebukes from Palestinian, international, even Israeli human-rights organisations in the process. In the West Bank, Palestinian police forces have worked with Israeli security services, a liaison that led to the destruction of Qassam cells in Jenin, Jerusalem and Hebron.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Hamas is much more than its military arm. It is a social and religious organisation, running an array of civic institutions. Mr Arafat has left these institutions intact--and initiated a quiet dialogue with Hamas's civilian leaders, attempting to co-opt them into the political process. He did not convince all of them, but his efforts produced a more pragmatic Hamas leadership, particularly in Gaza. These are men whose aim is less to scupper the peace process than to exist politically within it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In December officials from Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority (<font size=-1>PA</font>) met Hamas representatives, both from Jordan (where a harder line predominates) and from the self-rule territories, for "reconciliation" talks in Cairo. Hamas promised "a ceasefire with the occupation" on condition that the <font size=-1>PA</font> used its offices with Israel to "protect" Islamist military fugitives from the Israelis. Mr Arafat demanded an unconditional ceasefire. Hamas broke up the talks, saying it would boycott the Palestinian elections but still promising not to embarrass the <font size=-1>PA</font> in its commitments to Israel. But then, a month later, an Israeli booby-trap killed Yehya Ayyash, a Hamas bomb-maker who was Israel's number-one target, the biggest fugitive of all, in Gaza.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, some Hamas leaders stuck to the pragmatic line. The group's Gazan spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar, said it would take part in June's municipal elections. Another senior man, Ghazi Hamad, said publicly that "the majority of Hamas members are now ready to give up--temporarily--the armed struggle against Israel and turn to political activity."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A minority, clearly, are not. These, it is said, are Qassam activists based mainly in the West Bank, for whom an unconditional reconciliation could spell their own obituaries. Their return to the politics of terror was, they say, to avenge the killing of Ayyash and other Islamist activists. But it was also a message--to Israel, to Mr Arafat and to their own political leaders--that any rapprochement or truce must include them. The day Israel "stops terrorism against Hamas and releases our prisoners ... we will reach an historic position ... not to shed blood in Palestine," said a Hamas statement after Sunday's bombings.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Arafat's dilemma is acute. His instinct tells him that the way to neutralise Qassam is through Hamas's political leadership, perhaps by prising the two apart. But Israel and America are telling him to crush Hamas, military and political wings alike. Polls show that the overwhelming majority of local Palestinians oppose terrorist operations; Hamas's own support among them is down to 10%. But if Mr Arafat acts against the group in the way that the Israelis are urging, the whole organisation could become an outlawed, and even more murderous, religious militia.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

And none too soon.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If John Major and John Bruton, the British and Irish prime ministers, had not been able to agree on a way forward on February 28th, hours before both men left for a Europe-Asia summit in Bangkok, the peace process might well have died. Both governments had agreed, at another hastily arranged summit in November, that the end of February should be the target date for all-party talks. But the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had ended its ceasefire early in February and bombed London, saying it believed such talks would never happen. Pressure to do something was intense.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At their summit, the two leaders agreed that consultations with the political parties in Northern Ireland would begin on March 4th. They will cover the form of elections to lead "directly and without preconditions" to all-party negotiations. The consultations will also examine the possibility of holding referendums on both sides of the border asking people to repudiate violence and support talks. These consultations will end on March 13th. Whether or not there is agreement, the British government will pass the legislation needed to hold the elections--"based on a judgment on what seems most broadly acceptable"--some time in May, and then all-party negotiations will begin on June 10th.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Attention will now shift to the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, and its political wing, Sinn Fein. When it called off its ceasefire on February 9th, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> said that it was doing so because the British had failed, for the 17 months of its ceasefire, to move towards an "inclusive negotiated settlement". Again and again Sinn Fein leaders have said that this was a demand for all-party talks "without preconditions". Irish republicans now have a British promise, endorsed by Dublin, that all-party talks will begin at a fixed date.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immediate reaction from Sinn Fein was cautious. Gerry Adams, the party's president, said that many republicans would be sceptical in the face of "consistent British bad faith and stalling". Martin McGuinness, another Sinn Fein leader, said that his party needed "more clarity" before asking the <font size=-1>IRA</font> for a new ceasefire. But both men also said that their party would look at the proposals "positively".<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More significantly, Sinn Fein announced the following day that, hours after Mr Major and Mr Bruton unveiled their deal, Mr Adams and John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (<font size=-1>SDLP</font>), Northern Ireland's largest nationalist party, had met <font size=-1>IRA</font> leaders and "reiterated their commitment to restoring the peace process". It was Mr Hume who persuaded Mr Adams, after years of talks, to lead the <font size=-1>IRA</font> to their first ceasefire.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it is difficult to see how the <font size=-1>IRA</font> can now justify, even to its own supporters, refusing to call a second ceasefire. The only hurdle between Sinn Fein and all-party talks, an election, also applies to all other parties, and has been accepted by Dublin and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>. Sinn Fein knows that it can win its customary 10% of the vote in such an election. In interviews Mr Major also said that the government could not bar Sinn Fein from running in the election even in the absence of a new <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire. But with no ceasefire, Sinn Fein will not be allowed to take its place at the negotiating table. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> might decide to see this as a precondition. But this would be absurd. Taken at its word, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> would then be bombing and killing solely to get the British government to drop its demand for a ceasefire.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal announced by the two prime ministers has something bitter, as well as pleasing, for everyone, not just Sinn Fein. Both the Irish government and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, like Sinn Fein, have sought a firm date for talks. But both have also had to accept elections, which they have opposed as divisive and obstructive.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two largest unionist parties--the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionists--get the elections they demanded, but not the assembly or "body" they wanted, and which they would have dominated. Nor will the <font size=-1>IRA</font> be required to make a gesture on decommissioning weapons before Sinn Fein is allowed into talks, as the unionists have long demanded, though decommissioning will be near the top of the agenda once the talks begin.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of all, unionists will be unable to delay all-party talks. Both governments have said that, if the <font size=-1>IRA</font> calls a new ceasefire, they will expect the unionist parties to sit down with Sinn Fein on June 10th. If the unionist parties refuse to do this, they will be the ones who thereby exclude themselves from negotiations--and it is they who will be blamed for wrecking the talks. Neither unionist party was overjoyed at this, but neither rejected the package.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first argument will be about the form of the election. The Ulster Unionists, the largest unionist party, wants the election to be based on the province's 18 parliamentary constituencies, which would play to its organisational strength. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, in a surprising alliance, want a province-wide, party-list system, which will benefit both of them. The British government is likely to opt for the party-list system. Not only does it have support across the sectarian divide, but it will also make it easier for fringe loyalist parties to win a seat at the negotiating table.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So have the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s London bombs achieved their purpose--a firm date for all-party talks? Mr Major and Mr Bruton insisted that they were not responding to <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence and that the peace process was proceeding as they had promised back in November. Unfortunately, no one believes this. One Tory backbencher, David Wilshire, lambasted the deal as "another Munich". Few go that far. And yet talks looked a distant prospect before the bombs went off. They have clearly concentrated minds on how to get talks going.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is deluding itself if it now believes that it can turn violence off and on once Sinn Fein is into talks. Its bombs have alienated Sinn Fein sympathisers in America, alarmed the White House, enraged Dublin and filled many in the <font size=-1>SDLP</font> with disgust. The vast majority of people north and south of the border, nationalists and unionists, want both talks and peace. Sinn Fein leaders have repeatedly claimed that they will accept the outcome of all-party talks. Once such talks begin, more <font size=-1>IRA</font> bombs would split the republican movement wide open, or shatter Sinn Fein's credibility once and for all.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br2.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

They persuaded civil servants to include the length of a council's coastline among the factors used to determine how much its fire service should get. The rationale? That areas with lots of coastline had fewer neighbouring fire services to call on in time of difficulty. This decision has given hope to West Yorkshire, which is arguing that hilly areas should get similarly favourable treatment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is local-government season again. In the first half of March, councils tell local residents how much council tax they will have to pay during the current year. Some councils have been threatening huge rises: Southwark, for instance, suggested its bills might have to go up by 94%. Actual increases will be lower, probably up to 25%.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During April, after the council-tax bills have been sent to residents, the run-up to local-government elections starts. Central government points to high increases and accuses (mostly Labour-run) councils of being profligate, while the councils accuse central government of failing to finance services properly. At the elections in May, the electorate gets the chance to vote. But voters will, as usual, stay away from the polls in droves.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The voters' apathy is rational. Local government has little discretion over spending, and less over money-raising. These days, 80% of local government's money comes from central government, and its total spending is capped. The important battles are not about the council tax, but the backroom battles of the sort that Cornwall and the Isle of Wight have recently won.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some &#163;40 billion (13% of government spending and 5.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>) is allocated by a nine-month process. It starts in the first week of March to determine the Standard Spending Assessments (<font size=-1>SSA</font>s), the government's estimate of how much a council needs to spend. (<a href="br1.gif">See chart</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Needs are assessed according to an area's social, demographic and geographical characteristics. The more children an area has, for instance, the higher its educational needs will be. Equalisation, however, does not stop there. Some children appear to be more expensive to educate than others. Using past spending patterns, civil servants try to work out why this is so. Their conclusion is that more poor, unemployed, lone parents, ethnic minorities and a thinly-spread population put the bills up; so Tower Hamlets' <font size=-1>SSA</font> per head for education in 1996-97 is &#163;720 and Kensington and Chelsea's is &#163;226. Whitehall goes even further in its pursuit of fairness. The mathematics show that children "at risk" in some areas cost more than others; so a child "at risk" in Lambeth will have more money allocated to it than one in Cambridge.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such conclusions worry some: does past spending really say much about an area's need, or is it picking up other factors? In other words, does the higher cost of educating a child in a poorer area tell you that the child has greater needs or that its local authority is inefficient? Is the system rewarding failure?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The capping of local-authority spending, which started in the mid-1980s, complicates such calculations even further. These assume that past spending is an expression of an area's needs; but, increasingly, past spending has been determined by central-government fiat, which limits its usefulness as an indicator.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As well as being flawed, the system is obscure. It is, according to the Audit Commission, the most complex in the world, save possibly that used in Australia. Nobody knows how many variables it employs. Civil servants admit that the struggle to make it comprehensible has been lost.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It gets worse as time goes by. Councils argue constantly for extra factors to be taken into account that might shift cash in their direction; and they all employ consultants to make their case to ministers. Local authorities gang up to put a common case. A band of councils in South Yorkshire and Lancashire have won a long campaign to include a long-term sickness indicator to shift cash in their direction. Some pretty areas have managed to get a National Park indicator included in the calculations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest recent battle has been that between the south-east and the rest of England about what level of compensation the region should get to make up for its higher costs. The government has now set up a commission to settle the argument. The level of distrust between the two English camps is such that the commission is staffed by Scotsmen and one Ulsterman. It sounds a small matter, but the argument is about &#163;1.5 billion.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more variables are fed into the system, the more unmanageable it becomes. Once every few years, the system's minders admit that it has imploded. They then throw it away and start again, trying to build something that they can cope with. The system was last rebuilt in 1989. The current one is, true to form, showing signs of breaking down.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Civil servants justify the system's complexity by arguing that to be fair, it must be sensitive; and to be sensitive, it must be complex. To count the heads of school-age children, the argument goes, is to ignore the greater needs of some. Yet the "fairness" of the system seems somewhat arbitrary. Wales calculates its <font size=-1>SSA</font>s differently to England; when the Audit Commission recalculated English <font size=-1>SSA</font>s on the Welsh basis, it got results of up to 27% more and 36% less than the councils' actual allocations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyway, handing out more money per child to a county whose average incomes are low does not necessarily help poor children as much as Whitehall mandarins claim. As the illustration from Berkshire's education spending shows (on the previous page), local authorities tend to spend similar amounts on educating all their children, rich and poor alike, ignoring central government's careful calculations of need.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some argue that the problem is philosophical rather than practical: that the struggle to create a mathematical model of fairness is misconceived, because it cannot be objectively measured. "We have," says Martin Pilgrim of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, "an immensely sophisticated system to measure something which is not measurable."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The struggle for fairness has combined with the government's centralising tendencies to produce a system that looks nothing like democracy. Tony Travers, a local government specialist at the London School of Economics, points out the irony that this bureaucratic, egalitarian system should have triumphed under a Conservative government. "It is," he says, "as centralised as anything Eastern Europe ever produced."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is bothered enough about the system's problems to have asked the Institute for Fiscal Studies to examine its mathematics. But--as Labour accepts--bolder reform is needed: radical simplification to make the system understandable and a shift of money-raising powers back to local government to make it accountable. Until then, Britain's system of local-authority finance will stand as a monument to bad government and will contribute little to local democracy.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br3.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>Welshing on devolution</h1>

<p>IT WOULD be nice to think that the new powers for local government in Wales announced by William Hague, the Welsh secretary, in a Commons debate on February 29th, represented a belated Tory conversion to the merits of local democracy. It would be nice but it would be wrong. Mr Hague's proposals are really aimed at embarrassing Labour over its plans for a new Welsh assembly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his speech, Mr Hague proposed to transfer &#163;35m of funds for miscellaneous economic and social-development projects from his Welsh Office to local government. Local councils will also get control of &#163;364m of <font size=-1>EU</font> structural funds going to Wales. In future this will be handled by an independent executive controlled by the local authorities, rather than the Welsh Office.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These measures follow his announcement in November of a bigger role for the Welsh grand committee of <font size=-1>MP</font>s. It will be able to question ministers and will hold half its meetings in Wales.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both measures are designed to take the steam out of Labour's commitment to Welsh devolution. In Scotland, where most attention on Labour's devolution plans has been focused, most Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s are strongly for an assembly. But Labour's 27 Welsh <font size=-1>MP</font>s range between enthusiasts for a powerful Welsh assembly and those who would rather not have one at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recently Labour has built a fragile unity around a plan devised by Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary. He proposes an assembly that would not have legislative or tax-raising powers, but to which the Welsh Office and Welsh quangos would be accountable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In opposing those plans, Mr Hague hopes to make an ally of Welsh local councils. The most powerful of these, including Cardiff, are Labour-controlled. Local councillors are nervous that a new Welsh assembly would erode their responsibilities. By giving councils more power, Mr Hague hopes to convince them to criticise Labour's plans, rekindling the dissent in Labour's ranks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tory share of the Welsh vote has halved since the 1992 general election, according to recent public-opinion surveys by <font size=-1>MORI</font>, a polling firm. All six Tory seats in the province are at risk. As Welsh opinion is divided about devolution, opposing it may be a clever political move.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, with only one in seven Welsh voters now saying they will vote Tory--even fewer than in Scotland--the Tories face a difficulty. How much longer can they project themselves as the party of the union, when they have almost disappeared as a political force in three of the United Kingdom's four countries?

<p><b>Policing</b></p>
<h1>Downbeat</h1>


<p>SICK leave is a reasonable indicator of unhappiness with a job. So it is fair to conclude that, with sick leave among police forces ranging up to 20 days per officer per year, and patrol officers the sickest of the lot, that the bobby on the beat is none too happy these days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is one of the central problems of modern policing. Patrol policing is what the public wants; it satisfies some of the fastest-growing demands on police forces; it fits in with modern trends in crime-prevention. But policemen do not like it. A report published by the Audit Commission on February 29th, and one by the Police Federation a week earlier, both address the problem, but offer different solutions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around 60% of police officers are patrol constables. The gloom that pervades their ranks was illustrated by a survey in 1995. Nearly two-thirds described their morale as "not very" or "not at all" high; only a third wanted to go on being a patrol officer. Part of the problem is that the work is out of doors, around the clock and physically risky. But it is also one of those ancient institutional facts that other policemen look down on patrol officers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The public, by contrast, cannot get enough of them. On balance, people are satisfied with almost everything the police do, according to polls: from responding to emergencies (68% net satisfaction; that is, satisfied minus dissatisfied) to preventing crime (18% net satisfaction). But they are not at all satisfied with the number of patrol officers (net satisfaction: minus 20%).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Police forces have justified failing to satisfy this demand for more bobbies on the beat by arguing that patrols contribute little to the police's main job, which is catching criminals. But both strands of this argument are questionable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Catching criminals is nowadays a smaller part of what people ask the police to do. Increasingly, the police are summoned to deal with neighbourhood disputes of the sort that tighter communities once settled for themselves. Patrol officers who know their areas are better-equipped to do this than are emergency response teams. Also, police forces are nowadays trying new ways to tackle crime--and officers on patrol may make these methods work better. In London, for instance, the Metropolitan Police's successful Operation Bumblebee (against burglars) and Eagle Eye (against muggers) relied on intelligence. Patrol officers who know their beats are good intelligence-collectors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, as the Audit Commission points out, patrolling is held in such low esteem that forces fail to make the best of it. Officers are shifted around so quickly that they never become familiar with their beat. Too often, they are not provided with the information they need to deal with recurring problems. Giving patrol officers the support they need and time to get to know an area, argues the commission, will help the police in their ambition to prevent crime rather than just react to it. And what does the Police Federation recommend? You guessed it: more policemen.

Measured as a proportion of the economy's total output (<a href="br2.gif">see chart</a>), investment has been on a downward trend since 1989. Part of the fall is explained by cuts in the public sector's spending on infrastructure, and by individuals' reluctance to buy houses. But investment by businesses is also weak, as figures published on February 23rd showed. Manufacturing firms' investment during the fourth quarter of 1995 was 9% lower than in the previous quarter and 5% lower than in the same period in 1994.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present this reluctance to plough money into new equipment, offices and factories is all the more puzzling, because incentives to invest seem unusually strong. In principle, investments ought to be worth making when their cost is outweighed by the stockmarket valuation of the extra profits resulting from the investment. According to the Bank of England's estimates, the ratio between these two numbers has been favourable since the end of 1991, and has recently soared to its highest level for more than 25 years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the Bank suggests that the weakness of business investment is not as worrying as it might appear. First, investment is now close to its long-run average following a boom in spending--especially on property--in the late 1980s. Second, Britain's statistics seem to be underestimating the speed at which the cost of investing in computing power is decreasing, as Howard Davies, the Bank's deputy governor, pointed out in a speech on February 21st.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On this, a comparison with America is striking. Its investment statistics are based on a detailed analysis of changes in the efficiency and capacity of computers. They show that between 1985 and 1992 the underlying cost of computers fell by 55%. Britain's official figures, less sophisticated in this area, recorded a fall of only 25%. Britain's investment statistics also fail to record purchases of software bought separately from computer hardware (a shortcoming that will be corrected once Britain adopts new European standards for national accounts some time in the next two years).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The increasing use of information technology to organise production and to predict sales may also be helping firms to make better use of existing capacity, reducing their need to splash out on new equipment. Andrew Sentance of the London Business School points to surveys by the Confederation of British Industry which suggest that manufacturers are now comfortable with much lower margins of spare capacity than they were in the early 1980s.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br6.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1><center>Voice of America?</center></h1>

THE peasants are coming with pitchforks!" cried Pat Buchanan on the eve of the New Hampshire vote. Peasants? Pitchforks? Why not? Mr Buchanan's America is a medieval land where honest workers toil for pitiful wages, where castles of virtue are besieged by the forces of Tinseltown, where borders must be defended with armed guards, and where foreigners poison the wells. And this Republican candidate has won the New Hampshire primary with 28% of the vote.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is still highly unlikely that he will be the party's nominee. Political parties wish to preserve themselves. The Republicans have only to whisper the name " Goldwater"--just as the Democrats have only to whisper the name "McGovern"--to remember that nominees from the wild fringes of the party spell death at the general election. Failing a late eruption by a party idol, it is likely to be either Bob Dole (second, with 27%) or Lamar Alexander (third, with 23%) who will lead the Republicans against Bill Clinton in November.
</p><p><b>Tapping insecurity</b>
<br><ro>On the other hand, nothing is certain. The race is now wide open. And if the organisation is on Mr Dole's side, and a bit of momentum on Mr Alexander's, all the passion is on Pat's. He is a natural orator. His supporters adore him. He runs a clever grass-roots campaign based on small contributors and free radio time. He taps deep into some dismayingly widespread and long-lived American opinions--isolationism, protectionism, thinly-veiled racism; and into some more reasonable, and more widespread, anxieties. That is what makes him dangerous. In Mr Buchanan's topsy-turvy world, the right is so far right that it becomes the left: government once again becomes the arbiter of both morals and markets. But that philosophy has its attractions in eras of unsettling change. He plays them for all they are worth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In doing so, Mr Buchanan has opened with axe-blows the cracks which the Republican party, for eight years, has been delicately papering over. Is the party the voice of the religious right, stoutly opposed to abortion, homosexuality and all that could be called "liberal"? Or can it speak for the confused but tolerant majority? Is it the party of free-trade, or tariffs? Internationalist, or vowing to keep American boys and American aid safely at home? And, most important of all, is it a forward-looking party of reform, limited government and faith in the market, or one that, in the name of conservatism, demands a stronger and more intrusive state?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan's share of the vote was not large. More than 70% of New Hampshire's registered Republicans, who are a particularly rebellious and conservative lot, preferred somebody else. But it was a victory, all the same, and not simply the by-product of Mr Dole's failings. Mr Buchanan's appeal runs deep and the Buchananite side of the party should not be underrated. It includes, potentially, everyone who feels battered by the new economy, baffled by the Internet, nostalgic for Main Street, resentful of foreigners. According to opinion polls, fully one-third of American workers are worried that someone in their family will be laid off next year, and half are worried that their income will not meet expenses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The economic indicators, to be sure, should put these worries in perspective. America created nearly 8m jobs last year, and the "misery index"--inflation (2.5%) plus unemployment (5.8%)--is at its lowest for almost three decades. But ordinary workers seem more impressed by the fact that the actual purchasing power of wages has stayed flat for 10-15 years; and that flagship corporations such as <font size=-1>AT&T</font> have recently laid off workers in the tens of thousands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of these people voted for Ross Perot four years ago, although Mr Perot's eccentric authoritarianism took the form of a war on lobbyists and big government. Some of them voted for Bill Clinton, who always understood economic insecurity better than George Bush did. The Republicans need all these voters back in order to win in November. Here lies Mr Buchanan's threat: he can get their attention better than anyone else can. And, in the process, he can tug the whole campaign in his direction. It has happened already. The debate over tax reform, a good thing in itself, was quickly turned into a competition among the candidates to offer the largest tax cut, in airy disregard for the effect this would have on the deficit. And the debate over economic policy soon foundered in a morass of populist rhetoric against big corporations, with even Mr Dole declaring at last that the Republicans would henceforth be "the party of Main Street, not Wall Street"--whatever that meant.
</p><p><b>Fear of change</b>
<br><ro>This does not sound like the brave new Republican Party that was meant to have swept the country in November 1994, bringing with it irresistible notions of leaner government, citizen empowerment and a new high-tech American century. And it is not. That election was a revolution in the minds of a few, who erroneously read a mandate in it for full-scale reform of government. The mass of voters meant merely to send an anti-establishment, anti-Washington message. That message can also be heard in Mr Buchanan's speeches, half-buried in passionate cant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Newt Gingrich and his followers have yet to persuade the mass of Republican voters that economic change, and the freer operation of the market, can be exciting rather than frightening. And although the desirability of smaller, more efficient government is generally accepted, the loss of a particular federal pay-cheque or safety net is not. The Gingrich wing of the party, in fact, may be even less representative of the mass of Republican voters than the Buchanan wing. No candidate this year has even mentioned the "Contract with America" , or indeed made the case for a balanced budget. The candidates sense that this year Republican voters want no one so much as Ronald Reagan: charm, effortless leadership, low taxes, a full complement of federal services, and a budget deficit into the trillions of dollars.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who will be brave enough to puncture the Reaganite dream, while blocking the Buchanan nightmare? Mr Dole has the courage, and the battlefield experience in Congress; but he has no new ideas, and none of that essential confidence in the future that used to typify his party. Mr Alexander is light on both experience and personality, but, alone among the candidates, he has kept some of the flame of 1994 alive; he believes in the devolution of power from Washington to the states, the downsizing of government and the central importance of education in getting and keeping jobs. All this has been fuzzily expressed so far. Sharpened up, it could be an antidote to Mr Buchanan. The Republicans certainly need to find one, and fast.

<h2>Impasse</h2>
<p>The <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s <b>bombing campaign </b>continued with an explosion that destroyed a double-decker bus in central London, killing the bomber and injuring eight other people. The British and Irish governments failed to agree on a formula for starting all-party political talks over Northern Ireland's future.<p>About a million people in Madrid, together with the prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, and other politicians, demonstrated against violence by terrorists of the <b>Basque nationalist group</b>, <font size=-1>ETA</font>, who have carried out several murders in the run-up to a general election being held on March 3rd.<p>President Jacques Chirac proposed a drastic shake-up of France's mainly <b>conscript armed forces</b>, which may become all-voluntary by 2001.<p><b>Bosnia's Serbs </b>agreedafter talks in Rome to restore relations with <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s peace implementation force, Ifor. Days later, progress was slow, and the Bosnian city of Mostar stayed divided between Croats and Muslims, despite an agreement in Rome that the division would end.<p>The <font size=-1>IMF</font> gave a vote of confidence in <b>Russia's reforms</b> by agreeing to a $10 billion loan. It will be disbursed over three years; $4 billion could be paid this year alone. But the Fund's conditions are tough: monthly inflation below 1% by the end of 1996, and a budget deficit no<p>bigger than 4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>.<p>A coalition <b>government in Turkey</b> seemed increasingly likely as leaders of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party and the secular, right-wing Motherland Party sorted out who would be prime minister first. Haggling continued over how the other ministries should be shared out.<p>After six days stranded off the west coast of Wales, the <i>Sea Empress</i> was at last towed off the rocks. But the <b>oil tanker </b>had already leaked half its 135,000-tonne load of crude oil, one of the half-dozen worst spillages ever.<p><ro>
<h2>Feeling high</h2>
<p><b>Pat Buchanan</b>, fire-breathing populist, won the New Hampshire Republicans' primary; ex-top-dog Bob Dole came second; Lamar Alexander, would-be new top dog, third. Mr Alexander said Mr Dole should quit the race because he was out of ideas; Mr Dole said Mr Alexander should quit because he was out of money. Bill Clinton easily won the Democrats' vote. Now on to Arizona and the South.<p>A survey of <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> showed that their use among American teenagers is rising; that only 36% of teenagers admit to being frightened of drugs (47% last year); and that an increasing number say " being high feels good".<p>In <b>Cuba</b>, the government banned a planned meeting of the pro-democracy Concilio Cubano and arrested many activists.<p><ro>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Back to the fold</h2>
<b>Saddam Hussein's</b> two sons-in-law returned with their wives to Iraq from their brief self-exile in Jordan. Iraq's opposition-in-exile had decided the men had too much blood on their hands to be acceptable; and Mr Hussein had offered pardon.<p>Iraqi and <font size=-1>UN</font> envoys finished their first technical negotiation on an <b>oil-for-food deal</b>.Mr Hussein now has to decide whether to press on.<p>Israel's Labour Party narrowly defeated a Likud proposal that would have made a change to <b>Jerusalem's</b> current status virtually impossible. This did not mean, insisted Labour, that it would actually allow any change.<p><b>Qatar</b> said it had foiled an armed bid to reinstate its ex-ruler, ousted by his son, the present ruler, while he was on a visit to Switzerland last June.<p>Saudi Arabia's <b>King Fahd</b> took back the powers he had passed to Prince Abdullah.<p><b>Zaire's</b> government said it would take fresh steps to get rid of Rwandan refugees, accusing Rwanda's government of reluctance to help.<p>The <font size=-1>UN</font> tribunal on genocide has indicted two <b>Rwandan Hutus</b>. The two, a former militia leader and a mayor, have been held in Zambian jails since their arrest last year at the request of the tribunal.<p>The <font size=-1>UN</font> expressed alarm at goings-on in <b>Somalia</b>. New food shortages look likely and politics remains chaotic.<p><ro>
<h2>More ministers go</h2>
As <b>India's bribery scandal </b>continued to widen, four more government ministers resigned; three others had quit earlier. They are among more than 100 government and opposition politicians and civil servants whose names appear in the diary of a currency dealer charged with money-laundering.<p>The Philippine government claimed that <b>Chinese navy maps </b>were found in a pirate ship after a gun battle. Piracy in the South China Sea has been blamed on "rogue units" of the Chinese navy.<p>The ruling <b>Bangladesh </b>Nationalist Party won most parliamentary seats in a general election. But, deterred by an opposition boycott and a general strike, only about 15% of the electorate voted.<p>America is offering to move part of its air base in <b>Okinawa </b>to another site in Japan. Okinawa's local government had asked the Americans to leave, following the rape of a Japanese girl by American soldiers.<p><ro>
<h2>Happy holidays</h2>
<p>A coincidence of Chinese new year (it's the year of the rat), Carnival, and the end of Ramadan probably meant that a record number of people were on <b>holiday </b>at some point this week. A rough <i>Economist </i>estimate puts the figure at at least 3 billion.<p><p>

It said that in the nine months to December pre-tax profits, minus exceptionals, rose 29% to &#163;429m ($680m). The music side, largely <font size=-1>EMI</font>, a big record company, is valued after the demerger at &#163;5.8 billion; Thorn, which includes America's Rent-a-Center network and Britain's Radio Rentals, at &#163;1.8 billion.<p><b>CompuServe</b>'s parent is to spin off the successful on-line computer service mainly to shareholders, with less than 20% being offered to the public. Some of <font size=-1>H&R</font> Block's shareholders reckon the value of CompuServe--4.3m subscribers and growing--is not showing up in its parent's share price.<p><b>CUC International</b>, a big American consumer marketing group, is broadening its range in the electronic marketplace, where last year it launched Shoppers Advantage on the Internet, to include education and games. Now it is spending $2.2 billion to buy Davidson &amp; Associates, a maker of educational and entertainment software, and Sierra On-Line, a computer-games software firm.<p>Britain's <b>Grand Metropolitan </b>is bringing in an American to take charge of its poorly performing drinks division.

<h2>State aids</h2>
<p>Germany's largest shipbuilder, <b>Bremer Vulkan</b>, which is likely to declare a loss of DM1 billion ($700m) for 1995, sought protection from creditors in order to avoid bankruptcy. Its woes mounted when the European Commission found that DM600m meant for improving Bremer Vulkan's east German yards had been used elsewhere in the group, and demanded that the money be returned to its original purpose. Around 23,000 jobs are at risk.<p>In a shake-up at a leading Swedish bank controlled by the powerful Wallenberg family, Peter Wallenberg and two other directors are to step down from <b>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken</b> in April.

Despite central-bank intervention, the <b>South African rand </b>plunged to a record low of 4.03 to the dollar before pulling back slightly.

But with <b>Eurotunnel </b>poised to renegotiate its vast burden of debt, the bank, which has some &#163;250m in outstanding loans to the Channel tunnel operator, took a &#163;101m bad-debt provision, widely assumed to relate to loans to Eurotunnel.<p><p>(<a href="wtwimg2.gif">See chart</a>)<br>Two French mammoths returned to profit. <b>Groupe Bull</b>, a computer maker, made money for the first time in years, recording a net profit of FFr306m ($61.4m) in 1995 after a 1994 loss of FFr1.96 billion.

<h1>Fresh light on primary colours</h1>
<p><b>Pat Buchanan, a right-wing populist, won the New Hampshire primary. Is the system of presidential primaries good for American democracy?</b></p>

EVERY four years, candidates hoping to stand for the American presidency can be found shivering outside factory gates in the New Hampshire snow, fondling pigs in Iowa or joining old folks' singalongs in Florida. By performing such antics, state by wearying state, they hope to attract delegates to their cause and hence earn the Republican or Democratic presidential nomination at a party convention in August.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's primary season, which began this week in New Hampshire, is a bizarre ritual to brave in preparation for the most powerful job in the world. No other country has anything like it. A British Conservative is chosen to lead his party by an old-boy club of other members of parliament. Candidates for the German chancellery are picked before each election by a conference of party members, but there are no elections to the conference nor are delegates mandated to vote for particular candidates. The French and Russian candidates must win some support from voters first: in France they need the backing of 500 elected officials (such as mayors); in Russia, they must collect a million signatures; otherwise, candidates choose themselves by offering their candidacy directly to the electorate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No big democracy has America's combination of mass voting and a party slate. (Last year, France's Gaullist party thought about holding primaries but abandoned the idea because it could not decide who should vote, or who would foot the bill.) No big democracy forces incumbents to defend themselves so vigorously against rivals in their own party. No other country permits waves of popular opinion to determine who represents parties to voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The features which make the American primary system so distinctive are controversial. Critics condemn the primaries as a chaotic and degrading way of winnowing out candidates; so degrading, they claim, that it puts off well-qualified people. The process, they add, pushes peculiar states such as New Hampshire to prominence while ignoring larger, more representative ones. It undermines the moderating influence of party elders and, because of low turnouts, leaves politics vulnerable to extremists, producing presidential candidates supported by sectional interests rather than the mass of ordinary voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor, say critics, is the system as democratic as it once was; big money plays an increasing (and, in their view, distorting) role. The sheer number of primaries means the election campaign drags on and on, producing voter fatigue long before the poll that really matters in November. Above all, the critics claim, the primary system damages the eventual nominee because he must endure months of bitter public criticism from his own side before he ever faces opponents from the other. This not only weakens him as a candidate but also damages his party by magnifying divisions that might otherwise lie dormant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supporters of the primary system reply that this supposedly chaotic and degrading system goes with the grain of American democracy, with all its populism and egalitarianism. It allows ordinary Americans to pick not just their representatives but their candidates, too. And not just to pick them: to talk to them, impress their worries on them, see them break a sweat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, say the system's supporters, primaries work better than you might expect. Though they appear, at the early stages, to be vulnerable to extremists, they usually deliver, at the end of a long procedure, nominees who are widely known and widely approved of. The primary ritual means that voters judge candidates on performance; so, while money matters, it is not everything. Primaries are less corrupt than their alternatives. If they are exhausting (which they are), then that is no bad way to discern which candidates have the stamina to do the world's most demanding job. And if they are chaotic and parochial (which they also are), that is the nature of democracy in a country as sprawling and headstrong as America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So who is right? Are primaries, on balance, helping or harming American democracy? And are they getting better or worse at what they do? The trail of discovery is as long and winding as the campaign trail itself.
</p><p><b>Against conventional wisdom</b></b>
<br>The primary system was set up in response to dissatisfaction with the smoke-filled rooms of old. Before the early years of this century, you cultivated party bosses and their friends in big business; they pushed you, if you were lucky, to the presidency. Deals were done in back rooms; no need to consult the plebs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first modern-looking primary was held in Oregon in 1910. By 1916, after Teddy Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party had challenged the Republican establishment (in an uprising which eventually earned Roosevelt the largest number of votes for a third party until Ross Perot in 1992), 26 states had introduced primaries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the next half century, there was little change. In 1968, more than half the votes cast by delegates at the famously anarchic Democratic convention in Chicago were still controlled by party bosses. But now 39 states have primaries, and they have become the essential first stage in the American electoral process. Even unopposed incumbents, such as Bill Clinton this year, must dutifully slog through them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first effect of the extension of the primary system has been to reduce the role of the party convention, once the crucial first step in the election campaign. In the past, party conventions were places where delegates were (sometimes literally) fought over. Now, the primaries produce the nominee, and the convention merely crowns him. Bill Clinton attracted 2,511 delegates during the 1992 primary season, 366 more than he needed. George Bush, for the Republicans, got 80% of the delegates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actually, conventions may not always be redundant even now. In 1980 there was a wild attempt to draft Senator Edward Kennedy at the Democratic convention, even though he had lost to Jimmy Carter in the primaries. And many a Republican has been dreaming of a scene this year in which Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander go to the convention with equal numbers of delegates, and the deadlock is broken by the arrival of the <font size=-1>US</font> cavalry in the form of General Colin Powell, riding triumphantly to nomination. But even in such a case, the primaries would still have served a purpose, showing that, in the end, no candidate was sufficiently appealing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the most part, however, the days of arm-twisting brokered conventions are gone. No longer are groups of delegates " floating" or "for sale". No longer will conventions go on, as did the 1924 Democratic one, for 17 days and an amazing 103 ballots. The disappearance of such spectacles, though reducing the entertainment value of politics, has made the process of picking candidates more open and democratic, and somewhat more predictable. Whatever else might be said against the primary system, this achievement at least should be chalked up to its credit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, say the system's critics, even if the convention system was bad, it is still wrong to pretend that it has been replaced by a nationwide campaign of 39 primaries. In reality, conventions have been largely replaced by just one or two primary polls--and pretty peculiar ones at that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Think back over the careers of America's most famous modern politicians, and a surprising number will be found to have been made, or broken, in a couple of cold weeks at the beginning of February. In the 1952 New Hampshire primary, Dwight Eisenhower defeated Robert Taft, marking the first time a primary had shown its potential to upset a candidate anointed by party bosses; in the Democratic poll that same day, Harry Truman was defeated, and decided not to stand for re-election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1968, Lyndon Johnson abandoned hopes of re-election after almost losing the 1968 New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy, an anti-Vietnam campaigner. In the same state in 1972, Ed Muskie stood weeping on a flat-bed truck with the snow whitening his hair; his defeat led directly to the rise of George McGovern, another anti-Vietnam-war candidate whose radical programme alienated voters and returned Nixon to power. In 1968, the Republicans suffered a comparable fate when Barry Goldwater came from the far right of the party to capture the nomination after doing unexpectedly well in New Hampshire. In short, as "Primary Colours", the anonymous novel that is now Washington <font size=-1>DC</font>'s favourite bedside reading, puts it: "Folks up here [New Hampshire] don't mess around. They think it's their patriotic duty to choose a president for all the rest of us pathetic redneck shitheels."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extraordinary influence of New Hampshire is controversial. No state may be called typical of America, but New Hampshire seems even less representative than most. It is small-town and relatively rural; it is strongly conservative, and has fewer taxes than almost any other state. Issues that catch fire there (this year, the flat tax) may give no thrill to westerners or southerners. And the state has a strong rebellious streak: it likes to make up its mind late, confound the wise, and go for outsiders. Party leaders view it with trepidation. Is this a good place to invest with such influence?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actually, its power is overstated. Defeat there will not necessarily sink a well-prepared candidate with a good track record. Mr Clinton was beaten in New Hampshire by Paul Tsongas, a senator from Massachusetts; but because he clung on despite revelations of dalliance and draft-dodging, he did well enough to sweep his native South in the next set of primaries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conversely, a candidate who has not done his homework, has not raised enough money, is lackadaisical or prone to gaffes, will find his weakness glaringly exposed. This would happen anywhere, and is not connected with any issues or ideology that New Hampshire happens to favour. It is a matter of organisation and a man's internal fortitude: that "fire in the belly" that candidates love to talk about.
</p><p><b>Vote early, vote often</b>
<br><ro>That said, in so far as New Hampshire gets the campaign off to a peculiar start, the peculiarity is growing. Ironically, this is occurring as a result of attempts by other states to share New Hampshire's limelight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because early votes are vital, Arizona and Delaware have moved their primaries up to February, though New Hampshire has kept pole position. "Caucuses" (soundings of party members, as in Louisiana on February 6th), or "straw polls" (presidential preference votes, not attached to winning delegates, as in Alaska on January 29th) have been invented to steal a march on New Hampshire. Victory in both votes helped give Mr Buchanan momentum.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More significantly, other states have advanced the dates of their primaries to follow soon after New Hampshire's and this so-called "front-loading" of the calendar is the most important single change to the American primary system in recent years. It has so compressed the primary schedule--at least in the biggest and delegate-heavy states--that, by April Fool's Day, almost all the delegates will have been selected. The vital primaries now come so thick and fast that there is no chance to pause or regroup between them. So if you do badly in New Hampshire, there is less time to recoup lost ground. Just as important, the influence of money has grown.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Traditionally, the joy of New Hampshire was that it required "retail politics": knocking on doors, talking to the people. This sort of campaigning is relatively inexpensive and allows lesser-known, poorer candidates to perform on an equal footing with better-known, richer ones. The bigger, money-devouring states (especially California, where campaigning has to be done on television), used to be further down the calendar, allowing more chance for underdogs to gather funds on the back of respectable performances elsewhere. Now California (on March 26th) comes barely a month after New Hampshire; and a man without at least $5m to spend simply cannot make the running there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This reduction in the role of "retail politics" seems a discouraging development because it is a step away from the face-to-face characteristics that admirers of primaries claim to be one of the system's main virtues. It might also prevent poor candidates from entering the race at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the first argument is odd. Face-to-face meetings are a way of getting information about candidates. Now, television is usurping that role. Television may provide different sorts of information and may be susceptible to manipulation, but it surely adds hugely to the volume of information about candidates. The second worry seems not to be justified either. This year's Republican field is as big as ever. There were ten hopefuls at the start, including six no-hopers. The compression of the primaries may have put off more cerebral types--Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and conceivably Colin Powell; but the truth seems to be that if people really want the job, they will run despite the indignities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The real importance of money in the primaries is, in any case, debatable. To get that vital early boost, Steve Forbes, a billionaire, spent $15m of his own money. To counter him, Mr Dole diverted $1.8m from campaigning funds for the south and west. Both did badly in New Hampshire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A large wad of money is clearly vital. But a deluge of money for advertising does not seem to be cost-effective. That said, the ever-larger sums spent on primaries may hurt the system in one way. Every candidate this year has been drawn into a spiral of early spending. This means that some will fall out sooner than they might otherwise have done and the survivor will limp, short of cash, into the main election campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the final accusation: that primaries are liable to throw up candidates who cannot win a nationwide election? Mr Buchanan's success gives Republican managers cause to worry for just this reason.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Primaries generally get a low (and declining) turnout. In 1992, the average for all primaries was 30% of registered voters. Among that low share will be disproportionate numbers of single-issue or fringe voters. The religious right has dogged the Republican primary trial this year, hence the surge for Mr Buchanan, even though his message--anti-immigrant, protectionist, anti-abortion, anti-gay--is not one most "ordinary" Republicans support. Hence, too, the drift to the right among moderate rivals chasing him for delegates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Embarrassing as this may be for party bosses, they are not powerless in the face of it. The Democrats, especially, have fiddled with the rules since the 1970s in an attempt to avoid the nomination of unelectable "liberals" such as Mr McGovern or Walter Mondale, Jimmy Carter's vice-president. In 1984 they changed many of their primaries to caucuses, which are easier for party elders to control. In 1992, when they had a more moderate candidate in Mr Clinton, they changed the rules back again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tinkering does not always work. In 1988 southern Democrats invented (and the Republicans quickly copied) the idea of a southern regional primary, "Super Tuesday", which was meant to block the path of a liberal north-easterner (Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts) in favour of a southern conservative, Al Gore of Tennessee. In the event, Mr Gore failed, and Mr Dukakis went on to lose the general election. But though the intervention of party elders can backfire, the front-loading of the primary calendar has helped them in their struggle to influence the primaries. The system now demands ever-earlier and better organisation, so the anointing power of parties has become more important. Mr Clinton in 1992 and (for what it is worth) Mr Dole in 1996 both went into the primary season with the weight of their parties behind them. In previous seasons, such backing would have waited until the convention. Now the elders dare not wait so long.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In San Diego in August, during the party convention, the Republican National Committee has promised to review this year's primary season to see if it can be "improved"--presumably in ways the elders approve of. What might these improvements be? Regional primaries have become popular: not only Super Tuesday (this year, on March 12th) but also a "Yankee primary" of the New England states (New Hampshire excepted) on March 5th. Regional primaries might help the party give a favourite son a boost on his home turf (though, as Mr Gore found, there is no guarantee of this).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One last suggestion is sometimes heard: a national primary, in which registered voters of all parties could vote on a single day. Such a primary would require an orgy of nationwide televised advertising by all candidates lasting for months. And, since the sums available from public finances would not go far in such conditions, a national primary would tie the fates of candidates to the party bosses almost as tightly as in the old days.
</p><p><b>In their primary?</b></b>
<br>In the end, then, the primary system looks likely to survive in something like its current form. States like it; potent myths of democracy surround it. Nor are these merely myths. Primaries force candidates to give an account of themselves in the flesh, to listen to what worries voters (which is not always what politicians think) and to see the country they wish to represent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a way of picking candidates, primaries may be less efficient than the smoke-filled chambers of old. But because they are less corruptible, the result is more likely to be accepted. Even if they produce a maverick--if, say, they deliver Mr Buchanan to the hustings--that would not necessarily be reason for saying the system is rotten; rather, it is grounds for saying the system is reflecting a substantial part of public opinion and that those who disapprove need to respond with their own voting power. It is their very democratic qualities that make the primaries such a struggle, torment and mess. And this uncomfortable trade-off, in primary elections as in so much else, is one America will simply have to live with.

<h1>Digesting New Hampshire</h1>
<p><font size=1>MANCHESTER</font></p>BOB LEVINE and Craig Benson are a classic American success story. They started their computer-networking business in a garage 13 years ago. Since then, Cabletron Systems has grown into a company with 5,600 employees and an annual revenue of more than $1 billion, 29% of it earned abroad. " Free trade is the best thing that ever happened to this company," Mr Benson told a rally for Bob Dole at Cabletron's factory in Rochester on the day before the New Hampshire primary. "We're not afraid to kick anybody's ass around the world."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What better setting for Mr Dole to contrast his view of the economy with Pat Buchanan's protectionism? But he blew it. "I didn't realise that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days of this campaign," the Senate majority leader admitted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression that Mr Dole is hopelessly out of touch with the real world helps to explain his failure in New Hampshire on February 20th. Not only was he unable to squash the challenge from Lamar Alexander, the ex-governor from Tennessee, who won 23% of the vote, just four points behind him. He also lost to Mr Buchanan, despite support from almost the entire New Hampshire Republican establishment. The Dole people blame the damage done by millions of dollars of negative advertisements from Steve Forbes, who hurt Mr Dole without helping himself (the flat-tax fanatic finished fourth, with 12% of the vote). But the bigger problem was Mr Dole's inability to generate any real enthusiasm about his candidacy--in stark contrast to the raw energy of the Buchanan campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan has few assets save his fame as a televised political pugilist and the fire of his words. He writes his own advertisements, his sister manages his campaign, an army of volunteers man his phone banks. He visibly loves every minute of it, as well he might. In the past three weeks he has won in Alaska, won in Louisiana, come a strong second in Iowa and now stormed to victory in New Hampshire, with 28% of the vote. The barons of the Republican establishment are in a panic, he told a rally in Nashua last Sunday; the peasants are coming.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However far the Buchanan insurgency goes, it has already shown that many Americans are still anxious and angry, even in successful New Hampshire, where unemployment is down to 3.3%. Mr Buchanan's hatred of trade agreements such as <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and <font size=-1>GATT</font>, and his fusillades against transnational corporations "with no loyalty to our country", resonate with blue-collar workers and, especially, with those earning under $30,000 a year. He excites nationalists with his rhetoric about America's sovereignty. Add to that his Catholic fundamentalism, and you have a potent mix.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His devoted followers give the impression that they would jump over a cliff for Pat. Unlike the other candidates, they explain, he is honest and speaks from the heart, a real leader. At their packed victory celebration, amid the chanting, the drinking and the rocking-and-rolling, a construction worker called Eric, wearing Barry Goldwater and George Wallace buttons as well as his "Buchanan for President" badge, describes how he is sick of being told that if you were blue-collar you had to be a Democrat. Jack, an out-of-work pipe-fitter, stressed jobs. "If Japan wants to send a car over here, they've got to buy one. One for one. It's as simple as that."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the populist Mr Buchanan stands for something. He is the only one among the three candidates now seriously in the chase who can plausibly lend his name to an "-ism". "This is a victory for a cause," he told his supporters on Tuesday night, after his out-of-tune rendition of "God Bless America".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is it really a Republican cause? Mr Buchanan's design for a wall round America's economy is at odds with the free-trade mainstream of the party, and closer to the ideas of the Democratic left. His intolerance scares people. If he won the nomination, Republican big-wigs fear they would lose not only the presidential election but the House of Representatives as well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan will almost certainly not win. True, since 1952 the Republican winner in New Hampshire has gone on to the nomination every time except in 1964, when Henry Cabot Lodge took the primary but Barry Goldwater became the Republican nominee. But Mr Buchanan will have trouble expanding much beyond his devoted base of supporters--his share of the vote in New Hampshire was nine points below the 37% he won against President George Bush there four years ago. The stop-Buchanan majority in the party seems certain to prevail in the end.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the majority forces are split. Had Senator Richard Lugar not taken his 5% of the vote in New Hampshire, for example, Mr Dole would probably have won. As it is, although a couple of minor candidates are now withdrawing, the race is turning into a Republican nightmare, with the divisive Mr Buchanan attracting the headlines and the anti-Buchananites fighting among themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How long will the nightmare last? From now on, the nature of the race changes, as it moves on from small-state retail politics to an expensive contest in more than 30 primaries within a month. Going into this frenzy of voting, all three of the main contenders have serious weaknesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan lacks money, he no longer enjoys the element of surprise and, his opponents claim, he has "no end-game". He will also face a surge of media scrutiny and attacks from his rivals. Already, a couple of senior people on his campaign have had their connections to racist groups exposed. In his commentaries over the years Mr Buchanan himself has left a trail of bigotry that invites exploration.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Mr Buchanan, for example, Martin Luther King was "one of the most divisive men in contemporary history". The only people wanting the Gulf war were "the Israeli defence ministry and its amen corner in the United States". The central objection to the flood of illegal immigrants is that "they are not English-speaking white people from Western Europe". Promiscuous homosexuals "appear literally hell-bent on Satanism and suicide". Women are "simply not endowed by nature" with capitalist ambition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Alexander will repeat ad nauseam the contrast between Mr Buchanan's "wrong ideas", Mr Dole's absence of ideas and his own "fresh ideas" (see <A HREF="am3.html">Lexington</a>). But he has emptied his coffers and needs to persuade Republican money-givers to cough up several million dollars in a hurry. His name is not even on the ballot in New York, Pennsylvania and parts of Illinois, making his quest for a majority of delegates that much harder.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which leaves the damaged, derided Mr Dole still--just--the likeliest eventual Republican winner. He has stumbled in New Hampshire, as he did in 1988. But the logistics of the next stage of the campaign favour him. He has $6.5m in the bank and a formidable number of governors working for him in the mainly winner-take-all primaries ahead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if Mr Dole does win by attrition, it will not remove the Buchanan problem for the Republicans. Mr Buchanan is already influencing their agenda and he will be a force to be reckoned with at the party's convention in San Diego. He has once again shown that there is a market in America for populist politics, a market third parties under the likes of Ross Perot and Ralph Nader are eyeing eagerly. All the more reason for one person to be almost as delighted as Mr Buchanan himself with the outcome in New Hampshire: Bill Clinton

<p><b>Mobility in America</b></p>
<h2>Up, down and standing still</h2>


<p>ONE of America's most cherished ideas about itself is that, with enough pluck and hard work, anyone can achieve the ranch-style house with the two-car garage. A whole literature, starting with the Horatio Alger stories, spells out this belief. Yet now Pat Buchanan wins votes by claiming that for ordinary folks this notion of progress is over. Is he right?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans move both up and down the income ladder about as fast as they have in the past. Think of the country as being divided by income into five groups of equal size, with the poorest in the first group and the richest in the fifth. If you keep track of people of working age (between 25 and 55), within five years almost half will have moved up or down by at least one group, according to research by economists at Syracuse University. (<a href="amimg2.gif">See chart</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Syracuse trio have charted these economic mobility rates back to 1970: the results have barely budged. And with a million immigrants a year taking predominantly lower-paid work, those settled in the United States are likely to move up, while newcomers fill the bottom quintile--for a time. Newer figures from the Census Bureau extend the findings into the 1990s. Measuring year-to-year mobility between 1984 and 1992, the agency found that only once, in the recession year of 1990-91, did more families see their incomes fall than see them rise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mobility seems to be highest among middle-income Americans, but it is brisk for poorer ones, too. According to the Census Bureau, only 5% of people were below the poverty line (roughly the bottom 15% of Americans, measured by income) for each month of 1991 and 1992. Almost none of those employed full-time stayed poor for the whole period, a hint that those who get into work are likely to be able to pull themselves up and out of poverty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is it true that the "baby-boomers" (those born between 1946 and 1961) are worse off than their parents were at the same age. A study by the Urban Institute found that in 1989 pre-tax incomes for now-adult baby-boomers were half as high again, adjusted for inflation, as their parents' incomes in 1960. Consumption was 27% higher, and rates of home ownership and unemployment were much the same.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So what are Americans so grumpy about? "I don't know," says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, one of the Syracuse researchers. "The statistical measures look good but the mood of the people is not."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One concern may be inequality. In 1979, America's richest 1% held 22% of the nation's wealth, according to Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University and author of "Top Heavy". By 1992, they held 42%. If you use a different measure that includes the value of consumer durables, pensions and benefits, the difference shrinks considerably, but the trend is still striking--and increasing. At the beginning of the Clinton presidency, the top 5% of earners took in 18.1% of income; now they take in more than 21%, an unprecedented rate of increase. The fact that inequality is increasing and mobility is not explains some of the current unAmerican angst.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So does another figure. Few Americans resent the rich: most want to join them, if they get the chance. But median income, adjusted for inflation, grew only slightly during the 1980s, and fell every year between 1989 and 1993. The median household income is a bit less than it was in 1986. Mobility softens the blow for some: even if median wages are not rising, many individuals have seen their pay packets bulge. But remember that even in the most active quintiles, about 40% stay still.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even here, though, the reality may not be not quite so dismal. Although household income has scarcely risen, the number of households has grown sharply as students, singles and merry widows increasingly choose to live alone. Because families are smaller, the same income per family means more cash per head. And non-wage compensation, which includes pensions, health care and other benefits, has also increased steadily in real terms. Total compensation has therefore risen; but that is not the same as having cash in hand.
</p><p><b>The poverty trap</b></b>
<br>And, even when they work, some Americans cannot keep the wolf from the door. In 1977, 5.9% of workers were poor; by 1993 it was up to 7.4%. The percentage of poor families with children has risen by half, to 12%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two reasons for this. One is the increase in single-parent households. Lone mums, and their children, are the most likely to be poor, and they stay poor longer. This is not a problem the federal government can do much about: if mothers were better at picking fathers, and fathers better at taking care of their children, America would have many fewer children living in poverty. The other reason for the rise in working poverty is that the average hourly wage for the lowest-paid 10% of workers has fallen, in real terms, since 1979. That pushes more into poverty; arguably, it is the price America pays to find jobs, and a start on the ladder, for people with few or no skills. The earned-income tax credit, now under threat from Republicans, means that low-wage workers with children receive more income, but they are still far from joining the middle class.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan may be right to suspect that climbing into the middle class is getting harder. The University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which has tracked the same families since 1968, has found that although 65% of white American men who turned 21 before 1980 had reached middle-class earnings (defined as twice the poverty level) by the age of 30, only 47% of those who turned 21 after 1980 had managed to do so. For blacks, the respective percentages were 29% and 19%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The less educated, it is clear, are finding well-paid jobs harder to come by. For younger people with a high-school diploma or less, only 32% reached the <font size=-1>PSID</font> middle-class standard by the time they were 30; for those who turned 21 before 1980, almost half did. Also using the <font size=-1>PSID</font> data, Greg Duncan of the University of Michigan found that before 1980 more than a third of low-income families joined the middle class over a five-year period; after 1980, only a quarter did.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;White-collar insecurity is another new concern. The effect of corporate "down-sizing" may have been exaggerated, but many middle managers have been hurt. If they wish to re-enter the market, these people generally have to accept lower pay. The average worker re-entering the job market between 1990 and 1992 took a pay cut of around 20%. No feel-good factor there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if things are not getting worse for Americans, they are, at best, improving much more slowly than in the past. Because Americans love progress, this can feel like failure. The chief reason is that the education premium in America is getting bigger, widening income distribution and feeding blue-collar anxiety. America still has its Horatio Alger stories--but these days the heroes start by going to college.

<p><b>LEXINGTON</b></p><table border=6><tr><td>


<h2>The man who keeps on going</h2>

<p>IN THE summer of 1994 Lamar Alexander explained over a quiet dinner in Portland, Maine, how he was putting together the basis for a presidential bid. It was a methodical approach. The former education secretary and two-term Tennessee governor was driving across America to take the national pulse. Once a month he was hosting a televised " Republican Neighbourhood Meeting", narrowcast to party activists nationwide, to build a network of supporters and test his ideas. He sensed that, come 1996, Republicans would be looking for someone of Bill Clinton's generation who was not a Washington insider.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He spent the next 18 months doggedly following his plan--raising money, building an organisation, shaking hands in Iowa and New Hampshire--even though most of the time he was little more than a blip in the polls. Better-known candidates fell by the wayside, but Mr Alexander kept going, like the indefatigable bunny in battery advertisements. Then, this month, the long-promised surge started to happen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having scrambled into the front-running threesome in the Iowa caucuses, this week he found himself surrounded by cameras in New Hampshire, talking to overflowing audiences and emerging with 23% of the votes, only four points behind Bob Dole. Suddenly, the plaid persona who was in danger of becoming a joke is a canny candidate with a plausible chance of becoming president. How has he done it?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has been a triumph of Lamarketing. Mr Alexander identified his niche and packaged himself to perfection. If Lamar were a product on a supermarket shelf, with "NEW!" stamped all over its folksy red-and-black wrapping, it would be the safe-looking brand you turn to after rejecting the stale or risky alternatives. He advertises himself as "a little bit different", an outsider from the "real world", fit (unlike old Bob Dole) to be "the first president of the next century" and capable (unlike any other Republican) of besting slick Bill Clinton in debate. Remember your ABC, he tells voters in his soothing voice and with his telegenic ease: Alexander Beats Clinton.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has a good story to tell of his record as Tennessee's governor; his success in attracting Japanese investment offers a cheerful antidote to Buchananite protectionism. Mr Alexander lacks the spark to fire his audiences, but he warms them with talk of a "rising, shining America", with country music and with his renditions at the piano of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" and "The Tennessee Waltz". As he talks to voters--right hand reaching out, left hand casually in pocket, microphone clipped to his tie, head tilted to express concern and ever ready to smile--he has one underlying message: "Meet Mr Feelgood."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Look inside the packaging, however, and you discover a Lamar who is not quite as advertised. His outsider image, to start with, is phoney. A lawyer, Mr Alexander went to Washington as legislative assistant to Senator Howard Baker, graduated to the Nixon White House and later worked in the Bush cabinet. Now he blasts Washington and calls for the abolition of the Education Department; he was strangely silent on such themes when he was in Washington and running the department he now wants to kill.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His connections helped Mr Alexander to raise his family's net worth from $151,000 in 1978 to perhaps $3m now. With his surge to serious status has come a surge of reporters' interest in his family finances. His wife, Honey, seems to share with Hillary Clinton a talent for turning small investments into large profits--a $320,000 profit, for example, on the $10,000 paid for shares in Whittle Communications. "If anything distinguishes Lamar Alexander's career as a public official," writes Charles Lewis in his gloriously detailed account of the 1996 candidates' finances and friendships, "The Buying of the President" (Avon), "it is how much that career has benefited Lamar Alexander."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Alexander prides himself on running a positive campaign even while he politely trashes Mr Dole. He beams that he is the candidate with new ideas without offering any beyond a broad appeal for a return to civic virtue ("we should demand less from Washington, more from ourselves" ) and a handful of specific proposals that can generously be described as half-baked. He would substitute charitable giving for state welfare, set up a special branch of the armed services to patrol America's borders, agree with America's allies on burden-sharing around the world. But he offers few details. His crispest idea is the one that has the least chance of being approved by any Congress: returning to a citizen-legislature by cutting lawmakers' pay and sending them home to cool their heels for six months of the year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this explains why nice Mr Alexander has his enemies. Journalists now subject him to the scrutiny he avoided in his stealthy rise. The Christian right thinks him a liberal. The libertarian right thinks the revolution is not safe in his slippery hands. Many Republicans want to see Ronald Reagan in their presidential nominee, but in Mr Alexander they see George Bush. Indeed, the Bush network is looming large in the race for the nomination. Texas, where George W. Bush is governor, is up for grabs now that Phil Gramm is out, and brother Jeb runs the party in Florida.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like him or not, Mr Alexander is no longer underestimated. His formidable drive and strategic canniness have already taken him further than most people thought he would go. But, to go even further, he needs to raise big money, fast, and he must start winning primaries rather than coming in a feisty third. In the words of a song performed by a Nashville artist at Mr Alexander's rally in Derry last Sunday:<ul><font size=-1>It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart.</font></ul>

<p><b>The poor</b></p>
<h2>Consumers like the rest of us</h2>



<p>THE most wounding accusation made against Britain's Conservative era is that, while yuppies have benefited from rising salaries and cheaper cappuccino, poorer Britons have seen their standard of living deteriorate. Critics claim that social and economic disparities are greater in Britain than anywhere else in the European Union. Today, among similarly prosperous nations, Britain is uniquely harsh on its less-fortunate citizens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is simply not the case, according to an analysis of household statistics in six western countries (America, Belgium, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden) by the Luxembourg Income Study (<font size=-1>LIS</font>), an independent research organisation. The 20% of households in Britain with the lowest income fit well within the European fold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1991, for example, the average working British household in the lowest fifth earned the equivalent of $14,773, or &#163;8,349 (before tax, after benefits, and based on purchasing power parity, which adjusts for exchange-rate distortions). This put poor Britons ahead of their counterparts in Sweden and America (calculating the same way); those in the Netherlands had the highest incomes, at $15,932. Non-working households had an income of $9,126, placing them ahead of those in Germany and Sweden, and close to those in America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, government policy makes no difference to the rankings. Poor Britons pay a lot of tax (the third-highest burden for working households, second-highest for non-working); but they also receive generous benefits. More than 90% of British homes in the lowest fifth received some kind of income-replacement benefit, more than in any other country except Sweden. On every basis--working households, non-working households, pre-tax earnings, post-tax earnings, with or without benefits--Britain's poor come third out of six in the <font size=-1>LIS</font> ranking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Life has grown more comfortable for the bottom fifth in visible ways. There is enough disposable income to make televisions universal, washing machines ubiquitous and home computers not uncommon. Rates of ownership for all the items in the table have increased markedly during the Tory era. Housing standards have also improved. In each of 36 deprived areas of Britain surveyed by the London-based Policy Studies Institute, a think-tank, the percentage of households with more than one person to a room fell between 1981 and 1991 in all but one area, London's Tower Hamlets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, "mobility" is high: the members of the lowest fifth (and, indeed, the lowest tenth) change a lot each year. Climbing out of the lowest income quintile is not only possible, but a routine event. In January the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change, a group sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council (<font size=-1>ESRC</font>), published a study entitled "Do the Poor Stay Poor?". It found that, of those in the bottom fifth in 1991, almost four out of ten had moved up to a higher income by 1992.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As you might expect, most of those moving out of the lowest level did not climb far. Also, the children of the lowest fifth are less likely than average to make it into the top ranks when they grow up. According to another study published last month, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (<font size=-1>IFS</font>), 12% of the children born into the lowest fifth made it into the top fifth by the time they were 33; of those born in the top fifth, 34% managed to stay there. This is unfair, but hardly a portrait of a hopeless underclass. (<a href="brimg1.gif">See table</a>). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the good news. The bad news is that several trends are pushing gently in the wrong direction. Although the physical wretchedness of poverty may be declining--poorer Britons, remember, have nicer, better-equipped homes than ever--the spatial concentration of poverty is accelerating. When rules of entry to council estates changed in the 1970s, with need becoming the primary criterion, social indicators worsened. The estates have become more different from the rest of Britain than before: younger, poorer, more racially segregated, with twice the rate of unemployed and three times the proportion of lone parents. The middle class has moved out. As late as 1974, one in three Britons with incomes in the top 40% lived on a council estate. That figure is now next to nothing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This matters because, as the examples of America's inner cities and France's <i>banlieues</i> indicate, such areas tend to become self-perpetuating. Stigma means that business is reluctant to move in; working people move out as soon as they can. Public services suffer. Defeatism deepens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although there is considerable movement up (and therefore down) the income ladder, an increasingly intractable group is stuck at the bottom. One reason for this is the growing number of one-parent families, which account for 7% of Britain's households but more than a third of the lowest fifth. Six years after beginning to receive benefits, 78% of Britain's lone mothers are still on social assistance, compared with 24% of Americans, 20% of Germans and 58% of Canadians. The longer people are out of work, the less likely they are to find a job. So these women are not going to find it easy to find work even when their kids grow up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same problem afflicts the long-term unemployed. Britain has one of the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s lower unemployment rates. But almost four out of every ten unemployed Britons has been without a job for a year or more. Of the six countries surveyed by the Luxembourg Income Study, Britain (73.6%) and Belgium (76.5%) had, by far, the highest percentage of non-earners in the lowest 20%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidently, the way out of the lowest fifth is through work: employment enables even the poorest of the poor to escape. Figures on what happens to the unemployed in the lower half of the bottom fifth prove the point. Households in that unfortunate position in 1991 accounted for a fifth of those who had escaped poverty altogether by 1992--someone in the household had found a job, or married someone in work. Doing neither means staying stuck.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, the effect may stretch across generations. According to the <font size=-1>IFS</font>, sons of men who were unemployed for a week or more in the year their boys turned 16 were twice as likely to end up on the dole themselves. Other research shows that daughters from fatherless homes are more likely to become lone mothers. Although the growth of both groups seems to have stopped, they remain large (2.2m unemployed, 1.5m lone parents) and include many who, at best, are only intermittently connected to the world of work. And Britain has a greater proportion of children in the lowest fifth than any other country in the Luxembourg research.
</p><p><b>More or less equal</b></b>
<br>Moreover, inequality is increasing. In 1978, the bottom fifth took home almost 10% of the national income. By 1990 that was down to 7%, according to the <font size=-1>OECD</font>. Inequality in the 1980s increased faster in Britain than anywhere in Europe, though not as fast as in America. Tories say it is ridiculous to call the poor worse off because the rest of society grew richer. On the other hand, harsher forms of poverty, such as homelessness and temporary shelter, are more common. Real incomes in the bottom fifth have risen only 6% since 1979, less than for any other quintile--and that is before taking housing costs, which have risen in real terms, into account. Incomes actually fell for those likeliest to be in work (couples and childless single people) due to higher unemployment, fewer full-time jobs and higher housing costs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a bleak picture--but perhaps an exaggerated one. Consumption among lower-income households is often considerably higher than reported income; the lowest fifth say they spend about &#163;23 a week more than they take in. That explains what many would regard as an extraordinary finding by Eurostat, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s statistical agency: that Britain has narrowed the consumption gap between the top and bottom quarters of the population faster than any <font size=-1>EU</font> country (except Greece), even as inequality measured by incomes was rising. The link between income statistics and the standard of living is unreliable: transfers between family members, and the shadow economy, make a big difference.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is unlikely to calm those who see growing inequality as the scandalous failure of the Tory years. Services for the poor tend to decline into poor services, it is often said--which is why the Labour Party has long opposed selection in schools. Frank Field, a prominent Labour <font size=-1>MP</font> whom Tony Blair appears to heed, admits that there is "no general groundswell amongst middle-class groups for redistribution of wealth to the poor". Nevertheless, it is also true that the apparent growth of inequality has made many Britons uneasy. It is this uneasiness which Mr Blair has tried to address with his idea of the "stakeholder society". Finding policies which can reconcile concern over inequality with suspicion of the means to reduce it will be far more difficult.

<p><b>The economy</b></p>
<h2>January sales</h2>


TIPPED to be the "year of the consumer", 1996 is off to a slow start. January's inflation figures revealed the biggest monthly falls in the prices of clothes and shoes (5.6%) since 1921, and in household goods (3%) since records began in 1956. This provoked much talk of frantic price-cutting. The impression of empty shops and stationary merchandise seemed confirmed on February 21st when new figures showed that seasonally-adjusted retail sales were 0.6% lower in volume terms in January than in December.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retailers need not despair. January's fall in sales followed a strong fourth quarter of 1995, when sales surged at an annual rate of 3.4%. Compared with January 1995, this January's retail sales were 2.3% higher. And, says David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, retail sales in January were hit by the two "roll-over" weeks on the National Lottery--the extra money gambled may have shaved as much as four-tenths of a percentage point off retail sales during the month, as consumers switched cash from small purchases. Very cold weather was a problem too: strikingly, sales did rise in "non-store retailing and repair", much of which is mail order.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression of widespread price-cutting is also wrong. Despite the falls in the prices of clothing and household goods, inflation excluding mortgage interest and indirect taxes was unchanged in January. The prices of personal goods, leisure services and motoring all rose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is also less to the much-hyped supermarket wars than meets the eye. J. Sainsbury, for instance, launched its "January savers" with much fanfare: a mixture of discounts of up to 50% and buy-two-and-get-one-free deals on 100 basic items. However, according to Mike Conolly, Sainsbury's director of operational marketing, the cost was small because it merely concentrated the firm's usual discounts on fewer items.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Talk of fierce price competition due to the launch of various loyalty cards, such as the "Clubcard" introduced by Tesco last year, is also mistaken. These do reward the customer, perhaps by as much as 1% a year for a regular shopper. But many customers will receive less. And retailers reckon to regain much of the lost revenue by using the information generated by the card to aim special offers at likely takers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no sign of a fall in retail profit margins: gross margins have risen from 14% to 18% over the past ten years. Such healthy margins may be the result of a lack of competition. A paper to be published on February 28th by London Economics, a consultancy (whose research has been sponsored by Tesco), disputes this, arguing that high margins reflect the need to pay for heavy capital investment which has raised the quality of service. Possibly. But if spending does accelerate this year, retailers may be able to push prices up, and the margins will be healthier still.

<p><b>Tanker disaster</b></p>
<h2>Sinking feelings</h2>

<p>BRITAIN may no longer rule the waves, but it leads the world in oil-tanker disasters. This week it increased its lead when the Liberian-registered <i>Sea Empress</i> spilled 65,000 tonnes of crude into the sea as it lay on the rocks off Milford Haven in Dyfed, Wales. Three of the world's six biggest tanker-spills have now occurred around the rocky coasts of Britain: France, America and Tobago have had one each. This has nothing to do with being a big oil producer in the North Sea; the wrecks were all delivering or passing through. Bad luck and geography matter more. The real debate is now over how Britain handles such spills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain was introduced to this modern form of environmental disaster in 1967 when the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> ran aground off Land's End. Three years ago, off the Shetlands, the <i>Braer</i> broke up, spilling 85,000 tonnes of oil. On February 15th, the <i>Sea Empress</i> hit the rocks. Six days later, after repeated attempts to dislodge her in winds of up to 40 knots, she was refloated--but not before leaking twice as much oil as the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> did in 1989, causing $15 billion worth of damage to the Alaskan coast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that another tanker recently ran aground close to where the <i>Sea Empress </i>hit the rocks has added to the usual row that blows up after each wreck. The first tanker was one of the new double-hulled vessels, whereas the <i>Sea Empress</i> is one of the last single-hulled vessels to be built. The <i>Sea Empress</i> appears to have taken a wrong turn, but the real controversy is about what happened, or failed to happen, next.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is being criticised for not implementing the findings of the inquiry which followed the <i>Braer</i> disaster. It recommended that more big tugs should be laid on, to stop every tanker crisis turning into a disaster. The government did follow this recommendation to the extent of laying on one such tug in Shetland, and another in the south-west, close to the sites of previous disasters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics say that this has been inadequate, and that tugs did not get to the stricken <i>Sea Empress</i> quickly enough. The longer a holed tanker sits on the bottom, the more difficult it becomes to dislodge it. Seawater fills the gap left by spilt oil, making it harder to get the vessel off the rocks. The government denies any lack of tugs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Milford Haven is in a sheltered area, and is a refuge for rare birds and dolphins. Yet the <i>Braer</i> spill was less disastrous than first predicted. Strong winds dispersed its cargo of light oil, with little damage to wildlife. The <i>Sea Empress</i> was also carrying a light grade of oil. With luck, nature will quickly clean up humanity's mess.

<p><b>Higher-education inquiry</b></p>
<h2>Learning to pay</h2>

<p>AN INDEPENDENT inquiry into the future of the universities, announced in the House of Commons on February 19th, gets both the government and the Labour Party off a nasty hook. Neither of them wants to be first to admit that the only sensible way to meet the increasing cost of higher education is for students to stump up something themselves. The Liberal Democrats did just that, in a policy paper published the next day. But the two larger parties prefer to let the inquiry reach this conclusion for them, safely after the next election. The inquiry will look into all aspects of higher education. Yet its most pressing task is to find the fairest way to make students pay. Progress has already been made towards finding an answer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most promising proposal is to let students borrow to cover their living expenses and tuition from a " learning bank". On graduation, they would repay the loans through extra national-insurance contributions of perhaps 3-5% of their earnings. Interest would be charged on the loans at, say, a few percentage points above inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ideally, private investors would finance the loans, minimising the burden on public-sector borrowing. The banks refused to take part in the current, smaller-scale scheme for student loans, fearing the costs and the bad publicity incurred in chasing thousands of graduates for fairly small amounts of money. Using the national-insurance system would overcome this problem. Employers are obliged to deduct contributions from their workers' pay. Even self-employed people think twice about evading national-insurance payments because doing so also deprives them of their entitlement to some benefits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iain Crawford and Nicholas Barr of the London School of Economics, who are preparing detailed proposals for a graduate-repayment scheme, say it is not the banks but the life-assurance and pension funds who are the most suitable investors to finance student loans. These funds are designed to make long-term investments, and they are accustomed to making complex calculations such as the likely earnings, credit risks and life expectancies of graduates. There is already a market for securitised credit-card debts; student loans, in which the repayments are taken directly from pay packets, would be much less risky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Messrs Crawford and Barr suggest that the learning bank could invite investors to make competitive bids for packages of, say, &#163;10m of student loans. Since a few graduates would never earn enough to repay their loans, or would try to dodge paying them, the investors would bid at a discount. The government would make up the shortfall, but would then face no further liability. The investors would get the rights to repayments on the whole &#163;10m in return for taking on the risks of non-payment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a market in student loans to succeed, says David Sutherland of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, the repayments would have to be spread typically over 15 years. This would make the securitised loans similar to the long-dated gilts which funds like his are already used to buying in large quantities.

<p><b>Bang to rights</b> &nbsp;
The European Court of Human Rights said that the power exercised by British home secretaries to overrule court recommendations on how long young offenders should stay in jail was a violation of human rights.</p>
<p><b>Double standards</b> &nbsp;
A letter written by Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, appeared to admit that the government's plans to cut the annual cost of the social-security system by &#163;1 billion were feasible, even though Labour had publicly denounced the cuts.</p>
<p><b>Less majesty</b> &nbsp;
A <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll for the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> found that, for the first time, fewer people think the monarchy has a long-term future than those who do not. Only one in three adults thinks Britain would be worse off without a monarchy.</p>
<p><b>Deflated</b> &nbsp;
British Gas announced 1995 pre-tax profits of &#163;986m--down from &#163;1.3 billion in 1994--and admitted "a deterioration" in customer services. Labour attacked Richard Giordano, its chairman, for taking half his &#163;500,000 salary in dollars to avoid tax.</p>

<p><b>Careless</b> &nbsp;
The government dropped the term "care in the community" following repeated criticism that it meant abandoning the mentally ill. Its new policy slogan is "the spectrum of care" , emphasising that some patients will continue to be kept in mental hospitals.</p>
<p><b>Down the plughole</b> &nbsp;
It emerged that South West Water, many of whose customers have endured months of drought restrictions, allowed a billion gallons of water to pour into the sea, because of poor forecasting of demand.</p>
<p><b>Interesting</b> &nbsp;
Minutes of the January 17th meeting between Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, showed that Mr George had preferred to wait a month before cutting interest rates. Mr Clarke cut them the next day.

Britain's mountain climbers held their first national conference--not on Mount Snowdon or Ben Nevis, but at sea level in the resort of Llandudno.</p>

<h2 align=center>Still hope for Ulster's peace</h2>

BOMBS bring a dreadful sort of clarity. The message behind the Irish Republican Army's bombing of London was unmistakable. When it unilaterally called an open-ended ceasefire 17 months ago, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> assumed that in return Sinn Fein, its political wing, would obtain a seat in all-party negotiations on Northern Ireland's future. Persuaded by a year of stalemate that the British did not intend to let Sinn Fein into all-party talks, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> set off a bomb in London on February 9th and then, six days later, it planted more bombs, paralysing much of central London. We are still here, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was saying; and we can still be violent.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed; the surprise is that anyone had ever doubted it. Yet they had; and that, in the end, could be the point that the bombs highlight most clearly. At the heart of the British government's policy since the 1994 ceasefire has lain the idea that terrorism in Northern Ireland had lost its energy, and with it the will to fight. The advantage thus gained could be pressed home by British and unionist demands that the terrorists must begin to hand over their weapons before Sinn Fein could be admitted to all-party talks. Although they did not share those demands, the Irish and American governments did share the basic assumption behind them. But that assumption was wrong. One way or another, terrorism will lurk in Ulster's shadows even if a political settlement is eventually reached. The task is to deprive it of popular support and thus to isolate it. And the resumption of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bombing campaign may have made that task easier.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of all, the bombs have damaged Sinn Fein. Nationalists in Ireland, north and south of the border, share Sinn Fein's frustration with the intransigence of Ulster's unionists, and the British government's reluctance to over-ride them. But those same Irish nationalists are horrified at the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bombing of London. " I was willing to believe that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had ended the killing for good," John Bruton, Ireland's prime minister, told his parliament. "That act of faith has now been thrown back in my face." Ireland and Britain promptly cut off ministerial contacts with Sinn Fein, and demanded a restoration of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one knows what the <font size=-1>IRA</font> intends. The London bombs could easily lead to a full-scale resumption of Ulster's 25-year-long conflict. But even if that is not the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s intention, its resort to violence is short-sighted. It demonstrates that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is still willing to disregard the will of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland, nationalist and unionist alike, who want the violence to end. The bombs also seem to confirm unionist accusations that, if Sinn Fein does not get its way at the negotiating table, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> will use bombs and bullets.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And unionists are not the only ones who will now wonder whether dealing with Sinn Fein makes sense. Democratic politics is always complicated, and often slow. Mr Major may well have been delaying all-party talks, as Sinn Fein charges, in exchange for unionist support in the House of Commons, where the Conservative Party's slim majority has got even slimmer in recent months. But that does not justify the resumption of a war that Sinn Fein's own leaders have admitted that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> cannot win. In that war, Irish republicans have always taken the longest of views. The fact that their patience ran out after only 17 months of diplomacy contradicts their professed commitment to democratic change. True democrats, despairing of Mr Major, would have chosen simply to wait a further 15 months (at most) for a British general election. Nor are republican fears realistic. Britain does not want, nor would Ireland or the United States tolerate, the reimposition of a Protestant unionist hegemony in Ulster.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to shut the door entirely on Sinn Fein, as the British, Irish and American governments all recognised after the first bomb. Those governments will maintain contact with the party through officials. The biggest reason to do this is that, as even some unionists admit, most Irish republicans in Ulster want a permanent end to the conflict. Belfast's Falls Road greeted the news of the first London bomb with gloom and dread, not celebration. Revealingly, loyalist terrorists did not retaliate and called for Sinn Fein to be given time to restore the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire.</p><p><b>Breaking the stalemate</b><br><ro>The peace process can still be salvaged. But to do that, all sides to the conflict will have to re-examine their attitudes. The political settlements now in place in South Africa, the Middle East and even Bosnia, make it all the more incredible that a settlement in Ulster is so elusive.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nationalists of all stripes need to understand Britain's concerns. Although Mr Major's efforts to keep his own government in office may not be an edifying sight, they are understandable in a democracy. Nevertheless, Mr Major also has a responsibility to try harder to get all-party talks going, and to draw people from both sides who have supported terrorism into the democratic mainstream. To talk secretly to Sinn Fein before the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire, as Mr Major's government did, and then to deny the party a place at the negotiating table for 17 months after the ceasefire, has been perverse. To give the impression that he was brushing aside the views of the Irish government was a grievous blunder.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among democratic politicians, it is the unionists who most need to learn the art of compromise. Happy with the status quo, they have seen no need to negotiate. But nationalists, even the peaceful variety, will never settle for the status quo. Northern Ireland will never enjoy stability unless unionists compromise. Unionist fears of being pushed into a united Ireland are as unrealistic as those of Irish republicans. The best guarantor of Ulster's link with Britain is not London, but Dublin, where there is no support for ending the partition of Ireland as long as Ulster's majority remains opposed to it. Despite the London bombs, the unionist refusal to talk to Sinn Fein has also been misplaced. Britain and Ireland have proved for the past 25 years that they are not going to let the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, through Sinn Fein, dictate the terms of a final settlement.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British and Irish governments have spent the week following the first London bomb searching for a formula to get talks going. But they cannot concoct one on their own. With realism and a spirit of compromise from the parties in Ulster, any formula could work. Without them, none will.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?824508000,iss">Search</a>

<h3>End of a ceasefire</h3>The British and Irish governments broke off ministerial contacts with Sinn Fein after the <b>IRA</b> ended a 17-month ceasefire by detonating a 1,000lb bomb at Canary Wharf in London, which killed two people and caused damage estimated at up to &#163;100m ($155m). As attempts were made to keep the peace process on track, the British government sent more troops to Northern Ireland.<br>
<p><b>Boris Yeltsin</b> offered himself for re-election to Russia's presidency in June. His main rivals, so far, are the Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, whom opinion polls put well in the lead, the extreme nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal, and Alexander Lebed, a former general.<br>
<p>Bosnia's <b>peace was threatened</b> by a row between the Bosnian Serbs and <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s implementation force, Ifor, after it had sent two Bosnian Serb suspects to The Hague, where the <font size=-1>UN</font> war-crimes tribunal will hold its first trial on May 7th. Since then, the Bosnian Serb government has refused to talk to <font size=-1>NATO</font> officials. The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia will be pressed to honour their peace-deal commitments when they meet Russian and western officials in Rome this weekend.<br>

<p>In the midst of a general election campaign, a former head of Spain's Constitutional Court was <b>assassinated </b>in Madrid by Basque terrorists.<br>
<p>Ukraine's president sacked the head of the country's security service, apparently after three Chinese had been deported allegedly for trying to buy designs for long-range <b>ballistic missiles</b>.<br>

<p>Italy's stockmarket plunged after the prime minister-designate, Antonio Maccanico, failed to form what would would have been his country's 55th government since the second world war. A <b>general election</b> is now likely.<br>
<p>France's Roman Catholic bishops incurred the displeasure of the pope by saying that <b>condoms </b>"could be necessary" to combat the spread of <font size=-1>AIDS</font>.<br>
<h3>Feeling better</h3>
Saudi Arabia's <b>King Fahd</b>, who after a stroke had handed over to Crown Prince Abdullah, re-emerged to preside over a cabinet meeting.<br>
<p><b>Yasser Arafat</b> was sworn in as the first elected Palestinian president.<br>
<p>Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian representatives, meeting in Oslo, signed an agreement on the management of <b>water resources</b>. An Iraqi official said that Iraq and Syria were considering taking joint action against European companies helping Turkey to build dams on the Euphrates.<br>

<p>Algeria's <b>Armed Islamic Group</b> moved against the country's crucial export industry by threatening to kill oil and gas workers.<br>

<p>In a renewed bid to persuade its 1m <b>Rwandan refugees</b> to return home, Zaire is harassing them and cutting off services.<br>
<p>A South African commission set about investigating<br>
<p>political crimes committed during the apartheid era: the aim, said Nelson Mandela, is <b>truth and forgiveness.</b><br>

<h3>Doleful</h3>The <b>Iowa caucuses </b>gave Bob Dole a decidedly lukewarm endorsement; he won 26% of the vote, against 23% for his fire-breathing rival, Pat Buchanan. Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, enjoyed a rising fame; he won 18%. Steve Forbes, the flat-tax candidate, became a flash in the pan with 10%. Phil Gramm of Texas (9%, $20m spent) abandoned the race. The survivors moved on to New Hampshire.<br>
<p><b>Bill Clinton </b>won the Democratic caucuses with 100% of the vote.<br>
<p>The governor of <b>Kansas</b>, declaring that it was obvious Mr Dole would win in his state, cancelled the primary.<br>
<p>Bill Clinton signed an order barring companies from winning new federal contracts if they knowingly hired <b>illegal aliens</b>.<br>
<p>In <b>British Columbia</b>, negotiators announced an agreement on Nisga'a Indian land claims. It could set a Canadian pattern--if it wins general acceptance.<br>
<p><b>Argentina's</b> leftish Frepaso opposition coalition fell apart as Jose Octavio Bordon, its presidential candidate last year, quit to back an ex-Peronist instead of Frepaso's man as would-be mayor of Buenos Aires.<br>
<h3>Asian tension</h3>South Korea and Japan quarrelled over the ownership of three small islands in the <b>Sea of Japan</b>; South Korea said it would conduct military exercises near the islands. There were anti-Japanese demonstrations in Seoul. The islands, known as Tokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds.<br>
<p>A North Korean demanding <b>political asylum </b>at the Russian embassy in Pyongyang shot dead three Koreans guarding the building. He was himself later shot. Reports grew of more defections from the communist state, including that of Sung Hae Rim, a former wife of the Korean leader, Kim Jong Il.<br>
<p>The Karen, an ethnic minority which has been fighting for an <b>independent state</b> in Myanmarfor 47 years, said it would hold peace talks with the government.<br>
<p>A rocket carrying a $100m <b>communications satellite </b>exploded after taking off in China. And Japan's fledgling space programme also had a setback when a 4.4 metre (14ft) rocket-powered vehicle designed to be recovered was lost on re-entry.<br>

<h3>A far horizon</h3>Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, added to speculation about the postponement of a single currency in Europe. He said that a delay in implementing economic and <b>monetary union</b> would create fewer problems than a derailment after the launch.<br>
<p>The European Parliament voted to tighten limits on the number of <b>foreign films </b>shown on television. The present rule, in which schedules should have at least 51% European content " where practicable", should no longer be discretionary, said the legislature. This pleased France, which is desperate to keep Hollywood at bay. But, this being Europe, the parliament's vote is unlikely to lead to a real change in any government's policy.<br>
<p>America is taking a complaint over <b>recorded-music rights </b>to the World Trade Organisation in an effort to force Japan to extend its copyright-protection laws, which came into force last month.

<h1>Why peace broke down </h1>

<p><b>The Irish Republican Army's bomb in London's Docklands on February 9th brought a shattering end to the 17-month-long ceasefire in Northern Ireland. On February 15th, the police defused a bomb in the British capital's West End. Why has the IRA returned to violence? And is this the end of the peace process?</b></p>

<p>IN RETROSPECT, there were plenty of warning signs that Northern Ireland's peace process was in jeopardy. Exasperated by the failure to start all-party talks, leaders of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing, had been saying since last summer that the peace process was under threat. In this, they were reflecting grass-roots opinion: for the past few months, republican supporters in the province had grown ever more despondent and angry at the lack of political progress to the decades-old dispute.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet when the <font size=-1>IRA</font> called off its ceasefire late on the afternoon of February 9th, it still came as a shock. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> sent a coded message to <font size=-1>RTE</font>, Ireland's state-owned broadcaster: it was greeted with disbelief. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> had to make a second call to ask why the news had not been broadcast. Earlier that same week, British security sources had said they did not expect an early resumption of <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peace had transformed everyday life in Northern Ireland. It had been embraced with enthusiasm across the province's deep political divide. Most republican and loyalist activists, who had supported the gunmen on both sides, had said that the war was over, and that securing a political settlement through dialogue had become their goal. Perhaps the most visible sign of this commitment to peace was the euphoric reaction to President Clinton's visit to the province on November 30th: crowds of nationalists and unionists welcomed the president with joyous rallies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, at 7:01 pm on February 9th, a 1,000-pound bomb ripped through London's Docklands, east of the City, smashing windows in office blocks, injuring 43 people and killing two. Abruptly, the mood in Ulster shifted from optimism to despair. The mood darkened further with the discovery of a bomb in London's West End. At best, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was signalling its frustration in failing get Sinn Fein into talks. At worst, it was resuming full-bloodied " armed struggle" against British rule in Northern Ireland. What was beyond doubt was that the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire had ended.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What went wrong? A whirl of meetings between politicians of every stripe, trumpeted "breakthroughs", Anglo-Irish summits, visits to the White House by party leaders, and endless television interviews all gave the impression of political progress. But this was misleading. After 17 months of politicking, Ulster was not much closer to a political settlement before the bomb--or even to negotiations leading to such a settlement--than it had been when the <font size=-1>IRA</font> announced its ceasefire.
</p><p><b>The unspeakable and the intractable</b>
<br><ro>To understand why the peace process has proved so hard to maintain, it is necessary to recall the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, one of the longest and most intractable in Western Europe. Irish nationalists, who account for 40% of Northern Ireland's population and are mainly Catholic, have always thought that the province was an artificial creation, gerrymandered in 1920 to give mainly-Protestant unionists a permanent majority. Nearly 50 years of discrimination under the unionist-dominated parliament at Stormont Castle, a palace near Belfast, persuaded most nationalists that an "internal settlement" (ie, one that excludes Ireland) would be unacceptable because it would leave them permanently under the unionist thumb.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other side, unionists have always said there is no reason why Ireland should be a political unit just because it is a geographic one. They argue that those who wish to remain part of the United Kingdom should have the right to do so. Today, most unionists admit that a return to rule by a local assembly in Stormont is neither possible nor desirable. But they adamantly refuse to consider joining a united Ireland, in which they would be a permanent minority, and see any moves to forge links with the Irish government as the beginning of a slide towards unification.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such conflicting aspirations and fears have nurtured nationalist virulence alien to the rest of Britain and Ireland (<a href="sfchart1.gif">see chart</a>). When Catholic civil-rights protesters marched under the Stormont regime at the end of the 1960s, Protestant police and counter-protesters responded by attacking them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Out of the civil strife which followed, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, whose roots lay in the revolution that had established the Irish Free State 50 years earlier, was reborn--and so was a "republican", anti-British ideology. This viewed Britain's presence anywhere in Ireland as colonial and Ulster unionists as British stooges. On the unionist side, loyalist terrorists, who viewed all Catholics as subversives, sprang back into action.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These attitudes, legacies of 25 years of conflict, have dogged the current peace process from the start. But they are not the only ones in the province. After 25 years of stalemate, most people want peace. This was why hopes rose so high when the latest peace efforts began.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the nationalists, the main figure arguing for accommodation is John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (<font size=-1>SDLP</font>), which is the largest nationalist party in the province. After years of discussion with Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, Mr Hume seemed to have persuaded him of the view held by most people in the Irish Republic: that <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence, not the British government, had become the biggest obstacle to a settlement, and that the unionists would never be persuaded to compromise, let alone join a united Ireland, by bombs or bullets. Sinn Fein moderated its rhetoric, and established secret contacts with the British and Irish governments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 both governments tried to reassure everyone in Ulster that their concerns would be taken into account and no settlement imposed. When the <font size=-1>IRA</font> announced an open-ended ceasefire at the end of August 1994 (followed by a loyalist ceasefire six weeks later), Northern Ireland seemed at least on the brink of a durable peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Almost immediately old suspicions resurfaced. Sinn Fein's leaders were all too aware that their party's share of the vote, about 10% in Northern Ireland and a mere 2% in the south, would not give it much clout on its own. So they persuaded the <font size=-1>IRA</font> to stop its violent campaign only after winning promises from Mr Hume and Albert Reynolds, Ireland's then prime minister, that the <font size=-1>SDLP</font> and the Irish government would help ease Sinn Fein's way to the negotiating table. Together, the party's leaders told their supporters, nationalists across Ireland could get Britain and the unionists to accept a change. The help of Mr Clinton's White House would also be relied upon to press for an equitable settlement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unionist leaders saw this "pan-nationalist" front as a conspiracy to bully the British into accepting a slow-motion unification of Ireland. They bitterly resented the meddling of the Americans. Why, they asked, should we believe that the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire is anything but tactical? Why should we talk to Sinn Fein while the <font size=-1>IRA</font> retains its weapons? Sinn Fein, claimed unionist leaders, had to establish its democratic credentials before unionists would negotiate with it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British government tried to assuage unionist concerns. First it refused to meet Sinn Fein for three months, to ensure that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire was genuine. Then it demanded that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> declare its ceasefire "permanent". And then it demanded that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> make a gesture to bolster the confidence of unionists by decommissioning some of its weapons before Sinn Fein could meet British ministers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble was that neither side sees the British as honest brokers. Nationalists, even the majority who oppose the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s campaign, have long believed that when push comes to shove, the British will invariably side with the unionists. Ironically, the unionists do not trust the British any more than the nationalists. With some justification, unionists suspect that most people on mainland Britain would be happy to settle for any resolution of the conflict, even a united Ireland. British efforts over the past 20 years to meet nationalist demands by involving the Irish government in a settlement have fuelled unionist fears that Britain wants to wash its hands of Ulster.
</p><p><b>Towards the bomb</b>
<br><ro>Britain's attempts to steer through this sea of suspicion were unsuccessful. Eventually, the government abandoned its demands that Sinn Fein declare the ceasefire permanent; nor did the <font size=-1>IRA</font> hand in any weapons. But British ministers met Sinn Fein leaders. In February 1995, the British even went so far as to publish, together with the Irish government, a "framework" document sketching an outline political settlement. This involved a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland, which would remain part of the United Kingdom but would be linked through cross-border government bodies with the Irish Republic. Such a formula (similar to an attempt, called the Sunningdale agreement of 1973, to end an earlier round of fighting) may well be the only way to reconcile the demands of both nationalists and unionists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Sunningdale foundered on the rock of unionist opposition--and so did John Major's negotiations. Unionists were enraged, arguing that the British prime minister had misled them, and that he was trying to impose a settlement against the wishes of Ulster's majority. Meanwhile Sinn Fein's leaders seemed at first confused, then angered by the British.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years they had been told by the British that the alternative to <font size=-1>IRA</font> terrorism was dialogue. They believed this meant that, once the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had abandoned its violent campaign, Sinn Fein would be allowed a place at the negotiating table where a political settlement would be hammered out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sinn Fein's supporters felt that unionist leaders and the British government were out to humiliate them, that their demands for weapons handovers and delays would only increase, and that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was no longer being asked simply to stop waging war, but to surrender. This, they believed, was the prelude to the internal settlement they dreaded. Despite its connections with, and support for, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, Sinn Fein also has scores of elected local councillors. Its leaders demanded that its electoral mandate be recognised, and that talks without "pre-conditions" begin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the British insisted on the idea of some form of weapons disposal before any all-party talks, the Irish government and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font> were dismayed. Like Sinn Fein, they had assumed that the terrorist ceasefires would allow all sides to come to the negotiating table. As months of stalemate dragged on, spirits sagged.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nationalists in Ireland, and not just republicans, came to believe that unionist leaders would negotiate only if the British called all-party talks over their objections, but that the British had no intention of doing this. Mr Major's dwindling majority in the House of Commons made it likely that he would need to rely on the support of the nine <font size=-1>MP</font>s of the Ulster Unionist Party to stay in office. Nationalists noted this, but gave Mr Major little credit for trying to pursue peace negotiations anyway. Instead, they accused the British government of trimming its support for the peace process because of parliamentary arithmetic and argued that Northern Ireland should take precedence over "party politics" at Westminster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For their part, British ministers argued that without the unionists at the table, talks were pointless. They insisted that unionist demands for an <font size=-1>IRA</font> gesture on weapons as a "confidence building" measure were reasonable given the ferocity and length of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s campaign. This was not a demand for surrender. If the <font size=-1>IRA</font> truly wanted peace, asked the British, why could it not make this simple gesture?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After an ominous summer of sectarian marches and rioting, the deadlock became unmistakable when, by late autumn, the British and Irish governments had failed to agree on a way forward. Then, on the eve of Mr Clinton's visit to the British Isles in November, the two governments hastily announced a compromise--a "twin track" approach. Along one track would proceed discussions leading to all-party talks by the end of February. Along another, a three-man international commission examined ways to break the impasse over arms. The commission was headed by George Mitchell, a former American senator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the commission reported on January 24th, it recommended another compromise: instead of talks before disarmament, or disarmament before talks, both should proceed at the same time. Barely consulting the Irish government, Mr Major immediately rejected this proposal, and repeated his demand that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> disarm before talks. If Sinn Fein would not accept this, he said, he proposed instead an alternative of his own: special elections to choose delegates to all-party talks before disarmament. Make a gesture over weapons, he told Sinn Fein, or win a democratic mandate to talks--take your pick.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unionists were delighted. The idea had been theirs. It also sounded reasonable to British officials--how can democrats oppose elections? But it confirmed many of the worst fears of nationalists. After months of stalling, Britain seemed to be brushing aside the Irish government and the Anglo-Irish partnership that had formed the bedrock of the peace process. It had hastily rejected an international effort to offer a way forward. It had adopted the unionists' agenda, conjuring fears of a purely internal settlement. It had erected another hurdle in the way of Sinn Fein's entrance into talks. Sixteen days later, the bomb went off in Docklands. Mr Major's response to the Mitchell commission, Mr Adams speculated, had been the "last straw".
</p><p><b>Examining the wreckage</b>
<br><ro>The bomb has left all sides pessimistic, but it has set back, rather than stopped, the search for a settlement. Unionist leaders predictably claimed that the bomb confirmed the suspicions they had held of Sinn Fein and the <font size=-1>IRA</font> all along. But few others tried to make political capital out of the attack and neither the British nor Irish government, despite the bloodshed, seems ready to slam the door on Sinn Fein.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the bombing provoked a bout of finger-pointing between London and Dublin about who was to blame for the political stalemate. A few days later, however, both adopted a more conciliatory tone and scrambled to work out a new route to all-party talks. Both governments broke off ministerial, though not official, contacts with Sinn Fein. Both also demanded an immediate restoration of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major still called for elections. But, in a subdued House of Commons, also said he was open to other ideas. The <font size=-1>SDLP</font>'s Mr Hume proposed referendums in both parts of Ireland to ask people to repudiate violence and to back all-party talks. Mr Major was unenthusiastic about this but refrained from ruling it out. Ireland's prime minister, John Bruton, said he was willing to discuss elections, but only if "proximity" talks (like those held in Dayton, Ohio, to reach an accord in Bosnia) were also considered. The Irish had proposed such talks before the bombing. Both governments seem to realise that, whatever the <font size=-1>IRA</font> now does, the only way to salvage the peace process is to restore their partnership. A meeting between the two prime ministers is expected next week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bomb has left the strategies of both the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and Sinn Fein unclear. Sinn Fein's top leaders denied prior knowledge of the bomb. They expressed sympathy for its victims, but refused to condemn it. Instead, they explained it as the inevitable response to British and unionist intransigence, and the delay in starting all-party talks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bombing seemed to cause as much gloom among Sinn Fein's supporters in Northern Ireland as among anyone else. Yet, mindful of bloody divisions that have riven their movement in the past, republicans were determined not to split. Mr Adams and other top Sinn Fein leaders may not have been told the precise timing of the bomb, but they surely must have known that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was about to call off its ceasefire. The most likely explanation is that they lost an internal argument over whether to return to violence and, to avoid a split, went along with the decision.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for the <font size=-1>IRA</font> itself, its return to violence was the more surprising because few could see any persuasive political logic to its decision. Even if the upshot is that all sides think again and act more flexibly, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> will pay a high price for the bombing. It will now be more difficult, not easier, for the two governments to get unionists to the same table as Sinn Fein. The bombing has also increased doubts about whether the republicans are genuinely committed to democracy, and whether they have the patience for the slow pace and compromises that the democratic process entails.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gloom and fear have returned to Ulster. Yet a political settlement, even peace, should still be possible. Ordinary people's attitudes really do seem to have changed. After the bombing, demonstrators poured on to the streets of Belfast and Londonderry to show their support for peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An unexpected bright spot was the behaviour of the fringe parties representing loyalist terrorist groups, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bitterest foes. They called for restraint, ruling out a renewal of hostilities unless the <font size=-1>IRA</font> launched an all-out campaign in the north. One loyalist leader argued that Mr Adams had to be given time to restore the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire. Loyalist prisoners even issued a statement accusing mainstream unionist leaders of "gloating" at the bloody end of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire. Such a response would have been unimaginable 17 months ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is clear that the people of Northern Ireland want a peaceful resolution of their conflict. But what compromises they are willing to make to obtain it, and how their politicians can lead them to that goal, remain obscure. Ulster, like so many other troubled places on earth, now needs statesmen, not mere politicians.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?824508000,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Rail privatisation</b></p>
<h2>More trouble on the track</h2>


<p>A NEW obstacle has appeared on the track of rail privatisation: the National Audit Office (<font size=-1>NAO</font>) has decided to launch an inquiry into the sell-off after opposition claims that the taxpayer is being cheated and that public assets are being sold for a song. Officials say there will probably be a series of individual reports on the sales of the 60 separate businesses into which British Rail is being split.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The auditors have already started looking into a number of sales, including that of the London-Tilbury-Southend line. The sale of the line was aborted after it was discovered that ticket sales were being fraudulently shuffled between stations in order to increase its revenues at the expense of London Underground's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAO</font>'s belief that the government has cut corners in its rush to privatise the railways was fuelled by the leak on February 12th of a Department of Transport memo which sought to conceal irregularities in the sale of a British Rail maintenance depot at Eastleigh. Written by a senior official in the rail-privatisation directorate, it gave a warning that the sale of the depot to a management buy-out team may have been financed by cash reserves which competing bidders had not been told about. The civil servants had marked the document "Restricted--not for <font size=-1>NAO</font> eyes", thus arousing the suspicion of the sharp-eyed auditors. The department claims this to be agreed practice for documents responding to proposals for investigations by the <font size=-1>NAO</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The memo, from Mike Fuhr, the civil servant with the job of monitoring rail privatisation, to the department's permanent secretary, Nick Montagu, quoted a report by a firm of accountants, Price Waterhouse. The report found that the management had bought the depot for &#163;7m even though it had cash balances of &#163;5.4m and a net worth of &#163;18.7m. Mr Fuhr described his concerns about the question of hidden cash balances, then listed a series of official omissions in the conduct of the Eastleigh sale, notably the lack of detailed documentation. He asked whether there were "any similar skeletons in other completed sales".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials dismiss the memo as "foolishly worded" and "out of date" . They say that a further study of the Eastleigh sale, by another accountancy firm, Ernst and Young, will clear all parties of wrongdoing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The imminent privatisation of Railtrack, the company that owns the country's track and stations, is causing the opposite embarrassment. In order to avoid accusations that it is selling Railtrack too cheaply, the government is insisting that the company carry with it a debt of &#163;1 billion. Railtrack's directors, however, say that it cannot support so much borrowing. The argument needs to be resolved within the next fortnight if the privatisation is to happen as planned.

<h2>Golden goals</h2>
<p>FAUSTINO ASPRILLA is reputed to earn &#163;30,000 a week. This juicy salary has not prevented the Colombian soccer star from becoming the latest hero of Newcastle United fans. His match-winning debut on February 10th maintained the team's lead in the English premier league. Were Mr Asprilla instead earning a similar salary as managing director of a British widget manufacturer, those same fans would regard him as an over-paid fat-cat. Is there a rational explanation for such an apparently contradictory attitude to top pay?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stefan Szymanski, an economist at Imperial College Management School in London, reckons so. People are happy to accept rates of pay that are fairly set. The procedure for determining the rate for a job should be just; pay needs to be seen to reward effort and skill; and the rate should reflect a worker's perceived worth. Footballers pass all these tests, he claims, better than senior executives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Executives' pay is seen to be set by their peers, rather than in a market. Footballers' salaries are determined by a fiercely competitive transfer market. Club managers and players--the buyers and sellers--have opposing interests, the manager to keep pay low, the player to push it up, so wages are set by the normal market forces of supply and demand. In contrast, company directors, many of whom are buyers (as well as sellers) by dint of sitting on remuneration committees at other firms, have an incentive to bid up the going rate for the job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for testing whether pay accurately reflects effort and skill, that is much easier in the case of players than company bosses. If two directors are watching a football match, it is impossible to tell whether they are cementing a deal or having a nice time. But, says Mr Szymanski, not only is the performance of each footballer easily observed; 70% of the explanation for the position of a club in Britain's Premier League arises from the relative size of its pay bill. A company's profits may soar because of a growing economy, or its share price rise simply because the stockmarket has risen, rather than because its managers are doing a good job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But here's the rub. The pay of Britain's top footballers rose by around 60% between 1991-92 and 1994-95--far more than the pay of Britain's company directors. Yet in that period, Britain's economy has grown faster than that of any other big European country, and its exports have risen to record levels. Not since 1984 has a British club won Europe's top honour, the Champions' Cup.

<p><b>Constitutional reform</b></p>
<h2>Grand ideas</h2>
<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>
<p>LIKE his predecessors as Scottish secretary, Michael Forsyth has campaigned incessantly against Labour's plans for a devolved Scottish parliament. But unlike previous Tory Scottish secretaries, Mr Forsyth has a new ploy. A Labour government, he says, would not need to create a Scottish parliament because he has already done it for them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most people, including Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s, seem to have missed this, which is not surprising. Mr Forsyth is talking about changes he has made to the Scottish Grand Committee, a hitherto obscure part of the parliamentary apparatus on which Scotland's 72 <font size=-1>MP</font>s sit. Until recently, the committee's 12 annual meetings to discuss Scottish affairs were mostly ignored by the Scottish media even though they were held in Edinburgh.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth wants to change that. First, he has turned the committee into a travelling circus. Some 200 people turned up for a meeting on February 5th in Inverness where Mr Forsyth handed out goodies, including giving state-owned land to crofters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, ministers now appear before the committee. In Aberdeen on February 19th Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will be grilled on how his policies affect Scotland. Next month John Major, the prime minister, will undergo a similar ordeal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The power to quiz non-Scottish Office ministers was part of a package of reforms grudgingly accepted by opposition parties last December. Similar changes to the Welsh Grand Committee proposed by William Hague, the Welsh secretary, have divided Welsh Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s who are so far refusing to implement them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thirdly, Mr Forsyth has given the committee power to take votes on some legislation. As there are only ten Scottish Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s, this law-making power will be exercised only on non-controversial matters, such as legal reform. More controversial measures, even those applying only to Scotland, will still go through Westminster, where the Tories can rely on their marjority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This shows, says Labour, that Mr Forsyth's scheme is a sham compared to Labour's plan for real devolution. Mr Forsyth, however, says that a Labour government would not need to set up a Scottish parliament as it could leave all its Scottish legislation to the Scottish Grand Committee where it would have a majority (Labour has 49 Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s at present).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a transparent political gimmick which is most unlikely to persuade Tony Blair to drop devolution. But that is not Mr Forsyth's plan. He wants to convince Scottish voters that the government is interested in their grievances and that they do not need a Scottish parliament to do something about them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour, riding high on polls which give it the support of more than half of the Scottish electorate, has been slow to counter Mr Forsyth's agile campaigning. This complacency may yet cost the party dearly. Polls show that the Scots are overwhelmingly in favour of devolution, but they give it a lower priority than having a job and good hospitals. As for paying more tax--which Labour's devolution plans allow--they fancy that not at all. Like the rest of Britain's shambolic constitution, Mr Forsyth's scheme may not look much in theory. But unless Labour takes steps to counter it, it might yet work well enough to salvage a few Tory seats north of the border.

<b>Just the job</b><br>
The official unemployment count fell by an unexpectedly sharp 29,300 to 2.2m in January. But construction firms said they expected to cut 45,000 jobs in 1996, despite figures showing that their new orders in December were the highest for two years.<p>
<b>Rentamum</b><br>
A London hospital said it was arranging the first surrogate birth on the National Health Service. An unnamed woman will get expenses of up to &#163;10,000 for having a baby on behalf of another who has lost her womb.
<p><b>King's shilling</b><br>
Faced with a shortage of 2,500 troops, the army offered serving soldiers a &#163;250 bonus for persuading their friends to join up.
<p><b>Wages of sin</b><br>
More prisoners will be allowed to do paid work while serving their sentences, the government said. But they will have to contribute towards their keep and give money to crime-prevention and victim-support schemes.


</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>

<b>A fine decision</b><br>
Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced that people will no longer be jailed for failing to pay fines. In 1994 22,500 fine-defaulters were jailed.

<p><b>God not Tory--official</b><br>
The Church of England is no longer a male-dominated " Conservative Party at prayer"; it is increasingly left-wing and women are winning more influence, a survey of 500 General Synod members found.

<p><b>Oliver Twist 1996</b><br>
An outcry forced Liverpool council to drop proposals to give poor children, who get their school meals free, smaller portions than those who could afford to pay.
<p><b>That's that</b><br>
The Samaritans and Childline said their telephone counsellors were on standby for a wave of calls from distraught teenagers after pop heart-throbs Take That said they were splitting up.
<p><b>Pink pound</b><br>
A Manchester entrepreneur launched plans for what he claims will be the world's first gay shopping centre, including a dry cleaners which will launder frocks for transvestites.</td></tr></table></p></center>

Precious lack of progress had brought on a new lunch-time habitfor him. "We've talked to the lot on all 14 floors, but nothing pans out to murder. What I can't figure out is if Rathbone was foundlying on his back, he was facing 'Market Forces'. Why didn't he atleast get out of the way when it fell? We really don't know whodunnit,howdunnit or even whydunnit. It's not for lack of leads, because no one is holding back. "There's an information glut. Ask a simple questionand you get a editorial on some advanced topic. "Who ever murdered Rathbone is one cool customer with not a hint of guilt. <I>TheEconomist</I> just continues on in chaos as usual." </P><P> "Don't talk to me about chaos." Greg looked gaunt and pale. He had quit drinking at lunch and ate very little. "I asked Dr. Hamiltonhow she found anything in those heaps of papers around her office. She went on for half an hour about how she uses 'Chaos Theory' toorganize her files. But could she find a copy of the Magna Carta? You know, she retrieved it in less than 15 seconds. I haven't aclue what she was talking about." </P><P> After a week of working with <I>The Economist</I> staff, two detectives had a closer kinship. </P><P> Greg brightened up. "You would think these brains with their degrees in economics would be filthy rich. But no! I found from thepost-room fellows that Rathbone supplemented his income by writing under a pseudonym for the tabloids." </P><P> "That's better than writing under no name for <I>The Economist</I>." </P><P> "But that's not all. Strachey was in on it, too. In fact probably the whole staff were supplementing their income to some degree.Rathbone was the main one, because he had the contacts. These workaholics were not only putting out <I>The Economist</I> every week,they were writing a good percentage of Britain's finest rags! But the best irony of all was that Julia Barrington was their editor. Shewould cut and mark their copy mercilessly and have them rewrite it over and over. She would browbeat them until their column had the"right" degree of low brow to meet the market. She read widely in her niche and had a deep understanding of that genre." Greg had pickedup some nasty big words lately. </P><P> "Do you think there was blackmail?", Asquith was trying to work out the implications. "No, I don't see how. You know, all we'vedone is write huge reports and get nowhere. The chief wants someone behind bars and quickly." </P><P> "The only one who wasn't moonlighting was Hodgskin. "Greg got back onto his subject. "Thirty years ago he had a brilliant careerahead of him. Politically and economically he fitted right in with <I>The Economist</I> and its readers. At that time you could have onephilosophy for life. Now it's all constant change, no structure to hang data on, to plan a direction for the future. Hodgskin's just afrustrated burnt out old crisp but still a man of absolute principle. I rather relate to that." </P><P> "I went to check out the artist who made the 'Market Forces' sculpture." Asquith changed topics. "He is the oddest one yet, morelike New Age technical borfin than an artist. Talked about electrical auras, force fields, machine-human telepathy and machine-humanempathy, what ever that is. Builds all his own electronics, you know. The sculpture is just the cover for his gadgets. The only thing Iunderstood was that his gizmos need lots of power and the batteries are really heavy. To save power it turns on and off, intermittently.He stuffed all the equipment into the top of the pyramid. That's why it took so much effort to correct 'Market Forces' yet one personcould bring it crashing down. Moreover, I think <I>The Economist</I> crew like this sculpture because they are taken in with all thearty-technical jargon. He says they like his sculpture because it talks to them literally." </P><P> "Yes, more interesting information, but how does it help solve the case?" asked Greg. </P><P> "You are right. No use at all." Asquith was going to order another pint. </P><P> "Back to work." said Greg. </P><B><I>Later that Same Day </I></B> <br> Asquith was leaving <I>The Economist</I> after a discouraging afternoon; not that it was anydifferent from any other afternoon on this case. His head ached. The mystery was in a fog. Couldn't the case just go away. Couldn't hejust go back to dealing with simple thugs and punks. Wouldn't it be nice to have some extra cash to spend on his upcoming vacation.Wouldn't it be great.... </P><P> Crossing the plaza he became aware of a pleasant feeling of wellbeing. There was a quiet humming in the air, though he couldn'timmediately locate the source. He was now quite sure it was trying to communicate something to him. Had one of the sculpturesturned itself on? Maybe the statues of Walter Bagehot or Sir James Wilson had been upgraded. No, they didn't do anything for him. Look!There, above 'Market Forces', a faint glow. It's getting clearer. An apparition? A wad of cash? A big wad of cash! </P><P> He found purchase for his feet on the bottom ridge of the pyramid, and a spot for his left hand about the apex. He reached for thecash, but it exceeded his grasp. As he stretched, the invisible hand of gravity brought down 'Market Forces'. </P><!--Body text above this line--> <p align=center> <a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> HomePage</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?851130000,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; -&nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> </p> <p align=center><font size=-1> </p> </td></tr></table></body></html>

<h3>Ending written by <i>Shaiontoni Bose</i></h3>
<p>
<!--Body text below this line-->

<I><B>Friday evening</B></I>

<BR>
"Until these questions are satisfactorily answered I don't see how we can wrap up the case."

<P>
"Well," mused Asquith, " Julia may not be as dim as all that. After all she had access to her own
e-mail . She could have found out he was cheating on her and been conducting some assignation on the
side. The fur coat could have been a gift from some well-heeled old pussy who liked Rathbone's long
nose and copiously gelled wavy locks."
</P>

<P>
Greg whistled, "what a lot of big words you do know, lad! Ever thought of writing for them?"
</P>

<P>
Asqiuth, who had, blushed prettily but forbore to comment.
</P>

<P>
Greg, having caught him on the wrong foot, pursued his advantage. "I notice you too are moving along
the lines of <I>Cherchez la Femme</I>."
</P>

<P>
"We have to explore all possibilities, sir", Asquith replied . "I still think we should look at it
from an intellectual angle. These people don't quite think like - well- like, er,normal people do."
</P>

<P>
"Well said," said Greg. 'In fact, I wonder if there are any normal people left in this world. I'm
getting frazzled myself. By the time I've finished here I'll be ready for the ruddy loony bin. Never
seen so many suspicious characters lurking around altogether. Why don't they ever sign any of their
articles in their mag ?"
</P>

<P>
Asquith ventured, "They call it bylines, sir, not signatures. It's a paper, not a magazine."
</P>

<P>
Greg snorted. 'Why do they want to be anonymous? That Editor chappie - he doesn't even have a mug
shot in that history book about the paper. One gent has a magazine hiding his face. What's he in a
photograph for then? Have you seen the size of that tome?
</P>


<P>
"In Pursuit of Reason" by R.U. Nutty. It's a wonder that isn't the murder weapon instead."
</P>

<P>
"What was that last thing you said, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"About the book?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes sir, being the murder weapon."
</P>

<P>
"And the sculpture could have been used to cover up evidence. Rathbone wouldn't have to be standing
around waiting to be mashed. He could be brained, if you'll pardon the expression, elsewhere and then
dragged to the present scene of the crime."
</P>

<P>
"Let's see what Forensic says".
</P>

<P>
"If we do consider the book as a possible murder weapon how do we prove it ? Everybody will possess a
copy .
</P>

<P>
"Everybody should .We could check the ones who don't and find out why while we wait for Forensic".
</P>

<P>
Almost every one who had been given their copy of "In Pursuit of Reason" still possessed it .
</P>

<P>
Three people couldn't account for its absence. One was Thomas St. Loe Rathbone for obvious reasons.
One was Geoffrey Hodgskin whose nervousness increased under stringent questioning.. One was the
author of the book, a regular visitor to the paper and its library. She sounded like she wished
sometimes (only sometimes) that she had never written the book.
</P>

<P>
"That Rathbone was always snooping.He wanted to know what dirt I'd dug up on the paper. Snide remarks
were a habit with him. If I were to do him an injury I'd have done it during the writing of the book!"
declared Ms. Nutty. 'Why don't I have even one copy? I can't stand the sight of it ! Do you realize
the kind of paperwork and organisation it required? Anyway, believe me I only write about murders to
get them out of my system. I wasn't on the premises within the last few days. I can prove it." And she
did.
</P>

<P>
"This one-upwomanship can get a little trying ," said Greg as he checked the list of names. "Perhaps
we should look for the book and the lever in the same place. If the book has anything to do with all
this, that is. Is there a paper shredder in this place?." He grinned with pleasure, " They'll get their
knickers in a twist over this in Production but you had better check if they do possess anything so
organised.Are the shreds thrown away everyday or disposed of on a weekly basis. Call Geoffrey Hodgskin
for his daily dose."
</P>


<P>
Rathbone nosed around a lot, didn't he?" said Asquith,thoughtfully but he couldn't con-tinue.
Hodgskin burst in and collapsed limply onto a chair.
</P>

<P>
"You threw the book at him, didn't you-" said Greg.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but I didn't kill him.I swear it. I didn't even knock him out. He made me furious. He came and
sneered at me in the Archives room. He was angry because I wouldn't tell him what I was looking for.
He has --- had --- a habit of snitching scoops off other people. He wrote brilliantly but he didn't
play fair . Someone heard us arguing and looked in just as I threw the book.He can confirm it."
</P>

<P>
"Why didn't you tell us?" said Greg, exasperated.
</P>

<P>
"I thought <I>I</I> was the prime suspect," said Hodgskin, simply.
</P>

<P>
"Where's the book?" Asquith leaned forward.
</P>

<P>
"I don't know." Hodgskin shivered. "I hope I'm not next on the list..." He stared into space,
tonelessly murmuring, 'I'm investigating a scam on the stockmarket. The archives are helpful in
tracking down names and information, even possible sources for scoops. Rathbone knew something too. He
kept insinuating that I give the beat to him because he said he'd do a better job of reporting it
...that he knew more about it than I did. That he even had a list of names of those who benefitted
most. He hinted that some unscrupulous bloke in this office had sabotaged the computers to destroy
data that had been collected.That he would expose him when the time came"..........
</P>

<P>
Geoffrey Hodgskin suddenly stopped short and looked at Greg and Asquith as they shouted, "Who was it
who opened the door?"
</P>

<P>
"Donald Barrington", Hodgskin whispered, "wanted to meet me at The Royal Arms tonight.
</P>

<P>
"Why did you jeopardise a perfectly good career?" asked Greg.
</P>

<P>
"Because I was bored", said Barrington simply.
</P>

Asquith raised an eyebrow.

<B><I>Saturday morning</I></B>
<BR>
Greg sounded forlorn as he spoke to Asquith in their car: "Well, looks like we are stuck. No bloody
light at the end of the blasted tunnel."
<P>
"I think, sir," said Asquith, "we may have to take a different approach, look at things from a more
creative point of view."
</P>

<P>
Greg sighed, "And what would that be young squire?"
</P>

<P>
"Remember those Agatha Christie mysteries with their surprise twist endings? Sometimes you had a
situation where everyone, all the principal characters were the culprits...the murderers."
</P>

<P>
There was a pause in his breathing as Greg considered this, "You think the entire ruddy staff of <I>The
Economist</I> conspired to kill Rathbone?"
</P>

<P>
"You see, sir, it's like in 'Murder on the Orient Express', they all did it ... Sean Connery was in it,
and so was Vanessa Redgrave."
</P>

<P>
"What! Why on earth would film stars want Rathbone dead?"
</P>

<P>
"No, no, they were in the film version of the..."
</P>

<P>
"I see, no need too be condescending now," said Greg gruffly, "but how likely is it that the whole
damn lot of 'em would have killed Rathbone?"
</P>

<P>
"Why not, sir?" John Major thinks he's going to win the next General Election, how likely is that,
sir?"
</P>

<P>
"Good point."
</P>

<BR>
<P>
Both Greg and Asquith were querying Julia Barrington again when she said with tears in her eyes, "You
know, Zoe thinks there is only one way to find out who killed poor Tom."
</P>

<P>
The sleuths leaned forward in earnest ready to receive the information.
</P>

<P>
"She has decided to see Madam Madonna, the renowned medium, the one at Kensington. She will summon Tom
to point out the killer. She apparently holds regular conversations with John Wilkes Booth..."
</P>

<P>
"Aha, I know who that is, that's the fellow who shot Kennedy!" said Greg triumphantly.
</P>

<P>
"Er, no sir, that was Lee Harvey Oswald."
</P>

<P>
"Right now, you were saying..." Greg turned hurriedly to Julia.
</P>

<P>
"Sir, I've got it!"
</P>

<P>
"Well now, not the clap again?" asked Greg maliciously. Julia took several steps away from Asquith.
</P>

<P>
Asquith blushed, "I meant, sir, why don't we get Madam Madonna down this evening and assemble all the
usual suspects on the staff and let her point out the villains."
</P>

<P>
"Excellent -- the benefits of a university education," said Greg reluctantly.
</P>




<B><I>
Saturday afternoon</I></B>
<BR>

"You want me to get all the people on your list here, into the board room for a briefing this evening?
We almost missed sending out our edition because of all that's happening around the world and the
interruption caused by your investigations," said a harried Edward Strachey.

<P>
"Sorry about that, but this is a murder investigation and we believe we may be able to solve the
mystery this evening..." said Greg.
</P>

<P>
At that moment Strachey's phone rings and he picks it up. He listens intently for over a minute then
shouts, "Oh no! Bollocks and hell!" Then slams the phone down.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" enquired Asquith.
</P>

<P>
"Lathbury just found out that Andrew Neil's book 'Full Disclosure' was ghost written by Rupert Murdoch
and Pamella Bordes..."
</P>

<P>
"What, the chap who bought over Indonesia?" asked a shocked Greg.
</P>

<P>
"The same," grunted Strachey, "and that's not all of it, Kenneth Clarke has crossed over to Labour and
the Tories have announced that they are launching their secret weapon to lead them into the next
election..."
</P>

<P>
"Portillo?" asked Asquith.
</P>

<P>
"No, Dennis Thatcher."
</P>

<I><B>Saturday evening</B></I>
<BR>

The two detectives looked at the faces of all the people in the boardroom. Madam Madonna was now
seated at the head of the table and asked everyone to hold hands above it, including Greg and Asquith.


<P>
When she had entered the room, there had been a gasp of surprise from everyone as she was dressed like
the Madonna in a bright silver bikini and a sharply protruding conical bra. "Call me Evita," she had
said, "one must move with the times."
</P>

<P>
Madonna/Evita's eyes rolled upwards and her eyelids shivered before closing. Then there was a sharp
cough as she said, "Tom, Tom Rathbone we need to talk to you, we need to ask you who committed that
murder so foul...who killed you Tom, tell us...so that justice will be served..."
</P>

<P>
"This is creepy," whispered Julia to Sophie Hamilton next to her.
</P>

<P>
"Well, it's more fun then writing next week's leader on why Netanyahu will be a one-term prime
minister."
</P>

<P>
"Tom, Tom Rathbone come to me..." she coughed again, and then she sat upright and there was a
decidedly snooty look on her face as a distinctly Oxonian accent came from her mouth.
</P>




<P>
"Yes, yes, I'm here, what the devil do you want? I was just having this wonderful chat with Matahari
when you summoned me. By the way, hope Jeffers is there because I've also met Adam Smith who said his
book was actually a subtext on the ills of a free-market economy, choke on it you old sod!" There was
a nasty chuckle from Madonna/Evita's mouth.
</P>

<P>
Hodgskin turned red and shouted" "You lying bastard!"
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'll tell you what you want, all of you...I was returning home about midnight that fateful day
when I had stopped for a quick smoke near Market Forces."
</P>

<P>
"Didn't know he smoked," said Donald Barrington casually.
</P>

<P>
"I had first walked over to Wilson and told him that he looked so bloody awful as a statue, then
strolled over to Market Forces when I saw....him, but it was too late, he tipped his hand and sent
that cursed monument crashing on me, before I finished my smoke."
</P>

<P>
There was a tense silence as the medium shuddered and coughed violently. Then a serious demeanour took
over her features and a five o'clock shadow appeared on her face.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, it was I who pushed that ugly monument over that scarilegious rascal, it was I...Walter
Bagehot," the words emerged calmly from Madonna/Evita's mouth.
</P>

<P>
There was a gasp of shock around the room. Hodgskin moaned: "Oh, a miracle, the patron saint is upon
us, praise be...there is a God!"
</P>

<P>
"Do shut up Hodgskin, you're interrupting me. I killed Rathbone because he had no respect for patron
saints. Yes, I want a free exchange of ideas but when I heard him say those words that Monday morning,
"Bugger Bagehot", I knew he had to be taken to task. An example had to be set."
</P>

<P>
"Lord almighty, the ghosts of <I>The Economist</I> past and present...is this happening? What a story this
will make," said Strachey in awe.
</P>

<P>
"Since I am here, I think I ought to warn you about the future. You are in great danger of electing a
new government soon, but your new prime minister will prove to be a neo-Trotskyite."
</P>

<P>
"I knew it, we could never trust Blair!" screamed Hodgskin.
</P>

<P>
"You fool, I meant Peter Mandelson. If you were to ever have another staff member as rude as Rathbone
again, punish him severely and appropriately, if you don't want my invisible hand tipping statues."
</P>

<P>
"What should we do, O Great One?" asked Hodgskin reverentially.
</P>

<P>
"Make them listen for a full hour to a speech by a Singapore cabinet minister, or..."
</P>

<P>
"How cruel, what sadism," said Julia.
</P>

<P>
"Spend a night locked in a seedy hotel room with Australia's Pauline Hansen."
</P>

<P>
"Rather vicious ideas from a patron saint, don't you think?" Lathbury asked his editor quietly.
</P>

<P>
With that Bagehot left the medium as her head flopped onto the table from exhaustion.
</P>

<P>
"What do we do now?" asked Asquith turning to Greg.
</P>

<P>
"We'll have to file a report, but leave it at misadventure? I also think we had better haul Madam
Madonna here to the station for some questions."
</P>

<P>
Madonna/Evita sits up and seems normal again. She yawns and rubs her bristled chin, "There must be an
easier way to make money."
</P>

<B><I>Saturday Lunch
</I></B>
<BR>
"Indulging in chocolates while on duty, aren't you, Asquith?" Greg waved the report that described a
puddle next to the statue. 
<p>Asquith had the good grace to blush. "Mrs. Barrington offered me some
chocolates. I though she would be more likely to confide in me after we had shared a few
strawberry-liqueur-filled bonbons."
<p>"She did not tell you a thing, my lad, did she?" Greg patted his paunch and smiled indulgently.
<p>"The lab report says that the pebble I found was too small to unbalance
Market Forces." Greg said pointedly. "But I learnt from Zoe that Mrs. Barrington had broken the heel
of her shoe on Wednesday." He cleared his throat. "She does wear extremely high heels." 
<P>
Greg nodded appreciatively. "Get to the point, my boy!" 
<P>
"Any solid enough small object at least three inches high,
placed at a proper point, could have been used to destabilize Market Forces. Furthermore, Mrs.
Barrington is unable to account for the present location of the heel of her shoe."
<P> "The Cinderella touch." Greg said fondly. 
<P>Asquith said nervously, "I thought that perhaps you could talk to her. She
has an alibi for that evening and she could not have put that heel there earlier without being seen."
<P>"You could not break her down!" Greg rubbed his hands cheerfillly.
<P>




<B><I>Saturday Afternoon</I></B>

<BR>
Greg was sitting with his head between his hands. The two hours he had spent with Julia Barrington had
confirmed his feeling that with <I>les femmes</I>, as with economists, the curves did not restrict themselves
to their figures. 
<P>"A member of the graphics department had borrowed the heel Wednesday at eight to
hold his drawing board level. He says it's been there since." Asquith proffered the heel at his
understandingly frustrated superior.

<br>
<P>
Mr. Lung, dressed in a three piece suit, stood in front of Greg. "You work for Thomas St. Loe
Rathbone, at his place of residence in Belgravia, in the capacity of butler? 
<P>"Yes, Sir." Mr. Lung did
not volunteer an explanation. 
<P>"With what money did Rathbone hire a Chinese butler?" Greg said
offensively. "
<P>The money from the semi-conductors factories, Sir." 
<P>At that point Greg screamed,
"Asquith!" 
<P>"Sir!" Asquith ran into the room ready to protect his superior officer. 
<P>"Has Rathbone
factories?" Greg asked sharply. 
<P>"We are just running the facts on his laptop. Starting at the tender
age of 11, Rathbone played the stock market and built an empire, not of paper only. His last venture
was in-" 
<P>"-Semi-conductors." Greg finished for him. "What was this mogul doing scraping a living at <I>The
Economist</I>? And why has nobody told me about this before?" 
<P>"It was a secret." Mr. Lung offered kindly.
<P>"Mr. Rathbone felt that if his colleagues at the magazine" "Newspaper," Greg and Asquith said in
unison. "He thought that he would not have been hired if his non-academic proclivity had been known.
That's why he enjoyed writing articles against capitalism." Mr. Lung beamed at the policemen. 
<P>At that
point Greg left the room, presumably to buy a hat.
</P>


<B><I>Saturday night</I></B>
<BR>
"I did not know about it because I just returned from my fact-finding holiday in Polish coal-mines."
The Science editor squirmed. "It was sent to us by the maker of the alloy for our survey of the metal
industry." "When did you put it under the statue?" Asquith asked. 
<P>"I put it there a week ago. It is a
memory alloy and I was testing whether it would work after a week of compression under a heavy object.
The one-inch long spring could not have opened to its full three inch unless it was stimulated by some
electrical current." 
<P>"What enticed Rathbone to remain in that spot long enough to be crushed?" Greg
prodded. "How about a picture of Rathbone in fluorescent disappearing ink, set at a height just above
Rathbone's? Fascinated by his own reflection, and looking upward it would have been unlikely for him
to realize that the sculpture was falling on him until it was too late." The Science editor exulted.
<P>
"Can you prove you were in Poland, young lady?" Greg asked suspiciously.

<P>
"Hodgskin wanted to make a fool of Rathbone, but why kill him? Once dead Rathbone was an uninteresting
opponent who couldn't be made to listen to arguments!" The editor insisted. The dark circles under his
eyes had reached the dimensions of flying saucers. 
<P>"Wasn't the liquid that activated the alloy the
work of Hodgskin's landlady's large, shaggy dog? Didn't we find the spring, still extended to its full
length, holding sprigs of parsley in his landlady's kitchen brought back by the dog? And couldn't he
have trained the dog to push vigorously at an object?" 
<P>Asquith coughed. "Sir? The spot had been
slightly corroded by a regular application of dog urine. It seems that the dog is jealous of the
landlady's paramours and is usually left outside at particular times, and-" 
<P>"And this breed of dogs
tend to develop an inflammation of certain glands that result in a tendency to kick when lifting the
hind legs." Greg said wearily. 
<P>"Have you already seen the report, Sir?" Asquith asked. "You cannot
prove that Geoffrey did it." The editor insisted loyally. 
<P>"Once the lab finds the disappearing ink,
we'll tie the case against him!" Greg said with satisfaction.
</P>

<P>
At 2.00am, Greg and Asquith walked out of the building. Refusing to look at the still-prone statue,
Greg gazed instead on the spotlights aimed at the art exhibit. "Asquith!" He cried. "That spotlight,
there!"
<P>"The one that's aiming into space?" Despite the cmcking of his knees Asquith bent dutifully to
examine the spotlight. "There is a sheet of plastic at the front, with words etched on it." 
<P>Greg
turned suddenly to the student intern who had been looming pathetically close. "What do you know about
this, young man?" 
<P>"It was only a joke! The projection of the quote on the statue was a joke about
Market Forces! I did not know the thing would fall! It's the sculptor's fault!" 
<P>"What does it say,
Asquith?" Greg asked. 
<P>Asquith giggled nervously. "It says, 'In the long run, we are all dead. Signed,
Maynard Keynes.'"
</P>

<p>
<!--Body text below this line-->
<B><I>Saturday morning</I></B>
<BR>Inspector Greg, looking well-rested and cheerful, was at his desk. "Answered those questions for me, lad?" 
<P>   "Four of the five, sir." Asquith sounded satisfied without sounding pleased. 
<P>   "Expect I'll need only two." 
<P>   "Which two would that be?" 
<P>   Greg furled his brow, as if considering what to ask. "First one, how could Rathbone afford cashmere?" 
<P>   Asquith furled his brow, as if considering whether to answer. "Rathbone couldn't. The coat was a gift from the Britain editor." 
<P>   "Two for one," said Greg, his face spreading in a congratulatory grin. "The second question was, why did the Britain editor keep him on? Seems to answer itself." 
<P>   Asquith wasn't sure whether it was Greg or himself being congratulated. "She kept him on, because they were getting it on," he said. 
<P>   Another congratulatory grin from Greg, this one unambiguous. "As I was saying to Mrs. Greg, that Hamilton's a right little raver when she's off duty." 
<P>   "Had a similar conversation with my wife," said Asquith, a trifle disingenuously. 
<P>   "So. Now the e-mail makes sense." 
<P>   Asquith nodded in agreement. "The bogus message to Barrington." 
<P>   "Nothing bogus about it." 
<P>   "Beg pardon, sir?" Asquith's brow furled again, this time of its own accord. 
<P>   "Rathbone dumped the dim Julia Barrington for the brilliant Sophie Hamilton." 
<P>   Having accepted the notion of sex at <I>The Economist</I>, Asquith hesitated to confine it to orthodox pairings. "Barrington said it was a ruse. None of Rathbone's quotations." 
<P>   "Anyone clever enough to intercept messages would spot quotations. If it had been a ruse, it would have included a quotation, so's to sound authentic." 
<P>   "Why did Rathbone?" 
<P>   "He wasn't breaking a date, he was ending an affair. Best to be brief and direct." 
<P>   "Then Rathbone wasn't waiting by the statue for Barrington."
<P>   "Excellent, lad, you're catching on." Greg leaned back in his chair. 
<P>   Asquith continued, "He was waiting for Hamilton." 
<P>   "Sorry, no points. Lost a few, in fact." Greg shook his head and sat back upright. 
<P>   "Who was he waiting for?" 
<P>   "He wasn't waiting. But no matter. What about the crowbar?" 
<P>   "Nothing. We've ransacked litter bins throughout the area." 
<P>   "Rubbish." 
<P>   Asquith tried not to sound condescending. "Which is what we expected, sir."
<P>   "I mean, wrong place to look." Greg had forgotten who ordered the litter-bin search. 
<P>   This time Asquith did try to sound condescending.  "Where ought we then to look, sir." 
<P>   Greg wasn't having it. "Where you ought then to look, Constable Asquith, is in that jumble of trash in the courtyard." 
<P>   "Jumble of trash?" 
<P>   "The statuary thing, the one Hodgskin ran into, think it's called Fiscal Rectitude." 
<P>   "Not any more." Asquith tried to regain his dignity. "The artist came round to fix it Thursday, said he liked the new configuration, left it as was and retitled it Gross Domestic Product." 
<P>   "Honest label, that one. Scrabble about in Gross Domestic Product Asquith, and you'll find your missing crowbar. Tell the lab to check for fibers." 

<P><B><I>Saturday afternoon</I></B> 

<BR>Asquith sat down resignedly next to Greg, who was half-way through his shepherd's pie and more than half-way through his pint. "The crowbar was in Gross Domestic Product." 
<P>   "Fibers?" 
<P>   "Lab found bits of leather on it, not sure yet where they're from." 
<P>   "Not sure?" Greg tried not to sound condescending. "They're from Rathbone's gloves." 
<P>   "Rathbone?" 
<P>   "Think, man. The Barrington thing was over and Hamilton was in a meeting. He'd nothing to do for an hour. So he pinched the crowbar to upend that bloody statue." 
<P>   "Rathbone toppled Market Forces?" 
<P>   Greg took a deep breath and stifled a belch. "Where're the notes on the group that found Rathbone's body?" 
<P>   Asquith fished about in an inner pocket. "Right here, sir." 
<P>   "Who actually spotted it?" 
<P>   "It was, here we are, it was the deputy editor." 
<P>   "What did he say?" 
<P>   "His words, they all agreed, were 'Market forces seems to have come a cropper.'" 
<P>   "Aye, and what did he say next?" 
<P>   "He said, a moment sir, the notes are jumbled, he said, 'No doubt Geoffrey will blame Tom.'" 
<P>   "Why would he say a thing like that." 
<P>   "Got me there, sir." 
<P>   Greg banged his fist on the table, jarring but not upsetting the remaining quarter-pint. "Because it's exactly the sort of thing Tom Rathbone would do." 
<P>   "True enough, sir, but your point?" 
<P>   Greg's eyes rolled up, as if to heaven, but did not roll back in dismay. "My point is, that's what happened. Rathbone upset Market Forces to upset the others, particularly Hodgskin. He'd levered it up to the tipping point when his foot slipped on that pebble you found."  
<P>   "He wasn't using it to prop the statue?" 
<P>   "Hulking gob of junk like that, prop it with a pebble? Rubbish. His foot slipped on the pebble, he lost his balance, and Market Forces fell on him. He flailed about trying to escape, and inadvertently pitched the crowbar into Fiscal Rectitude." 
<P>   "So Rathbone's death was accidental." Asquith's voice betrayed a touch of disappointment. 
<P>   "Not to say self-inflicted," Greg added. He shoveled in a mouthful of shepherd's pie and washed it down with the last of his bitter, while Asquith tucked his notebook and his pride into an inner pocket. "By the by, which other questions have you answered?"
<P>   "The editor had a dim secretary because <I>The Economist</I> needed her husband's technical expertise," said Asquith. "To keep him they had to give her a job. Management figured she'd do the least harm to the operation as the editor's secretary." 
<P>   "Didn't the editor take that as a personal insult?" 
<P>   "Journalists take everything personally. It's in their nature." 
<P>   "Which appears to answer my question about Hodgskin." Greg glanced at the remainder of the shepherd's pie, then pushed the plate away.  
<P>   "Hodgskin took everything personally," said Asquith, "same as the rest. Only thing different about him was, he was honest about it." 
<P>   "Which, I gather, is not in the nature of journalists?" 
<P>   "Not so far as we can determine, sir." 
<P>   "Thank you, Asquith. Oh, one last item." 
<P>   "You wondered why people as intelligent as these like such idiotic modern art." 
<P>   "And the answer?"
<P>   "Haven't the faintest, sir." 
<P>

<P>    "Well, the last is not much of a mystery, sir. Nobody really
likes the art," Asquith pointed out. "Everybody seems to agree that the works
are ridiculous but they are part of the exhibition. The competition to show
the essence of the Economist," he reminded him.
</P>
<P>
    Julia Barrington sashayed by just then, distracting a good number of
the men in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
    "It still doesn't make sense. Strachey has the authority to get rid of
this pretentious nonsense," Greg countered.
</P>
<P>
    "Sir," Asquith hastily interjected, before Greg could start
meandering. "A few more inquiries might unearth the answers. If I
could look into the histories of..."
</P>
<P>
    "Eager aren't we?" the inspector rejoined sarcastically, cocking a
curious eyebrow. "Very well. Do what you will. Within reason, of
course. The competition is still on. Let's see who resolves the
questions first."
</P>
<P>
While he was waiting for Ms. Hamilton to return from a meeting
occasioned by yet another political crisis, Detective-Inspector Greg
discreetly searched the contents of her desk.
</P>
<P>
    "Well, what do we have here?" he murmured. In the upper right hand
drawer, hidden beneath piles of bills and a daily planner, was a
photograph of Ms. Hamilton and the deceased in what could only be termed
a very heated embrace.
</P>
<P>
    He quickly shut the drawer and moved to a place by the window scarcely
a second before the Britain editor entered the room. She studied him
with a wary eye, clearly displeased that he had been let into her office
during her absence.
</P>
<P>
    "Ahh, Ms. Hamilton. I won't take up too much of your time. I just
have a few more questions."
</P>
<P>
    She frowned but politely invited the inspector to have a seat.
    "Let us begin with this art competition. Who first had the bright
idea..."
</P>
<P>
From the atrium, Detective-Constable Asquith watched as Ms. Barrington
took a sip of water from the glass cup. Only then did he approach her
desk outside Strachey's office.
</P>
<P>
    "Ms. Barrington, Inspector Greg must take a statement from you," he
said.
</P>
<P>
    From her seat behind the desk, she looked up with an alarmed
expression.
</P>
<P>
    "It is only routine," he quickly assured her. "He is in the board
room."
</P>
<P>
    The moment she left, he carefully emptied the contents of her glass
into the nearest potted ficus tree. He gave the cup to a man from
forensics. They conferred briefly before the man left for the lab. A
table by the water cooler had been stocked with identical glass cups for
visitors. Asquith filled one of these with water and placed it on her
desk.
</P>
<P>
    "That was strange," said Ms. Barrington, as she returned from the
lift. "I couldn't find Inspector Greg anywhere."
</P>
<P>
    He smiled in an abashed manner which was really quite charming. "I'm
sorry. He must have gone to lunch," he explained apologetically.
</P>
<P>
    "That's all right," she said good-naturedly. "It has been very hectic
around here."
</P>
<P>
    "He'll probably want to talk to you later in the afternoon, then," he
said, before heading off for Mr. Hodgskin's spacious office. Hodgskin
had already left for the day. Between the pages of a large atlas on the
topmost bookshelf in the office, he found a letter addressed to Hodgskin
from a Mr. Cornelius Wilde in America.
</P>
<P>
On his way to Strachey's office from the personnel office, where he had
gone after his interview with the Britain editor, Greg passed the
receptionist's station.
</P>
<P>
    "There is a call for you, Inspector," Zoe informed him, holding out the
phone's receiver.
</P>
<P>
Just as he closed the door to Hodgskin's office, Asquith heard the
turbo-speed clicking of computer keys. He peered briefly through the
open doorway of the small adjacent room which was cluttered with cables,
whirring terminals, and blinking modems. Henry Lathbury sat before a
large computer screen covered with closely set lines of unintelligible
alphanumeric symbols. He was typing away furiously, completely
oblivious to the detective-constable's presence.
</P>
<P>
    Asquith ruefully shook his head, feeling terribly antiquated, before he
continued down the long hallway toward Rathbone's office.
</P>
<P>
<B><I>Friday evening</I></B>
<BR>    "Kipling was right, Asquith!"
<P>
    "Sir?"
</P>
<P>
    "Rathbone was having an affair with Ms. Hamilton, too," Inspector Greg
revealed triumphantly over dinner. "That explains why she tolerated him
when the other editors had already chucked him out as unendurable. It
also means that, like Barrington, she had motive. Jealousy. But she
seems to lack the means, the technical wherewithal, so to speak. Unless
they conspired..."
</P>
<P>
    "Sir," Asquith interjected. "Barrington was not jealous of his wife's
relationship with Rathbone, for it was not a dalliance. Rathbone and
Julia Barrington were brother and sister."
</P>
<P>
    The look of astonishment which crossed the Inspector's face at this bit
of news was more gratifying than Asquith could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
    "I was struck by a certain similarity between their features," he
continued. "I began to suspect they were related but, if so, why were
they hiding it. I ran a check on her prints. It turns out Ms.
Barrington ne Rathbone and Mr. Barrington have been convicted five
times in the past seven years for fraud and industrial espionage."
</P>
<P>
    "What a piece of work," Greg mused, almost appreciatively. "Never said
she was his lover. Just let us reach our own conclusions."
</P>
<P>
    "There was nothing on Rathbone, though," Asquith added. "Stuck-up Mr.
Superior' Rathbone probably didn't want anyone to know that his sister
was a jailbird."
</P>
<P>
    "That's why Strachey was forced to hire her, despite her lack of
secretarial skills." At Asquith's puzzled look, Greg proceeded to
explain. "I asked Ms. Hamilton about the art competition. Strachey had
originally suggested the silly idea. Apparently, he had championed the
concept for monetary gain. Strachey received a hefty commission from
three of the four schools. Yet, he was having problems making his car
payments. His funds were rapidly being depleted while Rathbone was
somehow making enough to afford cashmere. After several minutes,
Strachey finally broke down. He admitted that Rathbone had been
blackmailing him. He had discovered that Strachey's master's degree
from Harvard was not actually Harvard University in Massachusetts but an
undistinguished school which goes by the same name. Strachey feared
that if his superiors got wind of this, they would reconsider his
editorship. In return for Rathbone's silence, Strachey paid him 650 a
month. Strachey didn't know why Rathbone had insisted he take on Ms.
Barrington as his secretary, though."
</P>
<P>
    "So, Rathbone used his leverage over Strachey to find a good paying
position for his sister. I suppose Donald Barrington got his job by
more conventional means?"
</P>
<P>
    "Without a doubt. He knows a great deal about computers and such. 
When one of the staff of the technical department moved to Australia,
Barrington was the best qualified applicant. But damn! There goes our
prime suspect," Greg exclaimed irritably. He brooded quietly for a few
moments. "Asquith, were you able to find out anything more about
Hodgskin? By all accounts, he loathed Rathbone."
</P>
<P>
    "In his office, I came across a letter from an eccentric American
billionaire, a Mr. Wilde, who is sponsoring some sort of economics
contest. The first person to correctly solve all the riddles wins
$1,000,000. I think Hodgskin was convinced that the answers could be
found in the 1840s Economists. That's why he is perusing them with such
fervour. The deadline is only a fortnight away."
</P>
<P>
    "Makes sense. Rathbone had insinuated to Hodgskin, more than once,
that he was old and obsolete and would soon be on his way out. 
Hodgskin's not stupid. He saw that Hamilton and Strachey sided with
Rathbone on every major issue. That's why he was taking everything so
personally. He also missed his last doctor's appointment, so he had
stopped taking his Prozac. With the pressure of losing his job, he was
probably desperate to win the competition. $1,000,000 takes the sting
out of being sacked. A pity Hodgskin has an airtight alibi." Greg
downed the last of his beer and frowned. "That brings us back to Ms.
Hamilton."
</P>
<P>
    It suddenly came to Asquith in a flash. "Lathbury, sir!"
</P>
<P>
    "What about him?"
</P>
<P>
    "Lathbury is a very smart fellow. Double first, after all. And quite
ambitious, too, from what I gather."
</P>
<P>
    "Being intelligent is not a crime, Asquith," Greg retorted testily. 
"Even for a snotty-nosed, little jerk like Lathbury."
</P>
<P>
    "He is a computer wiz, sir. When technical support is busy, everyone
on the 13th floor turns to him."
</P>
<P>
    "His r&eacutesum&eacute in the personnel office did list several computer science
courses," Greg admitted.
</P>
<P>
    "His office is a veritable hacker's paradise. He could have gained
access to the e-mail accounts, read about the midnight meeting, and sent
that fake e-mail to Ms. Barrington."
</P>
<P>
    "And why would he have wanted to kill Rathbone?"
</P>
<P>
    "Professional jealousy. Rathbone was a cocky, disagreeable sort. My
guess is that Rathbone intimated that the next available editorship
would be his. Lathbury believed him, just as Hodgskin did. Lathbury
felt that this was grossly unjust, since he was smarter and had been at
<I>The Economist</I> for two more years. With Rathbone out of the way,
however, Lathbury would be next in line to succeed one of the current
editors. I don't think he worried much about Hodgskin. Probably
thought he was too batty to be seriously in the running."
</P>
<P>    They interviewed Lathbury in his office later that night. At first, he
adamantly denied everything. When, in a fit of pique, he contemptuously
derided them as "feckless gumshoes who conjure up slanderous fairy tales
out of thin air predicated on scuttlebutt, cashmere coats, and pebbles,"
they knew they had him. Only the killer would have known about the
pebble and its central role in Rathbone's death by the invisible hand.

<B><I>Friday evening</I></B>
<br>
After further questioning, Greg and Asquith decided to call it a
day and return to the police station. Just as Greg entered his
cabin, the phone on his desk started ringing. Wearily, Greg
picked it up. "Sir, it's Chief Inspector Palgrave on the other
end," said his secretary.
<P>"Ok, pass the line."
<P>"Greg, its all over," announced  Palgrave "All's well that
ends well and rightly so. I'm sorry I had to hide some vital
details from you."
<P>"What's over ? I'm sorry sir, I don't have the faintest idea
what you're speaking about," replied a nonplussed Greg.
<P>"Greg, Tom wasn't murdered at all - the corpse that you saw
was of some poor soul who had died that very afternoon," Palgrave
said. "But I can't reveal more on the phone. If you could come
over now, we could have a detailed talk."

<P>Later, over a cup of coffee, Palgrave made the revelation.
"You may not be knowing this, but Tom Rathbone was one of the
most respected investigative reporters here. He was currently
investigating some shady transactions carried on by a syndicate
of investment banks, chief among them being the Glarings Bank. It
seems that the top management of these banks had used bank funds
to indulge in massive speculation in the stock and bullion markets
of Europe and Asia. The brains behind this operation, which
was in outright contravention of the law, was one Rick Freeson.
Now, Tom was digging up the facts, when he caught scent of the
wheeling and dealing going on. Somehow, the people at Glarings
got wind of Tom's activities. They were understandably displeased;
their stakes seem to be so high that they've hired a
hit man to do away with Tom."
<P>"The Glarings Bank hired a hit man! Unbelievable!" exclaimed
Greg.
<P>"Well, not the bank exactly, but Freeson,"replied the Chief
Inspector, "Freeson apparently had his hand too deep in this. Tom
came to know this when he narrowly missed being the victim of a
hit-and-run car accident. He immediately contacted us and explained
the situation to me. He accepted that many of his findings
were vague and he needed a few more days to gather the
proof. That was on Monday evening. On Tuesday, Tom closely escaped
another murder attempt, this time at his house. This put me
thinking and I formulated a plan to buy time for Tom, till he
collected the proof he needed."
<P>"We contacted the senior editorial staff of <I>The Economist</I>
and told them about our plan. We would fool others into believing
that Tom had been murdered. Wednesday night, I transported a body
from the morgue that resembled Tom; I had it stowed inside a
truck parked outside The Economist Tower. It was Strachey who
made the hoax call at midnight, diverting the guard. During
that time, Tom was quickly whisked into a waiting
police car while we
planted the corpse near the statue. Strachey had it all neatly
arranged - the statue was levered using a pebble and a crowbar.
One of our boys gave a heave and that was that."
<P>"Oh, now I see, that corpse had been disguised in Tom's
clothes. The senior editors identified the corpse as Tom's and we
had taken away the body before anyone else could have a look."
<P>"Precisely," said the Chief Inspector, "our entire plan was
to convey the news that Tom had died, to the public in general and
the people at Glarings in particular. Freeson would breathe easy
and call off the hit man. This gave Tom the valuable time that he
needed. Tom is operating from a hideout in the suburbs, that I've
reserved for him. Yesterday, he and Geoffrey spent the entire day
unearthing the vital information. Just an hour ago, I received a
fax from him, giving me all the facts needed to proceed on these
banks. Greg, so now we have them in our hands."
<P>"Quite an interesting turn in the case, from a simple murder
to a white collar crime involving some of Britain's oldest and
most respected banks. You had the rest of us fooled," admitted
Greg sheepishly.
<P>"The secrecy was vital for our plan, Greg. Anyway, tomorrow
we have a lot of action on our hands. Here's a preliminary list
of the big shots involved," said Palgrave, handing over a piece
of paper, on which he had scribbled some names."So catch a good
night's sleep, 'cos tomorrow promises to be a hectic day."
<P>
<B><I>Saturday morning</I></B>
<BR>
The morning went quickly and by afternoon, the police had rounded
up most of the directors, as well as Freeson and his accomplices.
Their faces were a mixture of amazement, consternation and pure
shock as they read the arrest warrants.
<P>Freeson knew that it was all over when he saw the warrant
proclaiming him guilty not only of financial crimes, but also of
attempt to murder. Under interrogation, he spilled the beans.
"Yes, we were carrying on massive speculation in the stock and
bullion markets. Two weeks ago, Henry Lathbury from <I>The Economist</I>
approached me, saying he had vital information, which he could
part with, for a price. A hundred thousand pounds later, he told
us that Mr.Tom Rathbone had incriminating evidence about our
speculative transactions, and was going to publish it in <I>The
Economist</I>. Also, he could not be bought with money. At that
stage, we could least afford a public disclosure - it was a
question of billions and the fate of some of the best financial
institutions of England was involved. We unanimously decided that
Tom had to be done away with. But, my man had tried twice and
failed both times, and he says that this murder was not done at
his hands."
<P>
<B><I>Saturday evening</I></B>
<BR>Later that day, the hit man as well as Mr Lathbury were
held.
<P>A party was held in honour of Tom and all <I>The Economist</I> staff,
as well as Palgrave, Greg and Asquith were present.
<P>Everybody congratulated Palgrave on his brilliant plan.
<P>"Excuse me, sir" said Asquith, "but was this the best way to
protect Tom? And what about the e-mail received by Julia?"
<P>"Giving police protection to Tom would have aroused suspicion
in the mind of Freeson, and he could've turned even more
aggressive," replied Palgrave.
<P>"As for the e-mail, that was just made up by me, when
Edward told me that we were doing this just to buy time," said
Julia.
<P>Suddenly, a loud crash diverted everyone's attention. It was
Greg, who rushing out to meet an urgent call, had crashed into
the 'Pursuit Of Reason'.

<P>
<!--Body text below this line-->
<B><I>Friday Evening</I></B>
<BR>"My apologies for keeping you waiting," sighed the exasperated

editor.  "I don't need to tell you what a hectic week it has been. 
Was it too much to ask for a slow news Friday?  It appears that Alan 
Greenspan casually told his waiter that his coffee was too strong.  
Apparently, someone at a neighboring table thought he said that the 
ECONOMY was too strong.  Needless to say, New York stocks took a sharp 
dive before the steak was even served.  Oh well, why have you gathered 
the entire staff here?"
<P>"Well actually," explained Asquith, "we couldn't begin without 
you.  We have reason to believe you murdered Rathbone to preserve your 
domination of the editorial room."
<P>"That's preposterous," bellowed the incredulous editor.  "I have 
been the voice of sanity at those meetings!  Would someone here please 
vouch for my honour?"
<P>Silence.
<P>"Anyone?" begged the editor.
<P>"Well," offered the finance editor, "I have never seen him lose 
his temper or appear out of control.  Occasionally he'll look stressed 
when faced with breaking news or a pressing deadline, but that is always 
ameliorated when he,...ahem, helps himself to the many young female 
secretaries he has carefully accumulated."
<P>"I...I...uh, I don't know what you're talking about," retorted 
the blushing editor.
<P>"He has the libido of a royal," added the clearly envious 
finance editor.  "He doesn't even have the energy left over to even think 
about murder.  His weakness for the fairer sex is his only character 
flaw, if you would even call it one."
<P>"In my estimation, being a snitch is a more serious character 
flaw," said the annoyed editor.  "If word of this gets to the Fleet 
Street reporters hovering outside this building, this publication will 
be further diminished."
<P>"On the other hand, it might shift media attention away from the 
fact that there is a murderer in this very room," said an impatient 
deputy editor.
<P>Greg took his cue to redirect the discussion.  He motioned to 
Asquith that his "intellectual" theory was going nowhere, and now Greg 
would proceed with his own, more traditional, murder theories. 
<P>"Rathbone was a mere journalist," argued Greg.  "How could he 
afford such lavish clothes?  How much are journalists paid?"
<P>"Not nearly as well as the editors," said the upset journalist 
Henry Lathbury.
<P>"Wonderful, now everyone is joining the mutiny against me.  I'll 
have you know, Henry, that working at the internationally acclaimed 
<I>Economist</I> is a privilege in itself," said the beseiged editor.
<P>"Unfortunately, all of the,...ahem, 'benefits' accrue to your 
pants," muttered the finance editor.
<P>Greg ignored the gossip, and instead focused on the income 
issue.  "So how could he afford that cashmere coat?"
<P>"He couldn't."  It was said so meekly that, at first, no one 
knew who said it.  "It was a gift.  I gave it to him."  The voice 
belonged to the Britain editor, Dr. Sophie Hamilton.
<P>Greg approached with tact.  "Is there something you wish to tell 
us?"
<P>"Tom and I," began an emotional Dr. Hamilton.  She stared at the 
floor and brought her head up again.  "Tom and I were lovers ever since 
we hired him.  He was intelligent, daring, and passionate; not like the 
careful, and 'rational' dismal scientists that populate this place.  I 
was with him on that last night.  He made a prank call to remove the 
security guard as he set out to vandalize 'Market Forces.'  I was his 
lookout."
<P>"Why would he do such a thing?" enquired Greg.
<P>"He was a rebel," she replied.  "That's why I loved him.  It was 
a political as well as an aesthetic statement.  I enjoyed the excitement 
of being free.  He enjoyed dressing up for the clandestine operation in 
his coat and gloves."
<P>Asquith saw an opportunity.  "So you decided to murder him 
because you feared that he was dominating the meetings.  He was a 
potential roadblock in your career path.  Afterall, you are young, 
smart, ambitious, and so was he."
<P>"I was his biggest champion," she replied.  "I defended him in 
the meetings, and constantly shifted assignments to him."
<P>"Don't be silly, Asquith," said Greg.  "She obviously murdered 
him because while she was showering gifts on him, he was showering 
attention on other women, such as Julia."
<P>"I didn't mind sharing him," she replied.  "It made him that 
much more desirable.  Besides, I DIDN'T murder him.  While I was the 
lookout, I leaned against the side of 'Market Forces', and to my shock, 
the wobbly thing tipped over and crushed Tom to death.  His hand was 
free, but there was no pulse.  I panicked, fearing my reputation would 
be ruined if I was caught in this childish prank that ended in disaster.  
So I did something I don't normally do: I played dumb.  When we 
encountered the body, I was the first to identify it."
<P>"But you pointed the finger at Geoffrey?" asked Asquith, who was 
still not letting go of his theory.  "Kill TWO intellectual competitors 
with one stone, Dr. Hamilton?"
<P>"Geoffrey was never my intellectual competitor.  I just wanted 
to have Tom's death to have the intrigue and importance that would befit 
his brilliant mind and once-promising career.  I'm coming clean now to 
get our editor off the hook.  Now, Tom's death seems utterly boring."
<P>"Boring indeed," added Greg.  "Also unbelievable.  'Market 
Forces' has a rock-solid base.  One cannot lean on it to make it fall 
over.  One would have to jack it up beforehand and use a pebble to make 
it 'wobbly.'  This implies pre-meditation--not a mere accident.  
Asquith, I think we found our murderer!"
<P>"I didn't plant that bloody pebble.  YOU probably did!"
<P>"Madam, this is NOT Los Angeles," replied Greg.  "Accusing us of 
planting a bloody ANYTHING will not set you free." 
<P>"Hold it," begged Zoe.  "She might be telling the truth.  You 
see, I went to berate Tom for winding up Geoffrey.  Tom was delighted to 
see 'Fiscal Rectitude' destroyed; he said that it was the best 
contribution Geoffrey has ever made.  Moreover, he said it gave him an 
idea to do a number on 'Market Forces.'  He saw it as too massive to 
bring down, so he planned to deface it.  Tom thought that if enough 
'accidents' could happen to the artwork, they would stop displaying 
them.  He had to act soon because they were thinking about purchasing a 
new one.  He showed me the picture: two Laffer curves, side-by-side.  
The most pornographic thing I have ever seen.  Straight from the Benny 
Hill School of Design, if you ask me."
<P>"Tom hated the art because of politics," Zoe continued.  "I 
hated the art because they were so god-awful.  It was the only thing Tom 
and I had in common.  But I knew that merely defacing 'Market Forces' 
would not destroy it, because they would just paint over it--the 
Economist is legendary in its thriftiness.  I knew it had to be 
toppled over.  Geoffrey has an ample frame, but even he couldn't topple 
it during one of his rampages--not without first making the base 
unstable.  It nearly broke my back, but I managed to jack it up and 
lodge that pebble myself--just a little 'intervention,' if you will.  
Dr. Hamilton's accident is certainly plausible."
<P>"It's like I said before," said the relieved editor.  "There are 
no murderers here."
<P>"Apparently not," said a reluctant Greg.  "Plenty of 
skirt-chasers and mischief-makers, though.  Asquith, do you have the 
same empty feeling I have.  It was not intellectual, nor over love, nor 
over money.  It was just an improbable accident borne of a string of 
small decisions."
<P>"Just like real market forces," smiled Asquith.  "Of course, my 
parents told me that I am alive due to a happy 'accident' nine months 
before my birth."
<P>"Let's go drown that empty feeling.  It's the weekend.  You know 
what that means?"
<P>"Steak-and-kidney pie, I presume?" asked Asquith.
<P>"And a pint of bitter!"

<h3>Ending written by <i>Frank Ackerman</i></h3>
<p>
<!--Body text below this line-->
<P>But none of these questions, except perhaps the last, was to be
answered that afternoon.  As Greg and Asquith returned to the lobby, they
found much of the staff gathered around Isaac Webster, the normally
mild-mannered science and technology editor.  Webster, visibly distraught,
was gesturing toward the restored statue of "Market Forces" and talking in
an uncharacteristically loud and anguished tone:

<P>"If you paid more attention to our articles on complexity theory,
you'd recall that market outcomes are unpredictable in the presence of
increasing returns and system economies of scale.  And it's not just
markets that are unpredictable -- one of the classic experiments in
complexity shows that a single grain of sand dropped on a seemingly stable
pyramidal structure can trigger an avalanche.

<P>"So when I looked out the window here and saw our own pyramid, I
thought to myself, I can demonstrate the instability of market forces by
demonstrating the instability of 'Market Forces'."

<P>"Isaac, you're babbling," said Sophie Hamilton.  But it would take
more than a gentle interruption to stop Webster's passionate monologue.

<P>"After spending several weekends analyzing the geometry of 'Market
Forces'," he continued, "I found the exact spot where a single impact
could cause a dramatic turn of events.  I even picked out the perfect
pebble to drop on that spot -- though when I went back to look for it this
morning, the pebble was nowhere to be found.  It's almost as if someone
walked off with it.

<P>"I wanted to try the experiment for the first time when no one else
was around, in case it didn't work.  Midnight on Wednesday seemed like a
safe time.  The science and technology articles are always done by 5:30,
and I thought the rest of you would be out of here by 7:00 or 8:00 at the
latest.  But as soon as I dropped the pebble and 'Market Forces' began to
tilt, Rathbone came storming out of the building, muttering to himself
about a woman and paying no attention to his surroundings.  Of course,
complexity leads to path-dependent outcomes, but -- if only Tom had taken
the path to the right instead of the left!"

<P>"That's the story of his whole miserable life in a nutshell,"  said
Hodgskin with a snarl.

<P>Silence fell on the group for a moment, as Webster bent over, close
to tears.  Everyone else was too stunned to speak.  Then, as Greg and
Asquith moved toward the assembled crowd, Webster looked up with a
disturbing new gleam in his eye.

<P>"Maybe Rathbone didn't die in vain," he said.  "If his death helps
advance the state of scientific understanding, it's not a complete loss."
Louder and wilder now: "Can we imagine that our Tom, like Schrdinger's
cat, wasn't really dead until we observed him? Certainly not.  The fractal
instability of space-time that caused 'Market Forces' to teeter and fall
has finally laid to rest the outrageous Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics."

<P>"What a bore," said Zoe.  "What is he talking about?"

<P>Zoe was not alone in her bewilderment.  To his listeners, all of whom
possessed only modest backgrounds in the hard sciences, Webster seemed to
have swallowed a dictionary, and was spitting it back out, faster and
faster: "Under the now-vindicated many-worlds interpretation of quantum
indeterminacy, there is a universe in which black helicopters actually are
invading America, and another one in which Rathbone is alive and well,
advising a militant Labour prime minister on the creation of more
participatory forms of socialism..."

<P>"Hold it right there," snapped Greg, grabbing Webster firmly by the
wrist.  "Never mind your 'Copenhagen interpretations' -- I know when
someone's gone one Tuborg over the line.  We've got a nice, safe cell down
at the station where you can dry out overnight.  In the morning when
you're sober, you're going to tell us in plain English how and why you
killed Rathbone."

<P>With a farewell shout of "History is governed by chance, not
optimality; 'Market Forces' will fail again!", Webster was led away by
Greg and Asquith.

<P>Moments later, back in the editor's office, a bottle of whiskey was
out on the desk for the second time in less than 48 hours.  "The poor
bloke drove himself bonkers by thinking too hard, didn't he?", said Julia.
"If only he had stuck to those quaint little stories everyone could
understand about rare frogs or engineering marvels."

<P>"Still," mused the editor, "there's something unsettling in that
'many worlds' bit he was running on about.  Is it an unspeakable idea,
like protectionism, or just unthinkable?  How do we know which of the many
possible worlds this has become?  If Julia opens the curtains and we look
down at the street, will we see the comforting stability of 'Market
Forces', an invasion of black helicopters, or something else entirely?"

<P>Julia opened the curtains and everyone looked down at the street.

<h1>The likely winners</h1>

<p>SOME day in the far-distant future the luckiest net-heads will have fibre-optic cables pumping light-speed data straight from the Internet into their sitting rooms. But until then (digging up streets is expensive), keen surfers will have to make do with one or another of the technologies covered in this series of briefs. So which technologies are likeliest to be used?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In those countries with large, established cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> networks--America, Canada, Germany and a handful of others--cable modems will probably be the first high-speed technology to show up. Cable companies are eager to compete with telephone companies, and upgrading their networks to carry two-way data allows them to offer telephony, too. Where the cable companies lead, telephone firms will follow with high-speed <font size=-1>ADSL</font> (asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over their own systems. But they will have to subsidise <font size=-1>ADSL</font> to start with, to match the cost of the technologically simpler cable modems. As the costs drop and use rises, <font size=-1>ADSL</font> will increasingly have an edge: unlike cable networks, the telephone companies do not need to share their bandwidth between many users.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" Wireless cable", as digital radio transmission is known, may be the technology of choice for companies that want to enter this market but do not have existing networks of wires to build upon. But, while good for <font size=-1>TV</font>, this sort of wireless will rarely be the fastest choice for the Internet, mostly because it suffers even more than regular cable networks from the problem of shared bandwidth. For the peripatetic Internet user, packet radio will be a cheap alternative to sending data over cellular telephones, but only in the most technology-mad urban areas. This sort of data-only niche is too small to succeed elsewhere.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today's satellite offerings may be too limited and expensive to tempt many Internet users, but tomorrow's might be better. Iridium and its kin will deliver e-mail anywhere, while Teledesic--if it works--promises to simulate the multimedia riches of fibre-optic cable in parts of the developing world that may not see the real thing for decades.

<h1>The science of smoking</h1><p>NICOTINE is an insecticide. Certain plants, including tomatoes, manufacture it in their leaves to discourage bugs, which it kills by jamming the creatures' nervous systems. It interferes with human nervous systems too and can be fatal in large doses. At lower levels, however, the effect is rather more enjoyable.

<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nerve signals travel electrically but at junctions between nerve cells there are gaps, called synapses, which the signals have to jump across by converting into chemical form. These chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, are released by the nerve cell on one side of the gap and dock on the other side with a receptor protein. Nicotine insinuates itself into this process by masquerading as a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. The signal passed on by the acetylcholine receptors in turn triggers the release of dopamine, another neurotransmitter, which goes on to stimulate nerve cells which seem to be involved in the sensation of pleasure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So an influx of nicotine into the nervous system (something which a good gulp of tobacco smoke can introduce more efficiently than almost anything else) triggers a delicious rush of dopamine signals. But whereas acetylcholine is released promptly by its receptor protein and is then reabsorbed by the nerve-cell that released it, nicotine, like an ill-fitting key which jams in a lock, gets stuck, and prevents the receptor from working again for a while.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nicotine thus has a more controlled effect than, for example, cocaine, which also works on the dopamine system but does so by preventing the re-absorption of dopamine. A cocaine high is the result of dopamine hanging around in the system, repeating its message of pleasure over and over again, whereas after the first buzz from a blast of nicotine, the stimulation declines gradually until the acetylcholine receptors switch on again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The short-term effects of nicotine in the body, including relaxation, alertness and improved concentration, are enjoyable enough to make many people want to experience them again. But the body also adapts to regular exposure in ways that provide a physical basis for nicotine's addictiveness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With cocaine the link between neurological changes and addiction is clear: cocaine-users lose dopamine receptors, so come to crave the way it amplifies pleasure signals. With nicotine things are more complicated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regular exposure to nicotine seems to increase the number of acetylcholine receptors, as the body compensates for having them shut down temporarily, but scientists are still unsure exactly how this physical change relates to nicotine addiction. Research at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York shows that for smokers the process is further complicated by the effect of other chemicals in smoke which reduce the body's store of an enzyme which degrades dopamine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the details of the mechanism of addiction--genetics may play a part too--many people have come to expect a steady input of nicotine into their systems. Nicotine itself, at least at the doses delivered by cigarettes, is relatively harmless. The trouble is that cigarettes also deliver other substances into the body--such as tar and carbon monoxide--which are dangerous. It is these that increase the risks of heart disease and lung cancer: smokers die an average of 6.5 years before comparable non-smokers.

<h1>The British Desease</h1><p>BSE suddenly arrived from nowhere to attack huge numbers of British cattle. It has barely been seen in other countries. Why Britain? Why now? (See <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>)

<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most people think that <font size=-1>BSE</font> came from sheep infected by scrapie. As meal containing bits of infectious sheep was fed to cows, they could have developed <font size=-1>BSE</font>. As bits of these cows were then converted into meal and fed back to other cows, the disease spread.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But why Britain? It is possible it was just a lightning strike of bad luck. But there are other explanations. Few places outside Europe suffer from scrapie in sheep and also raise large numbers of cattle. Within Europe, few countries have rendered down carcasses at low temperatures. And few countries have gone so far as to make 4-5% of their cattle rations from meat and bone meal. Britain has all three of these factors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Feeding herbivores boiled-down animals predates <font size=-1>BSE</font> by a few decades and is widespread. In the 1970s, however, rendering businesses switched from an old-fashioned technique that used a noxious solvent and high temperatures, to the American Carver-Greenfield process, which operates at lower temperatures and was meant to make meat and bone meal more nutritious and appetising.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, however, renderers kept the temperatures unusually low--sometimes less than 100C (which is needed to kill even humble bacteria, let alone heat-resistant prions). In France and Italy, renderers heat the brew up to 130-140C--though even that, according to Bram Schreuder of the Institute for Animal Science and Health at Lelystad in Holland, may not destroy prions completely. A committee of its own experts warned the British government that low temperatures could be dangerous as early as 1980, six years before the first case of <font size=-1>BSE</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps, given modern farming methods, <font size=-1>BSE</font> was bound to crop up somewhere. Perhaps British farming cannot be blamed for that. But the British government deserves criticism for the way it has reacted to the disease.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As soon as other European countries suspected that animal meal might be spreading <font size=-1>BSE</font>, they banned it. France and Ireland (though not Switzerland) have from the beginning taken the further precaution of destroying all animals in any herd that has seen a case of <font size=-1>BSE</font>. In contrast, Britain's record has been mixed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In July 1988 the government was prompt to ban the use of cows and sheep to feed other cows and sheep. This was six months before a government committee set up to study the problem gave its report. In August 1988, the government insisted on the slaughter of infected animals and the destruction of their milk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the July 1988 ban has not been fully enforced. Farmers, who often have a few months' supplies of meal, still had an incentive to get rid of it in the bellies of their cows. Even now, at the back of barns there could be contaminated feed. Worse, with lots of unusable bits of cow and sheep around, feed-makers may have been tempted to smuggle them into food. Nobody knows how much infected material was illegally included in meal. Some believe that offal has continued to be incorporated until recently. That would explain why the <font size=-1>BSE</font> epidemic in Britain has still not been brought under control. Though it has peaked, cases are being reported at the rate of over 70 a week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If meal is still being infected, that is bad enough. But if the problem lies elsewhere, then the implications are no less disturbing. Any infection in younger cows--and there have been over 23,000 cases since July 1988--could mean either that the disease can be passed from cow to calf, or that it persists in the soil. Both these possibilities seem highly unlikely for <font size=-1>BSE</font>: of all non-inherited prion diseases only scrapie behaves in this way. But they cannot be ruled out because contaminated feed has obscured investigations into why young cows died.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result, doubts will remain about the policy of culling Britain's cattle. Calves or the soil might continue to harbour the disease. To eradicate the British herd could cost &#163;15 billion ($22.5 billion). The cull would certainly reduce the amount of <font size=-1>BSE</font>; whether it would restore consumer confidence is less certain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consumers are worried whether beef is safe to eat. Steak almost certainly is. The government has rightly pointed out that muscle (ie, meat) does not seem to carry <font size=-1>BSE</font>. Experiments on all forms of prion disease have not yet detected any infection in muscle. Even if there are nerves in the meat, they do not carry the disease because they are outside the central nervous system. The danger lies in eating pies, burgers and sausages which might have bits of infectious brain or spinal cord in them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beef is safer than it was before the government acted. But it is impossible to be sure that butchers are keeping muscle separate and uncontaminated. It is also impossible to prevent a few infected animals ending up in slaughterhouses. Even if farmers send no ailing cows to market, some animals may be infectious without showing symptoms of <font size=-1>BSE</font>. Abattoirs have been prosecuted for ignoring the rules. And even honest slaughterhouses are messy places. Only in November 1995 did the government stop anyone stripping meat from cows' back-bones. It had found that small fragments of potentially dangerous spinal cord had been left attached to them. Mad-cow disease may not yet be out of the human food chain.

<b>What is the Soros foundations network?</b><p>
The numerous nonprofit foundations and organizations created and funded by the
philanthropist 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>
are linked together in an informal network, the
Soros foundations network. At the heart of this network are 24 autonomous
organizations known as 
<a href="/found.html"><b>"national foundations"</b></a>
and located in Albania, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Georgia, Haiti, Hungary, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia,
Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine,
and Yugoslavia. These foundations share the common mission of supporting the
development of open society. To this end, they operate and support an array of
programs and initiatives in education, civil society, independent media,
Internet and e-mail communications, publishing, human rights, arts and culture,
and social, legal, and economic reform. 
The <a href="/osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute-New York</b></a>

<b>What is an "open society?"</b><p>
An open society is a society based on the recognition that nobody has a
monopoly on the truth, that different people have different views and
interests, and that there is a need for institutions to protect the rights of
all people to allow them to live together in peace. The term "open society" was
popularized by the philosopher Karl Popper in his 1945 book <i>Open Society and
Its Enemies.</i>  Broadly speaking, an open society is characterized by a
reliance on the rule of law, the existence of a democratically elected
government, a diverse and vigorous civil society, and respect for minorities
and minority opinions.<p>
<a name="gs"></A>    
<b>Who is George Soros?</b><p>
George Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1930.  He emigrated in 1947 to
England, where he graduated from the London School of Economics, and in 1956 to
the United States, where he began to accumulate a large fortune through an
international investment fund he founded and managed.  While a student at the
London School of Economics, Mr. Soros became familiar with the work of the
philosopher Karl Popper, who had a profound influence on his thinking and later
on his philanthropic activities.<p>
Mr. Soros established his first foundation, the Open Society Fund, in New York
in 1979, his first Eastern European foundation in Hungary in 1984, and the
Soros Foundation-Soviet Union in 1987. He now funds a network of foundations
that operate in 25 countries throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, as well as South Africa, Haiti, and the United States.
These foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure
and institutions of an open society. In 1994, the network of nonprofit
foundations and other organizations established by Mr. Soros gave away $300
million. In 1995, the network gave away roughly $350 million. Projected  giving
for 1996 is approximately $350 million.<p>
In addition to many articles on the political and economic changes in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, Mr. Soros is the author of  <i>The Alchemy
of Finance</i>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1987 and republished in
1994 by John Wiley &amp; Sons; <i>Opening the Soviet System</i>,  published by
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson in 1990; and <i>Underwriting Democracy</i>,
published by The Free Press in 1991.  Mr. Soros's most recent book, <i>Soros on
Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve</i>, was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons
in September 1995.<p>
Mr. Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social
Research, the University of Oxford, the Budapest University of Economics, and
Yale University.  In 1995, the University of Bologna awarded Mr. Soros its
highest honor, the Laurea Honoris Causa, in recognition of his efforts to
promote open societies throughout the world<p>
Mr. Soros is sole proprietor of Soros Fund Management, a private investment
management firm that serves as principal investment advisor to the Quantum

National Foundations of the Soros network currently operate in 
24 countries across Central and Eastern Europe, the former 
Soviet Union, 
<a href="/safrica.html"><b>South Africa</b></a>, 
and 
<a href="/haiti.html"><b>Haiti</b></a>. 
To select a foundation in 
a specific country, click on a country name below. 
<p>
The national foundations are autonomous nongovernmental 
organizations registered in their own countries and staffed 
by local professionals. The directors and program staff of 
each national foundation are accountable to a board of 
directors comprised of distinguished citizens from 
representative ethnic, political, geographical, and 
professional backgrounds.
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/imagemap/world"><img src="world.gif" border=5 ISMAP></a>
</center>
<p>
The national foundations develop their own programs in 
support of the mission and strategic goals established by 
their directors and staff to build open societies in their 
countries. These programs vary greatly in nature and urgency 
from country to country. Some foundations, such as Georgia 
and Haiti, began their programs in 1995, hiring staff, 
developing priorities, and awarding their first grants. 
Others, such as Hungary and Poland, have been in the 
forefront of the movement toward open society since before 
the revolutionary changes of 1989.
<p>
With the cessation of war in the countries of the former 
Yugoslavia, the foundation in Bosnia and Herzegovina reports 
that, for the first time since its creation in 1992, it was 
able to switch from humanitarian projects to long-term 
programs aimed at helping rebuild education, independent 
media, and other fields devastated by the fighting.
<p>
<i>
The following list of national foundations by the year of their 
creation shows how quickly the network has grown since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the collapse 
of communism in Eastern Europe.

<h4>Biographical Information</h4>
George Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1930.  He emigrated in 1947 to
England, where he graduated from the London School of Economics, and in 1956 to
the United States, where he began to accumulate a large fortune through an
international investment fund he founded and managed.  While a student at the
London School of Economics, Mr. Soros became familiar with the work of the
philosopher Karl Popper, who had a profound influence on his thinking and later
on his philanthropic activities.<p>
Mr. Soros established his first foundation, the Open Society Fund, in New York
in 1979, his first Eastern European foundation in Hungary in 1984, and the
Soros Foundation-Soviet Union in 1987. He now funds a network of foundations
that operate in 25 countries throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, as well as South Africa, Haiti, and the United States.
These foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure
and institutions of an open society. In 1994, the network of nonprofit
foundations and other organizations established by Mr. Soros gave away $300
million. In 1995, the network gave away roughly $350 million. Projected  giving
for 1996 is approximately $350 million.<p>
In addition to many articles on the political and economic changes in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, Mr. Soros is the author of  <i>The Alchemy
of Finance</i>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1987 and republished in
1994 by John Wiley &amp; Sons; <i>Opening the Soviet System</i>,  published by
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson in 1990; and <i>Underwriting Democracy</i>,
published by The Free Press in 1991.  Mr. Soros's most recent book, <i>Soros on
Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve</i>, was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons
in September 1995.<p>
Mr. Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social
Research, the University of Oxford, the Budapest University of Economics, and
Yale University.  In 1995, the University of Bologna awarded Mr. Soros its
highest honor, the Laurea Honoris Causa, in recognition of his efforts to
promote open societies throughout the world<p>
Mr. Soros is sole proprietor of Soros Fund Management, a private investment
management firm that serves as principal investment advisor to the Quantum
Group of Funds.  The Quantum Fund N.V., the oldest and largest fund within the
Quantum Group, is generally recognized as having the best performance record of
any investment fund in the world in its twenty-seven-year history.<p>

About This Site
</h2> 
Because information is such an important part of an open society, we have created a host to serve the broadest possible
constituency. This includes those with only e-mail access as well as those with a WWW connection. Our WWW site is limited in its use of graphics to insure that those in the developing world with low speed internet connections also have an easy time accessing it. We are trying to insure that the entities who generate information for this server have the ability to update the data themselves as well. 
<p>
To achieve our stated goals, we designed our site in a rather interesting way using a mix of Internet tools: 
<p>
<pre>
	User Access (WWW)---} Gopher Server {---(Gopher Mail) User Access 
				   ^    
				   |
			   (G-Mail) User Update 
</pre>
<p>
As the diagram above indicates, we used a Gopher server as a primary engine to store data. This allows users with graphics or character-based WWW access as well as basic Gopher users to view information on our site. More significantly, we use
Gopher mail to facilitate access to our data for those who only use e-mail. Our information is therefore available via multiple
types of access. 
<p>
In order to insure that our constituent organizations in the field who generate the information for this system also have
maximum flexibility in defining its content, we use G-Mail to allow them to update their own data on the gopher. This also
insures that our small design team concentrates more on the extension of this host's offerings than in content generation and
management of local Foundation Information. As Internet connectivity has expanded, many Foundations have created their own sites as well and we have in turn linked to them. 
<p>
The site is intentionally minimalist on the graphics side to allow for low bandwidth access and text versions of WWW pages with the most graphics have been added. It may not be the prettiest WWW site you have ever seen, but we hope to make it one of the most functional in order to meet the information needs of our diverse constituency. The design has the added benefit of minimizing centralized data control and management, (also a function of an open society and a decentralized management structure). Welcome, we hope you enjoy it.
We are <b>always</b> adding new Information, feel free to look around.

<h2>
About the Design Team
</h2> 
A lot of people have been working together to make this site possible:
<p>
<b>Anthony Galietti</b> -
UNIX and Internet Systems Administrator - Anthony is the first line of support for this Internet site. Anthony makes sure the servers are up, information is backed up, and the information is always up-to-date on this site.
<p>
<b>Horace Chang</b> -
Director of Systems - Responsible for our diverse network environment. 
<p>
<b>Bob Horvitz</b> - Internet Program Coordinator and Media Consultant Is responsible for coordinating development of all
our information servers around the network and analyzing what other neat resources are out there as well. He makes sure the
links are set correctly, and the message is consistent.
<p>
<b>Tim Cornish</b> - The original Internet Systems Administrator and Trainer - Tim implemented the gopher server engine and was the original first line of support. He has now moved on to a more aesthetic existence in Vermont. 
<p>
<b>Allen Wong</b> - Former Network Administrator - Initially coordinated our Novell/Unix/Apple network. 
<p>

Communications Department Helped us define the content and lay it out correctly for this rather diverse and decentralized
organization. Thank god WWW is relational!!!
<p>

The team is relatively small given this is one of many projects we are all involved in. However, we were able to put this together in a relatively short time (once we went on-line) because each person
came to the table with a different expertise. An important lesson for those of you who wish to create your own information
server. It requires: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>A person to market the concept and its uses to a diverse 
constituency 
<li>A person knowledgeable of content and how it should be organized A person to integrate the information services in a decentralized 
environment 
<li>A person to demonstrate the service and train others to use it A person to develop and administrate the various Internet 
information services 
<li>A network administrator to maintain and integrate the technical 
aspects of the service 
<li>A person with basic programming expertise 
<li>Users interested enough to test the Internet and the information 
services provided 
</ul>
<p>
Finally I'd like to thank our users, who are consistently adding to the quality and content of the site and our Internet/Automation coordinators around the world who create their own great sites and finally to you, the users of this web site who provide comments to help improve it.<p>

<b>What is an "open society?"</b><p>
An open society is a society based on the recognition that nobody has a
monopoly on the truth, that different people have different views and
interests, and that there is a need for institutions to protect the rights of
all people to allow them to live together in peace. The term "open society" was
popularized by the philosopher Karl Popper in his 1945 book <i>Open Society and
Its Enemies.</i>  Broadly speaking, an open society is characterized by a
reliance on the rule of law, the existence of a democratically elected
government, a diverse and vigorous civil society, and respect for minorities
and minority opinions.<p>

<b>Who is George Soros?</b><p>
George Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1930.  He emigrated in 1947 to
England, where he graduated from the London School of Economics, and in 1956 to
the United States, where he began to accumulate a large fortune through an
international investment fund he founded and managed.  While a student at the
London School of Economics, Mr. Soros became familiar with the work of the
philosopher Karl Popper, who had a profound influence on his thinking and later
on his philanthropic activities.<p>
Mr. Soros established his first foundation, the Open Society Fund, in New York
in 1979, his first Eastern European foundation in Hungary in 1984, and the
Soros Foundation-Soviet Union in 1987. He now funds a network of foundations
that operate in 25 countries throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, as well as South Africa, Haiti, and the United States.
These foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure
and institutions of an open society. In 1994, the network of nonprofit
foundations and other organizations established by Mr. Soros gave away $300
million. In 1995, the network gave away roughly $350 million. Projected  giving
for 1996 is approximately $350 million.<p>
In addition to many articles on the political and economic changes in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, Mr. Soros is the author of  <i>The Alchemy
of Finance</i>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1987 and republished in
1994 by John Wiley &amp; Sons; <i>Opening the Soviet System</i>,  published by
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson in 1990; and <i>Underwriting Democracy</i>,
published by The Free Press in 1991.  Mr. Soros's most recent book, <i>Soros on
Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve</i>, was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons
in September 1995.<p>
Mr. Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social
Research, the University of Oxford, the Budapest University of Economics, and
Yale University.  In 1995, the University of Bologna awarded Mr. Soros its
highest honor, the Laurea Honoris Causa, in recognition of his efforts to
promote open societies throughout the world<p>
Mr. Soros is sole proprietor of Soros Fund Management, a private investment
management firm that serves as principal investment advisor to the Quantum
Group of Funds.  The Quantum Fund N.V., the oldest and largest fund within the
Quantum Group, is generally recognized as having the best performance record of
any investment fund in the world in its twenty-seven-year history.<p>

<h1>National Foundations</h1>

<b>
National Foundations of the Soros network currently operate in 
24 countries across Central and Eastern Europe, the former 
Soviet Union, 
<a href="/safrica.html"><b>South Africa</b></a>,     
and                                                  
<a href="/haiti.html"><b>Haiti</b></a>.              
To select a foundation in 
a specific country, click on a country name below. 
<p>
The national foundations are autonomous nongovernmental 
organizations registered in their own countries and staffed 
by local professionals. The directors and program staff of 
each national foundation are accountable to a board of 
directors comprised of distinguished citizens from 
representative ethnic, political, geographical, and 
professional backgrounds.
<p>
The national foundations develop their own programs in 
support of the mission and strategic goals established by 
their directors and staff to build open societies in their 
countries. These programs vary greatly in nature and urgency 
from country to country. Some foundations, such as Georgia 
and Haiti, began their programs in 1995, hiring staff, 
developing priorities, and awarding their first grants. 
Others, such as Hungary and Poland, have been in the 
forefront of the movement toward open society since before 
the revolutionary changes of 1989.
<p>
With the cessation of war in the countries of the former 
Yugoslavia, the foundation in Bosnia and Herzegovina reports 
that, for the first time since its creation in 1992, it was 
able to switch from humanitarian projects to long-term 
programs aimed at helping rebuild education, independent 
media, and other fields devastated by the fighting.

The following list of national foundations by the year of their

<blockquote>
Open society is a form of social organization based on the recognition that 
nobody has a monopoly on the truth, that different people have different views 
and different interests, and that there is a need for institutions to protect 
the rights of all people to allow them to live together in peace. An open 
society is characterized by a reliance on the rule of law, the existence of a 
democratically elected government, a diverse and vigorous civil society, and 
respect for minorities and minority opinions.

Beginning in mid-1996, the Open Society Institute (OSI) undertook a significant
expansion of its programs focused on the United States. Why is an organization
that has traditionally been primarily concerned with countries making the transition
from repression to democracy now devoting substantial resources to the world's
leading democracy?<p>
The answer lies in the observation that the values of 
<a href="/faq.html"><b>open society</b></a>
are in disrepair in the United States. 
Schools in many inner-city communities are
barely functioning, leaving large numbers of children poorly educated and
unprepared for the future. An increasing reliance on imprisonment as the
response to crime has resulted in a soaring incarceration rate. Commercial
success has eclipsed other standards for judging achievement in fields such as
law, medicine, and journalism, to the detriment of professional ethics and
public confidence. The arts too have become increasingly subject to the
vagaries of the marketplace.<p>
Finally, in today's United States, democracy itself is not functioning very
well. A smaller proportion of the population votes than in other developed
countries. Political campaigns have become increasingly negative and divisive,
and running for office has become so expensive as to virtually exclude those
who eschew contributions from political action committees or who are not
themselves wealthy.<p>
<h2>Program Areas</h2>
In establishing new programs to deal with these concerns, the Open Society
Institute builds on two U.S.-focused programs, established in 1994: 
<a href="http://www.lindesmith.org"><b>The Lindesmith Center</b></a>, 
a research institute that seeks to broaden the debate on
drug policy and related issues; and the 
<a href="/death.html"><b>Project on Death in America</b></a>,
which works to enhance comfort, dignity, care and relief from pain for the
dying.  In 1996, OSI launched the 
<a href="/emma_lazarus.html"><b>Emma Lazarus Fund</b></a>
to assist
legal immigrants harmed by recent welfare reform legislation, and also the
<a href="/crime"><b>Center on Crime, Communities &amp; Culture</b></a>, 
a grantmaking, research, and
fellowship program that seeks to promote effective and humane responses to
criminal behavior and victimization.  In addition, OSI has established the
<a href="/fellow.html"><b>OSI Fellowships Program</b></a>
to support projects that foster the development
of open society worldwide and to help OSI develop new program areas.<br>
<br>
The following additional program areas are under development.  To receive
guidelines as they are developed, send an e-mail to:
<address><a href="mailto:usprograms@sorosny.org"><b>(usprograms@sorosny.org)</b></a></address>                                   
<p>
<a name="education"></a>  
<b>Education</b>:  OSI is developing guidelines for programs that seek to build
a stronger and more diverse constituency for effective, free, public education;
provide arts and enrichment programs, instruction and training in contemporary
science and technology; involve parents in their children's schooling; and
encourage and support good teaching.<p>
<a name="health"></a>  
<b>Reproductive Health and Choice</b>:  OSI is developing guidelines that aim
to reduce a rate of teenage pregnancy that is higher in the United States than
in any other developed country; enhance access to safe and effective
contraception for women of all ages; promote awareness about sex and
reproduction at the earliest appropriate opportunities; encourage sexual
responsibility in young men and boys; and protect women's control over their
reproductive lives, through support for abortion rights and contraceptive
advances.<p>
<a name="arts"></a>  
<b>Arts and Culture</b>:  In an environment where arts and cultural activities 
are increasingly marginalized by the commercial marketplace, OSI is 
interested in programs that support shared public cultural experiences, 
particularly among low-income communities; scout and support young talents; 
and restore a sense of civic obligation to support the arts.<p>
<a name="ethics"></a>  
<b>Professional Ethics and Standards</b>:  OSI is interested in programs that
aim to reverse the trend toward treating professions simply as businesses.  In
the law, OSI will consider programs that support changes in the content and
financing of legal education to encourage careers that serve the public
interest, particularly providing legal representation for the poor; that
strengthen pro bono activity by the private bar; and that counter restrictions
on legal advocacy for social change and mounting attacks on the independence of
the judiciary.<p>
In medicine, OSI will consider programs that help restore a professional
commitment to the care and treatment of all patients, regardless of means;
protect the confidentiality of the physician/patient relationship from new
assaults under managed care and other regulatory schemes; and deal with issues
of schooling and public interest work similar to those in the legal
profession.<p>
In journalism, OSI will consider programs that encourage more professional
responsibility without in any way infringing on First Amendment rights; provide
space for minority perspectives and analysis in a media marketplace where
control is increasingly centralized in a handful of large corporations; and
promote stronger coverage of community issues-- on radio and television, in
particular--in order to foster more informed civic participation at the local
level.<p>
<a name="political"></a>  
<b>Political Reform:</b>  OSI will consider programs that promote a
constitutional and practical system of election campaign financing that makes
it possible for citizens who are not wealthy, or tethered to powerful
commercial interests, to run for public office; programs that promote a less
cumbersome means of access to the ballot and voter registration; and electoral
practices that enhance civic participation.<p>
<a name="principles"></a>  
<h2>Operating Principles</h2>
The programs supported and operated by the Open Society Institute in the United
States will be diverse, eclectic, and fluid. But our activities will be
governed by a set of basic principles, including:<p>
<b>Fallibility</b>: The concept of open society is based on the recognition
that our understanding of the world in which we live is inherently imperfect.
As G.K. Chesterton said of Buddhism, open society is "not a creed, but a
doubt." Recognizing that human understanding will always be imperfect, OSI
opposes the notion that there is any single blueprint that can serve as a
solution to social problems. Foundations often forget that they are fallible;
grant applicants are unlikely to remind them.  In expanding its U.S. programs,
OSI will keep in mind that actions have unintended consequences and that good
intentions are not sufficient to ensure good results. In promoting the values
of open society, OSI will follow a process of trial and error rather than a
grand design.<p>
<b>Debate</b>: A society in which all ideas are subject to scrutiny and debate
is a society more tolerant of dissent and minorities, and one more conducive to
progress in social welfare and innovation in scholarship, science, and culture.
The Open Society Institute will work to strengthen public discourse,
particularly in areas thought to be taboo or where one side of the argument
dominates and drowns out the other, because suppressing discussion and
information exacerbates virtually every social crisis and impedes real
solutions.<p>
<b>Self-Government</b>: The Open Society Institute will focus on programs and
approaches that help people acquire or strengthen the ability to help
themselves. The Open Society Institute will be on the lookout for grassroots
initiatives and alert to the possibilities for replication in other
communities. Closely related to our interest in fostering debate and discussion
is our desire to enhance the capacity of marginalized groups to be heard -- to
affect public events and decisions through their own voices, and not simply
through reliance on others.<p>
<b>Strengthening Communities and Families</b>: "Community" can sometimes be a
code word for conformity or majoritarianism. The protection of individual
rights is the cornerstone of any open society, but no open society can thrive
if it is only a collection of self-interests. The Open Society Institute will
try to promote shared civic ethics and experiences, including support for
public art and culture and community service. The family is an element of civil
society that is sometimes overlooked. A focus on factors that undermine the
family might link work on teenage pregnancy rates that perpetuate a cycle of
ignorance and poverty; foster care policies that intervene and break up
families rather than offer support; schools that shut parents out; and a
criminal justice system that removes vast numbers of young men -- and,
increasingly, women -- from any meaningful family or community ties.<p>
<a name="approaches"></a>  
<h2>Operating Approaches</h2>
The programs supported and operated by the Open Society Institute in the United
States will also be guided by a set of basic operating approaches,
including:<p>
<b>Partnership</b>: Millions of dollars and hours have already been spent on
many of the areas in which OSI has chosen to work. Consequently, in many
instances, OSI will seek partnerships with existing organization or
individuals. To target resources effectively, OSI needs to know what has been
tried, what is working, what isn't, and where it is too soon to tell. In
addition, many areas, such as inner-city education, are so massive that no
single funder can have a significant impact operating in isolation.<p>
<b>Targeting</b>: Because the United States is such a vast country, OSI may, at
least initially, choose to focus on two or three cities and make a concerted
effort around only certain issues, such as education and criminal justice. In
selecting target cities, OSI will consider cities or communities of manageable
size, with promising possibilities for governmental, institutional, activist,
and philanthropic partners.<p>
<b>Services</b>: The Open Society Institute supports ideas and debate because
they are crucial to an open society and because they produce innovative and
novel approaches to serious social problems. But OSI's U.S. programs will focus
on supporting tangible programs, such as debate programs that foster
communication and advocacy skills in inner-city high school students;
transportation programs that make it easier for families to maintain ties with
their incarcerated relatives; needle exchange programs that reduce health harms
to addicts; hospices that ease suffering in the final days for the dying.<p>
<b>Investment in People</b>: The Open Society Institute's programs in the
United States will place a strong emphasis on education and training,
particularly of young people. Many of our new U.S. initiatives will provide
support for fellowships, internships, scholarships and research projects.<p>
<b>Affecting the Debate</b>: In selecting grantees, OSI will be particularly
responsive to those which have well-developed strategies for influencing public
awareness and discussion about the issues with which they are concerned, and
OSI will try to assist them in that regard. On all of the issues with which OSI
is concerned, the Institute will look for opportunities to advance new ideas in
the relevant community of leaders, scholars, and activists, through activities
such as roundtables, working groups, lectures, and seminars. To reach a broader
public, OSI will make use of new media such as the Internet, more traditional
means, such as pamphlets and other <a href="/publicat.html"><b>publications</b></a>.<p>
<b>Flexibility</b>: Whatever OSI's efforts to plan a program of activity in the
United States, important areas will inevitably be overlooked, or events will
add issues or shift priorities. In making preliminary choices among the many
issues pertinent to open society, OSI acknowledges that there are many other
issues that may deserve more focused attention in the future. The Open Society
Institute may also wish to support some institutions and initiatives that fall
outside our articulated areas of concern, or that play an important role in
fostering an open society across a number of areas of concern to us.

<h2>
From the 1995 Annual Report
</h2>

The Central European University (CEU) seeks to provide high-
quality, internationally recognized, postgraduate education 
in subjects particularly neglected or distorted over the 
last 40 to 70 years under the communist regimes of Central 
and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In addition 
to providing academic training, the university helps 
students find appropriate positions at institutions in their 
home countries, thus strengthening the development of open 
societies.
<p>
The CEU's faculty and students are a richly international 
body, drawn from over 47 countries in Eastern Europe, 
Western Europe, North America, China, and Africa. Each of 
the university's nine departments is able to grant up to 45 
full scholarships for students from the region, covering 
tuition, room and board, travel costs, and stipends, as well 
as up to two tuition waivers for students from the West.
<p>
In June 1995, the CEU graduated its fourth class of 243 
students representing 37 countries. Just under 450 students 
enrolled in the university's nine programs in the 1995-96 
academic year.
<p>
The CEU took several steps in 1995 toward consolidating its 
role as a leading academic institution in the region. The 
university opened a new teaching site in Poland where, since 
September, the department of sociology has operated in 
affiliation with the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology 
of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Further consolidating its 
presence in the region, the university received recognition 
from the governments of both Hungary and Poland.
<p>

Recognition as a Ph.D.-granting Institution
In February 1996, the Board of Regents of the State of New 
York, which charters the CEU, recognized the university as a 
Ph.D.-granting institution after a year-long evaluation. In 
a similar process, the Open University in England authorized 
the university, its international relations and European 
studies programs, and its program in nationalism to grant 
Ph.D. degrees.
<p>
An external review committee of leading medievalists 
evaluated the medieval studies program, which then was 
approved by the New York Board of Regents as a Ph.D. 
program. The master's program in economics was revamped for 
the 1995-1996 academic year. Students now spend a first year 
of introductory study at the University of Essex in the 
United Kingdom, then finish the program with a second year 
of transitional economics in Budapest.
<p>
European studies expanded its core program to form a new 
department in international relations and European studies. 
The new department helped introduce a student internship 
program with the 
<a href="omri.html"><b>Open Media Research Institute</b></a>.
<p>
In September 1995, the Centre for the Study of Nationalism 
launched a predoctoral fellowship program for CEU graduates. 
Ten students pursued this program during the academic year. 
The university experienced a great loss with the death of 
Ernest Gellner, director of the Centre for the Study of 
Nationalism, in November.
<p>
The Budapest campus moved from its former location in Buda 
to the heart of Pest. The administration is now housed in a 
fully restored 19th century palace while half of the 
academic departments and the CEU-Budapest library are 
located in a newly constructed ten-story tower designed by 
the Hungarian architect Laszlo Ivanyi. Other academic 
departments and services are located in an adjoining 
building which was renovated in 1995. In December, the CEU 
opened a 420-room residential and conference center on the 
outskirts of Pest.

<h2>
CEU Press                    
</h2>
The Central European University Press is the only publishing 
house working in the region dedicated to broadening the 
range of literature currently available in the English 
language on topics concerning Central and Eastern Europe. 
Its titles are directed toward scholars, policy makers, 
journalists, and the business community.
<p>
Among the highlights of 1995 were the publication of 
Socialism, Capitalism, Transformation, a volume of essays by 
Leszek Balcerowicz, architect of Poland's economic reforms, 
and a translation of Jerzy Szacki's most recent book 
Liberalism After Communism, the Polish edition of which was 
awarded Menzione Speciale by the jury of the Premio Europeo 
Amalfi. Two new series are being published in addition to 
the long-running CEU Privatization Reports. The first, 
Corporate Governance in Central Europe and Russia, is a 
joint World Bank/CEU Privatization Project initiative. The 
second, Central European Classics, is edited by Timothy 
Garton Ash and features English translations of some of the 
best Central and Eastern European fiction writers from the 
19th and 20th centuries.
<p>

A separate CEU Press Translation Project is administered by 
the 
<a href="copress.html"><b>Open Society Institute Regional Publishing Center</b></a>. 
The 
Translation Project supports the publication of 20 to 30 
translations in each participating country each year.

<h2>
About the University
</h2>
The Central European University (CEU), established in 1990 with 
study centers in Prague and Budapest, seeks to provide high-quality, 
internationally recognized, postgraduate education in subjects 
particularly neglected or distorted over the last 40-70 years under 
the communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
In addition to providing academic training, the University helps students find appropriate positions at institutions in their home countries, thus strengthening the development of open societies.<p>  
     
     
The CEU's decision to move the Department of Sociology from Prague to 
Warsaw in the fall of 1995, establishing it in collaboration with the Institute 
of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy
 of Sciences, underlines the importance the CEU places on its role as 
a pan-regional institution transcending national borders.<p>
     
The CEU's faculty and students are a richly international body, drawn 
from over 34 countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
as well as Western Europe and North America. As awareness of the CEU spreads, its application pool is be
coming increasingly diverse; the 1994-95 academic year included 
students from South Africa and China.<p>  
     
The University currently has eight master's departments. Beginning 
with the 1995-96 academic year, seven will be in Budapest (economics, 
environmental sciences and policy, history, international relations and European studies, legal studies, medieval studies, 
political science)and one in Prague (centre for the study of nationalism). All 
programs run for one academic year except economics, which 
will initiate a two-year transition economics program in 1995-96 with 
the first year at the University of Essex.
<p>

<a name="scholarships"></a>
<h2>
Accreditation and Scholarships
</h2>
     
In 1994, the University achieved nine accredited degrees in eight 
departments leading to MA, MSc or LLM degrees. Six programs are accredited by 
the Board of Regents of the State of New York, from which body the CEU also has a provisional five-year 
institutional charter until 1997; three others are accredited through 
universities in the UK (Sociology by Lancaster University; European Studies by 
the Open University; Environmental Sciences and Policy by the University of Manchester).<p>
     
Each department is able to grant up to 45 full scholarships for 
students from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (covering 
tuition, room and board, travel costs and stipends) as well as up to two tuition waivers for students from the West. Most 
departments normally admit a maximum of 50 students per year. English courses 
are given to all accepted applicants at the time of enrollment, predominately to strengthen academic writing skills.<p>
     
Scholarship programs enable excellent students from outside the 
region to study at CEU and CEU students to continue their graduate education at 
West European or North American universities. Tuition grants for students from the region are regarded as 'loans' so that 
those who do not return to the region to work are required to pay back their 
grants over a fixed period of time.
<p>

<a name="environment"></a>
<h2>
University Environment
</h2>
     
Each of the three study centers in Prague, Budapest, and 
Warsaw provides centralized classrooms, offices, a library, computing facilities
as well as language and computer training. In Prague, 
students live together on-site or in a nearby student dormitory; in Budapest, a well-equipped dormitory with library, 
computing, and sports facilities opened in 1995 together with a completely new 
campus site located in the heart of Pest on Nador utca. In
 Warsaw, the department will be housed with the Institute of 
Philosophy and Sociology in the Staszic Palace.<P>
     
The libraries are a central feature of the study centers; 
consolidation with other institutions will make it possible to enrich the CEU's 
collections and make new Western materials more widely available in the region, as in the case of the Medieval Studies Library, 
shared with the long-established Etvos Lorand University (ELTE) in Budapest. The
CEU also invests in CD-ROM and on-line access to international databases and shares these services with its academic 
neighbors.<p>
     
The University has its own publishing operation, the CEU Press, whose 
English language publications are distributed worldwide by Oxford University 
Press. In cooperation with local publishers, the CEU
 Press administers a Translation Project, which involves
 the translation and publication of key works from Western social 
science and humanities literature into the local languages of the region.

<h2>
The Transition Project
</h2>
     
The Transition Project, which is affiliated with the CEU's 
political science department, aims at an interdisciplinary analysis of the 
transitions in East Central Europe, conducted by locally based economists, sociologists, political scientists, and legal 
experts.<p>
     
Research findings are utilized in the political science department's 
curriculum and made accessible to the academic public through working papers, 
colloquia, and conferences. On the basis of the research results, the project makes policy recommendations to the wider 
public of politicians, advisors, and businessman. The research aims at a 
comparative analysis of the transition processes in Poland
, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. There are three main 
research areas. They are defined further in the gopher option below.

<a name="privatization"></a>
<h2>
Privatization Research Project
</h2>
     
The CEU's Privatization Project seeks to establish a new 
institutional framework capable of recording, analyzing, and disseminating 
knowledge about the economic transition, as well as translating the information into practical policy prescriptions and actual assistance. The project also trains local personnel in 
public administration and the emerging institutional infrastructure of the 
market economy, as well as promotes new standards of responsible corporate behavior.<p>
     
The project has received wide recognition in scholarly circles and 
attracted a variety of collaborators from the United States and Western Europe, 
resulting in joint efforts with the World Bank, the 
United States Chamber of Commerce, and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)). A number of governments have requested 
the project's assistance in such areas as the preparation of mass privatization programs (Poland, Romania), small business 
development (Russia), legal reform (Bulgaria), and international assistance 
(Russia).<P>
     
In cooperation with the Research Division of the World Bank (check 
original), the Project is conducting an extensive empirical and theoretical 
study of the emerging corporate governance structures in
 the region, including a survey of 450 enterprises in the Czech 
Republic, Hungary and Poland, a study of the postcommunist ownership structure, 
and a study of privatization investment funds in the Czech Republic and Russia. Other projects are defined more fully in the gopher option below:

The FM Alert is an electronic bulletin published by the Forced 
Migration Projects of the Open Society Institute, containing breaking news and updates on people, places and events that concern refugees and displaced persons. It is designed to compliment the in-depth stories featured in the bimonthly newsletter Forced Migration Monitor. FM Alert's electronic format aims to keep pace with developments, supplying widely accessible information in a timely fashion on a wide variety of topics. Stories in the bulletin will provide the international community with early warning of the forced movements of people, and suggestions of ways to ameliorate migration or refugee emergencies. The bulletin concentrates on developments in the former communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the former Yugoslavia, Haiti and Cuba.<p>

<h2><img align=bottom src="/images/point.gif"> From the 1995 Annual Report</h2>
<blockquote>
The year 1995 was marked by the signing of the Dayton peace 
accords for the former Yugoslavia, an agreement between the 
United States and Cuba on Cuban asylum seekers, and 
preparations for the 1996 international conference on 
population displacements in the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS). These events were central to the Forced 
Migration Projects' mission of encouraging early 
humanitarian responses to migration and refugee emergencies, 
advocating humane treatment and protection of those unable 
to return, and promoting measures aimed at averting the need 
to flee. 
<p>
<b>The Former Soviet Union.</b><br> 
Strengthening the role of 
nongovernmental organizations in the former Soviet Union is 
an important objective, not only because of the contribution 
of these organizations to resolving migration and refugee 
problems, but also because a thriving independent sector 
inherently strengthens the growth of civil society and helps 
prevent the causes of forced migration. Therefore, the 
Forced Migration Projects initiated an ongoing survey of 
local NGOs aimed at identifying potential partners in the 
region and exploring ways to enhance their work.
<p>
To create an interactive advocacy network for the area, the 
Forced Migration Projects appointed network members in 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Russia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine, while 
developing advisory and liaison relationships with 
governments and international organizations concerned with 
the region. The Forced Migration Projects made several 
research missions to the region and published reports of 
findings.
<p>
The regional conference on migration-related issues in the 
countries of the CIS could put these regional issues on the 
agenda of the international community and assist policy 
makers and donors in their efforts to address new 
responsibilities. A comprehensive, regional approach would 
include preventive and post-emergency strategies to address 
the evolution of humanitarian action from relief to 
rehabilitation as well as the promotion of respect for 
fundamental human rights. To encourage maximum participation 
by the independent sector, the projects initiated an 
informal conference preparation process, encompassing local 
and international NGOs and independent experts. Meetings to 
exchange information were conducted in Almaty, Kiev, Moscow, 
Novosibirsk, Tallinn, and Tbilisi. 
<p>
<b>The Former Yugoslavia.</b><br> 
In 1995, the Forced Migration 
Projects formed a Legal Policy Task Force for the former 
Yugoslavia. Comprised of lawyers from the region and 
international experts, the task force has focused on the 
establishment of the Commission for Displaced Persons and 
Refugees under the Dayton accords. The task force is also 
advocating for the reform of discriminatory legislation and 
practices in order to secure an environment that encourages 
return, not only to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but to all of 
the countries of the former Yugoslavia.
<p>
<b>Haiti and Cuba.</b><br> 
The projects have also addressed the 
situation of Haitian and Cuban asylum seekers. Our early 
focus on the monitoring of safe havens at the Guantanamo Bay 
naval base inspired the establishment of a Soros foundation 
in Haiti and contributed to the U.S. government's  decision 
to admit into the United States upwards of 20,000 Cubans. A 
mission of inquiry to Cuba in June 1995 provided a baseline 
to monitor the U.S.-Cuba migration accord. To deal with 
future crises, we are working for the establishment of a 
regional mechanism to provide a rapid, efficient, and humane 
response to migration and refugee problems in the Caribbean.

<A NAME="about"></a>
<h2><img align=bottom src="/images/point.gif"> About the Projects:</h2>
<blockquote>
A multitude of ethnic tensions and hostilities has resulted in substantial population 
displacements in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Some 25 million Russians live 
beyond the borders of the Russian Federation, and nearly 70 million people live outside the 
republic of their ethnic origin. With over 130 ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union, and 
nationalism, secessionist movements, and discriminatory measures in evidence, the potential for 
further dislocation is enormous. Official systems responsible for meeting the needs of those 
forced to flee are embryonic and easily overwhelmed. Resources in the independent sector are 
diffused, and nongovernmental organizations are still in formation. In the meantime, suffering 
and loss of life continue.<p>
The Forced Migration Projects are action-oriented programs that monitor circumstances in the 
15 countries that emerged or re-emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in order to 
warn of forced movements and to identify conditions that may cause such dislocations, 
including armed conflict, human rights violations, economic underdevelopment, environmental 
degradation, and other failures of governance. The Forced Migration Projects seek to 
encourage early humanitarian responses to migration emergencies, advocate humane treatment 
and protection of the rights of those unable to return, and promote measures aimed at averting 
people's need to flee.<p>
Working toward a complete, interactive advocacy network involving each of the countries of 
the former Soviet Union, the Forced Migration Projects have appointed consultants in 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Russia, 
Tajikistan, and Ukraine while developing advisory and liaison relationships with governments 
and international organizations concerned with the region.  The Forced Migration Projects 
have undertaken numerous missions to the region as well as a variety of efforts to promote 
better understanding of regional migration issues.<p>
While much of the work of the Forced Migration Projects has concerned the former Soviet Union, recent program activities have also concerned the former Yugoslavia as well as Cuba and Haiti.

<b>What is an "open society?"</b><p>
An open society is a society based on the recognition that nobody has a
monopoly on the truth, that different people have different views and
interests, and that there is a need for institutions to protect the rights of
all people to allow them to live together in peace. The term "open society" was
popularized by the philosopher Karl Popper in his 1945 book <i>Open Society and
Its Enemies.</i>  Broadly speaking, an open society is characterized by a
reliance on the rule of law, the existence of a democratically elected
government, a diverse and vigorous civil society, and respect for minorities
and minority opinions.<p>
<b>Who is George Soros?</b><p>
George Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1930.  He emigrated in 1947 to
England, where he graduated from the London School of Economics, and in 1956 to
the United States, where he began to accumulate a large fortune through an
international investment fund he founded and managed.  While a student at the
London School of Economics, Mr. Soros became familiar with the work of the
philosopher Karl Popper, who had a profound influence on his thinking and later
on his philanthropic activities.<p>
Mr. Soros established his first foundation, the Open Society Fund, in New York
in 1979, his first Eastern European foundation in Hungary in 1984, and the
Soros Foundation-Soviet Union in 1987. He now funds a network of foundations
that operate in 25 countries throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, as well as South Africa, Haiti, and the United States.
These foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure
and institutions of an open society. In 1994, the network of nonprofit
foundations and other organizations established by Mr. Soros gave away $300
million. In 1995, the network gave away roughly $350 million. Projected  giving
for 1996 is approximately $350 million.<p>
In addition to many articles on the political and economic changes in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, Mr. Soros is the author of  <i>The Alchemy
of Finance</i>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1987 and republished in
1994 by John Wiley &amp; Sons; <i>Opening the Soviet System</i>,  published by
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson in 1990; and <i>Underwriting Democracy</i>,
published by The Free Press in 1991.  Mr. Soros's most recent book, <i>Soros on
Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve</i>, was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons
in September 1995.<p>
Mr. Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social
Research, the University of Oxford, the Budapest University of Economics, and
Yale University.  In 1995, the University of Bologna awarded Mr. Soros its
highest honor, the Laurea Honoris Causa, in recognition of his efforts to
promote open societies throughout the world<p>
Mr. Soros is sole proprietor of Soros Fund Management, a private investment
management firm that serves as principal investment advisor to the Quantum
Group of Funds.  The Quantum Fund N.V., the oldest and largest fund within the
Quantum Group, is generally recognized as having the best performance record of
any investment fund in the world in its twenty-seven-year history.<p>

At House of Ruth,
a shelter for survivors of domestic violence and their children, a young boy
tries to sleep. Research shows that family violence places children at risk for
severe emotional problems, difficulties at school, and involvement in criminal
activity. As society continues to grapple with crime in general, and juvenile
crime in particular, House of Ruth is using Center funding to create a clinical
counseling program for children. To protect their privacy, the faces of
children participating in House of Ruth programs are not fully shown. <br>

MISSION STATEMENT
</h2>                                                   

Fear of crime, particularly violent crime, has become a hallmark of life in the
United States. While almost everyone is afraid of crime, research shows that
some communities, particularly low-income and urban minority communities,
represent a disproportionate number of both victims and perpetrators of crime.
To truly address the injurious impact crime is having on our entire society,
the problem must be approached and the solutions discovered community by
community. <br>
<br>
This is not an easy task. But we simply have no other choice. Crime, violent
crime, and violence are three separate, yet very real problems. Incarceration,
the indiscriminate response to these distinct problems, is not always the most
appropriate answer. A nation that incarcerates as many of its citizens as does
the United States cannot hope to remain an open society. We must find new
answers.<br>
<br>
The goal of the Center on Crime, Communities &amp; Culture is to create a
better understanding of and support for effective and humane responses to
criminal behavior and victimization. The Center seeks to turn the current
national debate on crime into an opportunity to reinvigorate basic principles
of individual rights and responsibilities, bolster community integrity, and
promote social innovation. The Center works toward this goal by seeking and
supporting outstanding and innovative programs in the field of criminal
justice; by performing policy and research work in areas of national and
international importance; and by providing academic and research fellowships to
individuals committed to becoming leaders in criminal justice.<p>

The Center on Crime, Communities &amp; Culture funds outstanding service
programs; policy, advocacy and research projects; and initiatives in the arts
and humanities. The Center also seeks to establish funding partnerships with
other private and public organizations to support worthy projects. While our
grantmaking focuses on domestic initiatives, the Center welcomes funding
requests for efforts involving the international transfer or exchange of
knowledge, as well as for non-U.S.-based initiatives which broaden the
international criminal justice knowledge base. Most of the Center's
grants will be for $50,000 or less, with a duration of one to two years.<br>

</h3>
The Center has developed the following guidelines to ensure that all
applications are reviewed in an efficient and fair manner. These guidelines are
not meant to discourage applicants who have not sought funding from a
foundation in the past. The Center welcomes good ideas, vision and commitment,
and requests the cooperation, best efforts and patience of applicants during
the application process. The applicants must submit a letter of intent that
includes the following:<br>
<br>
A one-sentence description of the proposed initiative that states its goal and
the means the applicant will use to attain the goal <br>
<br>
A 2,000-word statement of the need or issue to be addressed; organizational
capacity or individual expertise; objectives; activities or methods;
deliverables or expected outcomes; and (when possible) an indication of
evaluation procedures and identification of an external evaluator <br>
<br>
Applicants for research funding must also include: a 200-word abstract of the
proposed project and citations for the three most relevant studies or other
pieces of scholarship<br>
<br>
A one-year budget with no more than 10 percent allocated to administrative
costs <br>
<br>
A list of current funders of the initiative and a statement indicating the size

<a name="evaluation"></a>
<h3>
Evaluation Component
</h3>
Applicants are strongly encouraged to incorporate an external evaluation
component into their proposal and to identify an evaluator prior to requesting
funding. The Center will assist applicants who feel unqualified to design an
evaluation process and locate an external evaluator if the applicant's
initiative is otherwise judged to be worthy of support and if the applicant
expresses a commitment to undergo evaluation. Applicants in the arts and
humanities should propose measures of the potential impact of their project
which are appropriate to their field.<br>
<a name="grant"></a>
<h3>
The Grant Cycle
</h3>
The Center does not have a restricted grant cycle. Applicants may submit
letters of intent at any time. The Center will acknowledge the receipt of a
letter of intent in writing and inform applicants of the expected time frame
for a decision on funding. The Center may award grants based on the letter of
intent, or after inviting the applicant to submit a full proposal. All
applicants will be advised in writing of the Center's decision.<p>

<a name="monitoring"></a>
<h3>
Monitoring and Grantee Reporting
</h3>
Grantees will be required to present written semi-annual reports on the
progress of their efforts. The Center will disburse grants in two equal
payments, one issued at the time the grant is approved and the second issued
upon review of the mid-year report. The Center's staff will make
individual arrangements with grantees whose grant periods are shorter or longer
than one year. Center staff members or their representatives may make
occasional site visits to grantees.<br>
<a name="training"></a>
<h3>
Trainings and Symposia
</h3>
From time to time, the Center may invite groups of grantees to gatherings for
training and technical assistance, or to enable them to pool their expertise
with others and explore specific topics or quandaries in the field of criminal
justice. Attendance at such gatherings is wholly at the grantee's
discretion and is not a requirement for the receipt of funds.

<h2>
RESEARCH &amp; POLICY<br>
</h2>
Through the research and policy component of its work, the Center seeks to
redirect the public policy debate on criminal justice away from political
preferences and short-term solutions toward the best available evidence on what
the real issues are, what principles must be safeguarded when addressing these
issues and what individual and systemic approaches effectively resolve these
issues.<br>
<br>
THE CENTER WORKS TO ATTAIN THIS GOAL BY:<br>
<br>
CARRYING OUT SCHOLARLY RESEARCH in the criminal justice arena <br>
<br>
FACILITATING domestic and international information exchange on a range of
issues related to the criminal justice field, including crime deterrence,
economic development, prison industries, the use of fines and other civil
sanctions in criminal courts, domestic violence, correctional health care and
prisoners' reintegration into the community after release<br>
<br>
EXPLORING the social, economic and democratic implications of the continuing
expansion of prison and jail populations in the United States<br>
<br>
PROMOTING dialogue on criminal justice policy among diverse players including
politicians, victims/survivors' rights advocates, clergy, prisoners and
former prisoners, family members, researchers and academics, community-based
service providers, prosecutors, defense attorneys, members of the public, and
correctional, probation and parole officials <br>
<br>
WRITING Op-Ed articles and letters to the editor in a wide range of
publications<br>
<br>
IDENTIFYING and advocating for needed changes in the criminal and social
justice systems through a variety of avenues such as publishing original legal
and social science research<br>
<br>
PUBLIC SPEAKING at seminars and conferences; organizing symposia and
conferences; and producing Center publications

<h2>
FELLOWSHIPS
</h2>
The goal of the Center's fellowship program;Soros Justice
Fellowships;is to allow legal, health care, mental health and other
professionals at various points in their careers to begin or broaden their work
in criminal justice.<br>
<br>
Individuals in the criminal justice field tend to receive little support or
recognition for the value and difficulty of their work. Participating in
systems which determine how to handle individuals who have allegedly violated
the law and others who have been the victims of crime is a difficult and often
saddening task. Justice is an elusive concept that people who work on the front
lines of criminal justice;in police cars, court rooms, jails, prisons,
domestic violence shelters and hospital emergency rooms;must define and
redefine each day, for themselves and for the society at large.<br>
<br>
Given the public's concern with crime, the ever-increasing direct costs
of expanding and maintaining the criminal justice system, as well as the
frequently ignored attendant costs of high incarceration rates on families and
communities, it is crucial that talented, well-trained and visionary
individuals work in the criminal justice field. Toward this end, the Center
offers two types of fellowships, tuition-based Student Fellowships and Senior
Fellowships for leading frontline practitioners.<br>
<a name="student"></a>
<h3>
Student Fellows
</h3>
The curricular component of the Soros Justice Fellowships program will be
piloted at New York University School of Law as a distinct grouping within the
existing Root-Tilden-Snow Scholarship Program. <br>
In the fall of 1996, Soros Justice Fellowships will be awarded to two
first-year law students who intend to pursue careers in a field related to
criminal justice. Fellowships will be awarded on the basis of academic
excellence and a demonstrated commitment to public service.<br>
<br>
Student Fellows will receive a three-year, full-tuition scholarship to law
school as well as stipends for summer internships in criminal justice agencies.
In addition to attending law school, Student Fellows will participate in an
ongoing tutorial which will take an interdisciplinary approach to criminal
justice practice, policies and management issues.<br>
<br>
Student Fellows make a binding commitment to work in the field of criminal
justice for at least three years upon graduation or repay the scholarship. <br>
<br>
For the purposes of the fellowship, `criminal justice` will be
defined to include work in juvenile justice as well as the judicial and
legislative branches of government. Fellows must meet certain academic, study
and work obligations in connection with the fellowship award.<br>
<br>
In early 1997, the Center will evaluate the pilot program and determine whether
to continue and expand the program. In 1997, fellowships may be available to
individuals who have been admitted to colleges and universities participating
in the fellowship programs. Institutions interested in joining the fellowship
program should contact the Center.<br>
<br>
Possible areas of expansion include, but are not limited to, graduate school
fellowships in the areas of economics, psychology, journalism and sociology,
and undergraduate fellowships for young adults who have been able to lead
productive lives after spending their childhood years in either the child
welfare or juvenile justice systems.<br>
<br>
Contact the Center to receive a list of participating institutions.<p>

<a name="senior"></a>
<h3>
Senior Fellows
</h3>
Senior Fellowships will be awarded to outstanding individuals working in
domestic and international criminal justice, and, when relevant, in other areas
such as the arts and humanities. Applicants will be required to outline a
specific project in their application. The Center will consider applicants from
both within and outside the United States. Fellowships will consist of a
12-month stipend, along with medical coverage and other benefits. Finalists
will be asked to provide information on their salary needs. As a rule, Senior
Fellows will be provided with office space at the Center and access to the
Center's computer and library resources. Applicants who reside outside
the New York area and who are unable to relocate for the term of the fellowship
may apply as non-resident fellows. For information on application guidelines
and deadlines, contact the Center.

<h2><a name="mission"></a><b>Objective:</b></h2>

<p>
The University Internet Center (UIC) is a campus-based entity providing the campus and off-campus communities with access to two types of resources: (a) financial and programmatic opportunities from the Open Society Institute (b) information globally available on the Internet.</p>


<h2><a name="summary"></a><b>Summary of Program:</b></h2>

<p>

The UIC program was created by the Open Society Institute (OSI) as part of an ongoing effort to support communities involved in education and social activism in the Russian Federation. Throughout history, the advancement of democracy, civil rights, and equal opportunity, and the well-being of people and institutions involved in creativity and learning, have been deeply interdependent. The dramatic reduction in resources available for educational, cultural, artistic, and scientific purposes makes these possibilities increasingly less secure.  Particularly alarming is that due to the lack of resources, much of the Russian Federation is being left out of the information revolution taking place around the world. It was in response to these developments that the UIC program first arose.<p> 

At its essence, the UIC program has two central components: (a) providing 32 provincial universities in the Russian Federation with a fully equipped computing center and multi-media lab with complete access to the Internet (b) administering content based program initiatives for the university and larger community. OSI plans to support via the UICs various projects and programs in the humanities and social sciences, with a particular emphasis on education, independent media, arts and culture, civil society, and ecology. It is our hope that by establishing a presence in the farthest reaches of the country, these centers can better serve the needs and demands of the widest number of people and communities in the Russian Federation. <p> 


The UIC initiative has a program budget of $100 million to be spent over five years; it will be carried out in collaboration with the government of the Russian Federation which has pledged an additional $30 million earmarked for connectivity to the centers (either via satellite or fiber optic).  <p> 

<p> </p>



<h2><a name="univlist"></a><b>List of Universities:</b></h2>

<p>The State Committee on Higher Education of the Russian Federation and
the Open Society Institute have agreed to the following list of 32
University Internet Centers. The first two centers, opened June 10, 1996,
are Yaroslavl State University (Yaroslavl) and Novosibirsk State
University (Novosibirsk). The third center was opened on October 29th at Dalnevostochny (Far East) State University (Vladivostok).  Approximately 10 - 12 centers will open in 1997. </p>

<h3>
The Emma Lazarus Fund Application Guidelines
</h3>
The Emma Lazarus Fund of the 
<a href="/osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute</b></a>
is a $50 million
grantmaking program created to combat the unfair treatment of and
discrimination against aliens who are lawfully present in the United
States. The Fund also seeks to help those individuals become active
participants in American society. Named for the poet whose words adorn the
Statue of Liberty, the Fund was established in the Summer of 1996 in
response to welfare reform legislation that denies legal immigrants equal
access to a variety of public assistance programs. The discriminatory
provisions of the welfare reform laws reflect a broader trend of
increasing hostility toward newcomers to the United States. The Open
Society Institute believes this trend is antithetical to the values of an
open society, which is characterized by a reliance on the rule of law, a
diverse and vigorous civil society, and respect for minorities and
minority opinion. The Fund provides grants to nonprofit organizations that
help aliens who are lawfully present in the United States.  
<p>
<h3> 
Funding Priorities 
</h3> 
<b>Services:</b> Most of the Fund's grantmaking focuses on
organizations providing direct services to aliens who are lawfully present
in the United States. The areas of concentration are naturalization
assistance and legal services.  In both areas of concentration, the Fund
is primarily concerned with reaching individuals who have been adversely
affected by welfare reform. In the area of naturalization assistance, the
Fund supports activities related directly to the citizenship application
process, as well as English as a Second Language and civics instruction
associated with the preparation for the citizenship exam. In the area of
legal services, the Fund also supports organizations that provide other
immigration- related assistance to aliens who are lawfully present in the
United States. The Fund gives preference to proposals from organizations
that target vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations; that provide a broad
range of services; and that work in cooperation with other groups. Where
appropriate, the Fund supports grantmaking collaboratives or re-grant
programs. The Fund also supports technical assistance and training
services for immigrant organizations engaged in activities of interest to
the Fund. The Fund encourages all relevant organizations to work in a
coordinated fashion so as to increase the efficacy of grantee programs. 
<p>
<b>Advocacy and Policy.</b> The Fund supports organizations engaged in advocacy,
policy, and impact litigation strategies on behalf of aliens who are
lawfully present in the United States. The Fund supports organizations
working at the national, state and/or local level, primarily in the areas
of legal and welfare policy as they affect aliens. The Fund supports
public education and information dissemination campaigns related to the
impact of welfare reform on aliens who are lawfully present in the United
States, as well as campaigns to promote fair treatment of these populations. 
The Fund also supports a limited number of research projects related to
welfare and immigration policy, provided that the research has direct and
immediate relevance to the work conducted by the Fund's other grantees.
The Fund encourages all relevant organizations to work in a coordinated
fashion so as to increase the efficacy of grantee programs. 
<h3>
Application Guidelines
</h3>
Organizations interested in applying for funding should first submit a
two-page letter of inquiry along with a copy of their Internal Revenue
Service determination letter. The Fund will acknowledge receipt of all
inquiries promptly and will inform applicants of the expected time frame
for a decision. If the Fund invites a request for funding, a full proposal
and additional application materials will be required. Please do not send
full proposals or other unsolicited materials until requested to do so. 
<p>
The Emma Lazarus Fund makes grants only to tax-exempt organizations as
described in Section 501 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Except under
special circumstances, the Fund does not consider proposals for programs
consisting solely or primarily of conferences, television or radio
production, or publications. Additionally, it does not provide funding for
endowments, building construction or maintenance, annual fund appeals,
sectarian religious concerns, or political purposes such as lobbying,
propaganda or partisan political activity. The Fund does not make grants
to individuals, government entities or organizations based outside the
United States. 
<p>
Deadline: There are no deadlines for the submission of inquiries or of
invited proposals. Grant award determinations will be made on an ongoing
basis.

<h4>Biographical Information</h4>
<img src="/images/gs.gif" hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>
George Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1930.  He emigrated in 1947 to
England, where he graduated from the London School of Economics, and in 1956 to
the United States, where he began to accumulate a large fortune through an
international investment fund he founded and managed.  While a student at the
London School of Economics, Mr. Soros became familiar with the work of the
philosopher Karl Popper, who had a profound influence on his thinking and later
on his philanthropic activities.<p>
Mr. Soros established his first foundation, the Open Society Fund, in New York
in 1979, his first Eastern European foundation in Hungary in 1984, and the
Soros Foundation-Soviet Union in 1987. He now funds a network of foundations
that operate in 25 countries throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, as well as South Africa, Haiti, and the United States.
These foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure
and institutions of an open society. In 1994, the network of nonprofit
foundations and other organizations established by Mr. Soros gave away $300
million. In 1995, the network gave away roughly $350 million. Projected  giving
for 1996 is approximately $350 million.<p>
In addition to many articles on the political and economic changes in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, Mr. Soros is the author of  <i>The Alchemy
of Finance</i>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1987 and republished in
1994 by John Wiley &amp; Sons; <i>Opening the Soviet System</i>,  published by
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson in 1990; and <i>Underwriting Democracy</i>,
published by The Free Press in 1991.  Mr. Soros's most recent book, <i>Soros on
Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve</i>, was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons
in September 1995.<p>
Mr. Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social
Research, the University of Oxford, the Budapest University of Economics, and
Yale University.  In 1995, the University of Bologna awarded Mr. Soros its
highest honor, the Laurea Honoris Causa, in recognition of his efforts to
promote open societies throughout the world<p>
Mr. Soros is sole proprietor of Soros Fund Management, a private investment
management firm that serves as principal investment advisor to the Quantum
Group of Funds.  The Quantum Fund N.V., the oldest and largest fund within the
Quantum Group, is generally recognized as having the best performance record of
any investment fund in the world in its twenty-seven-year history.<p>

The

own boards of directors, staff, program priorities, 
application guidelines, and grantmaking procedures. The 
majority of the national foundations award grants only to 
local organizations and individuals for programs in their 
country. Some award grants to foreign organizations working 
in partnership with local groups on local issues and 
problems. Potential grant applicants should contact specific 
national foundations for information about their application 
procedures.

<a href="gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>, 
also have their own 
criteria for proposals. Prospective grantees should contact 
the specific OSI program or other organization for 
information about how to apply for a grant. 
<p>
In general, all foundations and programs require standard 
application information, including:
<ul>
<li>the purpose of the grant (justification of need, 
specific goals, planned activities, excepted outcomes, and 
timeline for completion),
<li>contact person,
<li>qualifications of key staff,
<li>project budget,
<li>amount of funds requested. 
</ul>
<p>
In addition, applicants should be prepared to provide 
overall organizational and budget information, if 
applicable, as well as supporting 
documents, which in the United States would include a copy 
of the IRS determination letter confirming the 
organization's status under section 501(c) 3.

Open Society Foundation - South Africa<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
The major focus of the Open Society Foundation for South 
Africa (OSF-SA) in 1995 was on promoting and building 
democracy at the grassroots level through support for voter 
education and training initiatives aimed at local government 
elections, which took place in November in all but two 
areas-Cape Town and war-torn KwaZulu Natal. The elections 
were peaceful and generally heralded as a success by 
international standards.
<p>
The exclusion of the majority of South Africans from 
participating in government structures during the apartheid 
era left a vacuum of professional experience at the local 
level. Foundation support for organizations such as the 
Association for Rural Advancement, Inlogov, Planact, and the 
National Women's Resource and Service Centre, all of which 
run training programs for local government councilors and 
officials, contributes to filling this vacuum and ensuring 
efficient local government in the future.
<p>
Throughout the year, the foundation continued its support 
for university-based programs offering diploma courses in 
local government and public administration. Included in this 
support was a contribution to the Joint University Public 
Management Education Trust. The Trust created a consortium 
of six graduate schools of local government to promote 
cooperation and the sharing of resources.
<p>
In the human rights arena in 1995, the foundation supported 
the Investigating Task Unit: Civilian Support Component, 
which is investigating the activities of the hit squads in 
KwaZulu Natal. Hit squads have operated from both inside and 
outside of state structures, preying upon members of 
opposing parties, political dissidents, and ordinary 
citizens during the apartheid era. During 1995, the Civilian 
Support Component hired a staff, established information 
systems, initiated investigations into killings, and helped 
prepare strategic cases for trial. 
<p>
Throughout 1995, the foundation continued its contribution 
to the development of transparent and open government 
through support for the Institute for Democratic 
Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA).  To promote 
understanding of and access to the changing legal and 
welfare systems of the new state, the foundation supported 
the Black Sash's Advice Centre initiative, which provides 
legal assistance in nine offices across the country. 
<p>
To combat the problem of homelessness, a $5 million grant 
was made to the National Urban Reconstruction and Housing 
Agency (NURCHA), an NGO established to help finance housing 
for the poor. This grant matched an equal sum committed by 
the South African government. In addition to the start-up 
funding, 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a> 
pledged $50 million worth of loan 
guarantees contingent on NURCHA raising substantial funds 
from other sources. This grant and the loan guarantees, once 
matched, will enable NURCHA to assist in the construction of 
about 200,000 housing units for low-income families in South 
Africa over the next five years.
<p>
An estimated 60 percent of young people in South Africa are 
unemployed. Youth development, particularly training and job 
placement, therefore, continued to be a priority of OSF-SA. 
The foundation renewed its support for youth development 
programs, in spite of the collapse of a major national 
initiative, the National Youth Development Forum, which it 
had supported. The Forum had aimed to bring together young 
people from a variety of political backgrounds for job-
creation initiatives. 
<p>
In 1995, the foundation also dedicated significant resources 
to transforming the country's education system, a major 
national priority in the postapartheid era. In addition to 
funding a number of education support programs, we made 
plans for a major initiative to be launched in 1996 in 
conjunction with the 
<a href="/osibuda.html"><b>Open Society Institute - Budapest</b></a>.
This 
comprehensive new program, which will affect students at all 
levels, from kindergarten through university, will seek to 
improve the quality of math, science, and technology 
education. During its first two years, the $15 million 
effort will target Northern Province and Eastern Cape, two 
of the country's poorest provinces. Both regions face 
particularly tough problems in education, including the 
challenges associated with integrating former apartheid 
"homelands" into coherent educational systems created out of 
previously fragmented ones.
<p>
Initial activities are slated to include commissioning the 
development of syllabi and other teaching materials, teacher 
training initiatives, and community outreach efforts. The 
program will also work to develop the involvement of other 
NGOs in education initiatives in these areas. The foundation 
will seek cooperative funding from the South African 
government as well as from the private sector.
<p>
In addition to the initiatives described above, the 
foundation continued its significant support for the 
development of community radio stations, with a particular 
focus on educational programming.

Open Society Foundation - Haiti<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 

The Fondation Connaissance et Libert was established in 
April 1995.  My first concern as executive director was for 
our seven-member board and small senior staff to discuss and 
understand the main philosophical concepts that guide the 
network of foundations established by 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>: 
transition, open societies, and empowerment.
<p>
In order to render these concepts operational, we had to 
give them meaning and coherence within our own political, 
economic, and cultural reality. This process led us to 
choose education as our main field of intervention. Haiti is 
a country with a long history of arbitrary rule and where 
today 85 percent of the population is illiterate and still 
struggling to gain access to the most basic rights of 
citizenship. In such a context, the process of transition 
toward democracy can only be understood if the children of 
this marginalized majority are given the means and skills to 
become responsible citizens. In 1995, the foundation gave 
grants to schools that seemed to share our vision for 
change.
<p>
At the same time, the foundation supported grassroots 
organizations in their attempts to reinforce and expand the 
skills and knowledge they need in order to help build an 
open society. A special fund was established to support 
small projects initiated by grassroots organizations. The 
foundation supported community radio stations, the only 
newspaper in the Creole language, experimental and 
alternative educational experiences (preschool, workshops, 
integration of blind children into mainstream schools), and 
a unique community library-entirely managed by a youth 
group-in a slum of Port-au-Prince. The latter has had such a 
positive impact on the youth group and the community that we 
hope that it may serve as a model for the foundation's 1996-
97 library program. 
<p>
Much of 1995 was taken up by the complex logistics of 
establishing an institution in a country lacking the most 
basic infrastructures, the need to develop an open society 
approach especially tailored to Haiti, and the 
identification of the best partners for launching the 
foundation's own programs.
<p>
<b>A Revolutionary Leap into the 21st Century</b><br>
In 1996, Fondation Connaissance et Libert will set up two 
additional libraries modeled on the youth group community 
library, although with a much enlarged collection, more 
sophisticated equipment, and the capacity to serve as a 
training ground for other interested groups. The approach 
and challenge here will be the integration of the library 
into the community through the empowerment of local children 
and youth by giving them access to the world of the written 
word and related activities (reading groups, debates, 
workshops). Partnerships are being negotiated with 
institutions for the training of local youths in community 
library management and in skills related to monitoring 
reading groups for children, for adults with special needs, 
etc. In that respect, we hope to get some support as well 
from the 
<a href="/osibuda.html"><b>Open Society Institute - Budapest</b></a>
<a href="/library.html"><b>Library Program</b></a>. 
Moreover, we are exploring the possibility of introducing 
the Internet to the foundation's libraries and eventually to 
others. If we succeed, this would constitute, for Haiti, a 
revolutionary qualitative leap into the 21st century.
<p>
In 1996, the foundation will also launch its own education 
program through three regional pilot projects-a commune in 
the north, a school complex in the central plateau, and a 
large community school in a remote town on the southern 
peninsula. The education program is modeled after the 
<a href="/aedp.html"><b>Albanian Education Development Project</b></a>.  
Like the program in 
Albania, our model will address teacher training and 
community involvement in education. A construction component 
of the program, although very much needed (all school 
infrastructures in Haiti are in deplorable condition), will 
be postponed until the foundation can find a partner willing 
to invest in this type of work. Finally, our education and 
library program will integrate three 
<a href="/osiny.html"><b>OSI-New York</b></a> 
regional 
programs: 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a>, 
<a href="/youth.html#highschool"><b>Debate</b></a>, 
and 
<a href="/youth.html#health"><b>Health Education</b></a>.
<p>
We have chosen to focus on education through an integrated 
approach which allows us to tackle other major development 
issues in Haiti: reinforcement of civil society, 
environment, health, and the empowerment of women.

Open Society Foundation - Haiti<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Haiti's history is one of depletion. Cultivation has been allowed to use up rather than enrich the land. There is no infrastructure for the delivery of water, electricity, telecommunications, and other services. Where there is electricity, it is rarely operable for more than two to three hours a day. Piles of garbage line the streets of the poor and rich alike. The water is not drinkable, but people drink it of necessity. There are too few resources to adequately support a large and growing population. The country's drastic economic situation is exacerbated by the precocity of its institutions and the social and political instability linked to a tradition of state violence and repression.

Soros Foundation - Hungary<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
Established in 1984, the 
Soros Foundation - Hungary
is the 
first in the network of national foundations created by 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>. 
In 1995, we identified five areas of priority 
for our work: higher education and scholarships; public 
education; arts and culture; health care and social welfare; 
and civil society.
<p>
<b>Higher Education.</b><br> Through the 
<a href="/hesp.html"><b>Higher Education Support Program</b></a>, 
the foundation funded a variety of programs to help 
restructure Hungary's higher education system. We sent 
researchers on scholarships to American and European 
colleges and universities, provided supplementary grants for 
living expenses to students with scholarships at foreign 
colleges, and helped scholars and scientists to participate 
in conferences and field trips abroad. The University and 
College Exchange Program supported the foreign exchange 
programs of various Hungarian higher education institutions. 
The foundation gave support to the publication of Hungarian 
scientific papers in prestigious international journals. 
Seven Student Advising Centers provided information about 
higher education and scholarship opportunities abroad.
<p>
<b>Public Education.</b><br> The goal of the Public Education 
Development Program, established in the beginning of 1995, 
is the democratization and development of the Hungarian 
public education system through reform of conventional 
teaching structures and methods. The foundation equipped 
classrooms in 85 schools with state-of-the-art computer 
technology (including Internet connectivity), created a 
textbook database, and organized teacher training. 
<p>
The regional 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
preschool program added 33 
classrooms to the 19 already established in Hungary. The 
Help for Disadvantaged Groups Program supported the 
preparation of curricula and course books, funded vocational 
training, and gave stipends to disadvantaged students at 
secondary schools. The foundation developed teaching 
materials for understanding prejudice and promoting 
tolerance, and a program for teaching democracy. Civic 
education involves students in shaping their school 
environment as well as their future in society.
<p>
We organized seminars and training courses for teachers of 
social studies, and developed management training programs 
in education to help school administrators perform their new 
professional responsibilities. The foundation helped 
establish six community schools, open to everyone; these 
schools focused on preserving cultural traditions, training 
jobless young people, and building community activities in 
Hungary. In a special environmental education project, 
children drew a map of Hungary identifying places of "joy" 
and "sorrow" from an environmental perspective. 
<p>
<b>Arts and Culture.</b><br> In 1995, the Library Support Program ran a 
competition for the restoration of documents from libraries, 
archives, and museums. Together with Arts International 
(USA) and the Budapest Municipality, the foundation 
announced a management training program for performing arts 
and visual art groups. The foundation also supported 
cultural journals, which are vital to spreading democratic 
civil thinking to all, and which cannot survive without 
subsidies anywhere in the world.
<p>
In book publishing, the foundation sought to make valuable 
Hungarian and foreign cultural and scientific works 
available to Hungarian readers at affordable prices. The 
Performing Arts Program was started in 1995 to support the 
production of contemporary dramas and promote cooperation 
between traditional and alternative theaters. Grants were 
given to support cultural events, conferences, concerts, and 
exhibitions.
<p>
<b>Health Care and Social Welfare.</b><br> The Health Care System 
Development Program started in 1995 to help modernize the 
Hungarian health care system by improving the quality of 
care and services, especially for disadvantaged children, 
handicapped people, homeless people, and refugees. The 
foundation supported the provision of meals for 
disadvantaged children in the primary schools as well as 
family counseling for the economically underprivileged.
<p>
<b>Civil Society.</b><br> The foundation helped NGOs by supporting 
training, and consultation/advisory services, and by 
developing communication networks. The Business Basics 
Foundation, supported by the foundation and the Know-How 
Fund of the British government, provided small and medium-
sized businesses in Hungary with training and consultancy 
services.
<p>
The Independent Ecological Center worked to promote 
innovative strategies for the prevention of pollution, 
create and strengthen NGOs in this field, and raise public 
awareness of environmental issues.

Soros Foundation - Hungary<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Hungary is one of the most stable countries in Central and Eastern Europe. In the last decade, the country made considerable progress in the transition to a market economy, in setting up a system of democratic institutions, and in guaranteeing human rights. The democratic, multiparty elections under peaceful circumstances in 1990 gave legitimacy to the transition. With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1991, the country gained total independence. In the last four years Hungary took major steps towards integration into Europe as a member of the Council of Europe and as an applicant for full membership in the European Union.<p>

The transition to a market economy has had important social costs. As enterprises, faced with market competition, laid off employees, unemployment rates rose sharply. Unemployment reached 14 percent in the first half of 1993 though it seemed to decline slightly in the summer of 1995 to 10 percent.<p>

Many ordinary citizens, perhaps 25 to 30 percent, have fallen below the minimum subsistence level, owing to decreasing real income and increasing unemployment. In the past few years, a great number of people became poor and a few became rich. A middle class, in the western sense of the word, has not yet evolved in Hungary. As a natural consequence of growing social problems, the number of people involved in social deviance, and the size and impact of marginalized groups, have increased.<p>

Human rights are guaranteed and their violation is punished in Hungary. From time to time, the interpretation of the content and range of freedom of expression and the press are disputed, but the majority of citizens do not feel restrained in the exercise of their rights. The social circumstances of the Rroma, however, are catastrophic in many places, and their chances of escaping poverty are limited.<p>

The number and range of newspapers available to the public has increased tremendously in past few years. The Hungarian nongovernmental sector, containing some 30,000 organizations, is developing dynamically, playing an expanding role in satisfying social needs.

Open Society Institute - Moscow<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
I took up my position as executive director of the Open 
Society Institute - Moscow hoping to see the foundation act 
not only as a source of financing but also as a resource 
center and unifying force among Russian NGOs and various 
civic initiatives. The year 1995 was one of many changes as 
OSI-Moscow underwent major administrative reorganization and 
closely aligned its grant management structure with the 
<a href="/isf.html"><b>International Science Foundation</b></a>, 
another grantmaking entity 
sponsored by 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>. 
The restructuring helped 
streamline our grantmaking process to address Russia's
rapidly changing needs.
<p>
Throughout 1995, OSI-Moscow continued its main programmatic 
activities by supporting various initiatives in education, 
the arts, civil society, and media. While it is impossible 
to list all projects supported by OSI-Moscow in 1995, I 
would like to call attention to the Textbooks for Russian 
Schools Program, our most innovative new project in 1995. In 
fact, reform of humanities education in Russia was the 
foundation's top priority. In close consultation with the 
Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation, the best 
texts produced during the earlier Transformation of the 
Humanities Program were selected for large print runs. 
Through its experience with the textbook market, 
distribution systems, and the publishing industry, OSI-
Moscow became a leader among foundations in Russia in the 
production of educational materials. For the first time in 
the foundation's history, its books were sold to schools, 
distributors, and regional departments of education, 
ensuring that new materials reached students while promoting 
reform within the publishing industry. Over half a million 
books were sold in the western part of Russia. This model 
will be expanded in the future to cover texts for both 
secondary and higher education.
<p>

<b>Seminars for Young Scholars</b><br>
In the field of higher education, financial and 
organizational support was given to a series of seminars for 
young scholars in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, Yashkarola, 
and Samara. These seminars examined issues ranging from 
federalism in Russia to the structural problems facing 
institutions of higher education. The seminar program was 
carried out in cooperation with the Russian State University 
for the Humanities.  
<p>
Continuing an effort to support projects in the provinces, 
OSI-Moscow cooperated with the Moscow Musical Conservatory 
and the Union of Composers to create the Traveling Musical 
Academy Program. The academy offers provincial cities 
concerts every evening for a month combined with daily 
master classes by musicians and teachers.  Between 40 and 55 
musical events are held in the course of a single academy 
engagement. The academy encourages existing musical 
institutions and the creation of new organizations. In 
bringing world class performances to cities with an already 
developed musical infrastructure, the foundation promotes 
contacts among local musicians and Western and Russian 
musical communities.
<p>
In its willingness to support outstanding individuals in the 
cultural sphere, the foundation stands apart from most other 
foundations in Russia. The grant given to the great Russian 
animator Yuri Norshtein to complete his master work, a 
version of Gogol's "The Overcoat," is but one example of the 
foundation's efforts. The film is likely to become a classic 
within the great tradition of Russian animation. 
<p>

<b>Flak Jackets for Journalists</b><br>
The Moscow Charter of Journalists, a long-term partner of 
the foundation, continued to develop projects to raise 
professional standards and assist Russian journalists. In 
addressing a list of priorities set by the Charter, the 
foundation provided flak jackets on loan to journalists 
working in zones of conflict. Other funds provided financial 
support to the families of journalists killed on assignment 
in these areas.
<p>
The foundation also participated in the financing of "Turn 
On," a television series to encourage young people to take 
part in the electoral process. The program examined issues 
facing voters prior to elections for the state Duma. The 
program, modeled on MTV's "Rock the Vote," mixed
performances from popular musicians with informational 
broadcasting. 
<p>
Finally, the creation of civic centers in several Russian 
cities to consult and provide technical support to local 
NGOs and civic groups was a direct response to a need for 
provincial NGOs to coordinate their activities more 
effectively. Such initiatives on the part of the foundation 
reflect a process of evolution which will eventually place 
OSI-Moscow at the center of NGO development in the 
provinces.

Life in Russia at the beginning of 1994 was relatively calm after conflict in 1993 between 
President Yeltsin and his opponents in the Congress of People's Deputies had plunged Moscow into bloody 
chaos and pushed Russia to the precipice of civil war. But elections for a new State Duma were called, and 
on December 12, 1993, Russians voted for new deputies and a new constitution. While there was initial 
shock over the poor results of the reformist parties and the perceived success of ultra-nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, the threat that the LDP would play a significant role in the 
decisions of the State Duma lessened during 1994. The new constitution clarified lines of authority for the 
president and the Duma, and lent stability to Russia's political life.<p>
 
Throughout 1994, the government continued to battle inflation, and encouraging indicators appeared that 
the transition to a market economy was continuing. Although prices continued to rise, goods and services 
became more readily available. But in the beginning of October the ruble and financial markets dropped at 
breakneck speed, eventually leading to an investigation and the removal of the head of the Central Bank. 
And while the ruble dropped, the crime rate steadily rose, especially in Moscow, and organized crime in 
particular flourished. Several financial scandals involving investment houses and banks underscored the 
increasing risk of doing business in Russia.

<h2>
From the 1995 Annual Report
</h2>
For the International Science Foundation (ISF), the year 
began with the successful continuation of projects funded by 
the ISF Long Term Grants aimed at supporting scientists 
involved in fundamental research in the former Soviet Union 
and Baltics, and ended with the completion of the 
foundation's mandate of transferring more than $130 million 
to the region. During a period of economic uncertainty, the 
ISF was able to provide direct assistance to more than 
20,000 scientists in 14 countries. 
<p> 
As the International Science Foundation looks ahead, it is 
both important and rewarding to review some of its 
achievements over the past year. The foundation had a 
tremendous impact in l995 with the creation and 
implementation of, among others, the following programs.
<p>
The 
<a href="/gap/index.html"><b>Grant Assistance Program (GAP)</b></a> 
offered reliable 
distribution and accounting services to other nonprofit 
organizations in the West conducting charity projects in the 
former Soviet Union in support of science and the 
humanities, education, culture, and humanitarian aid. 
Logistical assistance was provided to donors free of charge. 
In 1995 alone, GAP helped to manage 120 projects totaling 
over $3 million in direct grants or collaborative research 
projects funded by U.S. and European federal agencies (e.g. 
NSF, NIH, EPA, NASA), universities, NATO, and other 
organizations.
<p>
With a budget of $1.5 million, the 
Library Support Program 
sent over 115 different scientific periodicals worth $5.5 
million to about 400 libraries serving the public, 
universities, and other institutions. 
The program received journals through discounted 
subscriptions and donations from publishers and managed 
their distribution to 
recipient libraries. 
<p>
The Conference Travel Grant Program provided short-term 
fellowships for participation in professional meetings 
abroad. Since its inception, this program has helped nearly 
8,500 scientists to attend more then 2,000 conferences at a 
total cost of $13 million, $5 million of which were 
disbursed in 1995. Funding through this program covered per-
diem allowances and air travel arranged by the ISF's in-house 
travel staff at substantial discounts. 
<p>
Among the foundation's greatest achievements were the 
successful negotiations which resulted in the signing of 
seven unprecedented joint funding agreements with the 
governments of Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Russia and Ukraine. In these historic agreements, individual 
governments contributed funds totaling over $15 million to 
continue support of the ISF Long Term Research Grant 
recipients. As a result, the foundation distributed more 
than $30 million in additional funds, including $15 million 
in matching donations. Through these joint funding 
agreements, the foundation will continue to provide vital 
assistance to the region and encourage new approaches to 
funding and managing scientific research. 
<p>
The ISF will take a new direction in 1996. Under the 
leadership of Greg Johnson, the newly appointed executive 
director, the foundation will move toward a consolidation of 
duties and a strengthening of organizational links with 
other foundations supported by 
<a href="gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>. 
As the 
countries of the former Soviet Union and the Baltics face 
new realities and obstacles, the ISF will continue to 
promote mutual cooperation and partnerships, furthering 
assistance effort in the region.

George Soros established the International Science Foundation (ISF) in December 1992 to help scientists of the former Soviet Union weather the economic crisis in the region without having to leave science or their countries and to encourage new approaches to funding and managing scientific research in the former Soviet Union.<p>

The ISF provides support for basic research by individual scientists, research teams, and research institutes and organizations. The ISF does not support applied or military research nor does it make any claims to intellectual property rights. The ISF operations in Russia are conducted through its Moscow office and branch offices in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Vladivostok, and Yekaterinburg.<p>

<h2>
Emergency Grants Program
</h2>

On 25 February 1993, the ISF announced its Emergency Grants Program. The program sought to distribute $500 grants to the most productive scientists of the former Soviet Union who had published a minimum of three articles in the leading open scientific journals during the past five years. Some 35,000 applications were received by the ISF, and as a result 26,145 scientists received individual one-time grants of $500 each, totaling more than $13 million. Of that number, 20,763 grantees were scientists from Russia.<p> 

<b>Conference Travel Grant Program. </b><br>
The program supports the exchange of ideas and information among scientists of the former Soviet Union and the international scientific community by underwriting participation in conferences, including travel expenses, hotel accommodations, and per diem expenses. Applications must come from conference organizers on behalf of researchers presenting oral papers or posted presentations. Researchers in the areas of applied, military, and conversion studies as well as scholars working in the humanities or social sciences are not eligible. In two years, the ISF has funded over 6,000 scientists to travel to scientific conferences around the world.<p>

<h2>
Long-Term Research Grants Program
</h2>

This program provides funding for major research projects by individual researchers and research teams to cover the cost of laboratory and telecommunications equipment, materials, supplies, and travel. It is the biggest program implemented by the ISF, supporting some 3,550 research projects carried out by 15,000 scientists.<p>

By the end of 1994, the original funds allocated to the Long-Term Research Grants Program were distributed, but new funding arrangements will allow the program to continue until the end of 1995. At a meeting in March 1994, George Soros and Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin reached an agreement on joint funding of research projects submitted to the ISF. In accordance with this agreement and a subsequent ordinance, the government of Russia allocated $12.5 million with Soros matching the amount. As a result, the Long-Term Research Grants Program in Russia will have an additional budget of $25 million for 1995.<p>

According to the trilateral agreement signed by the International Science Foundation, the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, and the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research (RFFI), the additional $12.5 million allocated by Soros will be distributed proportionally among those holding ISF long-term grants in Russia. The ISF transferred to the RFFI all projects it has supported as well as 1,500 projects that were highly appraised by international experts, but were not awarded grants because of the lack of funds. The RFFI reviewed these projects and selected those it would finance from its own funds.<p>

The governments of the Baltic states, Belarus, Georgia, and Ukraine made their own contributions to the continuation of research in their countries. In each case these contributions were supplemented by matching grants from George Soros.<p>

<h2>
Library Assistance Program
</h2>

Starting in 1991 economic constraints forced libraries throughout the former Soviet Union to curtail their subscriptions to foreign scientific periodicals. This limited access to Western scientific literature deprived scientists of the possibility of keeping up with developments in their fields of research and exacerbated their isolation from the international scientific community. The ISF Library Assistance Program was established in 1993 to make up for these shortages.<p>

Today the ISF manages regular deliveries of Western scientific journals to libraries and research centers throughout the former Soviet Union. The ISF offices in Russia serve as distribution centers for 353 libraries in Russia and 15 libraries in other former Soviet states. Most of the journals are distributed through the library networks of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Medical Academy, Russian Humanitarian University, and the Siberian division of the Russian Academy of Sciences.<p>

As a result of successful negotiations with a number of US commercial and university publishing houses, the ISF obtained the 1993 and 1994 subscriptions at a big discount--$1.7 million for $6 million worth of scientific periodicals. In 1994 alone the Library Assistance Program distributed 98,000 copies of scientific journals.<p>

<h2>
Telecommunications Program
</h2>

In collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technological Policy of the Russian Federation, the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, and the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the ISF provides Russian research and academic communities with access to the Internet. As part of the program, the ISF is supervising the development of major infrastructure projects in Moscow, Novosibirsk, and Yaroslavl in Russia and in Kiev in Ukraine.<p>

<h2>
Competition for Humanities Research
</h2>

In 1994, the ISF helped organize a competition for research projects in the humanities. The coordinating board reviewed over 2,000 submissions and selected 637 winning proposals. Among the winners were nearly 1,400 historians, linguists, archeologists, art critics, and other scholars engaged in basic research in the humanities.<p>

<h2>
Discretionary Grants
</h2>

In 1994, the ISF also awarded several noncompetitive grants. The Komarov Botanical Institute in St. Petersburg, for example, received a $500,000 grant to repair its building and save its herbarium and unique collection of plants. Discretionary grants also went to the scientific publication Khimiyaizhizn (Chemistry and Life) and to the special mathematics-oriented school #57 in Moscow.<p>

Stefan Batory Foundation - Poland<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
After eight years of activity, the Stefan Batory Foundation 
is one of the largest and most important independent 
institutions in Poland. In 1995, the foundation concentrated 
its activities on transforming education, the promotion of 
culture and tolerance, the growth of civil society, and the 
development of democracy.
<p>
The modernization of education has always been a high 
priority for the Batory Foundation. This field requires a 
constant injection of innovation, experimentation, and 
reform that are incompatible with the bureaucratic 
structures of the state.
<p>
In 1995, the foundation continued to initiate and sponsor 
programs aimed at educational reform at all levels. The 
foundation offered fellowships and travel grants to Polish 
scholars traveling abroad and supported conferences 
organized in-country by various academic centers. The 
International Summer Schools were organized to familiarize 
teachers and scholars from postcommunist countries with the 
ways in which the disciplines of political science, 
international studies, and economics are taught or practiced 
in other countries. The Batory Foundation also supported 
professional training abroad for school teachers, and 
introduced three educational programs (Young Entrepreneurs, 
Entrepreneurship, and Debate Clubs) to elementary and 
secondary schools.
<p>
We continued to provide assistance to institutions, 
nongovernmental organizations, associations, and groups 
active in the realm of culture. Our support was offered for 
specific artistic projects, for the popularizing of the 
arts, and for the education and training of managers. We 
initiated cultural cooperation within Central and Eastern 
Europe and promoted our culture in the West. We also paid 
attention to the needs of national and ethnic minorities 
living in Poland by supporting cultural events which promote 
coexistence, tolerance, cultural pluralism, and mutual 
understanding. 
<p>
The foundation supported cultural journals, especially 
regional journals which keep readers in touch with national 
and world events while promoting local culture. We continued 
to support publishing activities by commercial publishers, 
focusing on books which serve the development of a 
democratic culture. 
<p>
Promoting development of civil society is one of the Stefan 
Batory Foundation's main objectives. It is hard to imagine a 
civil society without nongovernmental organizations through 
which citizens can advance common goals and common 
interests. The support of NGOs took the form of financing 
clearly defined programs and/or providing general support 
for NGOs that fulfill elements of our mission. Having 
initiated and tried out new programs, we often transfer them 
to 
already existing NGOs or spin them off to become new 
independent organizations.
<p>
<b>Combating Poverty and Violence Against Women</b><br>
We continued to support small, independent, local 
organizations that often are major actors in alleviating the 
social problems of transition, combating poverty, and 
providing welfare services to needy children and families. 
We also supported programs to protect the equal rights of 
women and prevent discrimination, violence, and sexual abuse 
in the home, in schools, and in the workplace. 
<p>
In addition, funding was provided for undertakings connected 
with local self-government, national minorities, cooperation 
in Central and Eastern Europe, and European integration.
<p>
A proportion of grants for education, culture, and civil 
society initiatives came from the Nongovernmental 
Organizations Support Fund, established in 1992. The fund 
was conceived as a response to the need, perceived by the 
foundation, for cooperation between nongovernmental 
organizations and financial and business institutions. In 
1995, many banks and companies responded to the foundation's
proposal to match every Polish zloty paid by them into the 
fund with one of its own. 
We believe that joint action can be more effective in 
building support for transformation processes and 
counteracting their side effects. 
<p>
To promote the idea of open society, the foundation 
established the Karl Popper Scholarship, to be given each 
year on a competitive basis to the authors of the three best 
book projects on subjects of importance to open society.
<p>
In 1995, the foundation reviewed 3,385 applications and 
awarded 761 grants to institutions and organizations and 
1,016 grants to individuals. More than 800 libraries 
received support for cultural journals. More than 400 
elementary and secondary schools were involved in 
foundation-supported programs. More than 200 journalists 
participated in training courses organized by the

Stefan Batory Foundation -  Poland<br>Country Background
</h1></td>
</table> 

Public debate in Poland has been dominated recently by the words "democracy" and "market" 
while the idea of "civil society," which had been so influential in the political struggles of the 1970s and 
1980s, has fallen into disuse. Although "civil society" is no longer at the center of debate, it is only now, 
under democratic and free market conditions, that civil society has had the opportunity to flourish. The 
foundation supports the ventures of different organizations, associations, and nonformal groups, especially 
independent initiatives that unite people in a common cause, focus on culture and education, broaden 
knowledge about other nations, and help people in need or protect the environment. These initiatives 
empower individuals and groups to seek solutions to problems without waiting for government action.

Open Society Foundation - Sofia<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
In 1995, the Open Society  Foundation - Sofia celebrated its 
fifth year 
of operation. During those five years, we have spent nearly 
$15 million to support Bulgarian nongovernmental 
organizations, universities, libraries, economic reform 
initiatives, and arts and culture programs. Overall, the 
foundation has awarded grants to 5,000 Bulgarians in 
various professions to study abroad or participate in 
conferences. 
Over 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students received 
support to study in Bulgarian and foreign universities. Our 
Libraries Fund gave Bulgarian libraries 130,000 volumes of 
scientific and other specialized literature from foreign 
donors. With the Soros Center for Contemporary Arts, we have 
financed 600 projects in Bulgarian arts and culture. The 
foundation has also supported over 1,200 projects 
for economic and legal reform and the development of 
Bulgaria's
third sector. 
<p>
Throughout 1995, the foundation built its presence in the 
country by establishing new Open Society Clubs in the cities 
of Stara Zagora, Gabrovo, Veliko, Turnovo, Vratza. Clubs in 
Plovdiv, Varna, Sliven, Velingrad, and Rousse were 
registered as independent civil associations. The clubs 
diversified their memberships and expanded their funding 
sources to support projects ranging from a charity ball in 
Plovdiv, which raised money for a fund to support orphans, 
to a joint project for cultural exchange between the town of 
Sliven and the University of Trontheim, Norway, to the 
establishment of the first private radio station in the 
Pleven region. 
<p>
The Information Center's 10 regional offices expanded their 
activities, disseminating information about education, 
nongovernmental organizations, and scholarship opportunities 
in other parts of Europe for Bulgarians. In June, the center 
produced the first computerized database of Bulgarian higher 
education. At about the same time, the foundation became the 
first Bulgarian organization with its own 
<a href="http://www.osf.acad.bg/"><b>home page</b></a> 
on the World Wide Web. In 1995, the foundation's European Fund 
helped speed Bulgaria's integration into European social, 
political, and cultural structures through research and 
other initiatives. 
<p>
<b>Internet Links and Library Networks</b><br>
The Internet Program supported the first full Internet link 
of academic institutions in Sofia and continued to expand 
connectivity to academic centers in other cities. The 
Universities Fund held a competition for projects to develop 
local computer systems in universities. Major initiatives of 
the foundation included two specialized training seminars 
for managers of privatization funds, organized by the 
Economic Reform Fund, the Center for the Study of Democracy 
in Sofia, and the CEU Privatization Project in Prague. 
Nearly 50 of the country's major libraries were equipped 
with automated networks with the support of the Open Society 
Foundation - Sofia.
<p>
The Scholarships Fund supported over 200 students pursuing a 
range of disciplines at Bulgarian and foreign universities, 
including Oxford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the Central 
European University, Institut Superieur Economique-Brussels, 
and Conservatoire Nationale Superieure-Paris.. 
<p>
The OSF-Sofia International Exchange Fund helped over 200 
professionals in the fields of law, medicine, and economics, 
among others, travel to international conferences and 
seminars. The Open Education Center supported the 
establishment of more than 10 regional groups specializing 
in youth education programs. The Soros Center for 
Contemporary Arts (SCCA) organized "Bulgarian Medieval Town: 
Technologies," unique presentation of medieval crafts, as 
well as the first exhibition of Bulgarian video art. The 
Open Program supported initiatives carried out by various 
environmental groups concurrently with the Sofia meeting of 
the Ecology Ministers of Europe, the United States, and 
Canada in September 1995. The program also organized a film 
festival, featuring documentaries on Sarajevo and films 
sponsored by Human Rights Watch. 
<p>
OSF-Sofia manages a charity fund for talented children from 
orphanages established by the Bulgarian opera singer Raina 
Kabaivanska. 
The fund opened the first specialized school for these 
children in September at Stoikite, near the town of Smolyan. 
<p>
Despite the withdrawal of support from the government and 
hostile attacks from nationalistic and post-communist 
circles, the foundation in 1995 continued to take a leading 
role in developing civil society 
in Bulgaria.

During the five years since the beginning of democratic changes in Bulgaria, political achievements have been more evident than economic or social progress. It is now clear that much needs to be done to attain the potential for open society.<p>

In the arena of politics, there is a fully established system of democratic multiparty elections, separation of powers, and adherence to democratic procedures within the framework of the constitution adopted in 1991. The December 1994 elections, which produced a socialist majority, did not attract international observers, an indication that the international community is satisfied with progress in the political sphere. The rule of law has had a more problematic recent history. Enshrined in the constitutional and legal system, it is still not a universal way of doing business; informal, backstage decision-making remains common. Law enforcement, oppressive under the old regime, has changed to inefficiency, leading to an explosive increase in crime and rising demands for law and order.<p>

The human rights situation in Bulgaria is seen by many as an achievement in the Balkan context. Following periods of friction in the 1980s, the different cultural, ethnic, and religious groups have reverted to their tradition of peaceful coexistence. In recent years, however, there has been a marked increase in hostility toward the Rroma.<p>

After a vigorous beginning in 1991-92, the transition to a free economy has slowed considerably. Some 90 percent of all productive property is still state-owned, although much of it is in the process of being privatized. Recent signs of economic recovery coexist with a continuing fall in living standards for the majority of the population.<p>

The clearest achievement in the area of civil society has been the appearance of some 1,000 independent newspapers and magazines, placing Bulgaria among the world leaders in press diversity. The problem for private businesses and NGOs is the limitations of the existing culture: lack of faith in individual ability, lack of individual responsibility, a group-centered way of life, suspicion of change, and distrust of outside (foreign) experience.

Open Estonia Foundation<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
At present, the political and economic life of our small 
country is stabilizing. But the method for developing an 
open society has not yet been firmly established. Dangers in 
the short term might arise from a single, uncalculated, 
destabilizing step by the government. Therefore, the work of 
the Open Estonia Foundation (OEF) in reinforcing the 
structures of open society is of the utmost importance. This 
means both grantmaking and proactive involvement in all 
fields which relate to the creation of a society based on 
the rule of law, protection of human rights, and respect for 
human values.
<p>
Over the years, education has always been a top priority of 
the OEF. 
In 1995, the foundation administered more than 20 
scholarship and internship programs in Europe and the United 
States, supported a wide range of projects for the reform of 
higher education and secondary school curricula, and 
implemented the regional preschool program 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
in 
21 kindergartens, including 5 Russian-language 
kindergartens. The OEF also continued its support for the 
<a href="/youth.html#health"><b>Regional Health Education</b></a> 
and 
<a href="/youth.html#highschool"><b>High School Debate Programs</b></a>, 
and launched the High School Exchange Program. 
<p>
More than 200 Estonian and Russian-language schools use the 
Junior Achievement program to teach students how to run a 
business and compete in a free market economy. Support for 
the successful Active Learning In Action program, which 
involves more than 300 schools and 450 teachers, is 
producing innovative teaching methods using modern computer- 
and telecommunications-based techniques. 
<p>
Together with other foundations, the OEF supported a huge 
information systems development program in six Estonian 
libraries. The foundation's
<a href="/internet.html"><b> Internet Program </b></a>
supported the 
establishment of the Baltic Academic Network and Computing 
Services, as well as the Baltic Studies Network, which will 
offer distance-learning courses. At the end of 1995, the 
foundation announced a countrywide competition to establish 
Internet connections with NGOs, educational institutions, 
hospitals, and libraries.
<p>
A major concern for the foundation continues to be the 
integration of ethnic Russians and other minorities into the 
social, political, and economic life of the country. 
Residents with a limited knowledge of the Estonian language 
face major obstacles in obtaining citizenship. To assist 
people in meeting the language requirement, the OEF 
announced a competition for the best script and production 
of a TV program for teaching the Estonian language, which 
will be distributed free to TV stations, schools, and 
language centers. The foundation also supported intensive 
teaching of Estonian in the schools and the publication of 
an Estonian-language textbook. 
<p>
In 1995, the OEF supported nongovernmental organizations 
whose activities promoted democratic values. The foundation 
helped organize an international seminar on Regulating Civil 
Society, a workshop on the legal and fiscal environment of 
nongovernmental organizations in Estonia, and a seminar on 
philanthropy. The foundation's law program concentrated on 
the training of lawyers by supporting a visiting lecturers 
program, the publication of law textbooks, and the work of 
the Lawyers' Training Centre. With the help of the 
<a href="/ilgps.html"><b>Institute of Public Service and Local Government</b></a>, 
the foundation 
supported the translation of public administration textbooks 
and the introduction of public administration courses at 
Tartu University.
<p>
In 1995, the Open Estonia Book program translated and 
published six books by prominent Western authors, including 
Bertrand Russell, Carl Gustav Jung, Paul Valery, and Jacques 
Derrida. The foundation also supported a number of other 
cultural and publishing projects while the Soros Center for 
Contemporary Arts-Estonia promoted diverse arts activities.
<p>
The OEF kept in close contact with other Central and Eastern 
European countries through the 
<a href="/east.html"><b>East East Program</b></a>, 
supporting 
14 cooperative workshops and seminars on, for example, 
Russian-Estonian relations and civics education in the 
Baltic countries. Medical grants were awarded for training, 
health education, HIV-related issues, Medinet (a computer 
practice unit of the Medical Information Center), a project 
on modern gene diagnostics, and a database on genetic 
diseases.
<p>
The Open Estonia Foundation trusts that its activities have 
contributed to the transformation of Estonia and the region 
by equipping both individuals and the community at large to 
share in the responsibility of establishing an open society 
and shaping their future.

Open Estonia Foundation<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Open Estonia Foundation is an integral part of the rebuilding effort that is going on in the Republic of Estonia. Estonia was an independent state between the two World Wars and regained its independence again in 1991. To get rid of the "Soviet heritage" rebuilding the state, civil society, and the economy have been Estonia's most urgent concerns from that moment onward.<p>

The first parliamentary elections in 1992 led to the formation of a center-right government, which, under the eyes of a politically divided opposition and a free press, has pushed through reformist legislation. A major legislative concern was the Russian-speaking people who settled in Estonia during the Soviet regime and how they would be integrated into the social, political, and economic life of the country. As a result, Estonia has guaranteed ethnic Russians and other minorities equal human rights, social care, the right to an education in Estonian or Russian schools, cultural autonomy, the right to vote in local elections, and eventual citizenship on the basis of a rudimentary knowledge of the Estonian language and at least two years of residency. To assist people in meeting the language requirement, Estonia's government, with the help of foreign governments and NGOs, established language training centers and courses throughout the country.<p>

The economic priorities are structural reorganization of the economy, liberalization of trade, privatization and development of the private sector, elimination of barriers to competition, strict fiscal and monetary policies, reforming the banking sector, and development of a legislative base. Estonia has made rapid progress toward a market economy while at the same time generating a high rate of economic growth. The key elements have been a good monetary system without major exchange rate risks, a fully balanced budget, and an open economy.<p>

There are also negative sides to Estonia's development. Social tensions arising from the current distribution of income pose major problems. The state's role in business remains too high. The social security system and state departments operate on very tight budgets.

Open Society Fund - Lithuania<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 

The Open Society Fund-Lithuania (OSFL) in 1995 confirmed its 
support for successful and effective programs and initiated 
a number of new projects with the common goal of helping the 
development of an open society. The foundation's main areas
of concern were education (from preschool to university), 
culture and the arts, publishing, legal reform, civil 
society, media and journalism, social services and youth, 
Roma, business and economics, Internet, and foreign travel 
and conferences.
<p>
The Transformation of Education Program concluded the first 
phase of its curriculum development and textbook project. 
Since its inception in 1993, the program has supported the 
authorship and publication of 90 original textbooks and 
teaching aids and 30 translations. Another 75 textbooks are 
nearing completion and will be published in 1996. By 
involving 22 publishing houses, the program also helped 
create new competitive conditions in the publishing and 
distribution of schoolbooks. In cooperation with 
<a href="/russia.html"><b>OSI-Moscow</b></a>, 
the foundation made Russian textbooks available to Russian-
language schools in Lithuania. 
<p>
School teachers have participated in various requalification 
courses and seminars, school leadership programs, and other 
innovative pedagogical projects. In early 1996, a new Inter-
university Educational Study Center was established with the 
aim of helping to modernize teacher training at pedagogical 
universities and colleges.
<p>
The New Educational Technologies Program played a key role 
in establishing a national, government-financed school 
computerization project, for which the foundation will 
provide teacher training and software development, and 
advance the Internet in the school system. Over 1,000 
teachers participated in computer literacy and Internet 
training programs. In preschool education, the foundation 
was instrumental in introducing modern methodologies at 
teacher training colleges, based on successful preschool 
pilot projects cofunded by the Egmont Fonden of Denmark and 
the 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
program. The 
<a href="/youth.html#highschool"><b>High School Debate Program</b></a> 
was expanded to include universities. The 
<a href="/youth.html#health"><b>Health Education Program</b></a> 
trained over 1,500 teachers on the implementation of 
a health curriculum focusing on alcohol and drugs, human 
sexuality, AIDS prevention, smoking, and nutrition; the 
program now reaches over 35,000 students.
<p>
<b>Stimulating Innovation, Experimentation, Exchanges</b><br>
The Cultural Program was restructured to place more emphasis 
on modernizing cultural infrastructures and training 
regional cultural workers. The foundation established a new 
Performing Arts Program to stimulate innovation, 
experimentation, and international exchanges. A new Open 
Society House was opened as a focal point for cultural and 
civil society events that promote open society. 
<p>
Through an open competition, the Law Program launched a 
project for the authorship of new, university-level legal 
textbooks. An Open Society Law Library, which opened in 
February 1995, provided the legal and academic community 
with a collection of Western legal works and periodicals. 
The Media Program established a new OSFL Journalism Center 
to provide in-service training for working journalists and 
media managers through courses and seminars in ethics, 
investigative journalism, public relations, media 
management, and computer applications. 
<p>
The Credit Union Project of the Business and Economics 
Program (cofunded by the Canadian Government) helped 
introduce new credit union legislation and created 
operating, accounting, and staff training systems. A number 
of credit unions will begin operating in 1996.
<p>
The Publishing Program continued to produce translations 
into Lithuanian of important works in political science, 
philosophy, history, and culture. Since its inception in 
1992, the program has helped publish 54 books, many of which 
are used as university textbooks. Another 60 titles are in 
preparation.
<p>
The 
<a href="/internet.html"><b>Internet Program</b></a> 
opened a community-oriented Dial-up 
Center in August 1995, offering free e-mail connections to 
noncommercial users. The strategy is to make Internet and e-
mail accessible to many new users, both individual and 
institutional, as a new avenue for building open society. 
The Internet Center provides technical assistance, training, 
and access to the Internet and offers new opportunities for 
civil society projects.
<p>
The board of directors and the foundation staff are taking 
into account the serious difficulties that the Lithuanian 
society is experiencing during this period of increasing 
disillusionment with the process of transition. We are 
committed to regularly reviewing the foundation's priorities
in order to better respond to the changing needs of the 
country, the society, and its institutions.

</table> 

In March of 1990, Lithuania's first democratically elected parliament of the post-World War II era declared the re-establishment of the country's independence, which had been lost through forced annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The declaration of independence was followed by a year and a half of threats, intimidation, economic blockade, and violence by the Soviet Union on a population whose peaceful struggle for freedom was often called by Westerners the "singing revolution." Only after the Moscow putsch of August 1991 was Lithuania's independence recognized by the nations of the world. The last Russian troops left Lithuania in August 1993.<p>

The Soviets left behind a distorted and unbalanced economy, ecological problems, and, above all, deep social, moral, and psychological wounds in society. Even before international recognition of independence and the withdrawal of Russian troops, the country embarked on an energetic path of reform in education, economics, administrative structures, and social services. Lack of experience and the absence of a tried and proven formula for transforming a post-Soviet society made this reform process more difficult than anyone expected.<p>

The process was made even more difficult by a dramatic deterioration of the economic situation, typical for post-Soviet economies. The loss of Eastern markets for industrial and agricultural production, inefficient plants, a work ethic suffering from the Soviet heritage, difficulties in adjusting to an emerging free market system, all contributed to a drastic decline in real incomes, inflation, unemployment, and social problems.<p>

Nevertheless, the political system is stable, and the country is firmly committed to economic and social reform. Education and law reform are progressing. Independent media, especially the privately owned press and radio, are engaged in a vigorous competition and enjoy freedom of the press. Ethnic minorities represent only 20 percent of Lithuania's population, and minority relations are relatively problem-free. Privatization is well advanced, inflation is kept under control, the national currency is stable, and exports to the West are rising.<p>

Unfortunately, the vast majority of the population is still living under adverse economic conditions. Because of the economic slowdown and an inefficient tax system, the state budget is unable to provide sufficient funding for an adequate social safety net and for educational, social, cultural, and scientific institutions.

Soros Foundation for an Open Society - Romania<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 

1995 marked the fifth anniversary of the Soros Foundation 
for an Open Society. As an occasion for evaluating the past 
and planning 
for the future, the anniversary year resulted in 
organizational restructuring and a redefining of the 
foundation's strategy for accomplishing its mission. The 
process started with changes to the governing statutes of 
the foundation, incorporating new areas of activity recently 
developed by national and regional programs as well as a 
more complex and efficient managerial structure that would 
meet the demands of this increased activity. 
<p>
In 1995, responsibility for the overall management of the 
foundation was assumed by a management team that brought 
together the executive director, financial director, and the 
branch directors from Cluj, Timisoara, and Iasi. This was a 
successful experiment that increased the participation of 
representatives from all branches of the foundation in the 
overall decision-making process. 
<p>
After the restructuring, our next challenge was to redefine 
program and budget priorities. In its first five years, the 
foundation's strategy was simply to respond to requests from 
individuals and civic groups in the belief that support for 
nongovernmental initiatives strengthened civil society. 
<p>
In 1995, we decided it was time to take a more proactive 
role in establishing programs and goals on which to 
concentrate our resources and energies. Acknowledging that 
programs which aim at immediate and spectacular change can 
be unrealistic and the cause of much disappointment, we 
decided to focus on a few main areas of concern that offered 
the best possibility of stimulating long-term change and 
reaching as large a portion of the population as possible.
<p>
<b>Communication, Education, Civil Society</b><br>
In keeping with its more proactive stance, the foundation 
allotted most of its funding resources to the following 
three programs: communication, education, and civil society. 
We also supported, to a lesser degree, programs concerning 
culture and art, medical and health, and travel. 
<p>
By promoting access to information and communication, 
providing opportunities in education, and supporting the 
development of civil society, the foundation seeks to change 
the mentality of the past and at the same time to infuse 
society with new approaches based on critical thinking, 
pluralism, tolerance, and civic engagement.
<p>
In 1995, the foundation expanded its e-mail and Internet 
programs, providing the general public and specific 
institutions with greater access to information. Satellite 
antennas were installed in our offices in Bucharest, Cluj, 
Iasi, and Timisoara, establishing the technical basis for 
the development of e-mail connectivity in Romania. Now 
information about the foundation and its programs is 
available on the Internet at: 
<a href="http://www.soros.ro"><b>www.soros.ro</b></a> (national programs and Bucharest)
<a href="http://www.soroscj.ro"><b>www.soroscj.ro</b></a> (Cluj); 
<a href="http://www.sorosis.ro"><b>www.sorosis.ro</b></a> (Iasi); 
<a href="http://www.sorostm.ro"><b>www.sorostm.ro</b></a> (Timisoara). 
These home pages present general program information, a directory 
of the foundation's branch offices, an impact study on the 
foundation's five years of activity, the results of a Public 
Opinion Barometer program (public opinion polls), the e-mail 
addresses of our computer centers (one of the most 
successful programs of the foundation), and InfoSoros (the 
foundation's newsletter).
<p>
The Public Opinion Barometer surveys a representative sample 
of the population on a variety of issues from views on 
current living standards to expectations for the future, 
from opinions on government policies to perceptions about 
individual politicians. Widely disseminated, this data has 
attracted the attention of ordinary citizens and 
politicians alike.
<p>
The 
<a href="/osimedia.html"><b>Media Program</b></a> 
supports numerous projects aimed at 
improving reporting and access to information. The BBC 
School of Radio and Television in Bucharest, for example, 
trains broadcast journalists in the principles and practical 
skills of their profession, using recording and studio 
equipment purchased with support from the foundation. The 
Young Journalists Foundation organizes workshops and 
seminars and provides a strong voice for young working 
journalists who represent the media's future.
<p>
In the field of education reform, the foundation has teamed 
up with the Romanian Ministry of Education and other 
international organizations to provide a wider range of 
textbooks for teachers and students. The foundation has 
provided a computer science lab in at least one high school 
in each of Romania's 40 counties.

Soros Foundation for an Open Society - Romania - About the Country

</table> 

Among Eastern European countries under communism, except perhaps for Albania, Romania had the most centralized and nationalized economic regime, the longest and most severe political repression, and the greatest restriction on freedom of expression. Alternative political forces were nonexistent. The communist party recruited 4.5 million members, approximately 50 percent of the active labor force. The economy was strictly centralized with few external connections and a low level of modernization. The living standard was among the lowest in Europe.<p>

The process of opening Romanian society is longer and much harder than it seemed in 1989. Political changes in the country have not resulted in significant economic changes, except for free initiative in trading. The future of Romania, either as an open and competitive society or a quasi-closed society lacking economic power, is still to be decided.<p>

International Renaissance Foundation - Ukraine<br>Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
The priorities of the International Renaissance Foundation 
(IRF), 
redefined in 1995, are to foster the transformation of 
education, facilitate the development of civil society, and 
support economic reform and cultural initiatives. To promote 
the idea of an open society, the foundation established an 
Open Society Radio program, which is broadcast twice a month 
over the National Radio Network. We also began publishing 
monthly bulletins highlighting the work of organizations 
supported by 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a> 
in Ukraine.
<p>
<b>Civil Society</b><br>
The foundation increased its efforts to promote the 
development of civil society with support for NGOs, economic 
education, training demobilized military personnel for 
civilian life, media, and youth. The NGO Program funded 75 
projects and provided financial support for the creation of 
resource centers for NGOs in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, and the 
Donetsk region. The Economic Education Program supported 72 
projects, including a contest for the best press coverage of 
economic reform in Ukraine, which resulted in 22 newspapers 
receiving grants.
<p>
The Retraining of the Military Program assisted 26,143 
servicemen, as well as members of their families. More than 
18,000 were retrained, and 7,857 found employment. With IRF 
assistance, former officers established new credit 
associations, investment funds, consulting firms, consumer 
societies, and industrial, service, and agricultural 
enterprises.
<p>
In 1995, the Mass Media Program facilitated the development 
of freedom of the press in Ukraine with support for both 
national newspapers such as <i>Narodna Hazeta</i>, <i>News From 
Ukraine</i> (Kyiv) and regional publications such as <i>Kamyaniy 
Brid</i> (Luhansk) and <i>Rodaen Krai</i> (Odessa). Support also went 
to nonstate television stations, e.g., the Nova Mova 
association.
<p>
The 
<a href="/youth.html"><b>Youth Program</b></a> 
supported 142 projects, including the 
establishment of a youth initiative servicing center, Hurt 
(Kyiv), which provides information and consulting services 
to youth organizations. The Women in Society Program 
established a women's civil rights center in Kyiv to 
stimulate cooperative efforts among female jurists and 
lawyers to insure legal and social protection for women.
<p>
<b>Education and Science</b><br>
The three-year-old Transformation of the Humanities Program, 
jointly launched by the IRF and the Ministry of Education of 
Ukraine, published 16 textbooks during 1995. The books, 
which attracted the attention of public education 
organizations and private publishers alike, were 
successfully tested in schools and institutions of higher 
learning.
<p>
The 
<a href="/issep.html"><b>International Soros Science and Education Program</b></a> 
has 
gained broad acclaim among educators and scholars in 
Ukraine. Twenty-one of the most distinguished Ukrainian 
scholars have received Soros Emeritus Professor grants. 
Based on the results of contests held in 1995, the 
foundation will award grants to 75 Soros Professors, 120 
Soros Assistant Professors, around 400 Soros Teachers, 140 
Soros Postgraduate Fellows, and over 350 Soros Students.
<p>
With the help of the Modern School Program, more than 600 
Ukrainian teachers learned new approaches to teaching. The 
<a href="/hesp.html"><b>Higher Education Support Program</b></a> 
provided funding for the 
publication of a handbook on Institutions of Higher 
Education in Ukraine. Computer classes were set up in Kyiv 
National University, Lviv University, and Kharkiv 
Polytechnical University. Through the Foreign Language Study 
Program, 31 students, postgraduates, and lecturers received 
grants for studying abroad. In 1995, 37 Ukrainian students 
were enrolled at the 
<a href="/ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a>, 
and 168 
applicants received grants for paying standard entrance exam 
fees.
<p>
The regional 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
preschool program, a comprehensive 
education and development program for children, is being 
tested in 20 kindergartens in Ukraine. Five hundred 
preschool educators received professional training through 
this program.
<p>
<b>Cultural Initiatives</b><br>
In 1995, with the support of the Open Society Institute, the 
IRF launched a new regional program, Cultural Ties, which 
will assist in the organization of international cultural 
events, such as festivals, conferences, competitions, and 
master classes, sponsored by the national foundation 
network.
<p>
Altogether, the foundation supported 107 cultural projects, 
including internship training for Ukrainian cultural 
workers, the establishment of cultural and artistic centers 
and information networks, and the publication of literature. 
In April 1995, the Open Library Program was launched to 
implement advanced library technologies, to help in 
completing book collections for the main libraries of 
Ukraine, and to exchange information and experiences.

Since gaining its independence in 1991, Ukraine has faced two huge problems: the transformation to an open society and the building of a state. Progress in both areas has been slow, severely hampered by the legacy of the past.<p> 
 
Some positive developments occurred in 1994. Pre-term parliamentary elections were held and, on the whole, were judged to be free and fair. Despite fierce opposition from the conservative parliament, the new administration is sticking to a course of market reforms. The outer trappings of democracy exist--for the most part people feel free to express their opinions, vote for whom they wish, practice their own religion, preserve and revive their ethnic culture, and travel abroad. Yet, to a large extent, this democracy is illusory. The lack of democratic traditions in all spheres of social and political life are evident, particularly the inability of politicians to hold constructive dialogues to resolve the country's problems.<p> 
 
Centuries of being divided between empires, only to be reunited under the Soviet empire, have taken their toll on Ukraine. Differences exist between the nationally oriented West and the "Sovietized" East, and separatist sentiment runs high in Crimea. Russia continues to try to dominate Ukraine's policies. Despite these problems, the country has managed to avoid ethnic conflicts and bloodshed.<p> 
 
Overshadowing all other concerns, however, is Ukraine's economic crisis. The sharp decline in production and excessively high inflation continued in 1994. Crime and corruption are rapidly on the rise, medical and other social services are being cut back, education and research are on the decline for lack of funding. The positive effects of economic reform will not be felt for some time. In such a situation, the electorate is more susceptible to populism, and more willing to accept authoritarian rule to improve the economic situation and to "restore order."

Fund for an Open Society - Yugoslavia<br>A Report from the President of the Board
</h1></td>
</table> 
After a media campaign against the foundation in early 1994 
faded away, we not only continued but expanded our work. We 
believed our report of activities for 1995 would be similar 
to the reports of the other national foundations within the 
network. Unfortunately, this did not turn out to be the 
case. During March and April 1995, the foundation was faced 
with a new, much stronger campaign by the official media 
against 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a> 
and the foundation itself. Once again, 
we received strong support from different institutions and 
individuals.
<p>
This show of support, however, which could have been a 
source of genuine satisfaction for everyone connected with 
the foundation, turned out to be an additional disadvantage 
in the foundation's relations with the powers that be. 
Following further attacks against the foundation, the 
Ministry of Culture of Serbia made a decision to revoke our 
registration. We appealed to the Supreme Court of Serbia 
while continuing our program activities. In February 1996, 
the Supreme Court upheld the revocation of the registration, 
and the foundation's activities had to be halted. After an 
internationally 
supported appeal, the foundation was allowed to reregister 
in June 
of  1996.
<p>
The foundation's activities in 1995 went far beyond our 
expectations. The combination of the media campaign against 
the foundation, the continuation of all our programs, and 
the announcement in September of a special, multimillion 
dollar program for refugee children in the former Yugoslavia 
made the foundation better known and respected than ever 
before.
<p>
Just two weeks before the beginning of the 1995 campaign 
against the foundation, we announced our programs in the 
country's major media outlets, asking publicly for proposals 
for the first time. We wanted the work of the foundation to 
become even more transparent, and to give virtually every 
institution, association, and individual in the country a 
chance to submit their ideas.
<p>
Some members of the foundation's board felt this request for 
proposals was one of the immediate reasons for the campaign 
against us. But it also resulted in an unexpected response: 
while the anti-foundation campaign was at its peak (in two 
months more than 400 attacks against the foundation were 
published or broadcast), we received over 1,200 proposals 
and applications. Although there was no doubt all these 
programs needed support, we also understood that this 
response represented a kind of civic resistance.
<p>
Despite an extremely difficult economic situation and a 
general clampdown on civil society, 1995 was marked by a new 
wave of proposals from 22 local papers, 6 youth papers, and 
43 weeklies and monthlies as well as 8 electronic media. The 
amazing increase of independent local papers that became 
apparent from the number of applications we received proved 
that there was an immense need for an alternative to 
government-controlled media. Toward the end of December, 
representatives of a number of independent newspapers met in 
Kragujevac, where they agreed to create their own 
association. 
<p>
The local papers were inspired by the example of the 
Association of the Independent Electronic Media, which has 
become one of the most successful media networks in the 
region. We find it especially significant that a number of 
local minority-language print media will participate in the 
new association of independent papers. In the upcoming year, 
we will provide significant support to these two 
associations. Using the Internet, we hope to improve 
communication among different media and other institutions 
and increase their access to information, breaking the 
internal and external isolation of people in the fields of 
science, media, culture, and the arts.
<p>
The arts and culture program proved to be effective in 
preventing official structures from controlling cultural 
life. Two alternative cultural centers were established in 
Belgrade, one in Novi Sad, and we hope to create similar 
centers in Podgorica and Prishtine. The Soros Center for 
Contemporary Arts is the only resort for dozens of visual 
artists who would be forced to leave the country, or give up 
their work without the support of this institution. The 
SCCA's first annual exhibition provoked great interest, 
especially among young people, who are hungry for new 
challenges in cultural and artistic expression. In the 
upcoming year, the foundation intends to concentrate even 
more on strengthening these alternative initiatives, since 
they are extremely important in maintaining the spirit of 
open society.

The Open Society Foundation for Albania (OSFA) assists the 
democratic process in Albania by helping to create a strong 
civil society. 
The foundation's 11 program boards, made up of some of the 
country's most respected professionals, collaborate with 
foreign experts to design projects that meet the urgent 
needs of the country. Foundation initiatives such as the 
Media Training Center, Legal Documentation Center, Women's
Center, Youth Center, and the Albanian Research Center for 
Health were all created with the intention that they 
eventually become independent organizations.
<p>
In 1995, education remained the OSFA's major area of focus. 
We supported preschool, primary, secondary school, and 
university programs in Albania and provided graduate and 
postgraduate study opportunities abroad. The regional Step-
by-Step program introduced participatory preschool 
activities at five schools. The multiyear $9 million 
<a href="/aedp.html"><b>Albanian Educational Development Project (AEDP)</b></a>,
developed in conjunction with the 
<a href="/osibuda.html"><b>Open Society Institute - Budapest</b></a>
and 
the Albanian government, continued to fund curriculum 
development, community development, and school 
reconstruction for Albania's primary and secondary school 
system.
<p>
Through the 
<a href="/hesp.html"><b>Higher Education Support Program</b></a>, 
OSFA provided 
assistance for humanities and social science programs at the 
university level. This support included funding for the 
translation and publication of textbooks, staff training, 
and limited equipment purchases. In addition, OSFA 
established a student advising center and initiated a 
project to publish a guide to higher education in Albania.
<p>
In 1995, our Library Program focused on the training of 
librarians, book collection development, assistance to the 
Albanian Library Association, and the establishment of 
Albania's first open reading rooms. The program's objective
is to make increased amounts of information available to the 
general public and to provide free access to libraries. The 
foundation also supported book publishing, mainly through 
Books for an Open Society, the long-term goal of which is to 
translate and publish about 40 titles in subject areas 
ranging from economics to social anthropology. 
<p>
The foundation's Youth Program funded a book of stories and 
essays by young authors, high school cultural activities, 
youth newspapers, and debate contests. The High School 
Athletics Program, which engages some 1,500 boys and girls 
in sports, is a model program that the foundation hopes will 
be adopted by the Albanian Ministry of Education.
<p>
The foundation's Arts and Culture Program, which initially 
worked with the Academy of Arts to support the visual and 
performing arts, expanded its mandate in 1995 to assist 
cultural projects by other artists and institutions, 
particularly independent initiatives that promote cultural 
pluralism.
<p>
During 1995, the foundation supported Albanian Roma 
organizations, such as the <i>Amaro Dives</i> newsletter, and the 
teaching of the Roma 
language to Albanian Roma. The Health Program promoted 
public health, including alcohol and drug abuse prevention, 
and funded 
programs to help integrate the handicapped into society. 
<p>
The Legal Documentation Resource Center aided Albania's 
legislative process by making available international 
documents pertaining to issues such as electronic media, 
medical ethics, and environment protection. The center also 
published commentaries on the penal and procedural codes, 
and organized workshops on economic crime, medical ethics 
and law, and bankruptcy. The center gave support to 
associations of lawyers and for the creation of database 
systems in the courts, and it issued the first independent 
legal magazine in Albanian history.
<p>
The Media Program, one of the most ambitious of OSFA's
programs, dramatically increased its cooperation with 
international organizations. Currently, through joint 
funding, Albanian journalists are trained at the BBC, 
Deutsche Welle, and Reuters. The foundation has also 
organized programs with Article XIX, the Committee to 
Protect Journalists, USAID, VOA Europe, etc. Also, training 
and support for high school newsletters and university 
newspapers remain a major focus area. One of the most 
notable achievements of the year was the joint effort with 
<a href="/colpi.html"><b>COLPI</b></a> 
and Article XIX in assisting with the drafting of 
Albania's new Electronic Media Law.

Open Society Foundation - Albania<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Albania is a typical post-communist society in which a dying system of values is being replaced by a new system of values through an intermediate process of continual reevaluation. The transition to a civil society with individual freedoms and a market economy faces huge, sometimes unpredictable difficulties due to the hard economic situation of the country, the lack of a developed democratic tradition, the backwardness of the political class, and unstable relations with neighboring countries.<p>

According to official data, production increased 8.1 percent during 1994. The privatization of land reactivated agricultural production while most industrial enterprises closed. The country's deteriorating infrastructure caused considerable hardship. Most towns had water for only two or three hours after midnight. During winter the towns and villages, which are inhabited by more than 60 percent of the country's population, were invaded by darkness because of a lack of electricity. The streets and schools were in very bad shape, and the telecommunications network was even worse.<p>

The political life of the country is characterized by a continuous tension between the party in power and the opposition. The defeat of the new constitution in a referendum on November 6th is a clear indicator that people are disillusioned with the methods of governing.<p>

One of the most important roles in opening up Albanian society is being played by media, which are becoming powerful supporters of civil society. More than 20 newspapers are published in Tirana, including seven dailies of more than 100,000 circulation. The Albanian press is dominated by the political parties while the state has a monopoly over television. Public information is limited by the lack of a distribution network in the villages, the state's information embargo, and the absence of independent centers of research and opinion.<p>

Legislative reform in Albania has replaced more than 80 percent of the old communist laws. In 1994, the legislature passed a new penal code and finalized a law on the education of minorities, bringing the issue into conformity with international standards. However, violations of human rights, including the use of violence by police and harsh conditions in prisons, remain a problem, exacerbated by the lack of an independent judiciary.

About the Project
</h2>
The 
<a href="albania.html"><b>Soros Foundation - Albania</b></a>,
with support from 
<a href="osibuda.html"><b>Open Society Institute - Budapest</b></a> 
launched the Albanian Education Development Project (AEDP)
in l994 with an initial multiyear commitment of $9 million.  AEDP
developed during l995 into one of the foundation networks 
major initiatives in educational change at the school level. 
Operating in Europes poorest country and within a society 
deeply affected by the regime of the past, the AEDPs 
programs have had to be both wide-ranging and targeted to 
fundamental, sustainable change in classroom conditions and 
childrens learning. Activities encompass three Cs
construction, curriculum, and community development linked 
to schools.
<p>
During l995, the AEDP completed emergency repairs and 
classroom refurbishment in approximately 50 schools, which 
provided basic access and a better learning environment for 
more than 20,000 children, as well as income-generating 
opportunities for Albanias emerging private industry. 
Facilities rehabilitation also served as an important base 
and catalyst for AEDPs other education and community-based 
activities. In cooperation with the Albanian Ministry of 
Education, World Bank, UNICEF, numerous bilateral donors, 
and others, AEDP helped facilitate nationwide curriculum and 
teaching reform through extensive training and program and 
materials development. A highly successful distance 
education program for teachers of history,  geography, 
English, and French was developed by AEDP and  broadcast 
countrywide as a cost-effective way to reach unqualified 
teachers and those in Albanias remote and mountainous rural 
areas.  AEDP, in partnership with the Catholic Relief 
Services, organized numerous programs to stimulate bottom-
up educational improvement led by Albanian teachers, 
parents, community and business leaders, and students 
themselves. Cofunding of AEDP activities by a wide variety 
of local and external donors during l995 is estimated at 
more than $1 million.

Belarusian Soros Foundation -<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
The Belarusian Soros Foundation (BSF) strives to address the 
growing needs, trends, and upheavals occurring in 
contemporary Belarus. The foundation has become the unifying 
force for both domestic and foreign organizations supporting 
the development of an open society in Belarus. Its strategy 
is to assist individuals and groups that conceive and 
implement innovative initiatives in education, independent 
media, and civil society.
<p>
Economic collapse has affected the lives of almost every 
Belarusian, and the country is controlled by an 
authoritarian administration. Unfortunately, most 
international agencies and foundations (as well as the 
media) are neither equipped to work long-term in Belarus nor 
particularly enthusiastic about doing so.
<p>
In recognition of the need to expand its activities to more 
segments of the population, the foundation organized 
national competitions to select grantees for programs in 
education, arts, culture, economic reform, mass media, and 
other areas. These competitions have already had an enormous 
positive impact on individuals and institutions previously 
not directly affected by BSF's grantmaking activities. By 
using the grant competition model, the foundation has 
resolved many of its earlier internal problems. The 
competitions as well as the existing 
<a href="/osibuda.html"><b>Open Society Institute - Budapest</b></a>
and 
<a href="/osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute - New York</b></a>
regional programs have generated much interest, support, and public 
debate concerning the foundation's work.
<p>
In each program category, experts from throughout Belarus 
were selected to assist the foundation in creating 
competitions that would promote the development of new 
methods to address critical issues in the republic. In order 
to attract the greatest number of applicants from all 
sections of the population, the competitions were announced 
via mass media throughout the republic. Expert jurors 
selected the projects which they considered to have the 
strongest long-term positive impact on the republic and 
recommended them for funding to the BSF advisory board. In 
total, BSF conducted over 26 competitions for funding in 
1995. Thousands of proposals were received, and hundreds 
were supported.
<p>
The national competitions in the areas of arts, culture, and 
mass media were the most successful. The competitions in 
arts and culture helped unify the resources of Belarusian 
intellectuals, helping them to persevere in their endeavors. 
The foundation's mass media competition, which was both 
timely and necessary, generated much controversy due to the 
government's efforts to eliminate the independent press. 
<p>
Given that funding has only recently been awarded via the 
competitions in medicine and ecology, it is difficult to 
assess their impact. However, both of these fields, which 
have had too little attention in the past, received an 
overwhelming number of proposals. BSF's
competitions in economic reform, youth programs, and 
education address areas of endeavor which are also essential 
to the establishment of open society.

Belarusian Soros Foundation -<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Belarus began 1994 effectively bankrupt, and the economic situation did not improve greatly as the year progressed. The country is one of the last in Eastern Europe to resist privatization and a free market economy. Out of 375 enterprises that were to be privatized in 1994, only 145 had been privatized by October. Private companies made up only 10 percent of the country's economy. The most notable economic achievement in the past year was the liberalization of prices on a number of consumer goods.<p>

The administration and parliament have fought pitched battles for control of the government with some lawmakers conducting a hunger strike on the floor of the legislature and the president sending troops in to evict the protesters. Censorship of the media remains tight. The president banned independent newspapers from printing a report charging corruption in his administration.

Open Society Fund - Bosnia and Herzegovina<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
During 1993 and 1994, all of the activities of the Open 
Society Fund - Bosnia and Herzegovina (OSF-BH) could be 
considered humanitarian aid of one sort or another-
assistance designed to help people survive the war. In 1995, 
with the Dayton peace accord, these efforts received less of 
our attention, and the foundation began to develop long-term 
programs in education, culture, independent media, and other 
fields. By the end of the year, the humanitarian aid 
programs were discontinued entirely. We hope we will never 
again have a need for such programs.
<p>
The most important undertaking during 1995 was the 
establishment of special-purpose institutions which 
conceive, implement, and coordinate a number of programs and 
projects in their specific fields. These include the Center 
for Management and Information Technology, the Media Center, 
and the Legal Center. The common objective of all of these 
centers is education and training aimed at developing 
relevant research and analysis and bringing Bosnia up to 
international professional standards.
<p>
The foundation's activities in 1995 were still limited only 
to the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina accessible to its 
personnel. With the gradual cessation of war activities, it 
became possible to make a considerable step forward in 
supporting projects outside of Sarajevo, as the OSF-BH did 
in the Zenica, Tuzla, and Mostar regions. Also, during the 
severest blockade of Bihac, the foundation managed to 
deliver considerable quantities of food into the region, 
easing suffering there.
<p>
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has stopped, and we expect 
that 1996 will bring further positive changes. There is a 
fundamental need for a deep transformation of economic 
consciousness in our country. To help bring Bosnia into the 
mainstream of modern economics, we started the Management 
and Information Technology Center to educate economists.
<p>
<b>Covering Sensitive Issues in Free Bosnia</b><br>
The Media Center was established to increase professionalism 
among journalists and to raise local standards to those of 
contemporary media in other countries. One of the center's
major undertakings was the revitalization of the periodical 
Slobodna Bosna (Free Bosnia), which covers even the most 
sensitive social and political issues. By establishing its 
Law Center - which collects and disseminates information on 
law and the legal profession - the foundation is helping to 
prepare lawyers for the new roles they will play in both the 
public and private sectors during the country's transition
to democracy.
<p>
The foundation continued to support education at the 
university level as well as at the elementary and high 
school levels. In 1995, the Soros School of English was 
established while the previously instituted Computer School 
extended the scope of its work. In the field of culture, we 
supported a special project entitled "A Month of BH Culture
in the Czech Republic" and the Sarajevo Film Festival, as 
well as activities to improve the quality of teaching at art 
academies.
<p>
In 1995, we discovered that the many projects we implemented 
during the war had provided valuable lessons for peacetime. 
At the time of their creation, many of our programs 
represented efforts to maintain at least some semblance of 
civilized life in the face of the apocalyptic impact of war. 
These "pilot projects" demonstrated that we could make 
significant accomplishments in adverse circumstances, and 
encouraged us to continue our activities as conditions grew 
more favorable. Due to its success in implementing programs, 
the foundation has developed a solid reputation among the 
general public as well as among representatives of 
governmental and nongovernmental organizations.
<p>
We are aware, of course, that peace brings its own problems. 
In that respect, in 1996 the foundation plans to initiate 
programs for the social groups that were particularly 
threatened and deprived by the war. 
The foundation's presence in the parts of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina thus far inaccessible will certainly require new 
approaches. The time has come to start some serious thinking 
about these matters.
<p>
If the Dayton accord brings real peace and the beginning of 
a new era for Bosnia and Herzegovina, then we can state with 
confidence that the OSF-BH is ready-with regard to its
experience, personnel, reputation, and the results achieved 
so far-for new, positive developments, for the process of 
reintegration of this country into the regional and 
international communities.

</h1></td>
</table> 

The year 1994 will be remembered in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the third year of the aggression against the Bosnian people. The war and its horrors define the life and work of everyone in Bosnia.<p>

Now, realistically speaking, the true believers in open society in Bosnia and Herzegovina do not have strong arguments to make to the long-suffering people of the country who face extermination precisely because of their tolerance. To whom can they appeal? To whom in the world of the powerful can they point as a positive example? The only lesson Bosnians have gained in their dealings with world powers is that force is all that counts.<p>

It is difficult to uphold the most important values of an open society in the midst of a war when most people can think only about survival. It is certain that due to the inevitable militarism of the society, the space for democracy has narrowed. Nevertheless, the local government has continued to support the work of certain democratic institutions within the political system and even tried to reform the economy within the limitations of a country in a state of war.<p>

A number of factors influenced the situation in Bosnia during 1994. The Washington Agreement establishing a federation between the Croat and Bosnian people halted military conflicts while opening roads and telecommunications between the two countries. The growth of the Bosnian army into a respectable force stalled the military drives of the opposing Serbs. Experts and especially young people, however, continued to leave the country. The collapse of the UN mission represented the collapse of international policy on Bosnia and a betrayal of basic principles of democracy, pluralism, and multiculturism.

Open Society Institute - Croatia<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
In 1995, the political situation in Croatia developed 
rapidly from one dominated by frustrated feelings of defeat 
and loss to one informed by the sudden restoration of 
Western Slavonia and the region around Knin. These events 
were followed by the disastrous revelation that almost all 
the Serbian population had fled those regions. Finally, we 
sadly witnessed instances of private revenge. Nevertheless, 
the Dayton peace agreement opened processes of normalization 
within Croatia and increased the demands of opposition 
parties, institutions, workers, intellectuals, students, and 
scholars for the restoration of civic values and greater 
transparency in public life. 
<p>
The Open Society Institute - Croatia began to find partners 
for its programs which promote democracy and a civil society 
built on freedom of speech, education, and communication, 
international openness, defense of human rights, and the 
rule of law. Programs in education, English and French 
teaching, library support, social sciences and humanities 
research, law, publishing, e-mail and Internet, cultural 
journals and independent media, conferences and travel, 
medical support, civil society, and social welfare sought to 
enhance or to preserve the principles and practices of open 
society throughout Croatia, in cities as well as smaller 
towns.
<p>
<b>A Platform for Promoting Open Journalism</b><br>
The Independent Media Program helped support the continued 
existence of a number of influential weeklies in spite of 
the antagonistic attitude of the government toward them. The 
presence and relevance of the Feral Tribune (Split), Vijenac 
and Arkzin (Zagreb), and Bumerang (Osijek) in their local, 
all-Croatian, or specific intellectual environments is 
constant and recognized. In addition, the ever-increasing 
informational influence of Novi List (Rijeka) presents a 
good platform for promoting open journalism. The 
foundation's partners in supporting alternative media 
include the European Union, European Council, the 
Westminister Foundation for Democracy, and The Press Now 
(Netherlands).  
<p>
The foundation's potentially very successful education 
programs-which seek to introduce new teaching methodology to 
preschools, 
primary schools, and high schools-were hindered 
unnecessarily due to the constant suspicions of the Ministry 
of Education and its excessive restrictions on their 
development. Programs such as Health Education for Teachers, 
which does not require official approval 
from the ministry, have succeeded in finding a welcome 
reception among participants.
<p>
The University Support Program provided assistance to 
individual scholars working on research projects, but, due 
to the resistance of the government, the foundation was not 
able to offer direct support to Croatian universities.
<p>
The Croatian Legal Center, which opened in September, 
quickly delivered its message to the public: Croatia can be 
a democratic country only if it recognizes the rule of law, 
including equal rights for all citizens. The center provides 
human rights counseling, monitors judicial proceedings for 
violations of rights, and engages in research and the 
dissemination of information on legal and legislative 
issues. The E-mail/Internet Program, which offers training 
courses and equipment grants, seeks to put more and more 
individual and institutional users onto computer networks. 
<p>
OSI-Croatia supported a well-structured cultural program, 
enhancing the musical education and performance capabilities 
of young, talented artists as well as providing instruments 
essential for high-class performances; supporting 
contemporary artists and art documentation activities 
through the Soros Center for Contemporary Arts; caring for 
aesthetic standards, for cultural heritage as a historical 
statement and obligation, and for theater, film, and drama 
as a stage for social sensitivity and sensibility.
<p>
We hope that the foundation will be able to continue these 
programs for some time in the future, aiding the evolution 
of open society in Croatia. The primary role of the 
foundation should vanish as its programs succeed, or it 
should change with future projects. At this moment, it is 
still a long road ahead of us.

Open Society Institute - Croatia<br>Country Background

</table> 

Since 1991, the war has shifted priorities from the democratization of society to a defense of national identities present in the collective memory since the beginning of the emancipation struggles at the turn of the century. For the past four years, life in Croatia has been characterized by the sudden impoverishment of the country by the destruction of war, the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a disabled transportation system due to occupied territories, and, as a consequence, the reconfiguration of society and simplification of internal communications to basic questions about the state, national defense, and the populist politics of the ruling party.<p>

People reacted to these pressures in different ways. Some gave in to the new political convictions, some became homeless and traumatized, while others tried to continue the democratization of society that began in the 1980s.

culture, and the promotion of intellectual cooperation among 
Central and Eastern European countries. Our strategy is to 
target areas neglected by the government and other official 
structures. In 1995, OSF-Prague established three new civil 
society programs to provide support and training for 
community-based organizations that develop activities 
responsive to local needs. The long-term goal is to create a 
network of active, self-sustainable grassroots organizations 
that share successful programs and experiences with each 
other.
<p>
The Civic Education Through Czech Language Courses seek to 
provide the rising number of immigrants and refugees in the 
Czech Republic with basic information about the legal and 
social systems, human rights, Czech history, and Czech 
language training. In 1996, we plan to offer high school and 
university scholarships to refugees to help them integrate 
into Czech society. Another education program in 1995, the 
<a href="/hesp.html"><b>Higher Education Support Program</b></a>, 
promoted the advancement 
of higher education in the social sciences and humanities. 
The foundation also supported several promising projects in 
the areas of postgraduate education, distance learning, and 
teacher training.
<p>
Our long-term goal in education is to develop alternative 
methods of basic and secondary school education by 
identifying and supporting already existing initiatives, 
implementing new ones, and encouraging different forms of 
teacher training. More support will be provided in 1996 to 
educational cooperation with Central and Eastern European 
countries by supporting student exchanges and other forms of 
student mobility in the region.
<p>
<a href="/youth.html"><b>The Youth Program</b></a> 
helped to encourage open thinking, 
responsibility, and other qualities indispensable for an 
open, civil society among young people. One of the most 
successful activities was a training program for young, 
aspiring journalists, which we hope to develop further in 
1996. The foundation will also introduce a new program to 
provide support to organizations that assist young people 
who are particularly vulnerable due to their economic or 
minority status. 
<p>
In 1995, the foundation's Roma Program provided support to 
talented Roma students by offering them stipends for high 
school and university studies. The foundation funded a range 
of projects and training programs in culture and education 
with the aim of improving the situation of the Roma 
community as well as the majority population's perception of
the Roma. In cooperation with the Soros Roma Foundation and 
local partners, the foundation offered legal counseling to 
Roma experiencing problems with citizenship. 
<p>
Throughout 1995, OSF-Prague increased its efforts to find 
the best and most relevant partners for existing and future 
activities, to raise public awareness of open society, and 
to create a supportive environment for the foundation's 
work.

</table> 

Since the fall of communism in 1989, the Czech Republic has established basic democratic structures, including reintroduction of free elections on both national and local levels, the adoption of important economic legislation, and procedures for privatization. Macroeconomic statistics show promising results, but the price for most of this economic success is being paid by the neediest members of Czech society. Economic reform itself tends to be the only interest of the government, which leads to the neglect of other crucial fields such as education and the environment.<p>

In the Czech Republic, as elsewhere in the post-communist region, society still finds it difficult to cope with an increase in various forms of racial, ethnic, and political intolerance. The public in general does not understand or fully accept values such as democracy, spiritual, political, and economic plurality, social and economic justice, social responsibility, the widespread participation of citizens in public life, and limits on the prerogatives of the state versus the rights of ethnic, religious, and other minorities.

Soros Foundation - Latvia<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 

You begin, in the early spring of 1992, with no office, no 
telephone, no board of directors, and only a skeleton staff, 
in a country where the structures of statehood are barely 
six months old. You have only the trust that has been placed 
in you to give form to one man's vision.
<p>
Almost four years later, you would like to believe that the 
form-a thing now called the Soros Foundation-Latvia, with a
definite structure and established reputation-has managed 
both to make a difference in Latvia and to retain the 
initial enthusiasm and vision of its early days. 
<p>
Looking back over the past year, I recall several moments 
which stand out, tangible milestones which seem to give 
credence to the belief that, yes, the foundation has made a 
difference. One such moment was the Soros Foundation-Latvia 
Town Forum in April 1995, where 20 of the foundation's young 
scholarship students debated for two hours, in English, with 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>, 
the Prime Minister of Latvia, and two of 
Latvia's leading politicians. Not the most accommodating 
company, yet one left the debate with the distinct 
impression that the students had more than held their own, 
and that these new members of Latvian society will be 
Latvia's best guarantee of open society: erudite, involved, 
audacious, and probing; respectful and tolerant, yet not 
submissive. These future citizens and voters of Latvia will 
be difficult to manipulate, to cajole, or to buy with empty 
promises.
<p>
At such times, the foundation's focus on education as its 
number one priority seems more than justified, especially 
when this supposedly long-term investment ends up reaping 
visible returns in such a short span of time. 
<p>
Another conspicuous sign of the foundation's impact on
Latvian society came in distinctly provocative and concrete 
forms: here a five-star merry-go-round where Lenin's statue 
used to stand, here a vertically upright tramway car at a 
major Riga intersection, there a mythical Latvian folk 
hero's hat of gigantic proportions floating down the Daugava 
river. These were just a few of the artworks and 
installations exhibited at the SCCA-Riga's open air 
exhibition entitled "Monument," also supported by the 
foundation. These works were the outward manifestation of 
that which is "different," "provocative," "non-standard,"
and "incomprehensible" in Latvian society.
<p>
The exhibition served as a litmus test of the level of 
tolerance for the "other" which Latvian society has or has 
not achieved. In this case, the test proved that the Soros 
Foundation-Latvia's vision of an open society was not yet 
fully realized. At first thought, this was discouraging; but 
on second thought, I found it encouraging to know how far we 
had come and to realize what work remained to be done.
<p>
Four years after independence, and four years into the life 
of the 
Soros Foundation-Latvia, it has become increasingly evident 
that the key problems of Latvian society are not systemic 
and structural. 
On the one hand, well-conceived reforms have been put into 
place. On the other hand, these structures both serve and 
are served by a populace that is divided along one clear 
line: those with the capacity for individual critical 
thinking who understand that the present and the future is 
their responsibility, and those who wish for nothing more 
than to bequeath this responsibility to the state, to a 
strong leader, to prophets bearing promises, or to the next 
generation. Our goal is to ensure that the former group take 
precedence over the latter in ever-increasing numbers.
<p>
In the coming years, we will continue to work toward this 
goal; we will continue to fight for our principles. Yet, at 
the same time, two new major challenges emerge as we grow 
and become more structured. First, we must be wary of the 
dangers of complacency. A foundation such as ours is poised 
at the fault lines of society. Old tremors subside, while 
new cracks emerge. We must continue to apply the wisdom that 
comes with experience, but at the same time not lose the 
inquisitiveness and flexibility of our early years as a 
foundation. Second, we must ensure that the principles we 
prescribe are ones that we also practice. We trust that we 
have been, and will continue to be, acutely aware of the 
fact that fighting for one's principles and living up to 
one's principles are two inseparable goals.
<p>

(In June 1996, Vita Matiss stepped down; Vita Terauda is the 
foundation's current executive director.)

Soros Foundation - Latvia<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

The Republic of Latvia's development as a civil society is perhaps bestillustrated by its acceptance in February 1995 as a member of the Council of Europe. Throughout 1994 the government of Latvia put into place the elements of a democratic, Western society, and at the end of the year the country was democratically governed and with a robust, mostly open market. Latvia was on its way to a stable economy and enjoyed a free and independent press, and, in most respects, the rule of law.<p> 
 
A key accomplishment in 1994 was the long-awaited adoption of regulations governing naturalization of noncitizens. The process of naturalization has already begun, and the law has been deemed internationally acceptable by the Council of Europe and other multi-national organizations. Although several international investigations (by the United Nations, the OSCE, and others) have found no systematic discrimination against non-Latvians or noncitizens in the country, the population remains riven by linguistic, ethnic, and national differences. The Soros Foundation-Latvia helps to address these issues through the Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies, the Ethnic Entente Program, and specific grants aimed at greater ethnic and multinational understanding. All Soros Foundation-Latvia grant, scholarship, and other programs are advertised in Russian as well as in Latvian.

Open Society Institute - Macedonia<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
In September 1994, I gave the title "Narrow Road, Third 
Step" to the introductory text explaining the foundation's 
program and budget for 1995. At that time, I could not 
imagine how dramatic this year would be, both for the 
Republic of Macedonia and the Open Society Institute-
Macedonia. It seemed that with the signing of the 
Macedonian-Greek Agreement, the Republic of Macedonia would 
finally be free from the threat of war and enter the 
international community as an independent state. However, 
the attempted assassination of President Gligorov in 
October, 1995, showed that danger for a democratic Macedonia 
still exists. 
<p>
During 1995, OSI-Macedonia was subjected to a fierce 
campaign instigated by media close to the president and his 
cabinet. Among other things, the foundation and 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a> 
were accused of putting pressure on the Macedonian 
government to legalize the so-called Albanian University in 
Tetovo. Even explicit and repeated statements by Soros 
explaining that he does not support Tetovo University 
because he believes it could lead to the disintegration of 
Macedonia did not help to silence the campaign.
<p>
In 1995, the foundation made a significant change in program 
priorities, placing the highest emphasis on education, 
instead of humanitarian efforts and support for the media. 
The regional preschool program 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
grew from 18 
groups in 1994 to 218 groups in 1995, encompassing 40 
percent of all children in kindergarten. The Active Learning 
Project initiated new teaching methodologies in 11 primary 
schools. More than 40 secondary schools received computer 
equipment. Through these programs, OSI-Macedonia became a 
valued and visible player on the education scene in 
Macedonia. Its relations with the national education 
authorities are positive and invite a deeper involvement in 
the restructuring of the educational system. Our partners in 
the field of education include UNICEF, the British Council, 
USIS-Skopje, and CEPES-UNESCO.
<p>
<b>Linking Private Radio Stations</b><br>
The Media Program helped establish direct links among 10 
private radio stations, giving the state radio serious 
competition. The foundation was very active in the public 
debate over the new telecommunications laws, attempting to 
ensure that they encourage rather than hinder private 
electronic media. We initiated a media monitoring program 
with the European Media Institute-Dusseldorf and began 
publishing the <i>Macedonia Media Bulletin</i>. Foundation support 
for the purchase of a small rotary press by Europe 92, a 
private printing house, made possible the existence of 
several alternative newspapers, including <i>Delo</i> in the 
Macedonian language and <i>Koha</i> in the Albanian language. 
<i>Dnevnik (The Daily)</i>  began publishing in early 1996, 
supported by a grant and a no-interest loan from OSI-
Macedonia.
<p>
Our first experience with giving loans was a credit line for 
small farmers who previously had received technical support 
from VOCA (Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance). 
The credits, with a maximum value of $5,000, are being 
repaid on time, making us optimistic about credit projects.
<p>
The 
<a href="/copress.html"><b>Publishing</b></a> 
and 
<a href="/osiart.html"><b>Arts and Culture</b></a> 
Programs played 
important 
roles in 1995, supporting the multicultural wealth of 
Macedonia. Translations from the classic languages into 
Macedonian represented 
a significant contribution to overcoming the marginalized 
status of 
the Macedonian language. The publication of the tragedies of 
the ancient Greek authors Sophocles and Euripides also were 
important in beginning to break down the artificial barriers 
between Greece and Macedonia.
<p>
Support from the Soros Center for Contemporary Arts-Skopje
made it possible for visual artists to express their 
creative potential at individual and group exhibitions in 
Macedonia and abroad.
<p>
Through the 
<a href="/east.html"><b>East East Program</b></a>, 
the foundation supported a 
program on "Advanced Conflict Resolution: Training for
Trainers from Albania, Macedonia, and Yugoslavia." The 
foundation also funded NGOs working on human rights, ethnic 
conflicts, women's rights, and the protection of the 
environment.
<p>
OSI-Macedonia supported a wide range of programs in 1995, 
and, as a result, played a significant role in supporting 
democratic, civil, and peaceful options in Macedonia.

The Open Society Institute-Macedonia was founded in October 1992 at a time when it had not yet received international recognition. During the difficult winter months of 1993, the foundation's programs and George Soros' assistance were the only source of hope for the citizens of Macedonia and the only evidence that the newly established independent state had not been completely forgotten by the international community and left to die slowly, somewhere at the edge of civilization and not far from the battlefields in Bosnia.

Soros Foundation - Moldova<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
Support for education remained the highest priority of the 
Soros Foundation-Moldova in 1995. While successfully 
developing a large range of regional programs (
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step,</b></a> 
<a href="/english.html"><b>English Language,</b></a> 
<a href="/youth.html#highschool"><b>Debate,</b></a> 
<a href="/youth.html#youth"><b>Youth,</b></a> 
<a href="/youth.html#health"><b>Health Education</b></a>
), the 
foundation also initiated its own programs to help 
universities by funding internships abroad, publishing new 
textbooks, supporting postgraduate students, and offering 
scholarships. 
<p>
In the field of secondary education, the foundation 
continued its computerization program as well as teacher 
training programs and other activities. As part of a 
comprehensive program of modernization of education, the 
foundation also established an information center and funded 
curriculum development efforts. To strengthen cooperation, 
the foundation's educational programs are now supervised by 
a single educational board.
<p>
The independent media was another strategic area supported 
by the foundation. We continued to support the Independent 
Journalism Center, which operates as an information source 
and training base for the independent media. Training 
programs at the center include Local Election Coverage, 
Management of Print Media, TV News, Business and Economic 
Reporting, Photojournalism, Government and Public Affairs 
Reporting, and Radio. In print media, which is emerging as a 
viable market nationally, the foundation shifted its 
attention to support for local papers, awarding equipment 
and newsprint grants to three local independent newspapers.
<p>
The foundation supported independent radio stations by 
insuring access to information through subscriptions to news 
agencies, and by providing training and equipment donations. 
In the area of television, funding went for the creation and 
promotion of TV programs by independent journalists. The 
foundation also supported English-language scholarships for 
journalists, helped establish a press club, and organized 
competitions for investigative reporting.
<p>
<b>Developing Civil Society Despite Social Apathy</b><br> 
Human rights activities were the main focus of support in 
the area of civil society. The foundation awarded a grant to 
the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights to organize an 
international workshop on human rights in times of 
transition. The workshop's goal was to educate the public 
about international human rights law. Soros Foundation-
Moldova also financed a workshop on the teaching of human 
rights in secondary schools. Representatives of local 
universities, the Ministry of Education, and Amnesty 
International attended the workshop and discussed the 
development of curricula for human rights teaching. The 
program will continue in 1996 with the preparation of 
experimental materials. The foundation also supported a 
legal center which offers free legal advice to disadvantaged 
segments of the population, especially concerning human 
rights violations.
<p>
In supporting the development of civil society in Moldova, 
the foundation faces two major difficulties: the persistent 
notion that the state should be responsible for everything, 
including the survival of NGOs, and the disastrous economic 
situation, which causes social apathy and forces NGOs to 
seek support for institutional survival, rather than for the 
development of new programs.
<p>
Fifteen local NGOs received grants for various activities in 
education, the arts, ecology, etc. Support also went toward 
the publication of an NGO directory, and a meeting of NGOs 
from Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine to discuss environmental 
issues and policies. In 1995, with financial support from 
TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of 
Independent States), the foundation established the first 
NGO consulting and training center in Moldova.
<p>
The foundation's
<a href="/health.html"><b>medical programs</b></a> 
emphasized education with 
support going to training courses and medical journals. The 
Soros Foundation-Moldova participated with the national 
foundations in 
<a href="/slovakia.html"><b>Slovakia</b></a> 
and 
<a href="/romania.html"><b>Romania</b></a> 
in the Regional Hospital 
Project, which provided donated medical equipment and 
supplies, as well as training in their use, to hospitals in 
the three countries.

Soros Foundation - Moldova<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Moldova rose as an independent state from the ruins of the former Soviet Union in August 1991. Until then, Moldovan society was governed by rigid totalitarian laws, freedom of expression was nonexistent, access to information limited (especially regarding the West), travel aboard was restricted, and so-called nongovernmental organizations were controlled by the state. Resistance to the Soviet regime was stronger in the area of national problems than in the human rights area. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Moldova as an independent state, the national problems being to a great extent solved, society proved to be unprepared for the danger that a quasi-totalitarian regime would be maintained on a local level. That danger still exists.

Open Society Fund - Bratislava<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
Since its inception in 1992, the Open Society Fund-
Bratislava has focused its activities on initiatives and 
programs in education, arts and culture, health and 
medicine, management, media, human rights, support of local 
NGOs, as well as cooperation with other Central and Eastern 
European countries. Our long-term goals are to develop a 
mosaic of grassroots organizations able to survive without 
substantial aid from OSF-Bratislava or foreign donors; to 
increase the educational level of the Slovak population; and 
to mitigate problems which arise from national, ethnic, and 
other kinds of intolerance.
<p>
In 1995, the foundation supported the civil society programs 
of a number of local NGOs, including the Milan Simecka 
Foundation, Jan Hus Foundation, Marai Sandor Foundation, 
Slovak Academic Information Agency, and the Forum 
Foundation.
<p>
In education, the foundation's
<a href="/hesp.html"><b>Higher Education Support Program</b></a> 
provided support through several important 
subprograms. The External Teachers Program helped 
universities stay in touch with competent teachers and young 
researchers who had left teaching for better-paying jobs. 
The universities hope to persuade these teachers to return 
when the pay and working conditions improve. The 
Postgraduate Teaching Support Program provided supplementary 
stipends to postgraduate students in order to inspire them 
to remain in academia. The International Cooperation Program 
provided small grants to academics to enable them to 
participate in important international seminars 
and conferences. 
<p>
The Graduate Studies Program, an OSF-Bratislava pilot 
project in its second year, awarded three-year postgraduate 
scholarships in fields such as science and technology, 
environmental studies, informatics, health and nutrition. 
The Travel Grant Program was expanded to include grants for 
students who have been accepted at Western Universities. The 
Open Libraries Program was established to help libraries 
with book, journal, and equipment acquisitions.The 
foundation established three e-mail/Internet programs in 
1995: Computer Acquisition for High Schools, Local Media 
Internet, and HealthNet. HealthNet, developed in cooperation 
with the 
<a href="/osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute - New York</b></a>,
seeks to improve 
the quality of health care by 
providing networking opportunities to health professionals 
throughout Slovakia.
<p>
<b>Training for Preschool Teachers</b><br>
In 1995, we continued to support the implementation of 
curricular reforms in elementary schools, the training of 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
and Roma preschool teachers, and the teaching 
of foreign languages in elementary schools. We started a 
training program for young journalists, which will serve as 
a model for local governments. Hundreds of secondary schools 
were awarded grants for their extracurricular activities.
<p>
For the past three years, OSF-Bratislava has supported 
several summer camps for disadvantaged Roma children in 
Central and Eastern Slovakia. We also supported the work of 
four preschools for Roma children and mothers. The children 
have shown a remarkable rate of success in entering and 
remaining in elementary schools. Separate classes are held 
for mothers on health and educational issues. 
A number of scholarships were awarded to talented Roma 
students. INFORoma, a special center established with the 
foundation's help, documented Roma issues and provided 
assistance to refugees.
<p>
In cooperation with the Covenant College Quest Program and 
the Management Training Program, the foundation helped young 
Slovak business leaders learn more about economic reform via 
internships with small American businesses. In health and 
medicine, we supported a summer internship program for 
medical students at the Veterans Hospital in New York and 
provided grants for drug and alcohol education prevention 
programs.
<p>
In 1995, we held competitions to support the publication of 
original works by Slovak citizens in literature, poetry, and 
history, and the translation of essential texts in 
economics, philosophy, law, sociology, and political 
science. Our Media Program provided technical assistance for 
local newspapers, educational activities concerning media 
law, seminars for local journalists, and exchanges among 
Eastern European journalists. The Soros Center for 
Contemporary Arts in Slovakia supported a wide range of 
programs in the visual arts, performing arts and film, 
educational activities, lectures, and roundtable discussions 
on art philosophy. The foundation also provided assistance 
to community groups working to protect the environment.

Slovakia, a small nation of 5.3 million, became independent in 1993 when it split from the former Czechoslovakia. As a newly independent nation, Slovakia faces intensified problems in its transition to an open, civil society. Repeated changes in the government have hindered reform efforts and led to a critical economic situation, especially in education, health care, and culture. Budget restraints and gross underfunding of the country's social safety net have particularly affected early childhood education and higher education. National minorities, including Hungarian, Rroma, Polish, Ukrainian, Czech, and Ruthenian, make up approximately 20 percent of the population. Despite alarming signs of tension and  
antagonism among these groups, no major conflicts have arisen.<p>  
  
Despite a lack of legislation fostering the growth of not-for-profits, NGOs in Slovakia are thriving and play an influential role in the development of Slovak society. Civic organizations carry out independent programs in social welfare, education, human rights, local government reform, independent media, health care, and minority rights.

Open Society Institute - Slovenia<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
Economic prosperity and open society do not always walk 
hand-in-hand. Slovenia, already relatively rich when it was 
part of the former Yugoslavia, has become even wealthier in 
the past few years. The process, however, has not been 
accompanied by the development of open society. In fact, 
growing intolerance and latent nationalism have increasingly 
come to characterize Slovenian society.
<p>
One of the foundation's key programs in 1995 was the 
Humanitarian Help Program, which allowed refugees from 
conflict throughout the former Yugoslavia to participate in 
educational, cultural, and other programs. Due to our 
efforts, all qualifying refugee students are enrolled in 
universities and receive free health insurance and meals. 
Although we lacked the funds to pay the fees for 111 
postgraduate students from Bosnia and Herzegovina, we 
persuaded some faculties to reduce the fees and the Ministry 
of Science to make up the difference. 
<p>
Slovenia's only secondary school with a special program for 
refugees continued its operations for a third year with our 
support. Foundation-supported legal counseling for refugees 
expanded to include a total of six offices across Slovenia. 
Cultural programs organized by refugees are now up and 
running in nine refugee centers. At the end of the year, we 
opened a 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
class for refugees, providing the 
children with an opportunity to interact with Slovene 
children every day and feel more a part of the community.
<p>
The foundation was a leader in bringing computer technology 
services to an eager public through its funding of the 
Internet Training Center, Digital Media Lab, Network Arts, 
Research Center, and Student Resource Center. The foundation 
worked in partnership with the Ministries of Education and 
Culture and the Students Organization of Ljubljana 
University to connect schools to academic computer networks. 
<p>
In 1995, we continued to assist smaller publishers, 
encouraging them to publish younger and less-established 
authors as well as translations of relevant contemporary 
works. We organized nine small publishers into a publishing 
group called Indeks, which has become a important voice in 
the industry. We held a competition for anti-fascist comic 
strips and helped publish the most successful examples. In 
support of independent media, we focused on projects that 
provide access to and develop alternative sources of 
information. We also supported particular radio programs 
that promote open society views, values, and approaches. 
Encouraged by the success of the Ljubljana Desktop 
Publishing Laboratory, we opened another center in Maribor.
<p>
In our civil society program, we continued to support human 
rights programs and other NGOs. In December, we opened a 
legal center to offer advice to refugees, NGO leaders, and 
others. Troubled by the fact that the government is 
reorganizing some of its services and calling these new 
agencies "foundation," we began preparing an effort to 
stimulate a wide public discussion about philanthropy, the 
role of NGOs, and the values of open society.

Open Society Institute - Slovenia<br>Country Background

</table> 

Secession and the pressures of building a state have delayed the passage of laws to regulate the transition in Slovenia. The absence of regulations severely obstructs the activities of educational, scientific, cultural, and artistic institutions, and the media. Nongovernmental organizations are forced to adapt to changing times without guidance. When appropriate regulations are passed, these organizations will have to reorganize in a relatively short time. OSF-Slovenia is assisting NGOs in developing the necessary legal competence and operational skills to meet their present and future situations creatively, to avoid confusion, and to recognize and use the opportunities open to them.<p> 
 
Recently passed laws open many new possibilities for nongovernmental organizations. For example, private and independent public schools and universities with their own curricula and programs are now legally possible. New laws promise more competition, yet power relationships remain unchanged. The universities, the national cultural and scientific institutions, and the government-controlled media (TV, national radio, daily newspapers) still possess the clout to block competition. Rare cases of governmental support to new dynamic entities are due more to enlightened individuals and small groups within the administration than to systemic policies and practices.<p> 
 
Independence of the media is a relatively new concept in Slovenia. The new law on the media, presently being adopted, still authorizes state subsidies for the national radio and television network. Independent media, on the other hand, must rely for their financing on advertising provided by a few large advertising agencies. The agencies have ties to political parties and lobbies, which gives these groups a measure of indirect control.<p> 
 
The financial situation of most NGOs is dire. Government support is mostly directed toward the "national" institutions inherited from the previous system. These institutions are overstaffed and used to relaxed financing and the absence of any real control. The more creative "non-national" entities are seriously marginalized and underfinanced.

Soros Foundation - Kazakstan<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 

The Soros Foundation-Kazakstan (SFK), established in 1994 
and registered in 1995, concentrated on education, library 
support, English-language instruction, arts and culture, 
third sector development, and conference and travel 
programs. In its priority area of education, the SFK took a 
multilevel approach, acknowledging the necessity of 
introducing new materials, new methods, and new disciplines 
in grade school, secondary school, and university programs.
<p>
At the Kazakstan Institute of Management Economics and 
Strategic Planning (KIMEP), which offers previously 
unavailable graduate degrees in economics, public 
administration, and business taught in English by foreign 
faculty, the foundation selected Soros Scholars based on 
need and academic achievement. In 1995, the SFK spent its 
entire English-language budget on training local English-
language instructors and setting up the English-language 
curriculum at KIMEP. 
<p>
At KIMEP, the foundation also established an education and 
cultural advising center, which works with the regional 
Peace Corps offices and Kazak educational administrative 
contacts to distribute information about opportunities for 
foreign study, scholarships, grants, and professional 
development programs abroad. The center was so successful in 
1995 that the foundation received a USIA grant to expand its 
operation in 1996.
<p>
Because secondary schools are extremely underfunded in 
Kazakstan, the SFK held two grant competitions for schools 
that wanted to adopt innovative educational approaches. 
Twenty-six grants were awarded for the 1995/96 academic year 
to support material and methodological changes within the 
school system through projects designed and implemented by 
the schools themselves.
<p>
In a pilot program for 20 school teachers, the foundation is 
introducing a new approach to teaching art centering on 
student perceptions, rather than teacher knowledge. Such an 
approach helps establish a more open and accepting rapport 
between teacher and pupil. If the pilot program is 
successful, the foundation will provide similar training to 
another 60 teachers throughout Kazakstan.
<p>
Schools at all levels in Kazakstan suffer from a shortage of 
textbooks. The SFK ordered 16 different books from other 
national foundations for testing in Kazakstan schools. In 
addition, the foundation held its first textbook 
competition, with an expert jury accepting 18 titles for 
publication and suggesting revisions of 30 additional works-
in-progress. In 1996, the SFK will focus its textbook 
competitions on Kazak-language instruction for native and 
non-native speakers, Kazakstani history, and Kazakstani 
literature. In conjunction with support to schools, the 
foundation provided subscriptions to Western journals to six 
central libraries, purchased a linguistics and philology 
collection for the Institute of Linguistics, and awarded 
travel grants to Kazakstani librarians to study library 
science abroad.
<p>
In the area of arts and culture, the SFK supported 10 
Kazakstani artists by publishing a catalog of their works, 
which will be sent to museums and libraries around the 
world. The foundation supported the creation of a new 
Kazakstani soap opera that dealt with current social issues, 
such as privatization and interracial tension, in a form 
that has wide public appeal. The experience also showed 
Kazakstani film crews, writers, and actors how to put 
together a television program in accordance with Western 
production standards. 
<p>
Through the Civil Society Program-the Third Sector
Initiative, the SFK provided 10 grants to NGOs for a range 
of social initiatives, including education for diabetics, 
the creation of a center for folk singer/narrators, and 
funding for the local Helsinki Watch committee. Support for 
local nongovernmental organizations is important to 
spreading the ideals of open society throughout Kazakstan.
<p>
Through the regional 
<a href="/east.html"><b>East East Program</b></a> 
and the Travel Grant 
Program, the foundation sponsored over 131 Kazakstan 
participants at major international conferences and 
scholastic programs in the humanities and social sciences. 
These extraordinary opportunities for citizens of Kazakstan 
to travel, study, and lecture in another country help them 
understand how their country is perceived abroad and 
encourage them to participate in working to encourage open 
society at home.
<p>
In 1995, we also implemented an e-mail/Internet program. 
Computer modems and software were purchased in preparation 
for a nationwide open competition which will give 30 schools 
across Kazakstan access to e-mail and Internet. In the first 
part of 1996, 15 schools will go online. Children from those 
schools will train students in the next 
15 schools.
<p>
In 1996, the SFK will initiate an independent film and media 
program, a legal reform program, a 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
preschool 
program, and a grassroots model school project.

Soros Foundation - Kazakstan<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Kazakstan had independence thrust upon it in 1992 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Like most other former Soviet republics, Kazakstan inherited a fragmented economy, an authoritarian tradition, a bloated bureaucracy, widespread corruption, and a politically and economically disenfranchised and uninvolved citizenry. While its highest leadership appears committed to reconfiguring the economy on a private basis and has attracted a number of foreign companies in search of joint ventures, progress in privatization is slow and many agreed-upon projects are as yet unrealized owing to intragovernmental conflicts, an uncertain regulatory environment, and complex geopolitical relations.<p> 
 
Living conditions for most people in the country are stark, and many technically trained ethnic Germans and Russians are returning to their ancestral homelands. The state cannot find the means to provide adequate education and health care to the general population, much less to fund research and cultural activities.<p> 
To date, the country has enjoyed overall political stability in spite of continual parliamentary crises. The economic situation, however, is exerting pressures on the political system and complicates the task of those seeking to build democracy. While relations among ethnic groups are largely amicable, there are nationalist elements ready to exploit the worsening economic conditions for their own ends.

Soros Foundation - Kyrgyzstan<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 

The mission of our foundation is to support the development 
of open society in Kyrgyzstan. We have chosen to focus our 
efforts on the field of primary and secondary education, and 
our goal is to seek and support initiatives that improve the 
quality and openness of our schools. We believe intelligent 
and tolerant kids are the best insurance for a better 
future. The end of 1995 marked the completion of just over 
one year's activity for our foundation. During this time, we 
initiated programs whose results we can already measure, and 
we prepared the ground for projects which will bear fruit 
for some years to come. 
<p>
In 1995, over 90 percent of our budget went to support for 
educational initiatives. The strategy of the foundation is 
to tie as many of our 
other programs as possible to our work in primary and 
secondary education. The result is a diverse but unified 
approach to educational reform in Kyrgyzstan which takes 
advantage of the traditional respect in Kyrgyz society for 
education, as well as the willingness among Kyrgyz teachers 
and school administrators to explore and refine new 
approaches to learning.
<p> 
<b>A Network of Pilot Schools</b><br>
The heart of our foundation's work is a network of pilot 
schools established in November 1994. The foundation began 
with 25 pilot schools, and in 1995 the number was increased 
to 43. We have provided these schools with leadership 
training, updated textbooks, computer and other technical 
equipment, multimedia educational programs, debate clubs, 
language resource centers, and young journalist clubs. We 
have also supported the development of innovative approaches 
to education at these schools. Our English Language Program 
has focused on introducing new textbooks into the pilot 
schools, training teachers in how to use them, and providing 
each school with the equipment necessary to incorporate 
video technology into the education process. The Education 
Abroad Advising Center has conducted seminars for pilot 
school teachers on how to help students take advantage of 
opportunities to study abroad. 
<p>
We have provided several pilot schools with e-mail, and, in 
1996, our goal is to expand e-mail and Internet access to 
all of the pilot schools. In 1996, the foundation will equip 
the schools with computer classrooms, support the 
development of more interactive methodologies of teaching, 
and promote the increased involvement of parents in the 
education of their children. By the end of 1996, we expect 
to be working with 50 schools all together.
<p> 
Encouraging parental involvement is one of the central 
characteristics of the 
<a href="/youth.html#preschool"><b>Step-by-Step</b></a> 
program. In 1995, the 
foundation introduced Step-by-Step into seven kindergartens, 
involving a total of 362 children. 
The goal is to help local preschool educators develop 
methods for 
cultivating the creativity and individuality of children. In 
1996, we will be exploring ways to ease the transition of 
pupils from Step-by-Step into elementary schools by 
encouraging enrollment directly into the pilot schools.
<p>
<b>Feeding the Country's 'Information Hunger'</b><br>
In the field of higher education, the foundation organized a 
series of seven seminars for young university faculty 
members and advanced graduate students on topics ranging 
from political science to pedagogy. The seminars, conducted 
by teams of lecturers from the United States, Eastern 
Europe, and the former Soviet Union, gave Kyrgyz academics 
access to information and ideas otherwise unavailable in 
this period of "information hunger." To support higher 
education, we conducted a textbook writing competition, 
which resulted in the publication of four titles. In 1995, 
we published an additional seven books by standard contract, 
and, in 1996, we will publish at least 21 books, 10 of which 
were winners of the 1995 textbook competition. 
<p> 
In addition to laying the foundation for Internet 
connectivity in the pilot schools, our 
<a href="/internet.html"><b>Internet Program</b></a> 
brought e-mail and future Internet access to three medical 
institutions and three newspapers. We also established two 
medical resource centers for surgical techniques. 
And, we have supported the establishment of a center for the 
study of Kyrgyz in a Russian-language high school, as well 
as a center for the study of Russian in a Kyrgyz-language 
high school. In 1996, while maintaining our emphasis on 
primary and secondary education, we will continue to expand 
our work in the fields of medicine, civil 
society, and the arts.

Soros Foundation - Kyrgyzstan<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

Under the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan had the tender russified name of Kirghizia. Upon gaining its sovereignty, the country changed not only its name but its character. The totally apolitical Kirghizia turned into the mobile and appealing-to-the-West Kyrgyzstan. It is here that the ideas of open society and democracy have grown more successfully than in many neighboring countries. Kyrgyzstan's independent newspapers periodically shock other commonwealth brethren with their utter explicitness of expression.<p>

This phenomenon can be explained simply enough: Kyrgyzstan has always valued education, and the country's women have always enjoyed a degree of equality. Under Soviet rule, many of Kyrgyzstan's citizens, most of them women, graduated from prominent Russian colleges and universities. This is the hidden spring of Kyrgyzstan's prompt and successful switch to democracy.<p>

Political considerations have always influenced the learning of  foreign languages. During the Cold War, German was the favored language. As a result, independent Kyrgyzstan has found itself practically incapable of directly communicating with the outer world. English language courses and tutoring have become a growth industry. New textbooks are sorely needed. Would-be capitalists and students, free of "young pioneer" organizations, still learn English from Lenin's biographies.<p>

Language problems also occur among the Kyrgyz, many of whom speak different languages, the urban Kyrgyz primarily Russian, rural residents only Kyrgyz. During the nationalist period of the early 1990s, when only the state language (Kyrgyz) was permitted, people of Russian origin had to master the language in a ridiculously short time. The language problem undoubtedly added to the outward migration of local Russians intimidated by the aggressiveness of the rural young who had gathered in urban areas in search of employment.<p>

Open Society Georgia Foundation<br>A Report from the Executive Director
</h1></td>
</table> 
For the Open Society Georgia Foundation (OSGF), 1995 was a 
year of growth and development. Administrative structures 
were put in place, a staff was hired, and a strategy for 
growth was developed. All this positioned the foundation to 
become an important partner in Georgia's transition toward
an open society. 
<p>
The foundation operated under difficult circumstances in 
1995. The government was supportive and helpful, but the 
economy presented severe problems. Energy shortages and a 
virtual breakdown of the country's infrastructure meant that 
OSGF began its activities in January with no heating, no 
gas, and very little electricity. Telephone communication 
with the outside world was unreliable, at best. 
<p>
While 1995 was, in effect,  OSGF's first year, the same 
cannot be said of the programs of the 
<a href="/ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a> 
and the 
<a href="/issep.html"><b>International Soros Science Education Program</b></a>, 
both of which have been active in Georgia for over 
two years. With the arrival of the foundation, however, 
these programs were merged into the larger administrative 
structure of OSGF. 
<p>
The foundation began 1995 with an intensive staff training 
program, developed by OSGF's head program coordinator. The 
training introduced staff to the network of foundations 
created and funded by 
<a href="/gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a>
and to the ideals of an 
open society. Staff learned what it means to be a 
coordinator, their responsibilities as representatives of a 
foundation espousing open society, and the importance of 
each person's contribution to the working of the foundation. 
<p>
An organizational structure was created to answer the many 
technical, administrative, financial, and program needs that 
arose. Managers were appointed to head various areas of work 
and given the freedom and responsibility to oversee the 
functioning of their areas. 
<p>
In the first half of 1995, a small group of representatives 
of the organizations that jointly founded OSGF governed our 
activities. As our activities unfolded-the first project 
proposals were reviewed in April-and news of the foundation 
spread, the need for a more formal governing structure grew. 
In September of 1995, the foundation appointed an executive 
board and formed review commissions for the four major 
program areas of education, English language, arts and 
culture, and mass media. 
<p>
<b>Computer Classes and Advice for Students</b><br>
In 1995, OSGF supported a total of 106 projects within its 
four program areas. The foundation created computer classes 
in several 
schools, funded independent newspapers and radio stations, 
established teacher training courses for English-language 
teachers, and reawakened the arts and culture community by 
offering grants in an area that receives virtually no 
funding from the government. In the fall, OSGF opened an 
International Student Advising Center and began a travel 
grants program. 
<p>
The 
<a href="/osiart.html"><b>Arts and Culture Program</b></a> 
supported several expeditions 
by archeologists and ethnographers to study ancient 
monuments, churches, and other sites, including an 
expedition to Turkey to record the Georgian monuments that 
remain on Turkish soil from hundreds of years ago. The 
<a href="/english.html"><b>English Language Program</b></a> 
supported the establishment and 
development of the English Teachers' Association of Georgia,
a summer teacher training course, and programs of English 
for NGOs and scouts. The Mass Media Program supported a 
respected newspaper, Seven Days, with a technical grant and 
funded an informational program at the environmental radio 
station Green Wave.
<p>
OSGF organized and hosted several Internet roundtable 
meetings in the spring and summer of 1995, bringing together 
a community of people interested in e-mail and Internet and 
stimulating a dialogue on the topic. In response to a demand 
for assistance, OSGF created the 
E-mail Starter Kit (ESK) Project, the goal of which was to 
promote 
e-mail connectivity through competitions organized for 
educational establishments, mass media, nongovernmental 
organizations, and 
others. The project awarded a total of 20 ESK grants in 
Georgia.
<p>
At the end of the year, an opinion poll conducted by a local 
television program voted OSGF the most popular funding 
organization in Georgia. In 1996, the foundation plans to 
establish new programs and to participate in additional Open 
Society Institute regional programs.

Open Society Georgia Foundation<br>About the Country
</h1></td>
</table> 

The nationalist outbursts and ethnic conflicts of recent years brought about great changes in Georgia's internal and foreign policies. Relations with Russia became more careful, more balanced and realistic. The result was an easing of ethnic conflicts, a willingness to find peaceful solutions to problems, the transfer of Georgian-Abkhazian political negotiations from Geneva to Moscow, and a bilateral thaw in Russian-Georgian mass media.<p>

Internally, the situation is more complicated. The political status of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia are unclear, and, accordingly, the state administration of the whole of Georgia is tentative. The work of parliament, in spite of help from different organizations, is inefficient. There is no political party capable of winning elections and carrying out serious economic reforms since the mentality of the major part of the population is paternalistic--they are waiting for a savior.<p>

The economy of Georgia was deeply integrated into the economy of the USSR. After the dismantling of the Soviet Union, these economic ties were also severed, and the result was the total collapse of the Georgian economy. The country produces no energy. Georgia cannot obtain oil from Russia, and it cannot pay its debts to Turkmenistan for natural gas. A number of regions have been without electricity for almost three years. Industry is almost at a standstill. Qualified workers are leaving the country. Many plants have been looted, many have grown obsolete. The lack of preparation for the decollectivization of agriculture destroyed many necessary and traditional areas of the economy. The private sector, however, did succeed in capitalizing on the need for petrol and liquid gas, allowing some entrepreneurs to grow very rich, becoming magnates in their fields.

<h2>
About the Program
</h2>
The viability of arts organizations following decreased 
state support is one of the greatest concerns and challenges 
for open society in Central and Eastern Europe. With the 
emergence of free market economies, people in the arts must 
create new structures to address issues such as fundraising, 
marketing, audience development, networking, and education. 
<p>
The Arts and Culture Regional Program promotes the sharing 
of information and resources among the region's arts 
institutions, supports training programs where Western 
assistance is still necessary, develops programs for the 
performing arts and cinema, and encourages the visual arts 
through the Soros Centers for Contemporary Arts.
<p>
In 1995, the arts program assisted partnerships such as the 
Royal National Theatre's "Seeding a Network", which provided 
management training and technical skills to participants 
from Albania, Macedonia, and Bulgaria. Under the program, 
theater people from Eastern Europe spent up to a month 
working with colleagues in the United Kingdom.
<p>
<a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a> 
<a name="artslink"></a>
<h2>
ArtsLink Program
</h2>
The ArtsLink Program gives Eastern European arts managers 
and artists of all disciplines a chance to collaborate with 
their American counterparts during five-week residences in 
the United States. In 1995, in partnership with other 
international arts funders, the Open Society Institute 
supported placements for 50 artists and arts managers from 
16 countries. Through this program, American artists are 
also working on collaborative projects with artists in the 
region.
<p>
The arts and culture program embarked on a new partnership 
in 1995 with the European Film Academy to support young 
emerging filmmakers in Central and Eastern Europe, including 
directors, screenwriters, actors, producers, and 
cinematographers, by providing them with access to the 
academy's educational activities and contacts with the 
European film community. The programs included master 
classes in directing and acting and a series of informal 
meetings with colleagues to discuss issues of importance to 
European cinema.
<p>
The visual arts continued to receive support through the 
Soros Centers for Contemporary Arts, which in 1995 were 
integrated into the national foundations. The SCCAs, located 
in 15 countries in the region, work to increase the 
international art world's access to the contemporary visual 
arts of the region. Each SCCA helps develop its country's
arts community through a visual arts grants program, 
comprehensive documentation of artists' works, an artists' 
registry, and an annual exhibition. The SCCAs also serve as 
clearinghouses for information on international exhibitions, 
arts events, and other opportunities for artists. 
Collaboration among the contemporary visual arts communities 
is encouraged through the Soros Contemporary Art Regional 
Program (SCARP), which supported 15 exhibition exchanges and 
sponsored an international workshop for young curators from 
the region.

<h2>
Open Society Cultural Link
</h2>
The Open Society Cultural Link (OSCL), developed in 1995, 
provided support for over 40 cross-cultural events, 
including musical performances, contemporary art 
exhibitions, theater acting master classes, dance festivals, 
new writing seminars, an architecture exhibition, and 
international theater festivals. The primary goal of this 
program is to facilitate collaboration among artists in 
countries in the region. The arts program also provided 
funding to the Northeast Document Conservation Center in 
Andover, Massachusetts, to expose Eastern European 
conservators to techniques used in the United States to 
conserve papers, books, and paintings.

The East East Program encourages the exchange of ideas and 
open dialogue among institutions and individuals in Central 
and Eastern Europe to share and learn from one another's
experiences in the post-communist transition. The program 
focuses on developing skills for identifying and addressing 
problems common to post-communist societies and provides 
ongoing and often new channels of communication.
<p>
In 1995, the East East Program emphasized efforts to raise 
public awareness and consciousness of current problems and 
needs of societies in transition in Central and Eastern 
Europe. The strength of the program is its ability to bring 
together people from the region who wish to learn from each 
other's experiences and help each other in these turbulent 
times of transition. The East East Program is a starting 
point for collaboration, provides a framework for regional 
cooperation and mutual dialogue, and creates conditions to 
address problems by bridging communication gaps and 
reestablishing links through innovative communication.
<p>
Throughout 1995, the East East Program evaluation team of 
five program coordinators from the 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a> 
provided an ongoing monitoring, internal evaluation, and 
advisory mechanism for the program as well as guidance for 
the program's strategic development and direction. The 
results of the team's comprehensive evaluation of the 
program provided the basis of discussion for the annual 
program coordinators meeting convened in Bled, Slovenia, in 
June 1995.
<p>
East East Program projects are designed broadly within the 
following areas: civil society and infrastructure 
development; societies in transition: information exchange 
and processes of reform; human rights, ethnic relations and 
cultural diversity; community development; social welfare, 
health, and environment; and cooperation in cultural 
research and education. The East East Program seeks to 
develop and sustain substantive, long-term initiatives and 
to strengthen and promote collaborative relations and 
intraregional networks in a practical approach to solutions 
to the complex problems faced by societies in transition.
<p>
In 1995, the East East Program supported over 200 projects 
on a wide range of topics throughout the foundation network.  
A seminar on fundraising for NGOs, hosted by the 
<a href="czech.html"><b>Open Society Fund - Prague</b></a>,
sought to strengthen the professional 
skills of fundraisers in Central and Eastern Europe and to 
increase the capacity of the not-for-profit sector to 
generate its own funding and to move toward greater self-
reliance within the region. Another seminar, entitled 
"Otherhood and Nation," hosted by the 
<a href="slovenia.html"><b>Open Society Institute - Slovenia</b></a>
attempted to initiate dialogue and 
debate in addressing the rise of nationalism in the 
post-communist transition.
<p>
"Better Perception for the Future: Information Exchange," an
initiative of the 
<a href="moldova.html"><b>Soros Foundation - Moldova</b></a>
provided 
participants from Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine an 
opportunity for exchange visits to facilitate the sharing of 
experiences in analyzing reform processes and changes in 
social consciousness in the post-communist transition and to 
create channels of constructive interaction and information.
<p>
The 
<a href="poland.html"><b>Stefan Batory Foundation</b></a> 
organized a series of seminars 
and training sessions to address the role of local 
government. The program included visits of representatives 
of local governments from Belarus and Ukraine to Poland to 
observe elections and meet with members of Polish local 
governments. An ongoing series of training workshops in 
Poland and Ukraine, "Central and Eastern European Trade 
Unions in the Process of Economic  Transformation," provided
Belarusian and Ukrainian participants with information on 
methods of transformation of Central and Eastern European 
economic systems, strategic directions of transformation, 
foundations of economic and political reforms, and rules and 
roles of worker unions' leadership.

The mission of the Regional Children and Youth Programs is 
to provide young people with the opportunities and resources 
to help them participate fully in an open society. The 
programs encourage critical thinking; teach decision-making 
skills; expose students to cultures other than their own to 
promote tolerance; initiate school reforms that foster 
cooperation between students and teachers; and provide 
access to information and innovative teaching methodologies.

<h2>
Regional Soros Preschool Project (Step-by-Step)
</h2>
The Regional Soros Preschool Project (Step-by-Step) is a 
comprehensive education reform program that promotes 
innovative teaching methods and a community-based approach 
to services for children up to eight years old. The 
curriculum for the project was developed by Children's
Resources International, and subsequently adapted to local 
conditions by early childhood experts in each country. The 
project stresses active learning, decision making, 
individualization of the teaching process, and parental 
involvement. In 1995, the project expanded to 966 
kindergarten classrooms, serving 23,225 children in 18 
countries, and focused on the needs of underserved children 
in the region-children living in poverty, ethnic minorities, 
Roma, and children with disabilities. The model classrooms 
developed for the program will be used as teacher training 
sites in order to make the methodology available on a wide 
basis.

<h2>
Regional High School Debate Program                                        
</h2>
The Regional High School Debate Program provides a forum for 
secondary school students to develop sophisticated 
communication skills, interest in and understanding of 
current social and political events, tolerance for different 
ideas, and an opportunity to discuss controversial issues in 
an educational yet competitive setting. Each country 
maintains a national center to train debate team coaches and 
provide students with research materials. In each country, 
students debate in their native language in tournaments 
throughout the year that culminate in a national tournament 
at the end of the school year.  In 1996, students and 
teachers from all 21 of the countries that participate in 
the program will attend the annual Regional Debate 
Competition, which will be conducted in English.

<h2>
Regional Secondary School Scholarship Program
</h2>
The Regional Secondary School Scholarship Program is an 
academic scholarship initiative that gives high school 
students from Central and Eastern Europe an opportunity to 
study in the United States or England. Each year, through 
open, merit-based competitions, the program awards one-year 
scholarships to the best American and British schools, one-
semester and one-year programs at U.S. schools, and summer 
academic programs. In 1995, 372 students were selected, 49 
for a full year of study in Britain, 113 for a year and 128 
for a semester in the United States, and 82 for the summer 
program. Plans for 1996 include providing Roma students with 
scholarship opportunities, adding participation in community 
service to the scholarship requirements, and establishing 
alumni networks to promote the continued participation of 
former students in open society programs.

<h2>
Regional Health Education Program 
</h2>
The Regional Health Education Program is a teacher training 
program that introduces elementary and secondary school 
teachers to innovative ways of teaching their students about 
health. The five-part curriculum focuses on alcohol and 
other drugs, human sexuality, AIDS, smoking, and nutrition, 
with supplemental activities on the environment and conflict 
resolution. In 1995, the program conducted 691 workshops and 
trained 20,515 teachers. In four years, one million students 
have participated in the programs.

<h2>
Youth Program                     
</h2>
In 1995, the Youth Program of the Open Society Institute 
joined with 
<a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/iearn/"><b>
I*EARN (the International Education and Resource 
Network) 
</b></a> 
to launch an initiative to enable schools within 
the region to participate in global educational 
telecommunications projects. The project also allows for 
cooperation in traditional academic subject areas such as 
math and science. I*EARN is active in countries from seven 
continents. In 1995, the project was introduced in Bulgaria, 
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Romania, and Slovenia. The Youth Program has made 
a commitment to I*EARN
to expand their project in 1996 to include additional 
countries within the Soros foundations network.

About the Program
</h2>
The 
<a href="osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute - New York</b></a>
supports two different yet complementary English language programs: 
<a href="#selp"><b>SELP (Soros English Language Program)</b></a>
and 
<a href="#spelt"><b>SPELT (Soros Professional English Language Teaching)</b></a>.
The mission of the two programs is to provide English 
language support to other foundation programs and to raise 
the general level of English usage in the countries of the 
region so that new generations will be able to communicate 
easily and successfully with people worldwide.
<p>
<a name="selp"></a>
<h2>
Soros English Language Program
</h2>
English language programs were introduced because the 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a> 
recognized that many people have 
difficulties participating in educational programs and 
international events that require a fairly advanced command 
of English. In many countries of the foundation network, 
foreign language teaching and learning were crippled by the 
long years of isolation from the international community. 
Therefore, local educational institutions at all levels, 
both state-owned and private, have had little to offer in 
improving the acquisition of practical foreign language 
skills.
<p>
The Soros English Language Program (SELP) was established to 
support a range of activities from independent schools of 
English to training courses for English-as-a-Foreign-
Language (EFL) teachers to the upgrading of university 
English departments to preparation for EFL examinations. In 
addition to English for academic purposes, SELP organized 
courses in business English, journalistic English, and 
military English to improve the foreign language 
communicative competence of participants in other foundation 
programs. SELP developed a number of programs in 
collaboration with other international governmental and 
nongovernmental organizations, including but not limited to 
the British Council and USIA.
<p>
In 1995, three EFL schools established by the foundations 
became self-supporting (two schools in Lithuania and one in 
Ukraine). Another significant event in 1995 was the 
introduction of other foreign languages into the SELP 
curriculum. French courses were started in Lithuania, and 
the teaching of German and French was begun in Ukraine.

<h2>
Soros Professional English Language Teaching Program 
</h2>
SPELT is an English language program that seeks to bring 
modern teaching methodologies to the region. SPELT also aims 
to inspire a dramatic change in the rigid teacher-student 
relationships characteristic of the former communist 
educational systems. As a cross-cultural educational program 
run in collaboration with official educational institutions, 
SPELT tries to increase international communication and 
foster diversity and understanding of other cultures.
<p>
To achieve these goals, specialists in EFL teaching are 
recruited by the University of Montana in the United States 
and sent to teach in secondary schools, teacher training 
colleges, and university departments in cities and towns 
throughout the region.
<p>
The 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a> 
advertise the availability of SPELT 
Teaching Fellows. Local schools pay teacher's salaries, 
provide housing, and appoint a "buddy" teacher to provide 
support. SPELT Teaching Fellows teach English side by side 
with local teachers. In addition, they offer teacher 
training workshops after school and on weekends to help 
local teachers acquire experience with new teaching 
techniques.
<p>
This program was started in 1990 with seven teaching fellows 
going to Hungary. In 1995, the program supplied 81 teaching 
fellows to schools in 15 countries. The participating 
countries in the academic year 1995-96 were Bulgaria, Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, and Ukraine.

<b>T</b>he OSI Regional Internet Program began in earnest in 1994.
Prior to that there were grants related to e-mail connectivity provided on
an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the local foundations. The
<a href="/isf.html"><b>ISF</b></a> also developed an Internet
connectivity  program for the NIS focusing on infrastructural development (i.e.
extending the network infrastructure that facilitates Internet connectivity in 
the region). The first official year of the OSI Internet program (1994) was
primarily spent funding local initiatives, developing strategy and making
contacts with funders and networking specialists throughout the world. In
1996, with a strategy and an abundance of contacts in place, the program
has matured and developed many avenues of funding opportunities.<p>
In 1995, the program extended its geographic reach to the non-Slavic
republics of the NIS and in 1996 all republics. Previously, these countries were
part of the ISF Internet project. However, ISF's need to concentrate on the four
infrastructural projects in which it was involved made it more practical for 
these countries to be administered through the OSI Regional Internet Program.
In 1996 the ISF telecommunications project was integrated into OSI's Regional Internet Program as well. 
Now both infrastructural and user-based projects are done in coordination.<p><p>

<b>T</b>he OSI-RIP program supports  relatively small scale projects that 
foster user demand for e-mail or Internet services. Each project  costs 
$100,000 on average and frequently incorporates training on use of the 
electronic services.  The OSI-RIP program encourages demand for e-mail/
Internet locally and engages other funding sources or government entities to 
supply larger scale infrastructure development once users have been exposed to 
the powers of e-mail and Internet.<p>           
The projects are usually implemented in phases: we may first introduce access 
to e-mail and, once demand has been created, we follow-up by providing access 
to the Internet. In cases where demand is facilitated and no other funding is 
forthcoming, the national foundations created and funded by George Soros may 
themselves become service providers and seek to subsidize their connections 
through fee-for-service activities. Our approach is heavily skewed towards 
fulfilling the connectivity objective of each foundation in their respective 
country. These relatively inexpensive projects have created tens of thousands 
of users in the countries they serve.<p>                
We hope that future initiatives (Internet Outreach Program, Nordic Internet 
Foundation) will be able to concentrate more on supply- and demand-side 
activities in areas where other funding sources are scarce. At the same time, 
they should share the philosophy of our regional program: connectivity projects 
must have as their core objective the exposure of more users to e-mail/Internet 
services and the provision of training to ensure their effective utilization.<p>
OSI-RIP is one of a number of connectivity efforts of the Soros-affiliated 
organizations.  Connectivity projects are also done by national foundation telecommunication programs. Some national foundations 
choose to subsidize their own telecommunication priorities and ask OSI-RIP for 
regional supplements to support coordination. OSI-RIP also provides advice to 
enhance national initiatives.<p><p>

<H3><A NAME="objectives">Objectives and Criteria</A></H3>                
<b>T</b>he objective of the OSI Regional Internet Program is to provide e-mail 
and full Internet access to individuals and organizations in Central & Eastern 
Europe as well as the republics of the NIS. The goal is to provide access to as
many as possible at the most reasonable cost. E-mail is a vital communications 
tool, and a source of first-hand news available when other communication options 
are not. The full Internet provides instant access for approximately 50 million users worldwide.<p> 
The program attempts to fund a broad array of pilot projects using different 
technologies to provide Internet/e-mail access.  The program's strategy is to 
have a number of proven options available when entering new countries with 
limited telecommunications abilities. Project funding may involve 
telecommunications-related equipment donations, loans, various telecommunication 
fees, and subsidies to cover the cost of data transmission (line and data access 
subsidies are limited to no more than two years).<p>
The OSI Regional Internet Program is "demand-driven." That is, it focuses  
on meeting user demands for connectivity as the primary objective, and builds 
infrastructure (leased lines, satellites, etc.) only when access to the current 
infrastructure proves unworkable for the users we support.<p> 
The program concentrates on identifying various 'niche markets' in each  
country where Internet access would greatly benefit society but is currently 
unavailable or unsupported by any entity. For example, while connectivity for 
the academic and research network in one particular country was government 
subsidized and relatively good compared to the rest of the region, little 
support for secondary school connectivity was provided.  Therefore, we 
concentrated our efforts on this niche. Major niche market categories include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> 	Academic and research institutions 
<li>	Secondary schools 
<li>	Media 
<li>  	NGOs 
<li>  	Libraries 
<li>	Medical institutions 
<li>	Museums 
<li>	Non-affiliated individuals 
</ul>
In addition to niche markets, the program has also supported projects  
that provide connectivity to the Internet through non-traditional as well as 
traditional means. In the West, traditional connectivity is provided through  
high-speed leased lines or optical fiber cabling. This involves installing cables
between different destinations, which is relatively costly in most of the areas 
we serve. However, Internet and e-mail service can also be provided through the
following transport mechanisms which our program has sought to develop in  
Eastern Europe:<p> 
<ul>
<li>	Satellites (dedicated or shared VSAT channels) 
<li>	Spread-spectrum radio modems 
<li>	Ham radio 
<li>	Cable television 
<li>	Microwave 
</ul>  
Wireless technologies, including those just mentioned, allow us to get  
around major obstacles in the local telecommunications infrastructure.<p> 
Both the niche market and non-traditional transport paradigms are  
designed to produce working models that can be transferred from country to  
country. For example, if a practical but non-traditional secondary school or  
medical connectivity project exists in one country, we seek to transplant it 
(with local modifications) to another with similar needs. If spread-spectrum 
radio links prove effective in one country, we encourage other countries with 
similar infrastructure problems to try that solution.<p>
 
Because of the degree of technical sophistication involved in the  
program and the widely varying telecommunication situations (both technical  
and political) existing in each country, the program is tailored to the 
budgeting and administration needs of each country. Some countries use only 
OSI-RIP's expertise and connections, but budget for the program locally. Others
have their own budgets but use the OSI-RIP budget as a supplement for specific 
telecommunication initiatives. Still others rely fully on OSI-RIP's  
telecommunications budget and expertise. The only requirement of the  Regional 
Internet Program is that a technical liason exist in each foundation to 
coordinate the Internet projects on the ground. As each office typically needs  
technical support for their own computers and networks as well, it is not  
unusual for these technicians to also coordinate the local Internet programs.<p>
A cornerstone of the program is working very closely with staff of  
foundations on the ground on any project supported by this program. The high 
cost of connectivity projects, their technical sophistication, and the need to 
deal with local telecommunication ministries and bureaus, require this close  
cooperation. It also is important to have a person locally who can determine, on  
a technical and user level, if the project is meeting its objectives and the  
objectives of the foundation.<p> 
 
In order to limit administrative overhead and concentrate on the  
broadest number of countries and projects, the Regional Internet Program  
operates almost exclusively as a third party grant giver rather than an  
implementer of projects. This is especially true of any infrastructure  
development projects where we require the grantee (or local foundation) to have
technical and management expertise available locally to ensure that projects are
successfully completed. Most Regional Internet Program grants are given to the  
local foundations, who then distribute them to third parties.<p>

<H4>Project Header: </H4>Geographical region of activity.<p>
<H4>History: </H4>A summary of each project(s). Other telecommunications 
initiatives of either the ISF or foundation in that country are also briefly 
described where applicable.  <p>
<H4>Population Targeted: </H4>The OSI-RIP focuses on specific population segments 
required to foster open, civil societies: universities and related research 
institutions, secondary (and sometimes primary) schools, libraries, medical 
institutions, cultural centers (museums, galleries, etc.), non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), independent media, environmental groups and unaffiliated 
individuals who may not have access to connectivity services otherwise.<p>
<H4>Training Sponsorship: </H4>Most projects have a training component built in.
Experience shows it is not enough simply to provide connectivity.  We also 
sponsor one coordinated effort annually to provide network administration and 
telecommunications training to service providers in the region of activity. In 
1993 and 1994, we sponsored the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/indextxt.html">
Internet Society </A>(ISOC) Internet Workshop for Developing Countries. To 
decrease costs and focus on issues and experiences in the major region we 
serve, we began to subsidize a regional workshop with the same objectives. This 
workshop is sponsored by the <A HREF="http://ceenet.nask.org.pl/">Central
and Eastern European Networking Association </a>(CEENET), a consortium of 
twenty Academic and Research Network providers in the region. The first session 
was held in 1995.<p>

<br>
<OL>
	<LI>For most e-mail projects and some Internet projects, we work with 
the <A HREF="http://wn.apc.org/apc.html">Association of Progressive 
Communications</a> (APC). The APC is a consortium of electronic Bulletin Board 
Services (BBS) in 133 countries and is dedicated to providing connectivity, 
information and training to NGOs, independent media and unaffiliated individuals.
APC serves many of our target population segments and works very much like the
Soros network, however, with BBSs that serve local users, local decision making 
and a directorate to coordinate activities. We work primarily with individual 
nodes in the region to help them progress and serve their local user constituencies. 
Occasionally, however, we sponsor projects that promote regional topics such as 
increasing connectivity for eastern European women and their associated NGOs.
	<LI>The other organization we work with is the Central and Eastern 
European Academic and Research Network (CEENET). Aside from co-subsidizing their 
workshop training activities in the region, we cooperate with most of the 
individual members in their local countries because they provide much of the
Internet service to our target population segments.
	<LI> Finally, we have linked our secondary school connectivity projects 
with distance education.  The <A HREF="http://www.igc.apc.org/iearn/">I*EARN 
Program</a>, which has a number of pre-defined distance education courses for 
secondary schools that run internationally, is being sponsored in our 
efforts.

About the Program
</h2>
Working with the 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a>,
other NGOs, and 
governmental agencies, the 
<a href="osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute - New York</b></a>
develops, funds, and operates a variety of programs aimed at 
improving the health and well-being of people in Central and 
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The emphasis of 
the programs is on public health issues such as primary 
care, prevention, substance abuse, and care for the mentally 
and physically disabled.

<h2>
Salzburg Medical Seminars Program
</h2>
The Salzburg Medical Seminars Program, directed by 
physicians from Austria and the United States, provided a 
forum for the discussion and promotion of a range of health 
issues. In 1995, 360 health care providers from 17 countries 
attended seminars in anesthesiology and intensive care, bone 
and joint surgery, cardiology, diagnostic imaging, community 
health care and family medicine, neurology, neurosurgery and 
brain trauma, pediatrics, emergency care in pediatrics, 
pediatric surgery, psychiatry and psychotherapy, and 
urology.

Schweitzer Seminars for Physicians Program
</h2>
OSI and the <a href="http://members.aol.com/asih1/">Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities</a> 
developed the Schweitzer Seminars for Physicians Program to 
reorient physicians in the region toward a systems approach 
to health care delivery by encouraging dialogue among 
clinical and nonclinical health professionals in structured 
problem-solving seminars.

<h2>
Regional Medical Training Program
</h2>
To improve clinical care in the region, the Regional Medical 
Training Program for Physicians provided medical training 
opportunities by sponsoring internships in the U.S. and 
establishing training centers in the region. By the end of 
1995, the three-year-old program had trained 108 physicians 
from 12 countries in medical specialties ranging from 
diagnostic ultrasound to pediatric surgery. In 1996, the 
program will focus on training in public health policy, 
family medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology.

Harm Reduction Initiatives
</h2>
The goal of the Harm Reduction Initiatives as Drug Policy 
Alternatives Program is to minimize the social and health 
problems associated with illegal drug use and drug control 
policies. In collaboration with 
<a href="http://www.lindesmith.org/lindesmith"><b>The Lindesmith Center</b></a>,
the 
program sponsored initiatives that address local drug 
problems through innovative measures based upon "harm 
reduction" approaches and practices.

<h2>
Disabilities Grants Program
</h2>
The Disabilities Grants Program sponsored projects promoting 
self-help initiatives among the disabled and providing 
educational opportunities and vocational training for people 
with disabilities. The program seeks to create a network of 
mental disability advocates and help end the segregation and 
institutionalization of people with mental retardation.

<h2>
Health Care Initiatives Program
</h2>
In 1995, the Health Care Initiatives Program was launched in 
coordination with the national foundations, and grants were 
allocated to projects focusing on public health issues, 
medical information systems, and health care management. The 
program awarded grants for a modern birthing facility in 
Cluj, Romania, a children's dental clinic in Belarus, and a 
project to improve eye care services in Albania.

<h2>
CD-ROM Regional Program
</h2>
The CD-ROM Regional Program keeps 23 major medical libraries 
in the region abreast of the latest developments in medicine 
and research through the distribution of CD-ROM hardware, 
software, and database updates of Medline. In 1995, the 
pilot HealthNet Slovakia Project began creating a network of 
hospitals, clinics, general practitioners, and health care 
institutions connected via the Internet to promote 
communication as well as access to information. The Regional 
Hospital Project, a two-year pilot project in Moldova, 
Romania, and Slovakia, helped modernize hospitals by 
equipping them with medical supplies and reconditioned 
equipment donated by U.S. hospitals.

About the Project
</h2>

In 1995, as part of its ongoing mission to respond to 
educational needs in the countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Consortium for 
Academic Partnership (CAP) established two new fellowship 
opportunities in the fields of environmental management and 
environmental law. The new program, consisting of 20 
fellowships in environmental management and 10 in 
environmental law, will include summer internships to enable 
grantees to experience the practical application of the 
theories and principles explored in their academic research. 
The first cohort of grantees will arrive in the United 
States in the fall of 1996.
<p>

<a name="virtual"></a>
<h2>
Virtual University
</h2>
A prominent feature of CAP's regional scholarship programs 
is the Virtual University, which seeks to nurture lasting 
ties among grantees from the various countries of the region 
as well as between the scholars and their host universities. 
In previous years, Virtual University efforts focused on 
predeparture orientations and winter conferences, which gave 
fellows the chance to meet colleagues and discuss issues 
relevant to their home countries as well as to their 
personal experiences studying abroad. In 1995, CAP 
introduced a newsletter 
<a href="newscap.html"><b>NewsCAP</b></a>, 
which was distributed to 
over 2,000 current and former grantees, host universities in 
the U.S., UK, and Western Europe, and the national 
foundations. Reporting on CAP programs and activities and 
printing stories by grantees, the newsletter will become a 
chronicle of diverse educational experiences and 
international intellectual changes.

<h2>
Supplementary Grants Program
</h2>
The most emotionally powerful event of the year occurred in 
November in the city of Philadelphia, where the 
Supplementary Grants Program for Students from the Former 
Yugoslavia sponsored a gathering of grant recipients living 
in the United States. Modeled on similar highly successful 
meetings in Europe and the United Kingdom, the three-day 
session offered a variety of discussions and cultural 
activities for these students displaced by the war in 
Yugoslavia. Many of the students had not seen their 
colleagues since before the hostilities began, and indeed 
many had been unaware of the fate of close friends and even 
relatives who turned out to be grant recipients as well. The 
genuine spirit of friendship and joy generated by this 
reunion was deeply touching to all present, and served as an 
inspirational reminder of the tolerance and respect still 
alive in many people from this troubled region.

<h2>
Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowships
</h2>
In 1995, flagship programs such as the Edmund S. Muskie 
Graduate Fellowships and the Virtual University 
Undergraduate Exchange continued to produce challenging 
academic experiences for exceptional students from Poland to 
Kyrgyzstan. CAP continued to augment other Soros-funded 
efforts in higher education in the region through 
scholarship assistance to graduates from the 
<a href="ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a> 
as well as highly competitive four-year 
fellowships for undergraduate study at the American 
University in Bulgaria.

<h2>
Additional Opportunities               
</h2>
Three new host universities in the United Kingdom, the 
University of Edinburgh, the London School of Economics, and 
the London College of Law joined the universities of Oxford, 
Cambridge, Warwick, and Manchester to offer additional 
opportunities for advanced study in the humanities. CAP's
unique initiative on behalf of exiled students from Burma, 
organized in close cooperation with the 
<a href="burma.html"><b>Burma Project</b></a>, 
kept 
up support to those struggling to further their education 
despite difficult and desperate circumstances.

<h2>
     About the Southern Africa Project
</h2>
Since 1990, southern Africa has experienced a number of 
important changes in its social, political, and economic 
climate. In the past five years, Namibia won its struggle 
for independence from South African domination; South 
Africa's apartheid regime was dismantled and replaced with a 
nonracial democratic government; multiparty elections were 
held for the first time in Zambia and Zimbabwe; and a 30-
year-long dictatorship came to an end in Malawi. The most 
encouraging news came from Mozambique and Angola, where 
peace accords ended decades of war.
<p>
Peace, political liberalization, and greater margins of 
freedom of expression have enabled civil society to make 
some progress in the region. Independent media outlets, 
human rights organizations, and public policy research have 
multiplied. Regional exchanges of information, knowledge, 
and skills are slowly expanding. Even regional economic 
cooperation is being revived.
<p>
Despite these positive developments, outside assistance is 
desperately needed in order to sustain and further develop 
these achievements in the face of structural economic 
limitations and continued political instability. Poverty 
levels in most of the region's countries remain high, and 
government funding in the areas of health, education, and 
community development is grossly inadequate. Meanwhile, 
foreign aid to the region, from the United States and some 
European donors, is decreasing.
<p>
The Southern Africa Project represents a first step in 
increasing the 
<a href="osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute - New York's</b></a>
involvement 
in sub-Saharan Africa. It will disburse grants exclusively 
to locally based initiatives. The project will be developed 
in coordination with the 
<a href="safrica.html"><b>Open Society Foundation for South Africa</b></a> 
and a board of advisors from the southern African 
region. Most of 1996 will be spent selecting advisory board 
members, defining the program's focus, and administering 
initial grants.
<p>
The project will focus primarily on supporting the 
development of an independent media, especially radio, and 
the dissemination of educational programming for the media 
on such issues as health and human rights at the grassroots 
level. 
<p><a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a>
<a name="goals"></a>
<h2>
     What are the goals of the project?
</h2>
     The Southern Africa Project supports organizations that cultivate the 
     development of independent media (especially radio) as well as 
     educational programming for the media on such topics as health care 
     and human rights. 
<p><a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a>
<a name="eligible"></a>
<h2>
     Who is eligible for funding?
</h2>
     The Project welcomes proposals from all countries in the Southern 
     African region. Initially, the Project will focus on Angola, Malawi, 
     Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Priority is given to 
     grassroots initiatives and innovative programs that contribute to the 
     development of a more diverse and vigorous civil society.

<h2>
     What is the Open Society Institute?
</h2>
     Based in New York, the Open Society Institute (OSI) is a nonprofit 
     foundation established in 1993 to promote the development of open 
     societies around the world. Toward this goal, the institute operates 
     and/or supports a variety of initiatives and projects in education, 
     independent media, legal reform and human rights. OSI is part of a 
     network of independent nonprofit organizations located in 22 countries 
     in Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Haiti, and 
     South Africa.

<h3> Program Development Fellowships </h3> 
The Open Society
Institute (OSI) invites applications and nominations for Program
Development Fellowships. <p> 

Program Development Fellowships are awarded
to individuals on the basis of their qualifications to assist the Open
Society Institute in the development and implementation of new program
initiatives in the United States. For the Program Development Fellowships,
individuals may either submit their own applications or be nominated for
the fellowship. 
<p>
Program Development Fellows reside in New York for the period of the

Open Society Institute. Fellows also participate in a variety of programs
organized on their behalf. The Fellowships are awarded for a term of up to
18 months, and may be renewed for up to another 18 months. 
<p>
The Open Society Institute welcomes applications and nominations in the
following areas: 
<ul>

along the lines of race and class, including the failure to assist
families and to provide community support for education, resulting in the
inadequate preparation of large numbers of children for life; 
 
<li>the promotion of noncommercial approaches to culture, journalism, and
professions such as law and medicine; 
 
<li>the reinvigoration of professional, civic, and political ethics and
community service, with particular interest in political campaigns,
finances, and reform; 
 
<li>immigration, citizenship, and civic identity;
 
<li>the impact on the poor of the devolution of welfare responsibility to
the states; 
 
<li>alternatives to law enforcement in reducing the harm caused by drug abuse;
 
<li>the enhancement of comfort, dignity, relief from pain, and family
support for the dying; 
 
<li>the problem of crime and the increasing reliance on imprisonment that
has resulted in a soaring incarceration rate; 
 
<li>other crucial issues affecting the development of an open society in the
United States.

<h3>
Individual Project Fellowships
</h3>
Individual Project Fellowships are awarded to writers, scholars, and
others from a range of professions pursuing research, writing, or other
efforts to foster the development of open society, either in the United
States or internationally, on the basis of proposals describing the
projects. 
<p>
Proposals may address any issues crucial to fostering the principles and
values of an open society either in the United States or globally. 
Broadly speaking, an open society is characterized by a reliance on the
rule of law, the existence of a democratically elected government, a
diverse and vigorous civil society, and respect for minorities and
minority opinions.  Areas of interest include: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>the management of the explosive growth of "mega-cities," improving the
effectiveness of intergovernmental institutions, and the promotion of
reproductive health and choice, in the United States and throughout the
world; 

<li>inner-city problems that have contributed to the hardening of divisions
along the lines of race and class and the inadequate preparation of large
numbers of children for life, including the failure to assist families and
to provide community support for education; 
 
<li>the promotion of noncommercial approaches to culture, journalism, and
professions such as law and medicine; 
 
<li>the reinvigoration of professional, civic, and political ethics and
community service, with particular interest in political campaigns,
finances, and reform; 
 
<li>immigration, citizenship, and civic identity;
 
<li>the impact on the poor of the devolution of welfare responsibility to
the states; 
 
<li>alternatives to law enforcement in reducing the harm caused by drug abuse;
 
<li>the enhancement of comfort, dignity, relief from pain, and family
support for the dying; 
 
<li>the problem of crime and the increasing reliance on imprisonment that
has resulted in a soaring incarceration rate; 
 
<li>other crucial issues affecting the development of an open society in the
United States and internationally. 
</ul>

a project summary of 200 to 400 words;

<li>

The Constitutional and Legislative Policy Institute (COLPI) 
helps countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union develop into states based on the rule of law. 
The institute's activities and projects in 1995 were aimed 
at supporting legal institutions and processes that 
ultimately create and maintain effective and accountable 
government. These activities include the development of 
legal institutions, legal education, and civil society. The 
institute is committed to working with local not-for-profit 
organizations, universities, government officials, and other 
foreign assistance organizations seeking to promote similar 
goals and initiatives.

<b>Development of Legal Institutions</b><br>
A rule-of-law state requires, at minimum, a set of 
institutional arrangements, constitutions, laws, and a 
judicial system. The precise shape and characteristics of 
these institutions will vary according to the public 
policies, political dynamics, and legal traditions of each 
country. 
To limit the arbitrariness of state action, these 
institutions should be well-crafted, with transparent, 
workable guidelines and regulations. 
By providing technical and expert assistance, COLPI seeks to  
ensure that the development of these institutions is 
consistent with international standards.
<p>
In 1995, the institute began a comprehensive research 
project on administrative law reform, an area designated by 
many as the target of second generation legal reforms. This 
research will be used as basic reference materials for 
governments in the region as they reform their systems. 
Other projects undertaken in 1995 included providing 
technical and expert advice on Albania's Mass Media Bill, 
the Latvian Criminal Code, and the Constitutional Court Bill 
in Georgia.

<a name="education"></a>
<b>Legal Education</b><br>
Crucial to the aim of decreasing the arbitrariness of state 
action is quality legal education of law professionals, both 
in government (judges, legislators) and outside (law 
faculty, law students, private lawyers). Having well-trained 
government lawyers, particularly judges, helps ensure that 
the rules by which the state regulates social and economic 
behavior and resolves disputes are clear and known to the 
population. Well-trained lawyers outside government play a 
significant role in checking excesses of state power, either 
by challenging state actions or by working to improve the 
legal system. 
<p>
In 1995, COLPI was involved in judicial training programs in 
Bulgaria, Hungary, and Latvia. A workshop in Eger encouraged 
judges to apply Hungarian constitutional principles in their 
resolution of individual cases. The institute organized 
short term training sessions on English legal terminology 
and substantive legal topics for law students in Lithuania, 
Ukraine, and Tajikistan. A three-week faculty training 
session in Budapest for law faculties from Ukraine, Belarus, 
and Moldova focused on teaching methodologies and pedagogy 
in legal education.
During 1995, COLPI worked closely with the Donetsk Human 
Rights School in drafting a human rights curriculum and 
organizing five training sessions for high school teachers 
in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. The institute, in collaboration 
with the Center for International Documentation and Economic 
Crime in Cambridge, UK, organized a training seminar on 
corruption and economic crimes for leading prosecutors from 
East Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.

<b>Development of Civil Society</b><br>
The development of civil society, particularly in the legal 
sector, is the third component that is crucial in assuring 
that the state does not abuse its power or exercise it 
arbitrarily. Nongovernmental or grassroots organizations 
perform at least two significant functions. First, such 
organizations can directly challenge governmental actions. 
Second, these organizations can play a constructive role in 
the structural reform process by initiating or lobbying for 
new legislation. COLPI will support NGOs that provide legal 
services to vulnerable groups-such as human rights victims 
and the disabled-and legal training to members of the legal 
profession. In the fall of 1995, for example, COLPI, the 
International Helsinki Federation, and the International 
Human Rights Law Group held a workshop to train human rights 
organizations.

<b>Other Activities</b><br>
COLPI has also helped the national foundations in Albania, 
Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Kazakstan, 
Lithuania, Moldova, and Romania develop their own law 
programs. In 1995, COLPI published <i>Corruption and Democracy</i>,
based on papers presented at a conference the previous year 
on "Political Institutions, Processes, and Corruption in 
States in Transition," and prepared for publication a 
handbook outlining cases of the Hungarian Constitutional 
Court. The book aims to increase awareness of constitutional 
principles among Hungarian judges, many of whom received 
their legal training prior to the establishment of the 
Constitutional Court.

Quality education beginning at the preschool level is 
crucial to development of open society. Students who are 
encouraged to become active participants in their own 
education, express and support their own theories, and make 
educated choices in learning options, are likely to carry 
the values of discourse, respect for the rights of others, 
and participation in democratic processes into their adult 
lives. To support and develop education for an open society, 
<a href="osibuda.html"><b>OSI-Budapest</b></a> 
and the network of 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a>
created 
and funded by 
<a href="gsbio.html"><b>George Soros</b></a> 
invested tens of millions of 
dollars in education programs for primary and secondary 
schools in 1995. 
<p>
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union are faced with educational needs ranging from 
simply keeping education alive, to retraining teachers and 
developing new curricula, to providing schools with 
computers and access to the Internet. While not all 
foundations focus on education to the same extent, the 
network, both in regional programs and national foundation 
initiatives, places a great emphasis on programs for school-
aged populations. 
<p>
The Education Program Support Unit (EPSU) was formed in mid-
1995 to help the foundations maximize the impact of their 
programs in primary and secondary education. In September 
1995, the EPSU hosted "Education for an Open Society" in 
Budapest. This conference, attended by education 
coordinators from the national foundations, was held to 
clarify the role of the foundations in education, build 
closer collaboration among foundations, and develop an 
exchange of ideas, practical models, and tools useful for 
education programs. Conference participants identified three 
priorities for their work in education: promoting and 
providing an example of open society in education; building 
partnerships with donors, ministries, and communities; and 
achieving sustainability for programs introduced by the 
national foundations.
<p>
The Education Program Support Unit sponsors seminars and 
workshops on specific topics, promotes information exchange 
among the foundations, and provides access to resources. As 
an initial response to the need for increased information 
exchange within the network, the unit disseminated the first 
issue of Open Society Education Update 
via e-mail in December 1995. This newsletter, issued 
periodically and distributed throughout the network, focuses 
on national foundation education initiatives and possible 
areas of cooperation among the 
foundations.
<p>
At the request of individual foundations, the unit directly 
assists in developing or rethinking education programs. 
Drawing on expertise within the network and using outside 
specialists when necessary, the EPSU helps foundations 
evaluate the needs in a particular country's education 
system, consider the impact of existing programs, and assist 
in developing new programs and modifying existing programs. 
In 1995, the EPSU provided direct assistance in program 
development to foundations in

The euphoria of wresting national independence and personal 
freedom from centralized control has been replaced in much 
of Central and Eastern Europe by anxiety about finding a way 
to responsibly and effectively exercise those freedoms. 
Local governments and universities face especially harsh 
challenges in this regard. 
<p>
For local governments, this anxiety is intensified by the 
scarcity of fiscal resources; the demands of integrating 
into a competitive world economy; the pervasive changes in 
attitude required to transform sociopolitical cultures that 
generally lacked individualism and decentralized decision 
making; and the tenacity of centralized control accompanied 
by the shift of responsibility to local and regional 
governments to provide public services.
<p>
Notwithstanding such difficulties, enormous energy is 
exerted by advocates of local self-determination, by local 
legislative and administrative public servants, and by 
public administration educators throughout the region.  The 
Institute of Local Government and Public Service (ILGPS) was 
created to assist them during this transitional period by 
helping to institutionalize the existence of and capacity 
for local self-determination. Charged with the primary 
mission of promoting local government reform, ILGPS 
completed its second full year of operation in 1995 by 
emphasizing initiatives in public administration education, 
training for local public servants, and the creation of the 
preconditions for local self-governance.
<p>
The institute's additional mission is to help enhance the 
administration of institutions of higher education, with 
special but not exclusive attention to those singled out for 
assistance by 
<a href="hesp.html"><b>International HESP</b></a>. 
The emphasis has been on 
direct assistance to enhance the capacity of selected 
universities within the general objective of establishing a 
professional culture of higher education leadership that 
extends beyond central education ministries.
<p>
University administration, also hampered by a lack of funds, 
faces the additional hindrances of the continuing 
overspecialization of education, a lack of professional 
managerial preparation of those in leadership positions, and 
the contradictory demands of centralized regulatory control 
balanced against localized economic dependency. 
<p>
The institute's strategy is to establish and strengthen 
institutional capacity in the region to address issues of 
local government reform and university administration 
reform. Tactics include close working collaborations with 
the 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a> 
and identifying motivated 
individuals and projects with the potential to enhance 
institutional capacity. Some initiatives are multinational 
in scope, others are local pilot demonstrations of solutions 
that might be applicable regionally, still others are 
country-specific responses to indigenous needs.
<p>
In the field of public administration education, ILGPS 
during 1995 helped to create an operating network of 
institutes and schools of public administration throughout 
the region; provided advice on public administration 
curricula in more than a dozen countries; instilled case 
study teaching and writing skills in public administration 
educators from throughout the region; and provided a 
postgraduate summer program in the 
<a href="czech.html"><b>Czech Republic</b></a> 
for Masters of Public Affairs degree students from more than ten 
countries. 
<p>
The training of local government public servants, and 
especially the preparation of training materials and the 
training of trainers, was provided to municipal executives 
in Russia, municipal legislators in 
<a href="romania.html"><b>Romania</b></a> and 
<a href="moldova.html"><b>Moldova</b></a>, and 
a variety of public servants in 
<a href="slovakia.html"><b>Slovakia</b></a> and 
<a href="belarus.html"><b>Belarus</b></a>. 
Recognizing that public administration education and civil 
servant training are not, in and of themselves, sufficient 
to achieve local government reform, ILGPS increasingly 
coupled education and training initiatives with efforts to 
promote local governance. This approach was evidenced by 
civic and local self-determination advocacy projects 
underway in 
<a href="slovakia.html"><b>Slovakia</b></a>, 
<a href="belarus.html"><b>Belarus</b></a>, and 
<a href="albania.html"><b>Albania</b></a>.
<p>
In university administration, ILGPS helped to improve the 
long-term financial planning of 14 higher education 
institutions from ten countries; to enhance self-assessment 
and associated accreditation knowledge of universities from 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia; and to develop the skills 
of university outreach officers. Among other initiatives in 
1995 were the creation of a network of university 
administrators in Romania, enhancement of financial planning 
expertise at the University of Vilnius, and improvements in 
the administration and strategic planning of universities in 
Kyiv, Minsk, and St. Petersburg.

<h2>
About the Program
</h2>
The International Higher Education Support Program (HESP) 
supports the development of higher education in the 
humanities and social sciences in Central and Eastern Europe 
and the former Soviet Union. This is achieved through 
programs designed to help institutions and scholars in the 
region to integrate more fully into the international 
academic community. International HESP also helps 
universities and institutions of higher education in the 
region to become internationally recognized centers of 
excellence in teaching and research. International HESP 
program activities are divided into the three broad 
categories described below.
<p>
<a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a>

<a name="support"></a>
<h2>
Supported Institutions 
</h2>
In 1995, International HESP provided support to more than 20 
universities, university departments, and institutes 
throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. International HESP builds networks among these 
Supported Institutions and programs to create international 
partnerships and encourage the exchange of ideas, faculty, 
and students. International HESP funds supported everything 
from general operating costs to student stipends. Activities 
focused on supporting the internationalization of regional 
curricula, faculty, and network development. A Regional 
Mobility Scheme, introduced in 1995, provided support for 
academics from across Central and Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union to visit the 
<a href="ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a>
in either Budapest, Prague, or Warsaw. In 1996, Inter-
national HESP introduced additional Mobility Schemes for 
Supported Institutions to increase the regional mobility of 
students, faculty, 
and staff.

<h2>
Regional Programs
</h2>
Regional Programs focus on transitional development and help 
maintain an environment in which academics can pursue 
scholarly activities in their own countries while keeping in 
touch with international developments in their field. The 
two primary regional programs are the Civic Education 
Project and the Research Support Scheme.
<p>
<b>The Civic Education Project (CEP)</b> assists reform efforts 
underway in the social science departments of various 
universities in the region. 
The project's Visiting Lecturer and Eastern Scholar programs 
send Western-trained scholars to universities throughout the 
region. The Eastern Scholar program focuses on the placement 
of Western-trained East European academics as Civic 
Education Project lecturers in the countries of the region. 
CEP lecturers teach courses in their specialties in English, 
French, German, and, in some cases, the local language. In 
addition, they cooperate with their host universities to 
improve social science education by assisting in the design 
of new curricula, developing local-language teaching 
materials, securing book donations, seeking research funds, 
and identifying opportunities for talented faculty and 
students to receive training abroad.
<p>
<b>The Research Support Scheme (RSS)</b> supports individuals and 
groups of scholars who wish to carry out innovative research 
in the social sciences and humanities on Central and Eastern 
European issues. Preference is given to groups of 
researchers with participants from two or more countries who 
are studying a generic issue or a particular theme from a 
multinational perspective. Interdisciplinary research is 
encouraged. The RSS grantees carry out new and exploratory 
international research work in fields vital to the 
development of education in the region. In 1996, 
International HESP will implement the RSS Fellowship 
Program, which will enable universities in the region to 
appoint former RSS grantees to teach courses based on their 
research. The program is designed to utilize the growing 
pool of researchers in the region and to provide access to 
the results of research to a wide audience. The RSS receives 
more than 1,200 applications a year, and awards grants to 
roughly 20 percent of applicants.

<h2>
Cooperation with the Central European University (CEU)
</h2>
A number of International HESP programs utilize and 
strengthen CEU expertise by enabling close cooperative 
contacts with regional universities and scholars. The 
Curriculum Resource Center, one of the most successful of 
these programs, invites teachers who are establishing new 
programs and developing curricula at their home institution 
to the CEU for intensive week-long periods of syllabi 
review, library work, and meetings with CEU faculty and 
staff. The Popper Project furthers the teachings of Karl 
Popper by hosting workshops for teachers and translators on 
the problems of transforming closed societies into more open 
ones. The Inter-Regional Faculty Seminar on Gender and 
Culture gathers scholars from the region to explore and 
reconceptualize issues of vital importance in gender and 
women's studies.

Founded in Budapest in 1995, the Open Society Archives has 
three missions: to establish and maintain a research center 
focusing on communism, the Cold War, and human rights 
issues; to provide records and information management 
support to the Soros foundation network; and to provide 
support for archives and preservation activities in Central 
and Eastern Europe.
<p>
A samizdat document from Russia, a statement by Czechoslovak 
Roma in support of the Dubcek government in 1968, an 
authentic Polish joke-these are just a few of the items held
by the Open Society Archives, which include the records of 
the Research Institute of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 
(RFE/RL). Throughout late autumn and winter of 1995, the 
archives received a steady stream of research requests and 
visits. Anyone may apply to use its resources and 
noncirculating library.
<p>
In 1995 and the first half of 1996, the archives' first
priority was to establish basic intellectual control over 
its documents, including audiovisual materials, microfilm, 
and microfiche, through a program of arrangement, 
description, and relocation. The initial work concentrated 
on the Bulgarian, Hungarian, Polish, and Yugoslav files. 
<p>
As the Open Society Archives' operations and holdings 
constantly expand, one of the main activities throughout 
1995 was the development of new storage space. Coordinating 
with architects, 
<a href="osibuda.html"><b>OSI-Budapest</b></a>, and the 
<a href="ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a>, 
the archives plans to open a facility with 
exhibition areas, research rooms, offices, archival storage 
space, and archival processing areas on the same city block 
as the university.  
<p>
The Open Society Archives maintains an 
<a href="http://www.osa.ceu.hu"><b>Internet site</b></a> that 
presents information about the archives, how to gain access 
for research purposes, and descriptions of the archives and 
its library holdings. A special site provides technical 
information for archivists in both English 
and Russian. 
<p>
The archives will initiate several programs in the coming 
year, 
including "Managing Modern Archives," a summer course at
CEU; 
an oral history program of RFE/RL; a planned 1997 exhibition 
of 
nonconformist Russian art from 1956-1986; and a regional 
archival support program.
<p>
By the end of April 1996, the archives had 21 full-time 
staff members, three part-time members, and two academic 
advisors, among whom are specialists in electronic records 
management, audiovisual archives, archival description, oral 
history, and computer references services. Altogether 11 
different nationalities are represented by the staff.

<p>    
Libraries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union face many problems as they adjust to 
decentralized management and attempt to provide open access 
to information. In some countries of the region, libraries 
have been neglected for decades. In others, libraries 
struggle to survive under newly constrained conditions.
<p>
In 1995, the Regional Library Program (RLP) developed long-
term plans for assisting the development of the region's
library and information infrastructure. The programs placed 
the highest priority on providing training workshops in 
management and automation. In 1995, the RLP sponsored three-
day management workshops for 20 librarians in 
<a href="albania.html"><b>Albania</b></a>, 
<a href="belarus.html"><b>Belarus</b></a>, 
<a href="bulgaria.html"><b>Bulgaria</b></a>, the 
<a href="czech.html"><b>Czech Republic</b></a>, 
<a href="estonia.html"><b>Estonia</b></a>, 
<a href="hungary.html"><b>Hungary</b></a>, 
<a href="latvia.html"><b>Latvia</b></a>, 
<a href="lithuan.html"><b>Lithuania</b></a>, 
<a href="macedon.html"><b>Macedonia</b></a>, 
<a href="moldova.html"><b>Moldova</b></a>, 
<a href="poland.html"><b>Poland</b></a>, 
<a href="romania.html"><b>Romania</b></a>, 
<a href="slovakia.html"><b>Slovakia</b></a>, and 
<a href="slovenia.html"><b>Slovenia</b></a>. 
The workshops were concerned with 
managing change in library and information services, project 
management, staff and personnel management, and collection 
development. 
<p>
Library automation has the potential to save time and money. 
In countries where libraries have operated with a system of 
closed stacks, automation also has the potential to quickly 
and cheaply multiply the amount of information a library can 
provide to its users both inside and outside the country. In 
1995, the RLP supported a number of small-scale automation 
projects. Before supporting library automation on a wider 
scale, however, the RLP is focusing on providing automation 
training workshops for librarians. During the past year, the 
RLP held such workshops in 
<a href="albania.html"><b>Albania</b></a>, 
<a href="estonia.html"><b>Estonia</b></a>, and 
<a href="ukraine.html"><b>Ukraine</b></a>. 
The RLP also supported the attendance of 24 librarians at 
the 1995 Fifth World Congress of Slavic Librarians and 36 
librarians at the International Federation of Library 
Associations' Annual Meeting. In addition, the RLP supported 
28 collaborative projects between institutions in the region 
and their counterparts in the West, including exchange 
programs, seminars and workshops, and collaborative 
research.
<p>
At the beginning of  1995,  the Regional Library Program 
took over responsibility for the Library of Congress/Soros 
Fellows Program. Over the past three years, the Soros 
Fellows Program had sponsored 12 librarians from the region 
to study at the Library of Congress for three months. In 
1995, the Library of Congress proposed adding a new work-
study component to the program. Through this program, the 
librarians from the region will be placed within libraries 
throughout the Washington, DC, metropolitan area for a 
period of three weeks.
<p>
Following the example of the Library of Congress/Soros 
Fellows Program, a similar program was initiated in 
cooperation with the British Library. During its first year, 
this program was limited to four librarians from Russia. The 
RLP, however, would like to offer this program to librarians 
from other countries, and the British Library has agreed to 
accept two librarians from two countries each year. In 1996, 
librarians from Albania and Lithuania will participate in 
the program.
<p>
Working in conjunction with the 
<a href="isf.html"><b>International Science Foundation</b></a>, 
the RLP also supported a program to provide 
libraries in the region with important Western scientific 
journals. The International Science Foundation supported the 
purchase of journals within the former Soviet Union, while 
the RLP funded a similar journal donation program for ten 
countries outside the former Soviet Union- Albania, Bulgaria,
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, 
Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

About the Program
</h2>
The Regional Library Program (RLP)  supports and advances all aspects of 
information science in 
Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  The RLP was established
as a separate
 program in February 1994. Previously the <a href="hesp.html"><B> Higher
Education Support Program</B></a > 
(HESP) had funded library projects. 
     
<P><B><U>Application Guidelines</U></B><BR>
The RLP only funds proposals that have been endorsed by the <a 
href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a> and have received matching  
funds. Application requirements are listed in calls for proposals issued by 
the RLP and 
advertised by the national foundations. The RLP's training and fellowship 
programs are also advertised by 
participating national foundations.</P>

<H3>Matching Funds Grants Program</H3>
<P> The RLP has been allocated $2 million to provide matching 
funding for proposals which have been endorsed by the national foundations. This
program can support 
proposals in all fields of library and information science, including automation
 and  collection development.  In addition, the RLP can to collaborate with
foundations both inside and outside of 
the Soros network to support proposals, on a matching funds basis, which have 
been endorsed by the 
national  foundations.  Those proposals which can demonstrate the highest level 
of matching funds 
are likely to be more favorably reviewed.  The RLP wishes to support projects 
primarily in the following areas: </P>
<OL>
<LI> <B>Library Automation.</B>  The RLP will support automation proposals from 
the 
 national foundations up to a grand total of $1,000,000 on a matching funds
basis.  In order 
 to encourage a range of projects, the RLP aims to support five projects at a
maximum of 
 $100,000 and a further ten projects for up to $50,000.
<P></P>
<LI> <B>Collaborative Projects.</B> The RLP will support collaborative proposals
from 
 the national  foundations up to a grand total of $800,000 on a matching funds
basis.  
 Projects in the range of $20,000 - $50,000 are anticipated.
<P></P>
<LI> <B>Collection Development.</B>  $200,000 is available for this purpose, but
the RLP will 
 not contribute more than $20,000 towards a single project.  For every three
dollars 
 that the national foundations or outside organizations are willing to
contribute to library collection development 
 proposals, the RLP will contribute a further one dollar. (1:3)

<H3> Automation Conference</H3>
<P>The Regional Library Program and the
<A HREF="http://www2.echo.lu/libraries/en/cee/homecee.html"><b>European Commission</b></A> 
jointly sponsored
an International Conference on Library Automation in Central & Eastern Europe,  
 held in Budapest from April 11-13, 1996. The goal of the conference was to
afford an opportunity for practising librarians 
from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to meet colleagues 
from across Europe and to share experiences and opportunities for collaboration 
in the areas of library automation, bibliographical standards, retrospective 
conversion, and document delivery.</P>
     
 <P> The conference program included presentations and workshops from Western
European
 librarians currently working on EU-funded projects and studies of potential
relevance and 
interest to librarians from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union,
 as well as presentations by librarians within the region.</P>

 <H3>Electronic Document Delivery</H3>
 <P>To achieve the goal of providing researchers with access to all the
information they require 
 through a single terminal, it will be necessary to have the printed 
 material in electronic (digital) form, and to have in place 
 the electronic infrastructure for the delivery of the digitized material. While
the 
 Internet is becoming more readily available, there is much to be done to
develop 
 the necessary technical tools which might be used by libraries to send and
receive 
 electronically transmitted articles.</P>
     
 <P>During 1996 the RLP Board intends to determine a detailed strategy in this
area, which will encompass several distinct 
 areas relating to the development of the "Virtual Library": (a) electronic
document 
 and article delivery to Eastern European libraries working in collaboration
with 
 commercial vendors; (b) conversion into electronically readable form of
backruns 
 of journals out of copyright, and subsequent distribution of the digitized
product 
 to the academic community; (c) creation of an experimental electronic journal
of 
 relevance to libraries in the region.

 <H3>Preservation & Conservation</H3>
 <P>Conservation is an international problem for all libraries and there is a
need 
 in the region for the development of efficient and productive centers for book 
 preservation, workshops for repair, modern chemical facilities for paper 
 strengthening and conservation,  and mass deacidification facilities to stop
the slow 
 deterioration of 19th and 20th century holdings. The development of a training
program
 in preservation and conservation will be a high priority in 1996.</P>

  librarians from the region to study at the <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/"><B>Library of Congress</B></A> for
  three months.  In 1996 the Library of Congress has added a new  work/study
element to  
  the program.  Through this program, the interns are placed within libraries 
  throughout the Washington, DC area for three weeks.
<P></P>
<LI>  <B>British Library Fellows Program</B><BR>
  Following the example of the Library of Congress program, a similar program
was 
  started in cooperation with the<A HREF="http://portico.bl.uk/"><B> British
Library</B></A> in 1995. The Library agreed to accept  
  two librarians from two countries each year. In 1996, librarians  
  from Albania and Lithuania participated in the program.
<P></P>
<LI>  <B>RLP Professional Scholarships</B><BR>
  During 1996 the RLP intends to offer to professors in schools of   
  librarianship in the region the opportunity to spend up to three months or  
  one semester at a library school in Western Europe or the USA.    
  Consultation has started with possible host institutions and once these  
  have been agreed, a call for applicants will be made to the national
foundations.

<h2>
About the Program
</h2> 
The Regional Media Program assists the 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a> 
in developing and designing their media programs, which 
offer a wide variety of support to independent media in 
Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former 
Soviet Union, and South Africa. 
<p>
The Regional Media Program's goal is to foster better 
communication and cooperation among the national foundations 
and to help connect those organizations with potential 
outside partners. The Regional Media Program itself 
cooperates with a variety of other groups that support 
independent media.
<p>
<a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a> 
<p>
In 1995, the Regional Media Program provided support in the 
following areas:
<p>
<a name="training"></a>
<h2>
Training and Development 
</h2>
	Open Channels, a project of AMARC-Europe, the regional 
arm of the World Association of Community Radio 
Broadcasters, featuring training and networking programs for 
local radio broadcasters, including study tours of 
established stations in Western and Eastern Europe.
<p>
	A year-long radio and television training program for 
journalists and technicians from Belarus, Moldova, and 
Ukraine, a cooperative effort of the International Media 
Center in Kyiv and Internews Network.
<p>
	A community radio support program in South Africa, 
designed for 
<a href="safrica.html"><b>OSF-South Africa</b></a>,
including planning and 
development, equipment, training, and program production.
<p>
	A radio training program organized by the national 
foundation in 
<a href="romania.html"><b>Romania</b></a> 
and the Center for Independent 
Journalism in Bucharest.
<p>
<a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a> 
<p>
<a name="conferences"></a>
<h2>
Conferences
</h2>
	European Colloquium of News Agencies, bringing together 
representatives from state and independent news agencies to 
enable networking, discussion of common issues, and 
potential cooperation.
<p>
	First International Festival of Local TV Broadcasters, 
Kosice, Slovakia. Organized by City TV Foundation in Kosice, 
this first-ever event in Slovakia featured screenings, 
programming exchanges, workshops, a program competition, and 
an equipment fair for local broadcasters from throughout 
Europe.
<p>
<a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a> 
<p>
<a name="fellowships"></a>
<h2>
Fellowships/Internships

	Alfred Friendly Fellowships for journalists from 
Armenia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Estonia, 
consisting of six-month residencies at major print media 
organizations in the United States.
<p>
	Internship at the Lewiston Sun-Journal in Lewiston, 
Maine, for Dorian Ciocanu, a Moldovan print journalist.  
<p>
<a href="#top"><img align=middle src="/images/go_up_bt.gif" alt="Top"></a> 
<p>
<a name="news"></a>
<h2>
News Exchanges
</h2>
	Continuing support for BalkanNet, an electronic-mail 
news exchange in the former Yugoslavia.
<p>
	Internews Network project, involving programming 
exchange, training, equipment, and technical support, 
designed to boost independent news programming at television 
stations in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and southern 
Russia.
<p>
In 1995, the Regional Media Program helped establish the 
Media Development Loan Fund to support responsible, 
commercially viable independent media in an increasingly 
challenging and complex economic and political environment. 
The fund provides program-related investments-mainly low-
cost loans-to independent media organizations devoted to     
promoting democratic institutions and practices in their 
countries.

Books are an effective way to make the complex ideas and 
information needed by societies in transition permanently 
accessible to a large number of people. Publishing is thus 
an important component of many programs of the 
<a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a>. 
The Regional Publishing Center was created in 
1995 to provide professional support for the publishing 
activities of the foundations and regional programs as well 
as to organize several new large-scale publishing projects 
of its own.  Some of these projects operate under the 
imprint name of the Central European University Press.
<p>
The Regional Publishing Center has two goals: First, to 
support the publication of books that promote critical 
thinking, high educational standards, intercultural 
understanding, and the values of open society. Second, to 
foster the development of a diverse and independent 
publishing industry, which is a vital component of civil 
society.

<h2>
CEU Press Translation Project
</h2>
Despite the changes in Central and Eastern Europe in recent 
years, there is still a drastic shortage of basic texts in 
the social sciences and humanities. These are books that 
play a vital role in any open society: they underpin higher 
education, sustain and enrich public discussions of social, 
political, and cultural issues, and provide the theoretical 
and practical knowledge needed for building new institutions 
and reforming old ones. In a majority of countries in the 
region, however, even the most fundamental texts in 
political science, economics, law, and sociology are 
unavailable in translation. The CEU Press Translation 
Project is an ambitious initiative designed to meet this 
need.
<p>
In 1995, the Translation Project was launched in 
<a href="albania.html"><b>Albania</b></a>, 
<a href="bulgaria.html"><b>Bulgaria</b></a>, 
<a href="poland.html"><b>Poland</b></a>, 
<a href="romania.html"><b>Romania</b></a>, and 
<a href="ukraine.html"><b>Ukraine</b></a>. 
In Romania, for 
example, a list of about 250 recommended titles compiled by 
CEU faculty was circulated to Romanian publishers. Through 
an open competition, 15 publishers were awarded grants to 
support the translation and publication of over 30 books 
from this list. These included classics by Kant, Weber, and 
Wittgenstein, core textbooks in economics, history, and 
sociology, and contemporary classics by writers like Michel 
Foucault, Hannah Arendt, and Isaiah Berlin. 
<p>
In 1996, the Translation Project will be extended to cover 
another 12 countries. Competitions for grants will be 
repeated annually, so that an average of 20 to 30 
translations will be published every year in each country.

<h2>
Publishing Support Service
</h2>
In 1995, the Regional Publishing Center helped to manage or 
design publishing projects for national foundations in 
<a href="bulgaria.html"><b>Bulgaria</b></a>, 
<a href="georgia.html"><b>Georgia</b></a>, 
<a href="kazakh.html"><b>Kazakstan</b></a>, 
<a href="kyrgyz.html"><b>Kyrgyzstan</b></a>, 
<a href="moldova.html"><b>Moldova</b></a>, 
<a href="russia.html"><b>Russia</b></a>, and 
<a href="ukraine.html"><b>Ukraine</b></a>. 
The center also began administering a special 
program to support translations of the works of Karl Popper 
into local languages in Central and Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia. In 1996, the Regional Publishing Center will 
launch a Publishing Loan Fund and a Training Service to 
assist the development of the publishing industries in the 
region.

<h2>
About the Center
</h2>
The OSI Regional Publishing Center operates under the imprint name of the Central European University Press. The program facilitates the publication, in the local languages of Central and Eastern Europe, of a wide range of books representing diverse ideas and perspectives. It also publishes, in English, books about Central and Eastern Europe for an international readership of academics, students, policy makers, journalists, and other interested individuals.<p>

Under the auspices of the Regional Publishing Center, the CEU Press is undertaking a broad-ranging translation project. The faculty of the <a href="ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a>, with help from the <a href="found.html"><b>national foundations</b></a>, has assembled for translation a long list of Western classics in the social sciences and humanities, especially titles considered relevant for societies in transition. The subjects covered are economics, political science, history, law, philosophy and sociology.<p>

Local publishers, many of whom are from the newly established private sector, undertake the publication of these books with financial assistance from the Regional Publishing Center. In this way the program supports the development of a strong and independent publishing industry.<p>

The first pilot project began in Romania in 1994 with over 30 titles selected for translation over a one-year period. Albania and Bulgaria were the next two countries to receive projects; other countries will be added in 1995. Collaboration with the <a href="hesp.html"><b>Higher Education Support Program</b></a> and the <a href="library.html"><b>Regional Library Program</b></a> assures that publishing expertise is shared and utilized effectively.<p>

In 1994, the CEU Press published a number of titles from the CEU Privatization Project, including two volumes of the Privatization Reports. Preparatory work was also undertaken in 1994 for the eventual publishing of the Radio Free Europe Archives on CD Rom.<p>

<h2>
From the 1995 Annual Report
</h2>
In its first full year of operation, the Open Media Research 
Institute (OMRI) has established itself as a recognized and 
respected center of research and publishing on Central and 
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Built on the 
legacy of its predecessor organization, the Radio Free 
Europe/Radio Liberty Research Institute, OMRI became a 
totally private, nonprofit entity in 1995, extending its 
publishing base and inaugurating new initiatives and 
projects.
<p>
Establishment of OMRI's periodicals was a central activity 
in 1995, with the steady growth of existing publications as 
well as the launching of new products. Transition, a 
biweekly journal of news and analysis from the region, 
including articles, interviews, and special features, 
established a solid readership and enjoyed a 33 percent 
growth in subscriptions during the year. The OMRI Daily 
Digest, a six-page summary of the latest news from the 
region, also grew in popularity, especially its electronic 
mail version. A Russian-language version of the Daily Digest 
was made available through electronic mail providers in the 
former Soviet Union.
<p>
OMRI launched two new publications ventures in 1995: the 
OMRI Digest, a weekly newsletter covering economic and 
business news from the region; and periodic special reports, 
appended to the Daily Digest, providing more in-depth 
coverage to major ongoing events, such as the legislative 
election campaign in Russia and the implementation of the 
Dayton accords in Bosnia.
<p>
OMRI's reputation as a source of reliable, high-quality news 
and analysis of the region is evident not only in the 
growing popularity of its publications, but also in the 
range of educational and training projects it has initiated. 
In October, OMRI hosted a seminar for high-level official 
and nonofficial representatives from the region on the 
future of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. Senior diplomats, business leaders, and academics 
came to OMRI for roundtable discussions and briefings 
throughout 1995. OMRI analysts lectured at the 
<a href="ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a> 
and other universities.
<p>
Recognizing the importance of preparing rising generations 
of experts from the region, OMRI has been actively training 
students, journalists, and others in the skills of reporting 
and analysis. In an ongoing program, selected postgraduates 
from the region are matched with experienced OMRI analysts 
for ten months of on-the-job training. OMRI regularly lent 
its expertise to shorter training and information sessions 
for journalists and academics, including a workshop for 
local reporters covering minority issues, undertaken in late 
1995 with a grant from the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees.
<p>
OMRI analysts have access to a wide variety of information 
collected from the region through specialized clipping 
services, document acquisitions, databases, and other media 
monitoring activities. The OMRI audience and opinion 
research department, based in Washington, DC, undertakes 
audience surveys and focus group studies together with 
analyses of audience media use in the former Soviet bloc. A 
recently initiated Distinguished Visitors Program will bring 
policy and academic experts to OMRI for lectures and 
discussions with OMRI analysts. 
<p>
In 1996, OMRI will continue to expand the reach of its 
publications and educational and training activities while 
deepening its commitment to comprehensive analysis of the 
issues and strengthening its links with institutions located 
or interested in the region.

OMRI has a three-fold mission: to inform people worldwide about regional
affairs through the regular publication of analyses and news; to maintain
and make accessible the extensive Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
Archives; and to train analysts and journalists from the region. Its home
offices are in the United States, with research offices in Prague.<p> <a

<a name="publications"></a>
<h2>
Publications and Programs
</h2> 
The institute's flagship publication is
Transition: Events and Issues in the Former Soviet Union and East Central
and Southeastern Europe, a journal of analysis and news focusing on
political, social, economic, military, foreign, media, legal, and 
cultural affairs in the region. Transition carries periodic special 
sections on
such topics as the media, foreign affairs, and the social costs of
transition. OMRI also publishes the OMRI Daily Digest, a six-page
compendium of news briefs compiled from a wide range of regional and
international sources. It is available each weekday free of charge on the
Internet.<p>

Future publications will include a media monitoring digest, a regional
news digest, and up-to-date handbooks. OMRI is also developing a network
of information sources throughout the region for monitoring media and
human rights issues. As well as publishing its research, OMRI cooperates
with RFE/RL broadcasters, providing them with research reports, program
briefs, press monitoring, and other services.<p>

As custodian of the vast RFE/RL archives, OMRI maintains materials older
than five years in a Budapest center in cooperation with the <a
href="ceu.html"><b>Central European University</b></a>. Newer materials
are housed in OMRI's Prague facility. The more
 than 15 million items document communist rule and the struggle for change during the post-World War II era in Eastern and Central Europe. The institute's collection of newspapers, periodicals, clippings, samizdat, and biographical holdings is open to the
 public; OSI has committed a minimum of $15 million over the next four
years to support this project.<p>

OMRI offers an internship program in cooperation with the Central European
University to train analysts from Central and Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. OMRI will sponsor conferences and seminars treating
topics of current importance, including one on the role of former
dissidents in contemporary society and another on the media in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.<p> <a href="#top"><img align=middle

<h2>
From the 1995 Annual Report
</h2>
Two organizations involved in providing managers and 
professionals with the skills necessary to function and 
compete in a free market economy are the East-West 
Management Institute (EWMI) and the Soros Business and 
Management Foundation (SBMF). These foundations operate 
throughout the region and offer the following programs.
<p>
<b>Internships.</b><br> The EWMI places competitively selected managers 
and professionals with international companies and 
organizations worldwide to receive on-the-job training 
internships. Several current programs also offer an academic 
component to complement the practical training. Hundreds of 
internships have been arranged for professionals in 
financial services, legal services, business management, 
public administration, and human services. In 1995, the EWMI 
administered 13 programs in 15 countries, providing training 
to over 435 interns with organizations in the United States 
and Canada.
<p>
<b>Management Training.</b><br> The business education program of the 
EWMI designs and implements business management and finance 
training programs. This program cooperates with Western 
academic institutions to develop course materials in 
accounting, finance, management, business, corporate 
governance, and public policy. These materials are used to 
train and retrain managers and professionals from private 
and entrepreneurial enterprise environments, as well as 
federal and municipal government institutions and the 
military. In 1995, a total of 350 trainers in Russia and 
Ukraine were instructed in Western accounting skills. In 
1996, the EWMI plans to enlarge the program to include 
Moldova and other countries in the region.
<p>
<b>Junior Achievement.</b><br> The EWMI develops, coordinates, and 
implements the distribution of Junior Achievement programs 
for high school students. This program comprises bilingual 
curricula and computer software for management simulation 
exercises that allow students to run their own businesses 
and learn the basics of a free market economy. In 1995, the 
EWMI awarded grants to four developing Junior Achievement 
programs in Eastern and Central Europe and the Newly 
Independent States, and assisted in program implementation 
in six other countries. During the year, over 30,000 
students in the region participated in Junior Achievement 
programs.
<p>
The EWMI has also developed a program titled the 
Fundamentals of a Market Economy, which targets the working 
adult population and professionals. In 1995, the program was 
piloted in two countries, with more pilots scheduled for 
1996.
<p>
<b>Privatization Policy and Training.</b><br> In 1995, the EWMI was 
awarded a contract by the United States Agency for 
International Development to carry out privatization policy 
and training projects in Eastern and Central Europe and the 
Newly Independent States. The first projects, initiated in 
the fall of 1995, are aimed at post-privatization 
restructuring work in Hungary and Moldova.
<p>
<b>Computer-based Training.</b><br> The Soros Business and Management 
Foundation develops multimedia, CD-ROM, and Internet 
computer-based training courses in order to reach a broader 
audience of professionals and technicians. The first course, 
a computer-based accounting course targeted to provide 
training to the personnel of the Russian State Tax Service, 
is scheduled to be completed by the fall of 1996. The second 
course in auditing is currently in the initial stages of 
development. The United States Agency for International 
Development and the U.S. Department of Treasury are co-
funders of this project and they, as well as OECD, further 
support the project by providing content and technical 
contributions.

<h2>
From the 1995 Annual Report
</h2>
The mission of the International Soros Science Education 
Program (ISSEP) is to preserve excellence in science 
education in Russia and other newly independent states by 
supporting and encouraging the work of teachers, professors, 
and students. ISSEP is funded by the 
<a href="osiny.html"><b>Open Society Institute-- New York</b></a>.
<p>
<b>Soros Teachers.</b><br> To choose the best high school teachers of 
mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in 1995, ISSEP 
polled more than 31,000 students at 140 universities in 
Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia. From more than 60,000 
names, over 4,000 teachers were chosen for Soros Teacher 
diplomas and stipends. Several hundred received the title of 
Soros Emeritus High School Teacher.
<p>
<b>Soros Professors.</b><br> 1,233 professors and 1,221 associate 
professors from 64 and 77 cities, respectively, competed in 
Russia for the university professor awards. More than 25,000 
students in 267 universities were polled to evaluate the 
candidates. The result: 389 Soros Professors and 394 Soros 
Associate Professors in Russia, and 85 Soros Professors in  
Ukraine, 30 in Belarus, and 12 in Georgia. Almost 75 retired 
professors with exceptional achievements and worldwide 
reputations were awarded Soros Emeritus Professor stipends.
<p>
<b>Soros University Students.</b><br> More than 5,000 of the best 
students of theoretical disciplines have received stipends 
as Soros Graduate Students and Soros Undergraduate Students 
based on their participation in scientific research, 
publication of scientific articles, and presentation of 
scientific reports at international and national 
conferences, symposia, and congresses. By the end of 
November 1995, ISSEP had received reports from 1,108 Soros 
Students. During the period of their grant, these students 
participated in 695 scientific conferences (205 
international and 98 national scientific meetings and 392 
student scientific conferences), submitted 394 scientific 
articles for publication (205 of which have already been 
published), and they are participating as team members in 
scientific work in 478 projects awarded with scientific 
grants. Of the 1,108 students, 778 students received 
straight A's on their last examinations and 411 students are 
actively involved in volunteer work with high school 
students.
<p>
<b>Soros Conferences.</b><br> In almost 50 cities all over Russia, 
ISSEP organized special Soros conferences of teachers, at 
which Soros Professors delivered lectures on the latest 
achievements in their scientific disciplines. Many of the 
lectures will be published by the Soros Educational Journal, 
which put out its first issue in December of 1995. The 
journal, consisting of articles on the basic sciences, will 
be distributed free to libraries of all high schools, 
universities, and vocational schools in Russia.
<p>
<b>Soros Olympiad for School Children.</b><br> More than 7,000 of the 
best high school students participated in the Soros Olympiad 
for School Children. The competition prepared students for 
the 1995 International (UNESCO) Olympiads in chemistry, 
biology, physics, and mathematics. Of the total of 19 medals 
received by the official Russian team, 4 were captured by 
winners of the Soros Olympiads.
<p>
ISSEP awarded almost $700,000 in small grants to Russian 
high schools with more than four Soros Teachers. Five high 
schools qualified for the top award of $8,000 for having 
more than ten Soros Teachers. All 3,300 Soros Teachers in 
Russia helped select the best 20 textbooks in mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, and biology. More than 500,000 copies of 
these textbooks were published and donated to Soros Teachers 
around the country.

<h2>
From the 1995 Annual Report
</h2>

The transformation of the former communist economies of 
Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union into 
modern economies is one of the great challenges of the late 
20th century. These economies are undergoing privatization 
of state enterprises on an unprecedented scale. One of the 
most critical problems facing economies in transition is the 
lack of trained personnel knowledgeable in the techniques 
required to operate in both the private and public sectors 
of the modern market economy.
<p>
The Soros Training for Economic Transformation Network 
(STETN) attempts to fill this knowledge void. STETN is 
involved in the training of public officials responsible for 
designing and implementing privatization policies as well as 
individuals in the newly emerging private sector. STETN 
cooperates with constitutional bodies in the promotion of 
economic transformation.
<p>
STETN consists of the Institute of Privatization and 
Management in Moscow; the Institute of Privatization and 
Management in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia; the International 
Centre of Privatization, Investment, and Management in Kyiv, 
Ukraine; the Institute of Privatization and Management in 
Minsk, Belarus; and the International Centre for Market 
Economy-ARMAN in Almaty, Kazakstan.
<p>
The members of the network all seek to build a coalition of 
reform-oriented policy makers through organizing seminars 
and facilitating nonpolitical discussion about the course of 
reform; to assist government agencies in their regulatory 
efforts through presenting the experience and achievements 
of other countries; and to build knowledge and a sense of 
professional standards among managers and consultants 
working to achieve reform at all levels of the economic 
system.
<p>
During the last three years, STETN has trained over 32,000 
people from the government and business communities of the 
Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakstan. The 
network's annual training capacity is 7,000 participants in 
the Russian Federation, 4,000 to 5,000 in Ukraine, 2,500 in 
Belarus, and 3,000 in Kazakstan. About 100 full-time staff 
and 500 part-time instructors are employed by the five 
institutions.
<p>
STETN centers in Belarus, Kazakstan, Russia, and Ukraine 
have received in-kind donations from the Know How Fund 
(Great Britain), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Germany), 
USAID, the World Bank, Economic Development Institute, 
European Community TACIS, and CIDA Canada. About 50 percent 
of program financing comes from the training participants.
<p>
STETN training activities include the following programs:
<p>
<b>Methodology of Privatization.</b><br> Policy-making conferences and 
information seminars on privatization methodology are 
conducted in all countries. In 1995, such meetings played an 
important role in Ukraine as privatization moved from 
concept to implementation.
<p>
<b>Corporate Governance.</b><br> The institutions offer programs in the 
preparation of supervisory board members of joint stock 
companies. Although there is still too little interest in 
new forms of property management, several hundred people 
received training in this program area in 1995.
<p>
<b>Corporate Restructuring.</b><br> Restructuring is an important step 
in making enterprises work in newly created market 
conditions. Programs conducted under this heading are doing 
well in Russia and Ukraine.
<p>
<b>Securities Market Financial Intermediaries, Investment 
Funds, and Trust Companies.</b><br> These seminars are quite popular 
in all of the countries participating in STETN's programs. 
They help design policy as well as prepare new professionals 
for the emerging market.

Open Society News, published quarterly by the Office of Public Affairs of the
Open Society Institute-New York, reports on the activities and programs of the
Soros foundations network, created and funded by George Soros. At the heart of
this network are 24 autonomous foundations in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria,
Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Haiti,
Hungary, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland,
Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia, and
five information offices in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and
Uzbekistan. In addition, the Institute operates programs concerned with
Southern Africa and Burma. All these organizations share the common mission of
fostering the development and maintenance of open society, supporting an array
of programs in the areas of educational, social, and legal reform. Together
with its Hungary-based sister organization, the Open Society
Institute-Budapest, the Open Society Institute-New York assists these
organizations in creating programs on common issues and by providing
administrative, financial, and technical support. The Open Society
Institute-New York also operates and/or supports a variety of programs that
focus on the United States, encouraging public debate and policy alternatives
in complex and often controversial fields. <br>

An Update on U.S. Programs<br>
by Gara LaMarche, Director of U.S. Programs<br>
<br>
The latter half of 1996 was a period of growth and increasing activity for the
Open Society Institute's (OSI's) U.S. programs. Additional staff  joined the
Institute, new initiatives were launched, and existing programs were
expanded.<br>
The Center on Crime, Communities &amp; Culture, launched last spring, completed
an initial round of grants, gave scholarships to two law students, and
published a research report on mental illness in jails. As with the Project on
Death in America in its field, the Center is emerging as a leader among funders
in criminal justice (an underfunded and politically unpopular area) and seems
likely to embolden other funders to rethink their commitment to the field.
Nancy Mahon, who came to OSI from the Osborne Association, where she was
director of research, policy, and planning, is the Center's director.
<br>
In an initiative announced at the end of September, OSI committed $50 million
to establish the Emma Lazarus Fund, which assists legal immigrants adversely
affected by recent welfare legislation and promotes fair treatment of
immigrants and refugees. The Fund provides grants to groups that help
immigrants become full participants in American society as well as to groups
that promote immigrants' rights through public information campaigns and in the
courts. Antonio Maciel, formerly with the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation and an
attorney with the Immigrants' Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties
Union, joined OSI to direct the Fund. <br>
Late in October, OSI made its first major U.S. grant in the area of education,
with a three-year, multi-million dollar commitment to the Algebra Project, a
nationwide network that promotes mastery of algebra by all children, especially
those in inner-city and rural schools. The funds will allow the Algebra Project
to expand training and technical support for its activities.<br>
In the coming months, the Institute is considering grants to strengthen state
and local groups dealing with the devolution of welfare responsibility from the
federal government to the states. The Institute also plans to support groups
working to reduce teenage pregnancy and reduce the influence of money in
political campaigns, and will soon select the first recipients of new Open
Society Fellowships. Future OSI initiatives will deal with inner-city problems
that contribute to the hardening of divisions along the lines of race and
class; the promotion of noncommercial approaches to culture, law, medicine, and
journalism; and the reinvigoration of professional, civic, and political ethics
and community service. <br>
The Institute's two initial U.S. programs are playing critical roles in
important public policy debates. In a climate of growing public support of more
sensible drug policies, the Lindesmith Center, established in 1994, will
shortly publish Marijuana Myths, Marijuana Facts, a well-documented book
designed to counter the misinformation which pervades the debates over
marijuana. The Project on Death in America, established in 1993, filed an
amicus brief in two Supreme Court cases concerning physician-assisted suicide.
The brief argues that the Court should not find a constitutional right to such
assistance until we, as a society, have instituted adequate safeguards to
ensure that people considering suicide are not motivated by the failure of
doctors to treat their pain or depression, or by economic fears.<br>
I joined the OSI staff at the end of May as director of U.S. programs. Prior to
coming to OSI, I spent 20 years working with civil liberties and human rights
groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch.
Other new U.S. program staff include Beth Breger, program officer for
education, formerly with OSI's Education Support Unit; David Condliffe, senior
adviser, formerly executive director of the Drug Policy Foundation; Erlin
Ibreck, program officer dealing with teenage pregnancy and reproductive health
and choice, formerly a program officer with the Aaron Diamond Foundation and
former Deputy Coordinator of the New York City Mayor's Office of Adolescent
Pregnancy and Parenting Services; Karma Kreizenbeck, program officer for
fellowships and communications, formerly director of programs for the
Lindesmith Center; and Catherine Samuels, director of the Legal Profession
Program, formerly a partner in the law firm Schulte, Roth &amp; Zabel and
currently chair of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund.<br>

The Voices of Debate<br>
The Karl Popper Debate Camp <br>* Celakovice, Czech Republic<br>
by Kimberly Iowaka Barber<br>
<br>
Is a zebra a white animal with black stripes or a black animal with white
stripes?" The question came once, and then again, more emphatically, from the
tall, slender adolescent standing before me. Never having thought seriously
about zebras, I dodged the question by offering up a standard response: "That's
kind of like which came first, the chicken or the egg," I ventured, hesitant.
But as would be demonstrated repeatedly over the course of the next week, when
you're talking with a debater, the "standard response" just won't do. In such
company, answers must be carefully formulated, built on sound logic and solid
evidence.<br>
After a few moments, the student let me off the hook and his face erupted into
a broad smile. "Welcome to the world of debate," he said. "Don't feel bad about
the zebra thing. My name is Kert Lobu and I am from Estonia. The zebra is our
team mascot. For us, this creature symbolizes the importance of debate. If you
make a statement that something is either black or white then you must be
prepared to build your case and be cross-examined. In the end, you must also be
willing to admit that nothing in this world is black or white. It's all shades
of gray."<br>
My young Estonian interlocutor was one of 65 high school students and 64
teachers who attended the Second Annual Karl Popper Debate Camp and Tournament,
held at the Czech Management Center in Celakovice, Czech Republic. The camp is
organized each summer by the Open Society Institute's Regional High School
Debate Program, which began as a pilot project in Hungary in 1993 and now
operates in 22 countries including: Albania, Belarus, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina,
Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia. <br>
In addition to participants from those countries, three teens from Haiti--where
George Soros established the Fondation Connaisance et Liberte last year--also
attended. But no matter what the country, the program's goals are the same: to
foster strong communication skills, promote critical thinking, encourage
tolerance and respect for different ideas, and promote an active interest in
current issues. The summer camp and tournament are the culmination of the
program's ongoing activities. Before attending the camp, students spend the
year debating in their native languages in their home countries and studying
debate through clubs funded by the program. Like many of the Open Society
Institute's other programs, the Regional High School Debate Program is carried
out in close cooperation with program coordinators at local institutions in the
Soros foundations network.<br>
"Until about six years ago, formal debate was virtually unknown in these
countries.  Even translating the term `debate' was problematic--there was no
equivalent in these languages," said Liz Lorant, director of regional programs
at the Open Society Institute. "However, once the teachers and students
understood the idea of debate, all barriers fell."  <br>
And if to American ears "summer camp" conjures up images of lakeside cabins and
mornings spent horseback riding or learning how to canoe, the debate camp at
Celakovice was a different story altogether. The Czech Management Center itself
is a gray, lackluster building that until the Velvet Revolution served as a
training center for Czechoslovakia's communist elite. And yet, despite external
reminders of the Soviet era, inside the Center the past was firmly in the past.
Students and teachers from all over the world lived together, ate together,
played together, and worked together in harmony. For the week in August that it
hosted the camp, the small village where the Center is located took on a new
face, recognizable as the face of the future: the face of debate.<br>
The camp's varied activities culminated in a final tournament that set the team
from Hungary in competition with debaters from Moldova. The issue under
discussion was whether government censorship of the media for the protection of
citizens can be justified. The Hungarian debate team ended up taking the final
prize (scholarships for each team member), but students and coaches from all
teams emphasized that while the tournament was an exciting event, victory was
not at the heart of what was important about their efforts. "The new
friendships I have formed here are what's vital about the camp experience,"
confirmed Alina Belukha, a student from the Dniepropetrovsk region of
Ukraine.<br>
Ken Broda-Bahm, director of debate at Towson State University in Maryland,
agreed: "While the camp is foremost a debate program, debate was not the only
focus. Other activities, such as acting, painting, dancing, sports, and social
events shared the schedule with debate. The resulting atmosphere was different
from the tense, ultra-competitive environment of debate workshops in the United
States." <br>
In the week leading up to the tournament, students attended workshops to hone
specialized skills, for debate is a far more complex affair than the random
expressing of opinions. Indeed, it is an exceptionally structured exercise,
with a special vocabulary to describe its discrete components--the resolution,
affirmative side, negative side, arguments, proofs, cross-examination, and the
decision. Teachers and students, divided into groups of beginners,
intermediates, and the advanced, undertook a daily regimen of workshops dealing
with these components and related issues, such as evidence research, team
strategy and roles, techniques of delivery, and the different styles of formal
debate. "We were fortunate to have top international coaches and students as
hands-on instructors and mentors," said Tricia Mullen Keane, program officer at
the Open Society Institute. "They provided innovative teaching methodologies
that the other teachers and coordinators can integrate into their clubs and
classrooms in their own countries."<br>
The workshops helped students become more articulate and increased their
analytical skills, knowledge of current issues, and self-awareness. Jan
Ruzicka, a self-effacing high schooler, returned to the Czech Republic from
Australia last Christmas when his <br>
parents reclaimed land and an inn that had been taken from his grandfather by
the communists. Jan, who plans to study hotel and restaurant management so that
he can take over the family business, said mastering the discipline and skill
that debate demands gave him the self-confidence to speak in front of hundreds
of people, a skill he was sure would be essential in his planned career.<br>
"When I was growing up, my mother constantly urged me to look for my own
voice," said Anca Pusca, a philosophical eleventh grader from Timisoara,
Romania. "The debate program helped me to find that voice." Anca's teammates
Dan Dimitriu and Carmen Draghici added that debate had helped them to resolve
conflicts, not only within themselves but with their families, their friends,
and even complete strangers. "The special thing about debate is that we not
only shake hands with each one of the opposing team members before the round,
but also after the round, no matter if we win or lose," said Carmen. "You can
not be involved in debate and be intolerant."<br>
Many students indicated that much of what they learn in school does not relate
to their everyday lives. The debate program, many said, made them more
attentive listeners and made it easier to separate fact from fiction when
listening to politicians and teachers. "One of the most difficult things for
people to comprehend is how to, let's say, prove that white is white but also
that white is black," said Ilija Gospodinov, a sophisticated teenager from
Skopje, Macedonia. "In other words, it is very difficult to argue with
conviction if you do not agree with what you are saying. This is when sharp
listening skills and the power of logic come into play. These are skills
students can use in every facet of life, whether business, academics, or
personal."<br>
In a region where minority voices have long been suppressed, the debate program
has had a tremendous impact on the female participants. Kate Golovko, a recent
high school graduate with a slight British accent, is from Chisinau, Moldova.
She and her two teammates formed the only all-female team at the camp. They
competed in the final round of the tournament, and Kate was selected as one of
the camp's top 15 speakers. "I don't want to be confined to an office," she
said. "Many women in my country are more or less pressured to hold traditional
office jobs, but that's not for me. Debate has changed my life because it has
given me a powerful tool, the power of effective communication and
self-confidence. I encourage women to participate in debate because they can
learn how to use logic as a power source."<br>
The debate camp was a mind-opening experience for many of the teens. Peter
Piasecki, an articulate and creative teen from Lodz, Poland, said, "The concept
of an open society was abstract until I came to the camp. People have a
tendency to stay in their own world, with their own people. Your thoughts are
only about the small world you create for yourself. But when you come to a camp
like this, you see that there are so many different kinds of people with so
many different kinds of experiences. You become friends with these people, and
it changes your perspective."<br>
On the last day of the camp, Alina Belukha, a student from Ukraine, could be
seen clutching a purple folder inscribed with large day-glo letters spelling
out "Late Night with Ukraine." Alina recounted how an American student had
written the phrase in commemoration of his many late night tutorial sessions
with the Ukrainians. To Alina, the folder was evidence of the friendships
formed at the camp. With a warm smile, she opened up the folder ever so
delicately and displayed the autographs and addresses of all the friends she
had made and with whom she planned to correspond. "Because we lived in a closed
society for so long, it has been difficult for us to be open and honest about
who we really are. But now it is important for us to learn how to reveal our
soul and character. Through debate we learn to question, and this brings us
closer to an understanding of ourselves and the world around us." <br>

Books Across Borders<br>
Reprinted from the Washington Post<br>
by Frances Pinter<br>
<br>
One day in 1994, not long after I had been appointed director of the Central
European University Press, my telephone rang and I heard the voice of George
Soros, the university's founder, posing a rhetorical question. "Wouldn't it be
great," Soros asked, "if we could somehow support the translation of classic
works of Western intellectual thought into the languages of Central and Eastern
Europe?"<br>
It would be great, I knew. And it would also be, I realized, a tall order to
implement such a complex, ambitious idea. For, while most political walls fell
all over Central and Eastern Europe in late 1989 and 1990, some remained
standing. Although a state-subsidized publishing industry was in place in many
countries of the region, the book publishing outside of the underground
samizdat culture was characterized by a monopoly of approved texts by
politically correct authors or writers imaginative and creative enough to
disguise their message in a politically acceptable vernacular.<br>
Among the utterly unavailable texts were the classic works of Western
political, social, legal, and economic philosophy, a gap that even six years of
democracy in Central and Eastern Europe has been slow to fill. Even at this
moment, if you are a first-year political science major studying in, say,
Latvia, texts whose availability is taken for granted by your American
counterparts--John Stewart Mill's On Liberty, de Tocqueville's Democracy in
America, even Aristotle's Poetics, to name just a few, are unavailable in your
native language. If you are studying law, economics, or sociology, or are
involved in gender studies or international relations, your predicament is even
worse: there may be nothing at all available to read in your field.<br>
Imagine, then, the shock felt by Melissa Hagemann, director of the Open Society
Institute-Budapest's Library Support Program, just a few years ago when, on a
visit to the national library in Tirana, Albania, she inquired about the
library's reference resources. Why yes, she was told by the librarian, the
library did have a copy of the complete Encyclopedia Britannica. When Hagemann
went to check, she found that, indeed, they did, but only of the 1913 edition!
All of this, inevitably, led to a central question: How could one help to
introduce Western liberal ideas into the newly democratized nations of Central
and Eastern Europe without, in widely available quantities, the books on which
those ideas and values are based?<br>
In an attempt to answer that question and to respond to some of the problems
illustrated above, the Central University Press Translation Project was founded
in 1995. Based on similar but smaller projects initiated by a few of the
foundations in the Soros foundations network, we sought to demonstrate that
translation efforts could be a highly effective and, if well-designed and
implemented, relatively inexpensive way of helping Eastern European publishers
redefine themselves in a changing world.<br>
From the outset, I saw that there were fundamental questions to be answered.
For example, how could OSI best obtain, and balance, the opinions of
intellectuals and scholars from both the East and West as to what kinds of
books should be published? How could we avoid supporting and promoting a list
which was, perhaps, too exclusively Anglo-Saxon in its orientation? Whose input
should be solicited in compiling a list of recommended titles? Central European
University faculty members? Outside experts? Publishers themselves? And, of
crucial importance to me as a publisher, how could we design such a project so
as to promote the growth of an innovative and efficient local publishing
industry?<br>
But one must start somewhere, and in the case of the Central European
University Press Translation Project, it was with a pilot program in Romania in
late 1994, at which time a list of about 250 recommended titles compiled by
Central European University faculty was circulated to Romanian publishers.
Through an open competition organized by publishing program coordinator Marina
Ghitoc at the Soros Foundation for an Open Society-Bucharest, in which
publishers themselves selected titles from the project list, 15 publishers were
awarded grants to support the publication of over 30 titles. Among the titles
were classic works by Immanuel Kant, Max Weber, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, as
well as essential textbooks in economics, history, and sociology, and
contemporary classics by writers such as Hannah Arendt, Karl Popper, Isaiah
Berlin, and Michel Foucault.<br>
As I was convinced that only if publishers had something to lose would they put
their hearts and souls behind the project, we decided that the Budapest office
of the Central European University Press would only assist with procuring
translation rights and various other publishing functions, and at the same time
insisted that publishers further invest their own resources.<br>
During 1995, in addition to Romania, the program was introduced in Albania,
Bulgaria, Poland, and Ukraine, where initial competitions for support funds
have received an enthusiastic response. In Bulgaria alone, over 70 applications
were received from a group including virtually every qualified publisher in the
country. In Romania, response to the program was so positive that a number of
publishers volunteered to translate additional books, with OSI funding only
copyright fees. The program has broadened to include over a dozen other
countries in 1996, and over the next several years we hope to support the
publication of some 500 titles per year. <br>
But translating classic works also often raises questions which are particular
to each individual country and language. In the case of Karl Popper's works,
for example, a recent translation of one of his books into Mongolian by a
political philosopher trained in Moscow turned out to be riddled with Marxist
terminology. It took a professor of Asian studies at Budapest's Eotvos Lorand
University familiar with the Mongolian tradition of translating ancient
philosophical and spiritual texts to rework the translation, reviving an old
philosophical vocabulary which was once part of the local translation
culture.<br>
The project of translation, I was also aware from the beginning, is very much a
two-way street, and we in the West, too, have been deprived, during the 50-year
reign of communism, of greater access to any of the classic works of
nineteenth- and twentieth-century Eastern and Central European fiction. Missing
from many shelves are works by writers of such world-class caliber as the Czech
Jan Neruda, the Hungarians Kezso Kosztolanyi, Zsigmond Moricz, and Gyula Krudy,
and Polish writers Boleslaw Prus and Witold Gombrowicz, writers whose work
deserves to be on the syllabus of every Western course in the literature of
this region. In acknowledgment of that glaring literary omission, the Central
European University Press English-Language Division recently relaunched the
Central European Classics series, begun (and remaining) under the editorship of
Timothy Garton Ash, with newly commissioned translations of Kosztolanyi's
Skylark, Neruda's Prague Tales, Moricz's Be Faithful Unto Death, and Brus's The
Doll. These are available worldwide through Oxford University Press'
distribution of Central European University Press titles in English.<br>
Over the long term, I hope we will be able to support the emergence and renewal
of a strong, diverse, and independent publishing industry in Central and
Eastern Europe, not merely a key element of any civil society, but of any
civilized person's claim to an open, inclusive, and stimulating intellectual
and cultural life. With all due respect to Robert Frost, who came of age in a
very different world, that while poetry may sometimes be what is lost in
translation, much of the world's rich scholarly, academic, and literary
heritage is also be found there.<br>

The Center on Crime, Communities, &amp; Culture<br>
<br>
Fear of crime, particularly violent crime, is a hallmark of life in the United
States. While almost everyone is afraid of crime, research shows that some
communities, particularly low-income and urban minority communities, represent
a disproportionate number of both victims and perpetrators of crime.<br>
<br>
The goals of the Center on Crime, Communities, &amp; Culture are to foster a
more informed and balanced national debate on crime, victims' concerns,
punishment, and the rehabilitation of individuals and communities; to support
and spotlight service programs which effectively address the needs of at-risk
youth, juvenile offenders, victims, prisoners, as well as the families of these
populations; and, to encourage knowledge transfer on successful criminal
justice programs and policies across the United States and between the United
States and other nations.<br>
<br>
The first nine months of the Center's history has been an extraordinarily
productive time. Established by OSI in the spring of 1996, the Center has
already provided more than $1.4 million in grants to over two dozen groups,
developed a fellowships program, and issued several publications in conjunction
with the Center's research department.  <br>
<br>
A nation that incarcerates as many of its citizens as does the U.S. cannot hope
to remain an open society. To truly address the injurious impact crime is
having on our entire society, the problem must be approached and the solutions
discovered community by <br>
community. We must find new answers. <br>

Rhythms to Ratios<br>
Open Society Institute<br>
The Algebra Project Brings Robert Moses' Activist Legacy<br>
 into the Classroom<br>
by Beth Breger<br>
<br>
Math teacher and civil rights activist Robert Moses spent the 1960s leading
voter-registration drives in the Mississippi Delta and, later, teaching
mathematics in Africa. When he and his family returned to the United States,
they enrolled their children in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moses found he wasn't happy with the mathematics
instruction his daughter Maisha received, so he began tutoring her at home,
himself. When Maisha reached eighth grade, her skills were so advanced that her
teacher invited Moses to transplant his home tutoring into the classroom. The
Algebra Project--now a program that operates in schools in 17 states across the
nation--was born.<br>
<br>
The Algebra Project's pedagogy is based on Moses' belief that abstract concepts
can be made more intelligible to children by relating mathematics to the
concrete experiences of daily life. A subway ride can teach the concept of
negative numbers, gumdrop-toothpick cubes can elucidate exponential theory, and
African drum rhythms can explain ratios. <br>
<br>
Moses' method for teaching the language of algebra is contained in a five-step
process: experiencing an event; drawing or modeling the event; describing the
event in idiomatic English; describing the event in more regimented English;
and representing the event with symbols. Thus, the student moves step-by-step
from a tangible event into the symbolic language used to represent it in
algebra.<br>
<br>
On a recent visit to a classroom at the King School, fourteen years after the
program was initiated, I saw the Algebra Project in action. What at first
sounded like a lecture on the Boston mass transit system turned out to be an
introduction to the mental processes and language of algebra. The students sat
in five different clusters around the room, each group hovering over diagrams
of the subway system that they had developed as a team. <br>
<br>
One delegate from each group presented the team's diagrammatic voyages, based
on actual field trips along different routes of Boston's subway system. Each
group proudly displayed work, accepted questions from their classmates about
why they chose their particular designs, what each symbol represented, where
trips started and finished, and how the diagrams could help a new subway rider
navigate the route between Boston and Cambridge.<br>
<br>
To those schooled in more traditional methods, this may seem more like playtime
than math class. But in fact, the thinking and reasoning skills taught by
Moses' math games help introduce students to the kind of abstract thinking and
symbolic language that is necessary for them to begin to grasp the concepts of
higher math. "At first, I didn't believe we were doing math,"  Laurance
Kimbrough, one of Moses' students, told Smithsonian magazine. "Now I look back
at what we did and I realize it really helped me."<br>
<br>
Moses focuses on algebra because he believes that without it the door to
college and most skilled professions is locked. "Computers can crunch more
numbers than anyone's going to dream of crunching," he told the New York Times.
"There are no jobs out there for people who [just] know how to divide." In an
interview with Smithsonian, he said, "New technology demands a new
literacy--higher math skills for everyone. Up in the [Mississippi] Delta, the
largest employer is now a shipping service. All the dollies have computers on
them. They need warehouse workers who are trained in computers."<br>
<br>
The Algebra Project is more than a novel teaching method; it has changed the
dynamic in classrooms. "We are now hearing more voices . . . children who sat
silently are contributing to conversations," said Pamela Paternoster, manager
of the Algebra Project in Cambridge. "Classrooms are set up differently. Desks
are no longer in rows but are clustered together to facilitate cooperative
learning." And, according to Paternoster, children aren't the only ones
transformed by the Project. "For the first time, teachers across the city are
talking to each other about math. They are taking more risks and are not afraid
to try new teaching approaches."<br>
<br>
And the Project's approach seems to be paying off in more ways than higher math
scores on achievement tests. Reading and writing skills are also improving, as
well as school discipline. "I see almost no one from the Algebra Project for
disciplinary reasons. They're too busy with the activities," said school
principal Ken Acton. An evaluation funded by the National Science Foundation of
the Algebra Project's efforts in Mississippi concluded that the project "has
had an extremely beneficial effect on students--particularly on their
attitudes, motivation, problem-solving, and ability to articulate and share
mathematical ideas."<br>
<br>
Moses compares his work with the Algebra Project to his days registering voters
in the South: "In the 1960s everyone said sharecroppers were apathetic, that
they didn't want to vote. It wasn't until we got them demanding to vote that we
got attention. Here, where kids are falling wholesale through the cracks--or
chasms--dropping out of sight, becoming fodder for jails, people say they don't
want to learn. The only ones who can dispel that notion are the kids
themselves. We have to get them to demand what everyone says they don't want."
The Algebra Project helps children who would otherwise be left behind reach an
intellectual level that could open up opportunities their parents might never
have dreamed possible. <br>

Institute-New York.The Institute recently awarded the Algebra Project a $12
million grant to be used over the next three years. For more information about

IMMIGRANTS' BURDEN<br>
by George Soros<br>
<br>
In the last seven years, I have devoted considerable energy to support the
creation of open societies in the former Soviet bloc. In those countries, the
meaning of open society was easy to explain: it was the opposite of Communism.
Open society was the United States, a country characterized by a reliance on
the rule of law, a democratically elected government, a diverse culture, and
respect for people who are different. The truth, of course, was always more
complicated. Yet the image and the ideal were inspiring, and they remain so to
this day. Refugees fleeing persecution, family members reuniting with loved
ones, and young entrepreneurs with talent and drive have long come to America
seeking a fair chance to contribute and, in the process, have enriched our
culture and strengthened the nation. But much of that fair chance was taken
away when the recent welfare law went into effect. That legislation bars most
legal immigrants from receiving a range of public assistance.<br>
According to the Congressional Budget Office, more than 500,000 immigrants are
likely to lose Supplemental Security benefits, and about 900,000 are likely to
lose food stamps. Legal immigrants represent only about 5 percent of those on
public aid, yet they are absorbing over 40 percent of the cuts in welfare. <br>
Immigrants have always pulled their weight. Except for the right to vote, legal
immigrants have enjoyed the same rights and shared the same responsibilities as
citizens. They serve in the military. They contribute more in taxes than they
receive in benefits. Denying them the safety net they help pay for is neither
necessary nor fair, and it breaks with a long and proud tradition of treating
legal immigrants as future citizens who are assets, rather than as non-citizen
aliens who are a burden. <br>
More than half of the legal immigrants who will lose their benefits have lived
in the U.S. for more than five years and are likely to be eligible for
naturalization. More than one million are expected to apply for citizenship
this year. Yet in taking benefits away from struggling immigrants, we are
adding yet another obstacle to those they already face in applying for
citizenship, including learning English, studying for the test, and paying
processing fees.<br>
There is no question that the welfare system needs to be reformed so that it
moves people from dependency to work. But to do so we must spend more money,
not less, in the short term, because creating work requires more public
investment and job training--for citizens and legal immigrants. Depriving
immigrants creates false savings at the cost of perpetrating an injustice. <br>
As an immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen, I have a deep sympathy for those
who come to America in search of a better life. I have prospered, but I know
that we all need a helping hand at some time in our lives. After World War II,
I left Hungary and stayed in England for several years, working as a railroad
porter. I broke my leg and was taken care of, free of charge, by the National
Health Service. I depended on government assistance. <br>
If immigrants to America suffer similar misfortunes, if they cannot work or
find a decent-paying job and their families are starving, where will they turn
for help? In the answer lies our identity as a people and as a nation. <br>
<br>
<br>
Aiding Postcommunist Societies: A Better Way?<br>
<br>
Since 1989, the U.S. government has sponsored a wide array of economic,
political, and humanitarian assistance programs aimed at helping the countries
of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union carry out the transition to
capitalism and democracy. Although far short of the Marshall Plan in magnitude,
the U.S. effort to <br>
aid the former communist countries has nonetheless entailed <br>
considerable resources--more than $2 billion for Central and Eastern Europe and
close to $10 billion for the former Soviet Union. Driven by a sense of historic
urgency, this assistance effort was put together in a tremendous hurry, with
maximum attention to getting aid flowing as rapidly as possible and minimal
attention to organizational design and innovation. Although the aid initially
unfolded in a honeymoon phase of sorts, in the past few years it has
increasingly attracted criticism, above and beyond the frequent laments from
some quarters over what some people believe to be its insufficient quantity.<br>
<br>
Both foreign external analysts and local participants report a fairly
consistent litany of operational problems with U.S. assistance: too much of the
aid goes to American organizations rather than to people in the target
countries; the aid is often too concentrated in large, top-down projects rather
than smaller, grass-roots efforts; and it is too often based on predetermined,
U.S.-oriented models rather than on local realities. The lack of much real
response to the criticisms of U.S. assistance is not primarily a result of
indifference or cynicism on the part of assistance officials. It is due instead
to the deeply entrenched psychological and bureaucratic structures that encase
U.S. assistance programs.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, there exists a positive example of a different way of giving aid
to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and it is not merely one small,
experimental program, which, although interesting, is obviously limited to
particular circumstances. Rather, it is a very large donor carrying out
wide-ranging assistance programs in most of the countries of the region. That
donor is George Soros and his philanthropic creation, the Soros foundations
network. A comprehensive study of the work of the network is well beyond the
scope of this article. What is presented here is only an analysis of the basic
assistance-giving methods of the  foundations, through a portrait of the Soros
operation in one country, Romania, with a focus on how the Soros methods differ
from those of official U.S. foreign aid. The work of the Soros national
foundation in Romania is not typical of all the activities of the Soros
foundations. It differs, for example, from the more high-profile, politicized
involvement of Soros in Poland and Hungary and the big-ticket
institution-building initiatives, such as the controversial Central European
University. But it is at least somewhat typical of the work of many of the less
high-profile national foundations which constitute a significant share of the
overall effort of the Soros foundations network. As such it is useful as a
window into an interesting and potentially instructive <br>
universe of foreign aid.<br>
<br>
Paying Heed to Localism<br>
<br>
As a guiding principle of foreign aid, localism has the same special status as
many other received truths in governmental affairs, such as the need for
bureaucratic innovation and efficiency--it is much cited but rarely practiced.
Western assistance officials are quick to talk of the need for, among other
things, sensitivity to the local environment, local "ownership" of assistance
programs, and local capacity-building. Yet, in Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, much of the Western aid of the past six years has been unloaded
in rapid fashion without much attempt to involve locals in the process, to
ensure that aid gets to locals, to design assistance programs on the basis of
conceptions of societal change that reflect a deep understanding of local
conditions, or to keep locals well-informed about the assistance. What
fundamentally characterizes the approach of the Soros foundations network, and
distinguishes it from the approaches of other major Western donors, is its
genuine localism on all these counts.<br>
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), like most
Western official donors, operates in Romania through a small bubble colony. The
USAID field office in Romania is a tiny piece of the American government
transplanted in Romania. In contrast, the Soros operation in Romania, the Soros
Foundation for an Open Society-Bucharest, has very little of the character of
an outpost of a foreign organization. At each of the four branches of
SFOS-Bucharest (unlike almost all Western donors in Romania, Soros has offices
outside Bucharest, in Cluj, Iasi, and Timisoara), the board of directors, the
management, and the staff are all Romanians. The selection committees that
SFOS-Bucharest uses for its many open grants competitions are similarly all
local. Unlike the USAID office in Romania, SFOS-Bucharest has the primary
responsibility for decisions about allocating assistance funds in the country.
The Open Society Institute in New York exercises some oversight over the
activities of all foundations in the network, but that relationship is
generally much less close and less control-based than the relationship between
USAID headquarters in Washington and its field offices in the region.<br>
<br>
A second key point of difference is the targeting of the assistance. Most USAID
funds for Romanian programs go to American organizations: U.S. consulting
groups, accounting firms, nonprofit non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
universities, and other organizations. The U.S. contractors and grantees
deliver training and technical assistance to Romanians in the form of
workshops, conferences, seminars, organizational advice, counseling, expert
analysis, and studies.<br>
<br>
The assistance of the foundation in Romania follows the inverse pattern--most
of it goes directly to Romanian individuals and groups; only a small share goes
to people and organizations outside the country. The assistance to groups in
Romania generally consists of small grants (usually $5,000 to $25,000) to
organizations within a sector, such as media, human rights, or public health. A
sizable proportion of SFOS-Bucharest's  funds go to individual Romanians,
usually as educational scholarships for short- to medium-term study abroad or
professional development activities requiring travel abroad. The grants to
individuals are usually micro-grants in U.S. assistance terms, ranging from as
low as $40 up to a few thousand dollars.<br>
<br>
A third facet of the foundation's localism concerns the design of projects.
USAID programs are generally designed by Americans, either USAID staff in
Washington, consultants hired in Washington and sent out on project design
missions to Romania, or U.S. contractors and grantees already involved in
related assistance programs. In contrast, the programs of the Soros Foundation
for an Open Society-Romania are designed primarily by Romanians, usually the
program staff of the foundation, although OSI-NY and OSI-Budapest sometimes
contribute technical assistance to the design of programs in Romania and other
countries, or create regional programs which include Romania.<br>
<br>
At the risk of oversimplification, the variance between the two approaches to
assistance is the same as that between a focus on the process rather than on
the result. USAID emphasizes the results it wants to help postcommunist
societies achieve (namely, a market economy and a democratic political system)
and characterizes its specific programs as building blocks relating to these
goals. An underlying assumption of this approach is that process is the servant
of result. <br>
<br>
In the case of Romania, for example, if external donors and Romanians focus
sufficiently on defining and endorsing the desired results of political and
economic transformation, a process to achieve those results will follow.
SFOS-Bucharest focuses instead on trying to foster or strengthen a process of
change, by supporting individuals who are seeking to change, rather than on
results per se. Process is assumed to be the master of result--if the right
process of change gains strength, Soros believes, the result will be good.
Soros is not indifferent to endpoints; in fact his underlying goals are
essentially similar to USAID's. An open society, he says, "is something akin to
what we have in Western Europe and North America." <br>
<br>
Benefits of Localism<br>
<br>
The establishment of a genuinely local organization to run the assistance means
that programs can be designed and overseen by people with a real understanding
of the sectors they are trying to shape, rather than by outsiders who usually
have only a superficial, generic understanding of the particular sectors in
question. Outsiders do sometimes bring a fresh perspective to a troubled
sector, as well as valuable experience in assistance efforts with similar
sectors in other countries. Yet, compared to foreign consultants, local program
officers, if carefully selected, usually have a much greater knowledge of where
the talent lies within a sector, how the sector has or has not been changing in
the past years and why, and how the sector interacts with other institutions or
forces within the society. This sort of knowledge permits the development of
assistance programs that build productively on local realities rather than
programs that try to produce changes that donors have decided should occur.<br>
<br>
An additional benefit of the Soros foundations network's use of local persons
to run its national foundations is that the experience of working in the
foundations provides sustained, real-world training to locals in all aspects of
the work, from policy formulation to financial management. This sort of
training is in great demand in Romania and other former communist countries.
The network's extensive use of locals as directors and as members of award
committees is also a multiple plus. It injects considerable local expertise and
knowledge into decision-making processes.<br>
<br>
Giving a large proportion of the assistance directly to people and groups
generally results in greater impact per dollar than indirect assistance through
U.S. or other external intermediary organizations. In part this is simply
because of the elimination of middlemen and the much higher costs of U.S.
personnel and overhead. It is not merely the difference in costs, however, that
leads to the greater impact of direct assistance, it is also the method itself.
So much of the Western-funded technical assistance seems to pass through a
country like Romania and leave distressingly little trace. On the other hand,
direct grants, if carefully targeted, either in conjunction with technical
assistance or on their own, often produce visible and definite, albeit modest,
results, as seen in the direct grants by the Soros Foundation for an Open
Society-Romania, and other donors, to independent newspapers, radio stations,
environmental groups, human rights groups, and other small organizations in
Romania.<br>
<br>
In such contexts of partial or serious stagnation, the Soros foundations
network approach of planting seeds for change rather than trying to engineer
results seems preferable. What one sees in looking at Soros foundations
projects in Romania is many small beachheads of interesting, often dynamic
activity--social science institutes regenerating themselves, cultural
organizations reaching new audiences, new professional journals under way,
civic groups expanding their operations, and thousands of individuals who have
been able to pursue advanced educational and professional opportunities abroad.
One cannot know with certainty precisely what these many activities and changes
will lead to, but they have clearly reached many areas of talent in the country
and, at a minimum, are positive developments in and of themselves.<br>

A Forgotten War<br>
A Commentary on Tajikistan and the Western Media <br>
by David Rieff<br>
<br>
Except for a few aid workers and diplomats, almost no one outside the former
Soviet Union has ever heard of Tajikistan. While by no means its greatest
misfortune, this fact has certainly not helped the country in these post-Cold
War times. For when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, so did the
idea--current in Western Europe and North America since 1945--that any place of
interest to Russia was also of interest to the West. By the early 1990s,
Washington was no longer even very interested in Afghanistan, where it had been
intensely involved for more than a decade. And if there was no interest in the
travails of Tajikistan's richer and more strategic southern neighbor, what hope
was there for the little Central Asian republic when its own troubles began in
May 1992?<br>
<br>
As with politicians, so with the press. Not only did Tajikistan never receive
even a fraction of the space regularly devoted to the agonies of Bosnia,
Somalia, or Rwanda in the front sections of the New York Times and
theWashington Post; it was all but ignored. Without sustained political
interest, editors of news programs in the United States and Western Europe felt
no pressure to send crews to Tajikistan. With no television coverage, probably
the only way people in the rich world can be goaded into indignation over a
catastrophe in a faraway place, the politicians never had to deal with a crisis
in which involvement would always have necessarily been based on moral rather
than geostrategic criteria.<br>
<br>
This may seem like an argument that public sentiment carries the day in foreign
policy matters. I do not mean to suggest anything of the sort. The most public
pressure can do is put an issue on policymakers' agenda and, as we saw in
Bosnia, even a great deal of activism may not succeed in provoking timely
action. In any case, the attention places like Bosnia, Somalia, or Rwanda
receive in the Western media is rarely as lavish as is often made out. Compare
the coverage the Rwandan genocide received with that lavished on Charles and
Di's slow-motion divorce or the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, America's
low-rent Othello. Most people don't have a lot of psychological room for
disasters in distant places. But to the extent they can care about such
matters, they cared about Rwanda and did not care about Tajikistan. <br>
<br>
And yet, from a moral point of view, it is not clear why this should have been
so. Ordinary Tajiks suffered as much as the citizens of Sarajevo or Mogadishu.
While undeniably complex and resistant to easy or cheap solutions, the conflict
in Tajikistan was no harder to understand or resolve than the Bosnian war or
the Somali emergency. Those of us from the West who travel regularly to places
like Tajikistan have grown accustomed to returning home to find indifference
among our friends, most of whom cannot even locate on a map the zones of war
and misery where we risk our lives and our sanity by staring so intently at so
much suffering and cruelty. And with a few exceptions, people at home are not
particularly interested in knowing more. <br>
<br>
The reality is that they do not really approve of our having made such
journeys. Ignorant of the causes of wars in places like Tajikistan, most people
seem to believe that there is no cause beyond the presumed savagery of the
inhabitants, a quality Westerners who have never met an Uzbek, a Hutu, or a
Bosnian Serb seem perfectly comfortable ascribing to them. And so ignorance
breeds not more ignorance but complacency--we do not have wars at home;
therefore there must be something wrong with them.<br>
<br>
It is often assumed that if people could see what places such as Tajikistan are
like, they would feel differently. Somehow, we still believe that knowledge is
power. If Tajikistan was ignored, it must be because there was no sustained
international press coverage. In other words, no "CNN effect" for officials in
Washington or Brussels to deal with. United Nations Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali once bitterly referred to CNN as the sixteenth member of the
Security Council. But CNN only provides a spotlight, not knowledge. At best, it
serves up information that might provide the basis for knowledge--a very
different matter.<br>
<br>
What is undeniable is that we are growing tired of other people's misfortunes.
If we don't have to look at them, so much the better. And if these misfortunes
are broadcast only occasionally, that is, if people are not repeatedly
subjected to images of dead children and refugees on the march, they will
ignore them. One recalls the few instances--Biafra, Somalia, Rwanda,
Bosnia--that actually mobilized the public, which is another way of saying we
remember a few moral successes. In reality, these instances have been
exceptional. It is Tajikistan, that paradigmatic "orphan conflict," that is the
norm, not Bosnia, just as it is indifference, not compassion or outrage, that
is the customary reaction to the hell that is the lot of four-fifths of the
world's population. Humanitarian relief workers have a name for this:
compassion fatigue.<br>
<br>
To be sure, individual stories still have the capacity to engage public
sentiment in the West. When a dying baby in a Sarajevo hospital was pictured on
British television, reaction in Europe was so strong that the British prime
minister had to send a special plane to bring the infant to England for
treatment. But unless suffering can be personalized, not to say sentimentalized
in this way (the baby in question was a hopeless case; it was already too late
for her, as it was not for Sarajevo itself), it often seems as if it does not
really move anyone who is not there to witness it.<br>
<br>
I do not believe that we in West have yet sunk so far into our own
self-regarding reveries to say openly that Tajik lives are not as precious our
own, or that their fates are less worth caring about. But it is growing harder
to resist the intuition that the global village is really a charnel house. And
the more that realization sinks in, the harder it becomes, paradoxically, to
assimilate what is taking place in all the conflicts raging in the world
today.<br>
<br>
Even in more orderly times, what has happened in Tajikistan in the past four
years would have been hard enough to take in. Some 50,000 people died during
the Civil War in 1992. More than a million became refugees or were "internally
displaced," the euphemism used to describe people who are forced to flee
because of political<br>
 or natural disasters, but who do not actually cross any international
frontier. But while this disaster was taking place, so were many others.
Tajikistan? There are 50 wars taking place in the world as I write. How can
anyone care about all of them? Perhaps the better question is, at the rate
things are going, how long will we who live in the more fortunate parts of the
world care about any of them.<br>
<br>
And while those whose attention matters were not paying attention, thousands of
Tajik refugees chose to cross the Amu Darya River into Afghanistan--then, as
now, itself at war--a choice that tells one all one needs to know about how
desperate the situation was at the time. Their movement had the irresistibility
of a swelling tide. No appeal from international relief agencies, no guarantee
that their rights would be protected, could stem the flow. They were scared.
They had seen their friends and relatives killed. Their world had been
shattered.<br>
<br>
And yet, to an outsider, almost the most terrible thing about this story is how
commonplace it has become at the end of the twentieth century. So generic, in
fact, that it becomes all but impossible to find the emotional and moral
strength to remain indignant or feel, however inchoately, that such things
should not be permitted to happen and that something should be done to stop
them.<br>
<br>
For all the glib talk of life in a wired global village, ours is a time of
forgotten wars in countries that seem as remote to the average American or
Western European as the dark side of the moon. People in New York or
Tokyo--citizens of the rich world--can find out more easily than ever before
about what happens in the Tajikistans of the world. But the fact that all this
information is available does not make people want to think about it any more
than they did when obtaining such information was more of a struggle.<br>
<br>
For "they," read "we." This is a story about all of us. Which is probably bad
luck for Tajikistan. Because Tajikistan is not only unknown because it is far
away. It's unknown because thinking about it, and all the other places like it,
where the lives of tens of thousands are snuffed out in the space of a few
months and where hundreds of thousands of other people are forced to flee their
homes for a life of uncertainty, misery, and exile, is far too disturbing.
Really imagining the world as it is might mean behaving differently. It would
certainly mean not sleeping so soundly, or thinking so much about money, or
vacations, or the dangers of secondhand smoke. Instead, we designate a few
people to deal with the question; these we call "humanitarians," and they are
both our heroes and our excuse.<br>

Abstract of Dayton Accords</b></center><p> 
 
 
<i>Introduction</i><p> 
 
The following abstract of the General Framework Agreement and its eleven annexes provides an outline of 
objective indicators and deadlines established by the Bosnian Peace Accords, which can be used as a tool 
to measure progress towards meeting the objectives of the Agreement, and as a guideline for the 
monitoring of such progress. <p> 
 
The Annexes to the General Framework Agreement, initialed in Dayton on November 21, 1995, and signed 
in Paris on December 14, 1995, are summarized below. Those provisions which describe actions which are 
to be accomplished within a specified time period or by a specified date appear in bold.  Dates are 
calculated from the entry into force of the Agreement on December 14, 1995, or from the Transfer of 
Authority on December 20, 1995, according to the text.  Objective indicators are in upper case.  The Parties 
to each Annex vary; each Annex thus should be consulted separately to determine who the Parties are.  Of 
course, complete details of provisions and procedures may be found in the <A 
href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/boshome.html">text of the Agreement</a> and its annexes.<p> 
 
This abstract was prepared bearing in mind the particular focus of the <A 
href="http://www.soros.org/migrate.html">Forced Migration Projects</a> of the <A 
href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Institute</a>;  selectivity was therefore employed in the 
process, and some articles and text have been omitted.<p> 
 
<i>GENERAL FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT</i><p> 
 
In terms of the general structure of the Agreement, in Articles I and II of the General Framework 
Agreement, the Parties agree to adhere to recognized principles of international law set forth in the UN 
Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and other documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE), and to comply with the provisions in <i>Annexes 1-A</i> and <i>1-B</i>. In Article III 
of the Agreement, the Parties agree to endorse the arrangements concerning boundary demarcation, as 
detailed in <i>Annex 2</i>. In Article IV of the Agreement, the Parties agree to endorse the elections 
program for Bosnia and Herzegovina, as detailed in <i>Annex 3</i>.   In Article V of the General 
Framework Agreement, the Parties agree to endorse the arrangements which have been made concerning 
the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as detailed in <i>Annex 4</i>. In Articles VI and VII of the 
Agreement, the Parties agree to the establishment of an arbitration tribunal, a Commission on Human 
Rights, a Commission on Refugees and Displaced Persons, a Commission to Preserve National 
Monuments, and Bosnia and Herzegovina Public Corporations, as set forth in <i>Annexes 5 - 9</i>.  In 
particular, the Parties recognize the importance of the "observance of human rights and the protection of 
refugees and displaced persons," and agree to comply with the related provisions set forth in <i>Annexes 
6</i> and <i>7</i>.  In Article VIII of the Agreement, the Parties agree to endorse the arrangements which 
have been made concerning the implementation of this peace settlement, including those pertaining to the 
civilian implementation, as set forth in <i>Annex 10</i>, and the international police task force, as set 
forth in <i>Annex 11</i>.<p> 
 
<i>THE ANNEXES</i><p> 
 
<i>Annex 1-A: Military Aspects of the Peace Settlement</i><p> 
 
Article I<br> 
The international community agrees to send a force <b>for approximately one year</b> to assist with 
implementation of territorial and military aspects.  <b>The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
transferred authority, on December 20, 1995, to the IMPLEMENTATION FORCE (IFOR), which is made 
up of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and non-NATO ground, air, and maritime 
forces.</b><p> 
 
Article II<br> 
<b>Cessation of hostilities as of October 5, 1995</b>.  Each party ensures compliance by its forces.  
Parties agree to provide a "safe and secure environment" within their jurisdictions by maintaining civilian 
law enforcement agencies in accordance with  "internationally recognized standards."  <b>Disarmament of 
"armed civilian groups" will be completed within 30 days after the Transfer of Authority, i.e. by January 
19, 1996</b>.  The Parties agree to fully cooperate with and grant access to international monitors, 
advisors, investigators, and observers. <p> 
 
Article III<br> 
<b>All forces within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina not of local origin must withdraw within 
thirty days of the entry into force of the Agreement (December 14, 1995), i.e. by January 13, 
1996</b>.<p> 
 
Article IV<br> 
<b>Phase I</b><br> 
<b>Immediately after this Annex enters into force the Parties will begin promptly and proceed steadily to 
withdraw their forces behind a Zone of Separation on either side of the Agreed Cease-Fire Line.  
Withdrawal will be completed within thirty days after the Transfer of Authority, i.e. by January 19, 
1996</b>.  The Agreed Cease-Fire Zone of Separation will extend two kilometers on either side of the 
Agreed Cease-Fire Line.  No weapons other than those of IFOR are permitted within this Zone.  Violators 
will be subject to military action by IFOR. <p> 
 
 
 
 
Specific provisions: <p> 
 
Sarajevo: <b>Within seven days after the Transfer of Authority (i.e. by December 27, 1995) the Parties 
will have transferred and vacated selected positions along the agreed Cease-Fire Line as instructed by 
IFOR.  Within thirty days forces will be withdrawn from within the Agreed Zone of Separation (i.e. by 
January 19, 1996)</b>.  The width of this zone will be approximately one kilometer on each side of the 
Cease-Fire Line line, but can be adjusted by IFOR.  No individual other than IFOR personnel will possess 
weapons or explosives of any kind within this zone. <p> 
 
Gorazde: A two-lane all-weather road will be constructed in the Gorazde corridor.  Until the road is 
constructed, two interim routes will be used by both Entities.  Complete freedom of movement will be 
granted along these routes, with IFOR authorized to use force to ensure protection of civilian traffic.  
Parties will not locate any forces or heavy weapons within two kilometers of the designated interim routes.  
<b>Immediately after this Annex enters into force (December 14, 1995) the Parties will begin promptly 
and proceed steadily to remove, dismantle or destroy all mines, explosive devices and/or barbed wire from 
the Cease-Fire Zone of Separation or other areas from which forces are withdrawn, or to mark all 
emplacements thereof in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as directed by IFOR.  This will be completed within 
thirty days after the Transfer of Authority (i.e. by January 19, 1996)</b>.<p> 
 
<b>Phase II</b><br> 
<b>In those locations where areas occupied by one Entity are to be transferred to another Entity, the forces 
of the withdrawing Entity will have 45 days after the Transfer of Authority to completely vacate the area 
(i.e. by February 3, 1996).  The Entity to which the area is transferred will not put forces into this area for a 
period of  90 days after the Transfer of Authority (i.e. until March 19, 1996)</b>.  IFOR will provide 
military security in the interim period.  Upon occupation by the Entity to which the area is transferred, 
IFOR will supervise the marking of new Zones of Separation, and will be authorized to use necessary 
military force to ensure compliance. <p> 
 
<b>Phase III</b><br><br> 
As confidence building measures:<br> 
<b>Parties will withdraw all heavy weapons and forces to cantonment/barracks areas within 120 days after 
the Transfer of Authority (i.e. by April 18, 1996).  All forces which cannot be accommodated in 
cantonment/barracks will be demobilized by April 18, 1996</b>.  They will surrender all weapons and 
other military equipment, and be released from service. <p> 
 
Article V<br> 
<b>Upon the establishment of the JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION, all Parties will provide the 
Commission with complete information as to the location of all known weapons, minefields, explosives, 
and all other hazards to safe movement within Bosnia and Herzegovina and will keep the Commission 
updated on changes in this information.  Within thirty days after the Transfer of Authority (i.e. by January 
19, 1996), the Parties will provide the Joint Military Commission with specific information regarding the 
status of forces within ten kilometers of the Agreed Cease-Fire Line and Inter-Entity Boundary Line and 
will keep the Commission updated on changes in this information.  Within 120 days after the Transfer of 
Authority (i.e. by April 18, 1996) the Parties will provide complete information regarding the status of all 
of their forces within Bosnia and Herzegovina.</b><p> 
 
Article VI<br> 
The IFOR mandate differs from that of UNPROFOR and includes the rights to:<br> 
<dl> 
<dt>- Monitor and help ensure compliance with this Annex. 
<dt>- Authorize and supervise marking of the Agreed Cease-Fire Line, its Zone of Separation, the Inter-
Entity Boundary Line, and its Zone of Separation. 
<dt>- Establish arrangements with local and international civilian and military authorities. 
<dt>- Assist in the withdrawal of UN Peace Forces not transferred to IFOR. 
</dl> 
IFOR also will have the right "on request" to fulfill the following supporting tasks "within the limits of its 
assigned principal tasks and available resources":<br> 
<dl> 
<dt>- Help create secure conditions for other peace settlement activities, including elections. 
<dt>- Assist the movement of organizations in the accomplishment of humanitarian missions. 
<dt>- Assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international 
organizations in their humanitarian missions. 
<dt>- Observe and prevent interference with the movement of civilians, refugees and displaced persons 
and respond to violence to life and person associated with such movements. 
<dt>- Monitor the clearing of minefields. 
</dl> 
IFOR has the authority to use military force to fulfill its mission and does not require permission by any 
Party to do so.  <p> 
 
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Croat Defense Council Forces, and the Army of 
the Republika Srpska will establish COMMAND POSTS co-located with IFOR command vocations, which 
will supervise their respective forces which are located within ten kilometers of the Agreed Cease-Fire Line 
or Inter-Entity Boundary Line.  The Command Posts will keep IFOR informed of the status of 
organizations and troop levels in their areas.  IFOR will have complete and unimpeded freedom of 
movement by ground, air and water throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  IFOR has the sole authority to 
govern air space over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to adopt rules to that effect.   <b>Parties will have shut 
down all air early warning, air defense, or fire control radars within 72 hours after this Annex enters into 
force (i.e. by December 17, 1995)</b>.  IFOR will direct the transfer to civilian control of air space over 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. IFOR can promulgate rules for the regulation of surface military traffic in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina.  IFOR will have complete access to all territories and communications systems.<p> 
 
Article VII<br> 
UNPROFOR will withdraw.<p> 
 
Article VIII<br> 
The Parties agree to the establishment of a JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION with the deployment of 
IFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The Commission will receive all military complaints, questions or 
problems, as well as reports; agree on specific actions  to ensure compliance with this Annex; and assist the 
IFOR Commander in implementing transparency measures.  The Commission will be chaired by the IFOR 
Commander or his or her representative and will consist of the senior military commander of the forces of 
each party within Bosnia and Herzegovina and other persons as the IFOR Commander may determine.  
Each Party may select two civilians who will advise the Commission.  The High Representative will attend 
Commission meetings and offer advice.  No one indicted by the International Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia may become a member of the Commission.<p> 
 
Article IX<br> 
<b>The Parties will release and transfer all prisoners, in full cooperation with the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC), within thirty days after the Transfer of Authority (i.e. by January 19, 1996).   No 
later than 21 days after this Annex enters into force (i.e. by January 4, 1996) the Parties will draw up 
comprehensive lists of prisoners for submission to the ICRC, the other Parties, the Joint Military 
Commission, and the High Representative</b>.  The ICRC will be granted full access to prisoners and will 
be permitted to privately interview each prisoner at least 48 hours prior to his or her release.  Parties will 
take no reprisals against a prisoner for refusing to be transferred.  The Parties will comply with any order 
of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for the surrender of prisoners.  Parties will permit 
graves registration personnel of the other Parties to enter into places of burial for a mutually agreed period 
of time to recover and evacuate bodies of deceased military and civilian personnel, including deceased 
prisoners.<p> 
 
Article XII<br> 
IFOR has the final authority to interpret this Annex.<p> 
 
<i>Annex 1-B: Regional Stabilization</i><p>

The Parties agree to devise new forms of cooperation aimed at "building transparency and confidence" and 
achieving balanced and stable defense forces at the "lowest numbers consistent with the Parties' respective 
security."<p> 
 
Article II<br> 
<b>Within seven days after this Annex enters into force (i.e. by December 21, 1995)  the Republic of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska will begin 
negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE, with the goal of agreeing upon an initial set of measures 
within forty-five days after this Annex enters into force (i.e. by January 28, 1996), which initial measures 
will include restrictions on military deployments and exercises in certain areas; restrictions on locations of 
heavy weapons; notification of certain planned military activities and of disbandment of special operations 
and armed civilian groups; identification of and monitoring of weapons manufacturing capabilities; 
exchange of data on holdings of certain weapons; establishment of "military liaison missions" between the 
Chiefs of the Armed Forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika 
Srpska</b>.<p> 
 
Article III<br> 
<b>No arms will be imported for ninety days after this Annex enters into force (i.e. until March 13, 1996).  
No heavy weapons, mines, military aircraft, or helicopters will be imported until 180 days after this Annex 
enters into force (i.e. until June 11, 1996), or until the arms control agreement referred to in Article IV 
below takes effect, whichever is the earliest</b>.<p> 
 
Article IV<br> 
<b>Within thirty days after this Annex enters into force (i.e. by January 13, 1996) the Parties will begin 
negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE to reach an agreement on levels of armaments, and an 
agreement establishing "voluntary limits on military manpower."  To establish a baseline, the Parties agree 
to report within thirty days after this Annex enters into force (i.e. by January 13, 1996) their holdings of 
tanks, certain artillery, armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft and attack helicopters.  The negotiations 
on levels of armament are to be completed within 180 days after the entry into force of this Annex (i.e. by 
June 11, 1996)</b>.<p> 
 
Article V<br> 
The OSCE will designate a special representative to help organize and conduct negotiations, and the Parties 
agree to establish a Commission together with representatives of the OSCE to resolve disputes.<p> 
 
 
<i>Annex 2: Inter-Entity Boundary Line and Related Issues</i><p> 
 
Article I<br> 
The Parties agree to the establishment of an Inter-Entity Boundary Line between the Federation of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska.  <p> 
 
Article II<br> 
The Parties may change this Line only by mutual consent, and during IFOR's mandate, in consultation with 
IFOR.  <p> 
 
Article IV<br> 
IFOR will determine the exact delineation of such lines, and the IFOR Commander in Sarajevo may adjust 
the Zone of Separation as necessary.   Following the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties will 
form a JOINT COMMISSION to prepare an "agreed technical document" containing a precise description 
of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line.<p> 
 
Article V<br> 
<b>The Parties agree to binding arbitration of the disputed Brcko area.  No later than six months (i.e. by 
June 14, 1996) after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Federation and the Republika Srpska will 
each appoint one arbitrator.  A third arbitrator will be selected by agreement between the first two 
arbitrators within thirty days thereafter (i.e. by July 14, 1996).  If they do not agree, the third arbitrator will 
be appointed by the President of the International Court of Justice.  The arbitrators will issue their decision 
no later than one year after the entry into force of this Agreement, i.e. by December 14, 1996</b>.<p> 
 
Article VI<br> 
<b>In those areas transferring from one Entity to the other, the transfer will be completed within 45 days 
after the Transfer of Authority, i.e. by February 3, 1996</b>.<p> 
 
<i>Annex 3: Elections</i><p> 
 
Article I<br> 
The Parties will ensure a politically neutral environment, will protect and enforce the right to vote in secret 
without fear or intimidation, will ensure freedom of expression and press, will encourage freedom of 
association, and will ensure freedom of movement.  OSCE will determine whether social conditions exist 
under which elections can be effective, and will provide assistance in creating these conditions, if 
necessary.<p> 
 
Article II<br> 
The OSCE will adopt and put in place an elections program for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to this end 
will establish a PROVISIONAL ELECTION COMMISSION to supervise the preparation and conduct of 
the elections for the legislatures and Presidency of both Entities, and for the House of Representatives of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (and if feasible, for cantonal and municipal authorities).  <b>Elections will take 
place six months after the entry into force of this agreement (i.e. on June 14, 1996), or if the OSCE 
determines a delay to be necessary, no later than nine months after the entry into force (i.e. by September 
14, 1996)</b>.<p> 
 
Article III<br> 
The Provisional Electoral Commission will establish rules and regulations for the elections, and will 
supervise all aspects of the electoral process, including determining voter registration provisions, ensuring 
compliance with their established rules and regulations, ensuring swift action to "remedy any violation" 
thereof, accrediting election observers and ensuring their unlimited access.  The Commission will consist 
of the head of the OSCE mission, the High Representative, representatives of the Parties and other persons 
which the head of the OSCE mission will designate in consultation with the Parties.  The head of the OSCE 
mission will chair the Commission.<p> 
 
Article IV<br> 
Any citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina aged 18 or over whose name appears on the 1991 census for 
Bosnia and Herzegovina will be eligible to vote.  A citizen who no longer lives in the municipality in 
which s/he resided in 1991 will, "as a general rule," be expected to vote, "in person or by absentee ballot," 
in that municipality, provided that that person is determined to have been registered in that municipality as 
confirmed by the local election commission and the Provisional Election Commission.  The citizen may 
apply to the Commission to cast his or her ballot elsewhere.  "The exercise of a refugee's right to vote shall 
be interpreted as confirmation of his or her intention to return to Bosnia and Herzegovina."  <b>By 
election day (i.e. between June 14 and September 14, 1996) it is expected that the return of refugees should 
already be underway, allowing returnees to participate in person in elections</b>. <p> 
 
<i>Annex 4: Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina</i><p> 
 
Article I<br> 
The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue its legal existence under international law as a state 
under the name Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It will remain a member state of the United Nations.  It will 
consist of two Entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska.  Its capital 
will be Sarajevo.  There will be a citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina which will be regulated by the 
Parliamentary Assembly, and a citizenship of each Entity regulated by that Entity, provided that all citizens 
of either Entity are thereby citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  <p> 
 
"No person shall be deprived of Bosnia and Herzegovina or Entity citizenship arbitrarily or so as to leave 
him or her stateless," or on the basis "of sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status." <p> 
 
"All persons who were citizens of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina immediately prior to the entry 
into force of this Constitution are citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The citizenship of persons 
naturalized after April 16, 1992 and before the entry into force of this Constitution will be regulated by the 
Parliamentary Assembly."<p> 
 
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina may hold the citizenship of another state if a relevant bilateral 
agreement exists between Bosnia and Herzegovina and that other state, and such dual citizens may vote in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina only if Bosnia and Herzegovina is their "country of residence."<p> 
 
Article II<br> 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and both Entities will ensure respect for "internationally recognized human rights 
and fundamental freedoms," and for those set forth in the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocols, including the right to life, liberty and security 
of person, the right not to be held in slavery or to be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, the right to a fair trial, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, freedom of expression 
and association, freedom of movement and the right to own property.  These provisions of the European 
Convention and its Protocols apply directly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and have priority over all other law.  
To ensure these freedoms, a Human Rights Commission for Bosnia and Herzegovina will be established, as 
detailed in <i>Annex 6</i>.  The Constitution guarantees protection from discrimination, and freedom of 
movement and return for refugees and displaced persons to their "homes of origin," as detailed in 
<i>Annex 7</i>.<p> 
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina will remain or become Party to the international agreements listed in the 
Constitution.  All competent authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina will comply with the orders of the 
International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.<p> 
 
Article III <br> 
Describes the responsibilities and relations between the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the 
Entities.  Among others, the responsibilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina will include foreign policy, 
immigration, refugee and asylum policy and regulation, international and inter-Entity criminal law 
enforcement, and air traffic control.  The Entities will have the right to establish special parallel 
relationships with neighboring states "consistent with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina," and will provide all necessary assistance to the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
The Entities will establish their own civilian law enforcement agencies.  All powers not expressly assigned 
in this Agreement to Bosnia and Herzegovina will be those of the Entities.  The Constitution of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina supersedes those of the Entities.  <b>Within six months of the entry into force of the 
Constitution (i.e. by June 14, 1996) the Entities will begin negotiations with the goal of including other 
matters in the responsibilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as energy resource management and 
economic projects</b>.<p> 
 
Article IV<br> 
The PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY will have two chambers: the House of Peoples, which will have 15 
delegates ("five Croats and five Bosniacs" selected by the House of Peoples  of the Federation, and "five 
Serbs" selected by the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska); and the House of Representatives, 
comprising 42 delegates (two-thirds elected from the territory of the Federation and one-third from the 
Republika Srpska).  <b>Each chamber will be convened in Sarajevo not more than thirty days after its 
respective selection or election (i.e. between July 14, 1996 and October 14, 1996)</b>.<p> 
 
Article V<br> 
The PRESIDENCY will consist of one Croat and one Bosniac from the Federation and one Serb from the 
Republika Srpska, who will be elected directly in each Entity.  The term of the elected members of the 
Presidency will be two years in the first election, and thereafter four years.  The Presidency will nominate a 
Council of Ministers, who will take office upon the approval of the House of Representatives.  Each 
member of the Presidency will have civilian command authority over armed forces, and the Presidency will 
select a STANDING COMMITTEE ON MILITARY MATTERS to coordinate the activities of the armed 
forces.<p> 
 
Article VI<br> 
The CONSTITUTIONAL COURT will have nine members, four selected by the House of Representatives 
of  the Federation and two by the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska.  The remaining three 
members will be selected by the President of the European Court of Human Rights.  Judges initially 
appointed will serve five years.   Judges subsequently appointed will serve until age 70.  A majority will 
constitute a quorum. The Constitutional Court is responsible for upholding the Constitution.<p> 
 
Article VII<br> 
The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina will have sole authority to issue currency and monetary 
policy throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.<p> 
 
Article IX <br> 
No individual who is serving a sentence imposed by the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 
or who is under indictment by the Tribunal and who has failed to comply with an order to appear before 
the Tribunal, may stand as a candidate or hold any appointive, elective, or other public office in the 
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<p>

<a href="/uzbkstan.html"><b>Uzbekistan</b></a>. The new Project on 
Open Society in Central Eurasia will make available 
information and funds to support programs that deal with 
social, cultural, and legal issues, as well as other 
activities that support the development of civil societies.
<p>
For a brief moment in 1995, war-weary, impoverished 
Tajikistan seemed to be lurching toward peace and semi-
stability, but the signs were deceptive, the efforts proved 
in vain.
<p>
The political situation appeared to normalize after widely 
criticized elections confirmed Emomali Rakhmonovs de facto 
presidency. Rakhmonov moved to replace the worst human 
rights abusers in the Ministry of the Interior. Oinikhol 
Bobonazarova, a law professor and outspoken advocate of 
human rights, held under house arrest for 
nearly two years, was allowed to travel abroad. Despite such 
efforts, serious human rights violationsincluding at least 
50 extrajudicial killingspersisted. A report by the 
Committee to Protect Journalists called Tajikistan a land 
without news where independent voices in the press have 
been silencedexiled or killedby the government and its 
supporters.
<p>
In an effort to breach the military and political 
confrontation, President Rakhmonov met the opposition 
leader, Mullah Said Abdullo Nuri, in Kabul, laying the 
groundwork for a breakthrough in August on the principles 
for achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistans civil 
war. In December, UN-sponsored talks got under way in 
<a href="/turkstan.html"><b>Turkmenistan</b></a>, 
only to founder in acrimonious stalemate. 
<p>
In late 1995, hostilities resumed between government and 
opposition  troops, reaching as intense a level as had been 
seen at any time since the victory of the Kulyabi, Russian, 
and Uzbek forces in 1993. 
An attempted coup from within the ruling coalition in 
February 1996 revealed how acutely regional cleavages 
continue to divide Tajiks. The events shook the government 
to its foundations, prompting the resignation of the Prime 
Minister and several other leading politicians.
<p>
Providing Support for Stabilization<br>
During the first part of the year, the Tajikistan Project 
supported activities in line with signs of stabilization, 
funding the continued presence of Human Rights 
Watch/Helsinki, a fact-finding mission by the Committee to 
Protect Journalists, and Internews efforts to develop 
independent television. Law professor Oinikhol Bobonazarova 
organized a first-ever human rights law course at Tajikistan 
State University with the Constitutional and Legislative 
Policy Institute. An OSI grant to Save the Children 
Federation (U.S.) supported an innovative Group Guaranteed 
Loan Scheme aimed at providing small loans to households 
headed by women.
<p>
The Tajikistan Open Forum sponsored debates about regional 
security issues, the peace process, political Islam, and 
human rights at the Council on Foreign Relations, the 
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the 
Brookings Institute. Speakers included the UN Special Envoy 
to Tajikistan and representatives from the Russian Embassy 
and Human Rights Watch, among others. 
<p>
A special Congressional briefing by opposition leader Hajji 
Akbar Turajonzoda, organized by Congressman Rob Andrews, led 
President Clinton to write and comment publicly on the U.S. 
commitment to supporting a peaceful political settlement in 
Tajikistan. The project commissioned a series of position 
papers, aimed at sharpening debate on these matters, for 
publication in 1996.

<h2>Open Society Reconsidered</h2>
<b>By George Soros</b><p>
<h2>"Building Open Societies: Soros Foundations Network 1995 Report on Activities"</h2>
The term "open society," as defined by Karl Popper, refers to a form of social 
organization which recognizes that nobody has a monopoly on the truth, that 
different people have different views and different interests, and that there 
is a need for institutions to protect the rights of all people and allow them 
to live together in peace. In contrast, closed societies such as communism 
claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth and, therefore, feel justified 
in imposing their will on society, persecuting those who disagree and 
dispossessing or even eliminating segments of the population.
<p>
With the collapse of communism, the old distinction between open and closed 
societies has become largely irrelevant. People living in formerly communist 
countries might have aspired to an open society when they suffered the 
repression of a closed society, but now they are far too preoccupied with 
simply surviving to bother with such abstract ideas. Even people living in the 
open societies of the West take the idea for granted. The great majority do not 
see open society as a desirable form of social organization for which they are 
willing to make sacrifices.  They proved as much in refusing to lend a helping 
hand to Eastern Europe when their assistance could have assured that repressive 
nationalist ideologies did not take root.
<p>
To reestablish open society as an ideal worth striving for, we cannot continue 
to define it in black and white terms as the opposite of 
communism. It must be given a more positive definition as a middle ground 
between extremes. Under the old formulation, open society was juxtaposed to 
closed society, and only doctrines which strengthened the authority of the state
against the individual qualified as enemies of open society. I contend that open
society is also threatened by the absence of government and excessive 
instability. The laissez-faire doctrine holds that the common good is best 
served by the uninhibited pursuit of self-interest. But unless the laissez-faire
doctrine is tempered by the recognition of a common good that takes precedence 
over particular interests, it is bound to lead to a breakdown of the 
present system, which, imperfect as it is, can be characterized as a 
universal open society.
<p>
It may sound shocking that I am putting the laissez-faire doctrine in the same 
category as Marxism-Leninism, but they do have an important feature in common: 
both try to justify their claim to the ultimate truth by an appeal to science, 
and both fail to do so.
<p>    
<b>The Bogus Science of Laissez-faire</b><br>
The main scientific underpinning of the laissez-faire ideology is the theory 
that free and competitive markets tend toward equilibrium. Perfect competition, 
as originally formulated, assumed perfect knowledge, homogeneous and easily 
divisible products, and a large enough number of participants so that no single 
participant could influence the market price. The assumption of perfect 
knowledge, proving unsustainable, was replaced by the assumption of perfect 
information and later by the ingenious methodological requirement of 
independently given supply and demand projections. None of these assumptions can
be reconciled with reality, at least as far as the financial markets are 
concerned. The shape of the supply and demand curves cannot be taken as given, 
because both of them incorporate the buyers' and sellers' expectations about 
events that change as soon as they act upon their expectations.
<p>
If the supply and demand curves are not independently given, how are market 
prices determined? The answer is, they are not determined at all. Instead of 
tending toward equilibrium, they continue to fluctuate. In the absence of an 
equilibrium, the contention that free markets lead to the optimum allocation of 
resources loses its justification. The scientific theory turns out to be an 
axiomatic structure whose conclusions are contained in its assumptions and not 
necessarily supported by the empirical evidence. 
<p>
What allows economic theory to be converted into an ideology hostile to open 
society is the assumption of perfect knowledge, first openly stated, then 
disguised as a methodological device. The assertion of perfect knowledge is in 
contradiction to the concept of open society (which is based on the recognition 
that our understanding of our own situation is inherently imperfect). I will 
give three examples of how laissez-faire ideas pose a threat to open society.
<p>
<b><i>Instability</i></b><br>
Economic theory has created an artificial world where the participants' 
preferences and their opportunities are independent of each other and prices 
tend toward an equilibrium that brings these two 
factors into balance. But in real-world financial markets prices play an active 
role in shaping the preferences and opportunities of participants. This 
reflexive interaction renders financial markets inherently unstable. Laissez- 
faire ideology denies the essential instability of financial markets and 
opposes any form of government intervention.
<p>
Instability extends well beyond financial markets: it affects the values that 
guide people in their actions. At the time economic theory was born, people were
guided by a set of moral principles which found expression in behavior that was 
outside the scope of the market mechanism. These principles were deeply rooted 
in tradition, religion, and culture. Market values, however, tend to undermine 
traditional values, arousing antagonisms and conflicts. Advertising, marketing, 
even packaging aims at shaping people's preferences rather than gratifying them.
As the market mechanism has extended its sway, it has become increasingly 
difficult to maintain the fiction that people act on the basis of a given set of
values. 
<p>
Our open society suffers from a deficiency of fundamental values. 
The situation is aggravated by increased mobility and the global scope of our 
open society. When people are firmly rooted in their community, they must pay 
attention to what the community thinks of them; but when they can easily pull up
stakes, they only need to look out for themselves. And in a global open society 
with so many different cultures, religions, and traditions, it is difficult to 
find common ground. Laissez-faire ideology, by accepting self-interest as the 
guiding principle, ignores the malaise and instability inherent in a pervasive 
market orientation.
<p>
<b><i>Social Justice</i></b><br>
By taking the conditions of supply and demand as given and declaring government 
intervention as the ultimate evil, laissez-faire ideology has effectively 
banished income redistribution. I can agree that all attempts at wealth 
redistribution are deficient, but it does not follow that no attempt should be 
made. Wealth does accumulate in the hands of its owners, and, if there is no 
mechanism for redistribution, the inequities can become intolerable. The claim 
that the accumulation of wealth is in accordance with the survival of the 
fittest is negated by the fact that wealth is passed on by inheritance.
<p>
In any case, there is something wrong with making the survival of the fittest 
the guiding principle of a civilized society. This social Darwinism is based on 
an outmoded theory of evolution just as the equilibrium theory in economics is 
based on Newtonian physics. 
The principle which guides the evolution of the species is mutation, and 
mutation works in a much more sophisticated way. The species and their 
environment are interactive, and one species serves as part of the environment 
for the other species. There is a two-way feedback mechanism, similar to 
reflexivity in history, only in history the mechanism is driven not by mutation 
but by misconceptions.
<p>    
<b><i>International Relations</i></b><br>
Laissez-faire ideology also accepts the survival of the fittest as a 
suitable guiding principle for international relations. International | 
institutions and other forms of cooperation are just as much frowned upon as 
governmental intervention in economic activities. There is irony in banishing 
the state from the economy but enshrining it as the ultimate source of 
authority in international relations. Laissez-faire 
ideology is closely allied with another spurious science, geopolitics: States 
have no principles, only interests, and those interests are determined by 
fundamentals such as geographical location. This deterministic approach is 
another relic of the nineteenth century view of scientific method. 
<p>
<b>Formidable Obstacles to Open Society</b><br>
Open society is based on the recognition that our understanding of the world is 
inherently imperfect. What is imperfect can be improved. Open society opens the 
vista for limitless progress: advances in science and technology, social and 
political arrangements, culture and quality of life. There are, however, 
formidable difficulties in the way of establishing open society as an organizing
principle.
<p>
First, the concept of open society has the appearance of a paradox: if the 
ultimate truth is not attainable, how can we accept as an article 
of faith that our fallibility is the ultimate truth? The need for articles 
of faith arises exactly because our understanding is imperfect. If we enjoyed 
perfect knowledge, there would be no need for beliefs.
<p>  
Beliefs ought to serve to shape our lives, not to make us abide by a given set 
of rules. If we recognize that our beliefs are expressions of 
our choices, not of the ultimate truth, we are more likely to tolerate other 
beliefs and to revise our own in the light of our experiences. Most people tend 
to identify their beliefs with the ultimate truth. Indeed, that identification 
often serves to define their own identity. 
A belief in our fallibility is a poor substitute. It is a highly sophisticated 
concept, much more difficult to work with than mere primitive beliefs, such as 
my country (or my family or my self-interest) right 
or wrong. 
<p>
If the idea of our fallibility is so hard to take, what makes it appealing? Only
the results it produces. It is best justified by success, and, indeed, open 
societies tend to be more prosperous, more innovative, more stimulating than 
closed ones. But success is an inadequate basis for holding a belief because 
being successful is not identical with being right. The cult of success can 
become a source of instability in open society, because it can undermine our 
sense of right and wrong. That is happening in our society today. Our sense of 
right and wrong is endangered by our preoccupation with success, as measured by 
money. Anything goes, as long as you can get away with it. Moreover, success 
tends to be self-reinforcing in both directions. The concept of open society 
needs to be more firmly grounded. We need a commitment to fundamental values, 
even if we know full well that all fundamental values are fallible. 
<p>  
But that is not all. Even if the concept of open society were universally 
accepted, that would not be sufficient to ensure that it will prevail. Open 
society merely provides a framework within which different views about social 
and political issues can be reconciled, it does not offer a firm view on those 
issues. If it did, it would not be an open society. This means that people must 
hold other beliefs in addition to their belief in open society. Only in a 
closed society does the concept of open society provide a sufficient basis for 
political action.
<p>
Yet another difficulty in adopting open society as a goal is that it is usually 
best approached by indirection. That is what my foundations are doing: they are 
fostering education, culture, pluralistic media, civil society, economic reform,
and so on; they are not propagating open society as such. Society is more likely
to become open as the unintended consequences of conflicting views and interests
than as the outcome of a conscious design. Conflicting views and interests will 
produce an open society only if there are institutions dedicated to the common 
good, allowing people with different views and interests to live together in 
peace. In mature democracies, such institutions are firmly established, but in 
our global open society, they are very rudimentary and inadequate.
<p>
At present, we enjoy the benefits of a global open society, but we 
lack the institutional framework necessary for its preservation.
The international community has demonstrated its inability to cope with the new 
types of conflict emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the region 
where the majority of my foundations are active, I can sense a tendency to 
closure. As the conflicts escalate, the European Union may turn itself into a 
fortress and the United States may retreat into isolationism.
<p>
I do not have a ready-made solution to the crisis at hand. All I am 
trying to show is that there is a problem. I blame the prevailing laissez-faire 
attitude which believes that the unhampered pursuit of self-interest will take 
care of the common good. I believe the concept of an open society, which needs 
to be deliberately fostered in order to
prevail, provides a better guide to action. If we agree on that point,
we are ready to confront the problem. We may legitimately disagree on the course
of action, but at least we shall not stand idly by as the free world 
disintegrates in the same way as the communist world did.

<h2>Background</h2>
The communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union had a profound influence on the arts and culture of the region. Under communism, artists had to find favor with the state in order to ensure support for their work, resulting in a culture in which freedom of expression was severely restricted. Artists who attempted to express ideas incompatible with the regime were forced underground, forming an important dissident voice. Today, arts and culture, while free of state and party control, continue to suffer from a dearth of funding as governments and private funders concentrate on more urgent priorities in the transformation process. The Soros Foundations, however, believe that nurturing the diverse voices of a country's culture, from the artists to the audiences, is as important to the creation of a strong and vibrant open society as, for example, the building of market economies and independent media.

<h2>Soros Centers for the Contemporary Arts</h2>

The largest arts and culture initiative funded by the Soros Foundations is a network of <b><a href="osiart.html">Soros Centers for the Contemporary Arts (SCCA)</a></b>, which are devoted to the development of the visual arts in Central and Eastern Europe and to the integration of the region's arts communities into the international arts world. The SCCA network, which includes 15 countries in Central and Eastern Europe, increases the international art world's access to the arts of the region by promoting its artists, arts professionals, and organizations through local and international cooperation.<p> The centers select modern and contemporary visual artists for comprehensive documentation and organize exhibitions of local contemporary art. 
The SCCA act as resource centers for information on foreign grants, scholarships, arts programs, competitions, and exhibitions, and organize press conferences to publicize international opportunities in the arts. A number of international foundations and institutions use the SCCA to channel information, projects, and finances to local arts groups, thereby facilitating collaboration with other reputable worldwide arts organizations. The centers also select Soros grantees in each country.

<h2>ArtsLink</h2>

Another program, <b><a href="osiart.html">ArtsLink</a></b>, enables artists and arts managers from Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and the Baltics to work with U.S. artists and arts organizations by funding exchanges, residencies, and collaborative projects. The program in the U.S. offers a five-week residency in an established, nonprofit arts organization, incorporating the visiting professional into the host organization's activities and providing interaction with local artists and arts groups. ArtsLink allows artists and arts managers to exchange ideas, expertise, and technical innovations about their work while training in a variety of U.S. museums, galleries, and studio spaces. 
A public-private initiative, ArtsLink is a partnership of the SCCA network, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Trust for Mutual Understanding, and the Citizen Exchange Council.<p>In addition to their participation in these regional programs, national Soros foundations provide major funding for arts projects such as cultural journals, art books, drama and music productions, and visual arts exhibits. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, and Yugoslavia, efforts to maintain and revive arts and culture also serve as a way of rebuilding a sense of community while bringing the area's plight to world attention.
