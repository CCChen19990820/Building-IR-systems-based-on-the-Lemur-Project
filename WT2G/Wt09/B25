HEADLINE: Press Conference with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Tansu<br>
Ciller, Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister - December 18, 1996<br>
SOURCE:  Official Kremlin Int'l News Broadcast, December 18, 1996 <br>
<p>
Moderator: A memorandum is being signed between the government the Russian<br>
Federation and the government of the Turkish Republic on cooperation in<br>
combating terrorism. The memorandum is being signed by the Foreign Affairs<br>
Minister of the Russian Federation Yevgeny Maximovich Primakov and<br>
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of the Turkish Republic Tansu Ciller. <br>
<p>
Tarasov: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The negotiations have ended<br>
between the Russian Foreign vc Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the Vice-Premier<br>
and the Foreign Minister of the Turkish Republic Mrs. Tansu Ciller. Mr.<br>
Ciller is in Moscow on an official visit. At the start of the press<br>
conference with your permission I will give her the floor. <br>
<p>
Ciller: The Turkish delegation are deeply moved by the affection and the warm<br>
atmosphere we have encountered in the friendly country of Russia. We felt all<br>
this during the talks with Mr. Primakov and in the talks earlier with mayor<br>
of Moscow and with the Chairman of the Government, Chernomyrdin. And I think<br>
the relationship between the peoples of our countries is the same, and for<br>
this we are grateful to the Russian Federation. I also believe that I am<br>
entitled to conveying to you similar feelings from the Turkish people. <br>
<p>
The relations between our two countries located in a large region which is<br>
living through radical change are based on cooperation and partnership and I<br>
am convinced that after our Moscow contacts, after this visit, we will open a<br>
new door in our relations and pass to a new level in our cooperation. We note<br>
with much satisfaction the extent to which our points of view come close on<br>
regional affairs. This is an excellent earnest for our future cooperation.<br>
Also, both sides confirmed at the talks their adherence to the principles of<br>
territorial integrity and declared for preserving the territorial integrity<br>
both of Russia and Turkey. Along with this we also signed a memorandum, as it<br>
was already announced, on cooperation between the governments of the two<br>
countries in the area of combating terrorism. <br>
<p>
We also are satisfied that the settlement of the Chechen problem in the<br>
Russian Federation is based on precisely these principles and is being<br>
implemented precisely within this framework. <br>
<p>
Also, we achieved unity of views in the question of the need to preserve the<br>
territorial integrity of absolutely all countries of the region and also the<br>
settlement of regional conflicts precisely on the basis of this principle,<br>
and this includes the preservation of the integrity of Azerbaijan. Now we can<br>
step up the dialogue between the two countries on the broadest range of<br>
issues, we will be able to extend the areas of cooperation and at the level<br>
of the two ministries we will be able to discuss specific issues and start<br>
resolving the outstanding problems between us immediately. The similarity of<br>
opinions between the two parties on regional problems and on conflict<br>
situations in our sensitive region provide an excellent foundation for<br>
partnership which we are seeking in our relations together. Such a foundation<br>
for our relations and our cooperation is also provided by the atmosphere of<br>
confidence that prevailed during our negotiations today. Both parties noted<br>
in the course of the negotiations that the two countries have enormous<br>
potential for trade and economic cooperation and a large trade. Turkey is the<br>
second largest trade and economic partner for Russia and similarly, Russia is<br>
Turkey's second trading partner after Germany. The advanced character of our<br>
cooperation will lead to partnership in our relations if we continue to work<br>
in the same way. <br>
<p>
Today we worked well in the course of our contacts on specific projects. We<br>
touched upon the question of encouraging the activities of small and medium<br>
businesses and of course, we discussed major projects in the field of energy<br>
and other sectors. And in the course of these contacts we have identified<br>
many areas for joint effort. But, of course, it will take great effort and<br>
much labor to further realize these projects. <br>
Within this framework we also discussed issues that were formerly touched<br>
upon by the Chernomyrdin government -- issues pertaining to cooperation in<br>
the energy and industry sectors. In this context, we decided to urgently<br>
convene working groups and step up their activity in respective fields, in<br>
particular, as early as tomorrow our energy group will hold a meeting -- I<br>
have taken a decision to this effect. <br>
<p>
We proceed from the need for cooperation and partnership with Russia on such<br>
issues as stepping up gas supplies from Russia to Turkey, oil supplies from<br>
the Caspian basin. At any rate, we will continue to work and the first<br>
concrete step will be made tomorrow.  Of course, the friendly and sincere<br>
dialogue between our countries will be continued on all issues, including the<br>
most sensitive ones for our country. <br>
<p>
I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank on behalf of all<br>
the members of our delegation Moscow's mayor Luzhkov and Chairman of the<br>
Government Chernomyrdin, and my dear colleague Primakov for the cordial<br>
reception we met here and for the warm attitude we all felt here, and also I<br>
would like you to express my best regards to the Russian people. <br>
<p>
Primakov: Thank you very much. The visit by Madam Ciller to Russia is not yet<br>
over, but it can already be said that it has produced many results, that it<br>
has been a very useful visit. It may become a very important visit in terms<br>
of the development of relations between our two countries. <br>
<p>
Combining here are both objective and subjective moments. The objective<br>
moments are that we are two closely located countries, two bordering<br>
countries that should live in peace, that should cooperate in the<br>
strengthening of regional stability, in the development of bilateral ties in<br>
the political and economic spheres. The subjective moment, I will not conceal<br>
that, is that it is very pleasant, greatly pleasant to do business with such<br>
a partner who clearly sets questions, who clearly provides answers to them,<br>
who conducts many conversations in a very trusting manner. <br>
<p>
We have arrived at the conclusion that a substantial economic foundation has<br>
been created for our relations. Madam Ciller is very correctly raising the<br>
question of the need to expand and strengthen this foundation. But now we are<br>
also saying that it is necessary to build a political superstructure, and by<br>
saying this I mean political consultations on a whole number of questions<br>
where our positions either coincide or are close. Today we, so to say, took<br>
stock of these problems. In the regional aspect this includes, of course, the<br>
liquidation of existing conflicts. We arrived at the conclusion that our<br>
positions are very close in respect of the liquidation, settlement of the<br>
Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The way out is in the self-determination of<br>
Nagorny Karabakh in conditions of recognition of the territorial integrity of<br>
Azerbaijan. We have agreed to act in parallel in this area but the goal is<br>
one -- settlement. Our views coincide in many ways on the situation in and<br>
around Iraq. We come out for the territorial integrity of Iraq with<br>
autonomous rights for the population in the north. Russia supports the desire<br>
of Turkey to resolve the issues in the relations with Syria. <br>
<p>
Finally, we discussed our bilateral relations at length. Perhaps, I should<br>
have started with this. Among the specific issues were the document on<br>
cooperation in combating terrorism which has already been mentioned by my<br>
colleague. An agreement in principle was reached on opening Russian General<br>
Consulate in Ismir and a Turkish Consulate in Novorosiisk. We will continue<br>
negotiations on dispensing with visas for those who travel under diplomatic<br>
and service passports and on abandoning quotas for the number of personnel in<br>
the diplomatic and consular offices. <br>
<p>
We have exchanged opinions on the situation in Europe, on the architecture of<br>
European security. Despite the continued existence of a certain difference in<br>
approaches here, despite the continuation of the differences that are seen in<br>
our positions, we are unanimous in that it is necessary to leave Europe<br>
without lines of division. <br>
<p>
The talks with Madam Ciller were very useful and pleasant ones. Like Turkey,<br>
and Madam Ciller has just said this, we will work to raise our relations to<br>
the level of a partnership relationship. Thank you. <br>
<p>
Moderator: Thank you, we will have questions now. As always, please introduce<br>
yourself and use the microphone that is in the center of the hall. <br>
<p>
Q: ORT. When you told us about your negotiations, you kept saying "despite<br>
certain differences, despite some differences in views". Can you, please,<br>
specify what these differences are? <br>
<p>
Primakov: Excuse me, but you must have not listened attentively enough. We<br>
emphasized more the identity or closeness of approaches to various questions.<br>
<p>
<p>
If we are to speak about different approaches, I mentioned only questions<br>
connected with the expansion of NATO. But I would also like to stress that<br>
both Russia and Turkey agree that no actions should disrupt the unity of<br>
Europe and bring about the appearance of some new divisive lines. <br>
<p>
I am sorry, but I cannot give anything of a sensational nature to ORT<br>
television. (Laughter.) <br>
<p>
Q: Could you provide any stuff for a sensation to Radio 1 on the role of<br>
personality in history and on how well you felt speaking with Mrs. Ciller? <br>
<p>
Primakov: In this respect I stick to Plekhanov's view, who believed that a<br>
personality can play a tremendous role in history. These today's negotiations<br>
came as another confirmation of this idea. <br>
<p>
Q: Interfax. I have a question both to Mrs. Ciller and Minister Primakov. My<br>
question to Mrs. Ciller is as follows: could NATO expansion proceed without<br>
Turkey's consent, in light of the close Turkey-Russia relationship? And a<br>
question to Yevgeny Maximovich: taking into account this very special<br>
relationship, could Turkey play the role of a go-between or a liaison officer<br>
in the forthcoming negotiations between Russia and NATO about drafting an<br>
agreement on special relationship? <br>
<p>
Ciller: We are certain that NATO expansion should proceed very carefully. And<br>
we flatly oppose the emergence of any new dividing lines in Europe. We oppose<br>
the emergence of any new dividing lines in Europe, and naturally, we are<br>
naturally aware of this and we know how sensitive Russia is to the plans of<br>
NATO enlargement. In the course of the negotiations the Russian Federation<br>
brought this concern to us in great detail. We are aware of all the details<br>
of Russian position and we have the respect for this position. Based on this<br>
information, we will continue dialogue with the Russian Federation which we<br>
hope will assume the form of cooperation in this field as well. In any case,<br>
we will never allow NATO to pose a threat to the Russian Federation. I am<br>
stating this clearly and with all responsibility. Processes of transformation<br>
cannot take place without the consent of Russia and without taking into<br>
account its interests. <br>
<p>
Primakov: Thank you. I will answer my part of the question. We have good<br>
experience of interacting with Turkey in addressing a number of specific<br>
issues, but issues that are very important. For example, we held very<br>
fruitful negotiations on flank limitations under the Conventional Forces in<br>
Europe Treaty. <br>
<p>
We will continue cooperation in this area in the future. As for consultations<br>
with NATO, we have been offered to conduct them with the Secretary General<br>
and with the persons who represent NATO as an organization. And while<br>
preserving our negative stand on the expansion of NATO, we have accepted the<br>
offer. <br>
<p>
Q: With the signing of the agreement on cooperation on combating terrorism,<br>
can it be said that from now on, the Workers' Party of Kurdistan will no<br>
longer be able to act on the territory of the Russian Federation? It's a<br>
question for Mr. Primakov. <br>
<p>
Primakov: Although I am not responsible for the activities of Workers' Party<br>
of Kurdistan, I will answer that question. We are against terrorist activity<br>
and we repeatedly stated this. There can be no support for terrorist<br>
activities on the part of democratic Russia. And you can rest assured that<br>
our territory cannot be made available as a base for any forms of terrorist<br>
activities. <br>
<p>
Q: NTV. Alexander Israyelyan. To further the theme raised by the Turkish<br>
colleague, fighting terrorism was discussed here, but both Turkey and Russia<br>
have two hot spots they try to bring tranquility to, I mean -- (inaudible) --<br>
Chechnya. On the other hand, there is the problem of the Kurds in Turkey. --<br>
(Inaudible) -- Mrs. Ciller, could you tell us: have you met with support from<br>
the Russian leadership for your activities against the Kurds in Turkey? <br>
<p>
Primakov: This question was asked in continuation of the Turkish journalist's<br>
question. <br>
<p>
Ciller: This is a case of journalists' solidarity. -- (Laughter) -- I have<br>
already stated that as regards Russia's territorial integrity, during our<br>
talks we have repeatedly stated our commitment to this principle. While<br>
discussing Chechnya-related matters, we stated that we stand for settling<br>
this problem within the framework of Russia's territorial integrity and that<br>
we consider this to be Russia's internal matter. Mr. Primakov has also<br>
expressed similar views on the activities of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan<br>
and the events in northern Iraq. I think that this similarity of views will<br>
play an important role in strengthening the atmosphere of confidence between<br>
the two countries. <br>
<p>
Moderator: Two final questions. <br>
<p>
Q: Mr. Primakov, I would like to show solidarity for my fellow journalists<br>
and ask you whether you found satisfactory the explanations of the Turkish<br>
side on Chechnya and whether you are satisfied with the position of the<br>
Turkish Republic on Chechnya? Did it dispel the doubts and fears that the<br>
Russian side had on that score? And a small question. Russia as a member of<br>
the U.N. Security Council and an active participant in the Cyprus settlement,<br>
how does this square with the supply of offensive weapons to the southern<br>
part of the island? These reports have brought a mixed reaction of the<br>
Turkish public opinion? <br>
<p>
Primakov: On the first question, we are certainly very satisfied with the<br>
position formulated by Turkey on Chechnya.  Certainly, there are some<br>
organizations of a public nature on the territory of Turkey which take a<br>
different stand. But we are very pleased with the official position of Turkey<br>
on the Chechen issue. <br>
<p>
On your second question, I would say that I do not consider the air defense<br>
systems whose shipments are contemplated to be offensive weapons. <br>
<p>
Q: A question for Mr. Primakov. You have mentioned Karabakh settlement and<br>
the need for the self-determination of Karabakh, so that the citizens of<br>
Karabakh should themselves decide the fate of that area. Should the Azeris<br>
who had to leave Karabakh earlier be involved in the process of such<br>
self-determination, that is, those who are in fact refugees? And the second<br>
question. You mentioned the territorial integrity of Iraq. The need of<br>
preserving this integrity is recognized by all. You also mentioned the<br>
certain autonomy that should be granted in the north of Iraq to the peoples<br>
that live there. When you mentioned autonomy, did you refer only to Kurds or<br>
you meant also other peoples, including Turkmen? <br>
<p>
Primakov: I will answer your questions. A separate document was issued in<br>
Lisbon on behalf of the current chairman of the OSCE, a document on Nagorny<br>
Karabakh, on the conflict in the Nagorny Karabakh. This document contained<br>
three provisions that were agreed upon by the members of the Minsk Group. The<br>
first is the recognition of the territorial integrity of both Azerbaijan and<br>
Armenia. The second -- self-determination of the people of Nagorny Karabakh<br>
on the basis of an agreement and within the framework of Azerbaijan. The<br>
third moment -- security, security ensured for all sides in the conflict. I<br>
believe that this is the basis for the settlement. <br>
<p>
Concerning the second question. We are against a situation, in the event of<br>
the formation of an autonomy in the north of Iraq, in which rights would not<br>
be enjoyed by the other peoples living in the north of Iraq, not only Kurds,<br>
but also Arabs, Turkomans, Assyrians, etc. <br>
<p>
This means that it is necessary to find such a decision that would ensure<br>
observance of human rights, ensure observance of the right to<br>
self-determination, which does not necessarily has to express itself in the<br>
form of cessation. In this case, as it was stressed by Madam Ciller, we come<br>
out for the solution of all these questions within the framework of Iraq.<br>
Thank you. <br>
<p>
Moderator: Thank you, the press conference is over, good-bye. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: President Nazarbayev unveils independence monument <br>
SOURCE: Kazakh Television first channel, Alma-Ata, in Kazakh 1330 gmt 16 Dec<br>
96 <br>
<p>
The fifth anniversary of Kazakhstan's independence was marked when President<br>
Nursultan Nazarbayev unveiled a monument to Kazakh independence in Alma-Ata's<br>
central Square of the Republic on 16th December, Kazakh TV reported. <br>
<p>
Speaking at the ceremony, Nazarbayev said the legacy of those who have fought<br>
for Kazakh independence since the days of the Kazakh khans must be realized<br>
in the form of a law-governed state. " Kazakhstan's people and the Kazakhs<br>
have been fighting for this independence for vc many years. Now we are<br>
building a new law-based state based on equality of rights. We must not turn<br>
away from this road," he said <br>
<p>
He also said that reforms need time to bear fruit: "None of the world' s<br>
states has managed to carry out such huge reforms as Kazakhstan has achieved<br>
over the past five years [since independence]. We need patience and<br>
solidarity." He attributed problems with paying wages and pensions on time to<br>
the Soviet legacy of bad debts between enterprises, and noted that they are<br>
common to all former Soviet states. <br>
<p>
Nazarbayev also praised the absence of interethnic or religious strife in the<br>
country: "Thank God we have no Karabakh, Tajikistan or Chechnya here. We must<br>
preserve these kindly relations in this way." <br>
<p>
Among the freedom fighters of the past he singled out the Kazakh khans'fight<br>
for Kazakh statehood in the 14th-15th centuries and their struggle against<br>
the Dzhungarian-Kalmyk Mongol invaders, and the Kazakh nationalist and<br>
peasant victims of the Stalinist purges and farm collectivization in the<br>
1930s. He also spoke about the damage wrought by the Soviet Union to the soil<br>
of Kazakhstan through nuclear tests and the destruction of the Aral Sea, but<br>
expressed confidence in the ability of the people of the Kazakhstan to<br>
overcome this. <br>
<p>
Nazarbayev thanked those responsible for the monument, which is a 28-metre<br>
high gold-coloured column crowned with a Kazakh legendary warrior figure atop<br>
a winged snow leopard. <br>
<p>
Nazarbayev and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived in Kazakhstan<br>
on 15th December, laid wreaths at the foot of the monument, the television<br>
said. <br>

THE MEDICS WERE MURDERED BY RACKETEERS? <br>
<p>
By Boris Vinogradov<br>
<p>
The entire personnel of the international Red Cross mission to Chechnya  --<br>
35 people -- has left Chechnya. Only five of them remain in Grozny to assist<br>
the investigation into the murder of their six colleagues in Novye Atagi.   <br>
<p>
Some important details preceding the bloody terrorist act have become known.<br>
Speaking before journalists in Oslo a representative of the Norwegian Red<br>
Cross Terier Engevik expressed his confidence that this hideous crime was<br>
committed by Chechen bandits who had previously tried to take hospital in<br>
Novye Atagi under their control. Not once they tried to impose on hospital<br>
administration their own people for protection.  Terrier Engevik was in<br>
Chechnya last August when this field hospital was donated to the people of<br>
Chechnya by the government of Norway.  According to him, armed bandits<br>
intruded to the area of hospital several times before in attempts to dictate<br>
their will in administrative issues, namely on hiring guards who are well<br>
paid in hard currency by l;ocal standards. During the latest intrusion<br>
bandits stole the satellite telephone and a container with medicine.  <br>
<p>
The terrorist attack in Novye Atagi caused an uproar of indignation abroad<br>
and for the first time in history international organizations state that<br>
they are determined to stop activities in this "zone of extreme risk."<br>
Although they are mandated to work in such zones, in this particular case<br>
"we are dealing with the most brazen and despicable form of gangsterism and<br>
we will not put up with it," stated UNHCR representative Sylvana Foa. She<br>
said that UNHCR made a decision to recall all field workers from Chechnya.<br>
The UN aid to Chechen refugee families in Dagestan, Ingushetia and North<br>
Ossetia is suspended. "Doctors without borders" organization with<br>
headquarters in Paris is stopping activities in Chechnya to demonstrate<br>
solidarity with their colleagues from the ICRC.   President of the ICRC<br>
Conellio Sommaruga issued a call for international community to create a<br>
special tribunal for the trial of bandits who should not stay unpunished. (end) <br>

<p>
WHO WAS INTERESTED IN THIS? <br>
<p>
By Boris Vinogradov<br>
<p>
Most analysts who are looking into motives of the crime in Novye Atagi<br>
instead of the question "Who did that?" are asking the question "Who want to<br>
upset elections?"  This question immediately assigns political motives to<br>
this crime.  Moreover, a conclusion is implied that murderers shall be<br>
sought among those groups in Chechnya which have no chances to win elections<br>
but would want to preserve the status quo of post-war authority and<br>
influence in Chechnya.  This scenario is most popular among those who<br>
observe Chechnya from outside and try to make prognosis about outcome of<br>
elections.  With this approach quite a few groups in Chechnya, if not all,<br>
can be held under suspicion as none of them feels quite confident about<br>
results and the closer the date (January 27) the stronger tensions among<br>
them and the stronger chances for new provocations.  There is a wide-spread<br>
opinion that upsetting elections and introduction of a special regime<br>
similar to an extraordinary one would be in the interests both field<br>
commanders who are reluctant to say farewell to arms and such leading<br>
figures as Shamil Basayev and Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.  From the other hand<br>
side postponement of elections may provoke open clashes among various<br>
Chechen groupings and channel developments to a river bed which is against<br>
interests of current leaders of Ichkeria and federal authorities.   <br>
<p>
Some other experts on Chechnya maintain a different view. They see the main<br>
reason for the crime in Novye Atagi in the fact that the balk of Chechen<br>
population is well armed. Emil Payin, Advisor to the President, does not<br>
rule out recurrence of similar actions in the foreseeable future. Moreover,<br>
this problem will become even more acute in future.  Even if elections are<br>
held, the legitimacy of elected power will always be challenged by<br>
legitimacy of arms. Emil Pain dismissed the version on political nature of<br>
this crime. He thinks that elections cannot be canceled due to any<br>
provocations. However, one cannot help note that these murders were<br>
committed right after Raduyev's band took Russian policemen hostages on<br>
Dagestani border. Raduyev tried to present this incident as a provocation of<br>
Russian special services. It is not by accident, says Payin, that some<br>
people in Grozny are implying that Moscow was involved in the blood-bath at<br>
international hospital. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, reports from Grozny state that Interior Ministry bodies and the<br>
Offices of Prosecutor and National Security have developed their own version<br>
of the crime, but it is not clear what that version is.  Some light on this<br>
event is shed by eye-witness accounts. Thus, one of hospital guards stated<br>
that there were 10 terrorists, they intruded to hospital area through the<br>
fence and they had special arms with silencers.  (end) <br>

Common Declaration <br>
of Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Karekin I<br>
<p>
Source: Revd Fr Ronald G. Roberson, CSP, Roman Catholic Secretariat for <br>
Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs, 3211 Fourth Street, NE, <br>

<p>
<p>
<p>
As they bring to a close their solemn meeting which they are deeply <br>
convinced has been of particular significance for the on-going relations <br>
between the Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church, His <br>
Holiness John Paul II, Bishop of Rome and Pope of the Catholic Church, <br>
and His Holiness Karekin I, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All <br>
Armenians, give humble thanks to the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who <br>
has enabled them to meet in His love for prayer together, for a fruitful <br>
discussion of their common desire to search out a more perfect unity in <br>
the Holy Spirit, and for an exchange of views about how their Churches <br>
may give a more effective witness to the Gospel in a world approaching a <br>
new millennium in the history of salvation.<br>
    Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Karekin I recognize the deep <br>
spiritual communion which already unites them and the bishops, clergy <br>
and lay faithful of their Churches.  It is a communion which finds its <br>
roots in the common faith in the holy and life-giving Trinity proclaimed <br>
by the apostles and transmitted down the centuries by the many Church <br>
Fathers, Church doctors, bishops, priests, and martyrs who have followed <br>
them.  They rejoice in the fact that recent developments of ecumenical <br>
relationships and theological discussions carried out in the spirit of <br>
Christian love and fellowship have dispelled many misunderstandings <br>
inherited from the controversies and dissensions of the past.  Such <br>
dialogues and encounters have prepared a healthy situation of mutual <br>
understanding and recovery of the deeper spiritual communion based on <br>
the common faith in the Holy Trinity that they have been given through <br>
the Gospel of Christ and in the Holy Tradition of the Church.<br>
    They particularly welcome the great advance that their Churches have <br>
registered in their common search for their unity in Christ, the word of <br>
God made flesh.  Perfect God as to His divinity, perfect man as to His <br>
humanity, His divinity is united in Him to His humanity in the Person of <br>
the Only-begotten Son of God, in a union which is real, perfect, without <br>
confusion, without alteration, without division, without any form of <br>
separation.  <br>
    The reality of this common faith in Jesus Christ and in the same <br>
succession of apostolic ministry has at times been obscured or ignored.  <br>
Linguistic, cultural and political factors have immensely contributed <br>
towards the theological divergences that have found expression in their <br>
terminology of formulating their doctrines.  His Holiness John Paul II <br>
and His Holiness Karekin I have expressed their determined conviction <br>
that because of the fundamental common faith in God and in Jesus Christ, <br>
the controversies and unhappy divisions which sometimes have followed <br>
upon the divergent ways in expressing it, as a result of the present <br>
declaration, should not continue to influence the life and witness of <br>
the Church today.  <br>
    They humbly declare before God their sorrow for these controversies <br>
and dissensions and their determination to remove from the mind and <br>
memory of their Churches the bitterness, mutual recriminations and even <br>
hatred which have sometimes manifested themselves in the past, and may <br>
even today cast a shadow over the truly fraternal and genuinely <br>
Christian relations between leaders and the faithful of both Churches, <br>
especially as these have developed in recent times.<br>
    The communion already existing between the two Churches and the hope <br>
for and commitment to the recovery of full communion between them should <br>
become factors of motivation for further contact, more regular and <br>
substantial dialogue, leading to a greater degree of mutual <br>
understanding and recovery of the communality of their faith and <br>
service.<br>
    Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Karekin I give their blessing and <br>
pastoral support to the further development of existing contacts and to <br>
new manifestations of that dialogue of charity between their respective <br>
pastors and faithful which will bear fruit in the fields of common <br>
action on the pastoral, catechetical, social and intellectual levels.<br>
    Such a dialogue is particularly imperative in these present times <br>
when the Churches are faced with new challenges to their witness to the <br>
Gospel of Jesus Christ arising out of the rapidly changing situations in <br>
the modern world so deeply affected by an extreme secularistic and <br>
secularizing pace of life and culture.  It requires closer <br>
collaboration, mutual confidence and a greater degree of concern for <br>
common action.  It presumes and requires an attitude of service which is <br>
not self-seeking and which is characterized by a mutual respect for the <br>
fidelity of the faithful to their own churches and Christian traditions.<br>
    They appeal to their clergy and laity to carry out more actively and <br>
effectively their full cooperation in all fields of diaconia, and to <br>
become agents of reconciliation, peace and justice, struggling for the <br>
true recognition of human rights and dedicating themselves to the <br>
support of all those who are suffering and are in spiritual and material <br>
need throughout the world.  <br>
    John Paul II and Karekin I express a particular pastoral concern for <br>
the Armenian people, both those living in their historic motherland <br>
where freedom and independence were once more recovered and <br>
reestablished recently through the creation of the new Independent State <br>
of Armenia, those living in Nagorno Karabagh in need of permanent peace, <br>
and those who live in a state of world-wide diaspora.  Amid upheavals <br>
and tragedies, especially during this century, these people have <br>
remained faithful to the apostolic faith, the faith of martyrs and <br>
confessors, the faith of millions of unnamed believers for whom Jesus <br>
Christ, the Son of God incarnate and Saviour of the world, has been the <br>
foundation of their hope, and whose Spirit has guided them across the <br>
centuries.  As they approach the seventeenth centenary of the official <br>
establishment of the Church in Armenia, may they receive the special <br>
blessings of the Triune God for peace with justice and for a renewed <br>
dedication to witnessing faithfully to the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>

Press-conference of Terry Adams<br>
<p>
Caspian Oil Consortium: =93it is like running the UN=94<br>
<p>
By Georgii Dvali and Andrei Smirnov<br>
<p>
Recent intensive consultations among participants of the Caspian Oil<br>
Consortium indicate that a final decision on the main oil route is not far.<br>
At a briefing for a close group of journalists (your =FF correspondent was<br>
among them) during his recent visit to Tbilisi the chief of the operations<br>
committee of the consortium, Terry Adams presented a detailed commercial<br>
feasibility study of various proposed routes for oil transportation.  But<br>
the problems that the =93project of the century=94 is facing are not only<br>
commercial ones.=20<br>
<p>
=93project of the century=94 that was the name that President of Azerbaijan<br>
Heidar Aliyev gave to the plan to develop oil resources of the Caspian shelf<br>
two years ago. Then it sounded pretentious. But now, according to Adams, it<br>
is clear that the project is truly turning into one of the largest projects<br>
of the century. =93I have always a feeling that I am running at least a UN,=<br>
=94<br>
said the chief of the consortium. Two years ago everything was different.<br>
=93We were assigned to develop a relatively simple project and to conclude=<br>
 all<br>
necessary contracts in two and a half years.=94 The budget was planned to be<br>
$600 million. Now everything has changed. Initially, Adams claims,<br>
participants of the consortium did not plan to finance the construction of<br>
northern route (via Russia) and Western route (via Georgia) pipelines. Now<br>
investments exceed $2 billion. The program of financing until 1998 envisions<br>
spending of: $220 million for infrastructure $630 million for a terminal in<br>
Sangachal, $40 million for restoration of the northern pipeline, $300<br>
million for the terminal in Supsa (Adjaria, Georgia), $60 million for<br>
pipeline service,  $26 million for the construction of the second platform. =<br>
 =20<br>
<p>
This project will provide access to new oil deposit which, according to<br>
Adams, are of =93super-gigantic scale.=94  The confirmed deposits amount to=<br>
 17.5<br>
billion barrels. These deposits are equal to all deposits in the Northern<br>
Sea. Deposits that are not yet confirmed but are based on some solid<br>
geological surveys indicate that Caspian deposits are twice as large as<br>
those of the Northern Sea.=20<br>
<p>
Adams reminded us that the length of the northern route is 1,400 km and only<br>
167 km are on the territory of Azerbaijan. The rest of the pipeline will go<br>
via Russian territory, including Chechnya, to Novorossiisk. Adams=92s<br>
statement that despite the recent war in Chechnya and tensions in the region<br>
the Russian section of the pipeline has been fully restored is sensational.<br>
The pipeline was cleaned of water and dirt and its first section was tested.<br>
The Azeri side has claimed that the first supplies of oil can begin in the<br>
end of first quarter of 1997.  The capacity of that pipeline is 5 million<br>
tons of oil per year and it shall be sufficient for the oil extracted from<br>
the first platform.=20<br>
<p>
The length of the second route is 930 km (to Batumi where terminal Supsa is<br>
under construction). In two months spending for this pipeline will be<br>
confirmed. Restoration works will begin in the second quarter of 1997. A<br>
significant volume of restoration works needs to be carried out on the<br>
section on the territory of Azerbaijan and a new pipeline from Akstafa to<br>
Tbilisi shall be built from scratch. A tender was announced for companies<br>
willing to participate in the reconstruction and restoration of the pipeline<br>
Baku-Batumi. The deadline is January 6. So far 53 companies had announced<br>
intentions to participate and   over 40 were rejected in the screening.  The<br>
first oil shall be delivered via the Western pipeline in the end of 1998.=20<br>
<p>
Adams said that the answer to the question which route the main oil from the<br>
Caspian will go will be given in the middle of next year. The choice of the<br>
main route will be pre-determined by technical and commercial factors.  The<br>
same two routes are under consideration: first -- existing northern route<br>
from Baku to Novorossiisk; second Western via Georgia to Eastern Turkey and<br>
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. There are other scenarios which entail oil<br>
delivery by tankers through the straits or by pipelines bypassing the<br>
straits via Bulgaria and Greece in case Turkey closes the straits.  =20<br>
<p>
Adams did not make a secret that the choice of the route will also be<br>
determined by political factors. In Georgia, for example, a big row was<br>
caused by a statement of President of self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
Republic, Robert Kocharyan, that consortium=92s activities were damaging<br>
security interests of Nagorno Karabakh since the implementation of the<br>
=93project of century=94 may increase the economic and first of all military<br>
potential of Azerbaijan.  Some military experts do not rule out that<br>
military formations of Karabakh may attempt to cut the Western pipeline by<br>
advancing to Gyandzha, the second largest city of Azerbaijan. The unresolved<br>
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict may restart again in serious.  Another<br>
indication for this are Heidar Aliyev=92s words at his press-conference=<br>
 after<br>
Lisbon OSCE Summit when he called authorities of Azerbaijan =93occupants.=94=<br>
   =20<br>
 This situation is complicated by contradictions among states represented by<br>
companies in the consortium. Relations between Moscow and Baku cannot be<br>
called partnership. Moscow suspects that Azerbaijan secretly supports<br>
Chechen separatists. Baku accuses Moscow in conspiracy for not extraditing<br>
persons charged with plotting against Azerbaijan. Baku would want to see<br>
Turkey, not Russia as partner, and condemns the presence of the Russian<br>
military in Transcaucasus.  =20<br>
<p>
The problem of straits has not been resolved yet. Turkey (in violation of<br>
international maritime agreements, Montre) is trying to impose limits for<br>
oil tankers. As a response Moscow quite unambiguously hints that the project<br>
Baku-Tbilisi-Supsa-Ceyhan will never take off as it will have to cross areas<br>
of Kurdistan where PKK fighters have been waging a guerrilla war against<br>
Turkish authorities  for 12 years.  Answering a question of your =FF<br>
correspondent on the attitude of the Kurdish leadership to this project, a<br>
representative of the Front of national Liberation of Kurdistan in the CIS<br>
countries and Eastern Europe, Makhir Valat, stated that for the pipeline to<br>
pass areas controlled by PKK one would need to exterminate PKK and that<br>
won=92t be easy to achieve since they have a 30,000 strong army.=20<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the other hand side the end of war in Chechnya is strengthening chances</i><br>
of the northern route, of course, if Chechen leaders do not rush to use that<br>
trump card for getting a de jure independence.=20<br>
<p>
This knot of contradictions can be resolved peacefully only as a result of<br>
consent among all major players in the region and first of all among Moscow,<br>
Washington, and Ankara.  That is hard to imagine as their interests are<br>
often quite contradictory.  This is one of the cases where confrontation<br>
will reveal the loser who will have to step aside.  (end)=20<br>

     December 19, 1996<br>
     <br>
     ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER HIGHLIGHTS ARMENIA<br>
     <br>
     The Orange County Register, published in Orange County, California, <br>
     ran a cover story on Armenia in its travel section on November 17, <br>
     entitled Armenia -- A People of Hope, A Land of Challenge. The article <br>
     introduced descriptions of tourist attractions, encounters with <br>
     Armenians, and history and current events including the Genocide, the <br>
     earthquake, blockades, and Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
     <br>
     On December 8, the Register also ran a feature story in the Accent <br>
     Section, The Eyes of Armenia, about Dr. Roger Ohanesian and Dr. Rick <br>
     Hill, local area eye surgeons who travel twice yearly to Armenia to <br>
     perform eye surgery, examinations, teach new techniques to Armenian <br>
     doctors, and provide the gift of vision of to patients. <br>
     <br>
     The Orange County Register sent reporter John Hughes and photographer <br>
     Bruce Strong to cover the work of these physicians and offer their <br>
     perspectives on what Armenia has to offer the traveler. The Armenian <br>
     Assembly's Western Region Office Director, Peter Abajian, and <br>
     Assistant Director, Lena Kaimian, met extensively with Hughes and <br>
     Strong prior to their first trip to Armenia to provide briefings, <br>
     background, and information. Hughes movingly captured the resilient <br>
     spirit of the Armenian people in his articles, while Strong's <br>
     outstanding photographs captured the beauty, pain and never-ending <br>
     hope of the Armenian people.<br>
     <br>
     ACTION:<br>
      Contact the Orange County Register (OCR) and commend them for <br>
     running two major and well-written articles on Armenia.<br>
     <br>
      Commend the OCR for sending reporter J. Hughes and photographer B. <br>
     Strong to Armenia.<br>
     <br>
      Commend the OCR for maintaining references to the Genocide in its <br>
     second story despite outrage from the Turkish community concerning <br>
     references to the Genocide in the first story.<br>
     <br>
      Urge the Orange County Register and other newspapers to continue <br>
     covering stories about Armenia and the one-half million Armenians in <br>
     California.<br>

     Due to many requests, the Orange County Register no longer has copies <br>
     of the November 17 article about travel to Armenia. However, copies of <br>
     the December 8 article about Drs. Ohanesian and Hill are still <br>
     available.<br>

     The Armenian-American Action Committee (ARAMAC) -- the grassroots arm <br>
     of the Armenian Assembly of America -- supports grassroots activism <br>
     and anti-defamation. Providing accurate information regarding Armenian <br>
     issues as well as responding to inaccurate information is critical <br>
     today given that greater attention is being given to Armenian issues <br>
     in Congress. Mobilizing, encouraging, and supporting the one million <br>
     Armenians throughout the United States in disseminating information <br>
     and impacting legislation concerning Armenian-American issues is an <br>
     integral part of improved U.S.-Armenia relations and improved <br>
     conditions in Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh.<br>

WHO WAS INTERESTED IN THIS? <br>
<p>
By Boris Vinogradov<br>
<p>
Most analysts who are looking into motives of the crime in Novye Atagi<br>
instead of the question "Who did that?" are asking the question "Who want to<br>
upset elections?"  This question immediately assigns political motives to<br>
this crime.  Moreover, a conclusion is implied that murderers shall be<br>
sought among those groups in Chechnya which have no chances to win elections<br>
but would want to preserve the status quo of post-war authority and<br>
influence in Chechnya.  This scenario is most popular among those who<br>
observe Chechnya from outside and try to make prognosis about outcome of<br>
elections.  With this approach quite a few groups in Chechnya, if not all,<br>
can be held under suspicion as none of them feels quite confident about<br>
results and the closer the date (January 27) the stronger tensions among<br>
them and the stronger chances for new provocations.  There is a wide-spread<br>
opinion that upsetting elections and introduction of a special regime<br>
similar to an extraordinary one would be in the interests both field<br>
commanders who are reluctant to say farewell to arms and such leading<br>
figures as Shamil Basayev and Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.  From the other hand<br>
side postponement of elections may provoke open clashes among various<br>
Chechen groupings and channel developments to a river bed which is against<br>
interests of current leaders of Ichkeria and federal authorities.   <br>
<p>
Some other experts on Chechnya maintain a different view. They see the main<br>
reason for the crime in Novye Atagi in the fact that the balk of Chechen<br>
population is well armed. Emil Payin, Advisor to the President, does not<br>
rule out recurrence of similar actions in the foreseeable future. Moreover,<br>
this problem will become even more acute in future.  Even if elections are<br>
held, the legitimacy of elected power will always be challenged by<br>
legitimacy of arms. Emil Pain dismissed the version on political nature of<br>
this crime. He thinks that elections cannot be canceled due to any<br>
provocations. However, one cannot help note that these murders were<br>
committed right after Raduyev's band took Russian policemen hostages on<br>
Dagestani border. Raduyev tried to present this incident as a provocation of<br>
Russian special services. It is not by accident, says Payin, that some<br>
people in Grozny are implying that Moscow was involved in the blood-bath at<br>
international hospital. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, reports from Grozny state that Interior Ministry bodies and the<br>
Offices of Prosecutor and National Security have developed their own version<br>
of the crime, but it is not clear what that version is.  Some light on this<br>
event is shed by eye-witness accounts. Thus, one of hospital guards stated<br>
that there were 10 terrorists, they intruded to hospital area through the<br>
fence and they had special arms with silencers.  (end) <br>

THE MEDICS WERE MURDERED BY RACKETEERS? <br>
<p>
By Boris Vinogradov<br>
<p>
The entire personnel of the international Red Cross mission to Chechnya  --<br>
35 people -- has left Chechnya. Only five of them remain in Grozny to assist<br>
the investigation into the murder of their six colleagues in Novye Atagi.   <br>
<p>
Some important details preceding the bloody terrorist act have become known.<br>
Speaking before journalists in Oslo a representative of the Norwegian Red<br>
Cross Terier Engevik expressed his confidence that this hideous crime was<br>
committed by Chechen bandits who had previously tried to take hospital in<br>
Novye Atagi under their control. Not once they tried to impose on hospital<br>
administration their own people for protection.  Terrier Engevik was in<br>
Chechnya last August when this field hospital was donated to the people of<br>
Chechnya by the government of Norway.  According to him, armed bandits<br>
intruded to the area of hospital several times before in attempts to dictate<br>
their will in administrative issues, namely on hiring guards who are well<br>
paid in hard currency by l;ocal standards. During the latest intrusion<br>
bandits stole the satellite telephone and a container with medicine.  <br>
<p>
The terrorist attack in Novye Atagi caused an uproar of indignation abroad<br>
and for the first time in history international organizations state that<br>
they are determined to stop activities in this "zone of extreme risk."<br>
Although they are mandated to work in such zones, in this particular case<br>
"we are dealing with the most brazen and despicable form of gangsterism and<br>
we will not put up with it," stated UNHCR representative Sylvana Foa. She<br>
said that UNHCR made a decision to recall all field workers from Chechnya.<br>
The UN aid to Chechen refugee families in Dagestan, Ingushetia and North<br>
Ossetia is suspended. "Doctors without borders" organization with<br>
headquarters in Paris is stopping activities in Chechnya to demonstrate<br>
solidarity with their colleagues from the ICRC.   President of the ICRC<br>
Conellio Sommaruga issued a call for international community to create a<br>
special tribunal for the trial of bandits who should not stay unpunished. (end) <br>

TURKEY CONSIDERS CHECHNYA PART OF RUSSIA<br>
<p>
By Boris Pilyatskin<br>
<p>
The three day visit of Turkish Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs<br>
Minister, Tansu Ciller, to Moscow ended yesterday with a signing of a<br>
Memorandum on cooperation between Russia and Turkey against terrorism.<br>
Among practical results of her visit are agreements on opening Russian and<br>
Turkish consulates in Izmir and Novorossiisk respectively and creation of a<br>
working group on energy issues this week. <br>
<p>
The Turkish guest evaluated the political importance of negotiations with<br>
the head of the Russian Federation MFA, Evgenii Primakov, and talks with<br>
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and Moscow mayor Yurii Luzhkov as "opening of<br>
doors" to a new stage in the relations of two countries -- partnership.  Her<br>
Russian colleague completely agreed with her. At a joint press-conference<br>
Evgenii Primakov and Tansu Ciller expressed their satisfaction with the<br>
results of this visit and emphasized common approaches to a number of issues<br>
in international regional politics.  <br>
<p>
Moscow seems to be particularly pleased with the official position of Turkey<br>
which in the context of the resolution of the Chechen crisis. Turkish<br>
Foreign Affairs Minister reiterated her country's adherence to the principle<br>
of territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. The sides agreed that the<br>
same principle shall be applied to Turkey and other countries of the region.   <br>
<p>
Trying to identify areas of tensions between the sides, journalists asked<br>
the Russian Minister what he thought about supplies of "offensive weapon<br>
systems" to Cyprus. <br>
<p>
-- I do not think that anti-aircraft systems are offensive weapons,<br>
responded Primakov.<br>
<p>
Ciller kept silent and only smiled.  (end) (Translated from Russian by AM)<br>

SEGODNIA: No. 235, 12/18/96<br>
<p>
Ankara is concerned with Russian military supplies to Cyprus<br>
Moscow accuses Turkey of "incorrect" activities on the territory of the RF<br>
<p>
The two day visit of Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister of<br>
Turkey Tansu Ciller to Moscow which began yesterday is held in the time of<br>
appreciable aggravation of bilateral relations. Interfax was told by a high<br>
ranking anonymous source in the Russian government on the eve of the visit<br>
that the Russian side was going to discuss the new Black Sea straits regime,<br>
unilaterally imposed by Ankara as well as attempts of Turkish officials to<br>
establish "special" relations with Turkic peoples of the Russian Federation<br>
which Moscow views as "incorrect."  According to the same source, Moscow is<br>
concerned with the activities of Islamic organizations in Turkey which<br>
financially support "separatist trends in Chechnya."  <br>
<p>
Ankara in its turn is extremely concerned with prospects of sales to Cyprus<br>
of Russian anti-aircraft systems S-300. Russia has already sold 41 T80-U<br>
tanks which impressed everybody at a military parade on October 1.  Along<br>
with 52 AMX-32B2 tanks provided by Greece and 52 French tanks already at the<br>
disposal of Cyprus, the Republic of Cyprus may soon reach parity  in terms<br>
of armor with the Turkish expeditionary corps which has 265 tanks on the<br>
island.  Meanwhile as Minister of Defense of Greece Akis Tsokhadzopulos<br>
stated last month during his trip to Moscow the south of the island badly<br>
needed protection against possible air strikes.  Recently S-300 systems have<br>
been examined by the Chief of Staff of Air Force of Greece, Georgios<br>
Antonetsis at one of Moscow test fields.  <br>
<p>
Mutual accusations can mar otherwise quite good potential of RussianTurkish<br>
military-technical copperation. Moscow hopes to bring sales of military<br>
equipment to Turkey to 300 million (currently 121 million) dollars. Turkey<br>
has an ambitious re-armament program (as well as Greece).  In the next 30<br>
years Turkey is planning to spend  150 billion dollars for defense purposes.<br>
However, it is not clear at all that Russia will play any significant role<br>
in that program. <br>
<p>
The political intrigue is that Turkey disappointed by yet another rejection<br>
to be accepted to EU has allegedly threatened to block expansion of NATO.<br>
The leak of this information was obviously sanctioned on the eve of Ciller's<br>
visit to Moscow. Most probably the threat will turn out to be a bluff (after<br>
all Greece, too, has the right of veto in the alliance). Moscow knows only<br>
too well the Turkey's inclinations to self-aggrandizement. <br>
<p>
Today the most feasible and the largest project  is the construction of the<br>
second natural gas pipeline which is in Ankara's utmost interest. The 1,160<br>
km long pipeline will cost 1.1 billion dollars and will increase Russian<br>
export of natural gas to Turkey from 8 to 14 billion cubic meters. (end) <br>

NOTES FOR AN ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY GARNIK NANAGOULIAN ON THE<br>
OCCASION OF THE TRIBUTE BANQUET MARKING THE DEDICATION CEREMONY OF THE<br>
PERMANENT PREMISES OF THE EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA IN OTTAWA<br>
OTTAWA, SUNDAY DECEMBER 7, 1996<br>
<p>
	It is very symbolic that December 7, the day of the tragic<br>
earthquake in Armenia, we chose to inaugurate the new Embassy building<br>
of the Republic of Armenia in Canada. There are many ways of marking<br>
this anniversary. Personally, I feel that we don't have the luxury to<br>
continue our grieving. We must take positive and constructive steps to<br>
re-build not only our homes, but, more critical to our future, to<br>
build our Nation. That would be the best monument to the memory of the<br>
victims of the earthquake. In Armenia today, the process of nation<br>
building is developing slowly but steadily. We are facing enormous<br>
challenges and problems but our goals are focused and our vision is<br>
clear and it is obvious that we are moving nearer to our target.<br>
<p>
	We are to create a country where fundamental human rights and<br>
the rule of law will be the essence of governing, and where every<br>
Armenian will be proud of not only a rich history and a fabulous past,<br>
but more importantly, of its current deeds. I have been privileged to<br>
become a member of the new government in Armenia, to join a team of<br>
those outstanding Armenians headed by the President of republic, Levon<br>
Ter-Petrossian , who are committed to fulfill this goal. But the<br>
important guarantee that this goal will come to fruition is the People<br>
of Armenia. Our people are the true safeguard for democratic reforms<br>
and socio-economic progress. It is not a secret that we have to rely<br>
on your support, the Armenians all over the world. To those who are<br>
still hesitating regarding the future of Armenia my best advice to you<br>
is to help us by taking a positive approach to the issues and work<br>
with us for solutions.<br>
<p>
	I have said that we are building in Armenia, but we build<br>
outside of Armenia as well. Thanks to the assistance of our friends,<br>
we erected "Hay Doons - Armenian Embassies" in a number of countries<br>
worldwide. In North America we have launched embassies in New York and<br>
Washington. I would like to take this opportunity to salute Mr. and<br>
Mrs. Hrair Hovanian for their extraordinary support which made it<br>
possible to have an Embassy building in Washington DC. Today, we have<br>
inaugurated another splendid Hay Doon, the Armenian Embassy in<br>
Ottawa. I think that it is a fitting monument to our fellow citizens<br>
who tragically died on 7 December 1988. Today it is also fitting that<br>
we pay a tribute to a man, an Armenian, whose contributions to the<br>
independent Armenia are hard to overestimate. It is a unique<br>
opportunity because he prefers to be a silent benefactor, a silent<br>
supporter and a silent soldier dedicated to his motherland. This man<br>
is Mr. Sarkis Acopian.<br>
<p>
	Owing to Mr. Acopian's generosity, the Embassy building in<br>
Canada became a reality. The magnitude of Mr. Acopian's generosity<br>
reaches well beyond the building in Ottawa. Through his support for<br>
many projects in Armenia, he has demonstrated a depth of commitment to<br>
our country well beyond what many can imagine. Respecting his modesty,<br>
I am in no position to elaborate on his contribution and involvement<br>
in a number of projects for Armenia. More than the gift, however, it<br>
is the manner in which the Acopian Family chooses to contribute that<br>
makes it so appreciated -- it is given with modesty, without fanfare<br>
and with extreme sincerity.<br>
<p>
	I met him several years ago and I got to know him better<br>
through our occasional meetings in Pennsylvania or Washington or<br>
Boston, I truly felt that my life was enriched. I felt very encouraged<br>
by the support for Armenia of an individual with these high moral<br>
values and philosophy of life. I, as an Armenian, felt more secure and<br>
more confident with this caliber of commitment; that we, as a nation,<br>
would prevail and we, as a nation, will once again claim our proper<br>
place in the world.<br>
<p>
	Mr. Acopian is a truly unique individual with wide range of<br>
activities and interests. He is involved in the sophisticated<br>
high-tech engineering that has created marvels for the defense<br>
capabilities of his country. But, at the same time, he is the driving<br>
force and an initiator of delicate projects such as the first<br>
Encyclopedia on the Feathered World of Armenia. Whatever he is<br>
involved in becomes enlightening and useful to human life.<br>
<p>
	After Armenia became independent, many people in the Diaspora<br>
felt lost and confused. They did not know what to do with this newborn<br>
and how to deal with it. Not for Mr. Acopian. His choice was<br>
immediately made and he started even before his corporate plane with<br>
the sign "Acopian" landed in Armenia. Independent Armenia was the<br>
incarnation of his and his parents' dream and regardless of the fact<br>
that who is in the government and what kind of political forces are<br>
there, he is committed to contribute to the process of making Armenia<br>
a modern nation. He is a man who has faced many challenges during his<br>
life and prevailed. He values professionalism, commitment and human<br>
decency. I wish I could spend more time with him. It is unfortunate<br>
that the full measure of Sarkis Acopian's good works are not known, as<br>
they would serve as an outstanding example for many to emulate.<br>
<p>
	Sarkis Acopian and his family fulfilled an enormous commitment<br>
with regards to their share to the new embassy building in Canada. The<br>
Canadian-Armenian Community also contributed to our new Embassy with<br>
its share. Today, I must mention in recognition for outstanding<br>
contributions to these efforts, Mr. John Adjeleian, the project<br>
manager, one of the most renowned structural engineers in Canada whose<br>
achievements include the famous Toronto Skydome, Mr. Haig Madjarian<br>
who provided all the lighting for the Embassy, actually, enlightened<br>
the Embassy, Mrs. Sylvia Toukhmanian, Mr. Mitchell Davey, Mr. and<br>
Mrs. Harry and Magda Yaghjian and others from the community whose<br>
daily contributions made this project come to fruition. And, of<br>
course, we have always felt the support from the Friends of Armenia,<br>
headed by Mr. Haig Misakyan, Mr. Mego Malkhassian and Mr. Garo<br>
Nichanian. A particular mention is due to the Primate of the Armenian<br>
Church in Canada, His Eminence Archbishop Hovnan Derd!  erian whose<br>
participation and guidance could hardly be exaggerated. He is an<br>
outstanding personality and a real leader of this Community.<br>
<p>
	So, the Home is built and now we have to fill it with the soul<br>
and essence. This must become a place where important initiatives<br>
strengthening Canadian-Armenian and Diasporan-Armenian relations<br>
should be executed. We should all join together to make this<br>
happen. The relations between our two countries have real<br>
perspectives. During the past one and a half years in Canada, we<br>
planted the seeds from which we are now just beginning to see the<br>
fruits of our labor. But it has only just begun. There are many more<br>
buds on the tree that will soon bloom, but with your attentiveness and<br>
cooperation. It so happens that I have to leave Canada. I will be<br>
frank with you, I will miss this country, I will miss the people, and<br>
I will miss you. During my stay here I met many wonderful people who<br>
were very supportive. I also experienced the sadness of losing close<br>
friends. Today I have to remember Dr. Ara Mouradian who held an<br>
instrumental role at the very beginning of our programs with regards!<br>
to the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant. His contribution and support are<br>
invaluable. I will not forget another good friend of the Armenian<br>
people, a decent Armenian man, Mr. Varoujean Boyadjian whose thoughts<br>
and support were so important at the initial stages of our Embassy.<br>
<p>
	But life goes on and there are many things to be done. Our<br>
people in Armenia deserve better living conditions. Let's not forget<br>
the fact that a significant number of them still live below the<br>
poverty line. We must continue to make ourselves stronger and to do<br>
everything possible to alleviate these burdensome problems. We are<br>
counting on your continued vigilance, your sensitive response, your<br>
caring support. I also rely on you, my friends, to support our Embassy<br>
staff here Mr. Ashot Grigorian, Mrs. Karine Afrikian and Mr. Hrach<br>
Kaspar.<br>

1. POST-ELECTION ARREST CASE TO BE REVIEWED BY SUPREME COURT<br>
2. AYJM NEWSPAPER CONSIDCATED<br>
3. EUROCOURT DEALS DOUBLE BLOW TO TURKEY<br>
4. AEF NAMES PETROSSIAN EDUCATOR OF YEAR<br>
<p>
<p>
1. POST-ELECTION ARREST CASE TO BE REVIEWED BY SUPREME COURT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN-The preliminary investigation into criminal charges for a <br>
number of individuals arrested as a result of the Sept. 25 post-<br>
election crackdown in Armenia has concluded and the results have <br>
been submitted to the Supreme Court, National Democratic Union <br>
executive member and chairman of its lawyers association, Vova <br>
Hakhverdian said Wednesday.<br>
	According to Hakhverdian, none of the charges can be proven <br>
because the events that led to those individuals arrests-storming <br>
of the National Assembly building where the Central Electoral <br>
Commission was headquartered, the kidnapping of National Assembly <br>
Speaker Babken Ararktsian and the beating of Deputy Speaker Ara <br>
Sahakian-were carried out by Armenias leadership and not the <br>
opposition as is claimed.<br>
	The trials are scheduled to begin at the end of January and <br>
all of the defendants have retained attorneys to prepare their <br>
defenses, Hakhverdian said.<br>
	Armenian authorities have expedited the hearings to show the <br>
international community that the parliament building was stormed, <br>
laws were broken and that the responsible parties will be held <br>
accountable, Hakhverdian added.<br>
	Hakhverdian was convinced that the events of Sept. 25 were <br>
orchestrated entirely by Armenias leadership to cover up what <br>
truly happened. "Otherwise, they would not have any excuses," <br>
Hakhverdian said.<br>
	Criminal charges against Armenian Revolutionary Federation <br>
Executive Council member Kim Balayan will be heard separately. <br>
Balayan has been charged with leaving a victim unaided (Article <br>
128 of Armenias Criminal Code); inciting mass disorder (Article <br>
74); and illegal possession of weapons (Article 232).<br>
	Mkrtich Meghavorian, Vahe Beknazarian, Seyran Masoyan, Habet <br>
Petrossian and Argishti Kivirian have all been charged with <br>
violating Article 74 of the Criminal Code.<br>
	The families of the defendants issued a statement Wednesday <br>
in an effort to focus attention on the plight of their relatives. <br>
The statement, sent to Armenias public-political organizations <br>
and the mass media, calls attention to the fact that those <br>
individuals, who were all active in national alliance candidate <br>
Vazgen Manoukians presidential campaign, have been detained for <br>
their political convictions and participation in opposition <br>
politics.<br>
	"They are innocent, unless being a supporter of Vazgen <br>
Manoukian is a crime," the statement said.<br>
	"In his televised appearance following the declaration of <br>
his presidency, Levon Ter-Petrosyan promised that he would not <br>
carry out witch-hunts, but the trumped up charges against our <br>
relatives demonstrate that Armenias leadership is conducting a <br>
sweep of opposition forces," the statement said.<br>
	The statement harshly criticized the massive human rights <br>
violations by Armenias authorities, especially their relatives <br>
three-month detention without formal charges. The statement was <br>
also highly critical of Prosecutor-General Artavazd Gevorkian for <br>
carrying out the orders of the leadership and "detaining, without <br>
any evidence, innocent individuals." Gevorkians actions remain <br>
unchecked, the group said, calling on others to join their <br>
struggle for justice and to hold Gevorkian accountable.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. AYJM NEWSPAPER CONSIDCATED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN-The Dec. 18 issue of Ayjm newspaper, the official <br>
publication of the National Democratic Union, was confiscated by <br>
the state distributing agency.<br>
	The issue was published but never  reached readers, since, <br>
NDU officials said, the distributing agency Haimamoul, using its <br>
monopoly on newspaper distribution has halted the dissemination of <br>
Ayjm.<br>
	In the current issue, Ayjm had published a critical report <br>
on Haimamoul, which, in turn, decided to not distribute the <br>
newspaper.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. EUROCOURT DEALS DOUBLE BLOW TO TURKEY<br>
<p>
STRASBOURG, France (Reuter)-The European Court of Human Rights <br>
dealt a double blow to Turkey Wednesday, ruling that Ankara had <br>
violated the rights of a Greek Cypriot with land in northern <br>
Cyprus and tortured a suspected Kurdish fighter. <br>
	Turkish authorities had no immediate comment, but the <br>
rulings in widely-watched cases seemed bound to bolster already <br>
widespread criticism of Ankaras human rights record.<br>
	In a landmark finding, the court rejected Turkeys argument <br>
that the European human rights convention did not apply to its <br>
occupation of the north of Cyprus since it occurred before Ankara <br>
accepted its jurisdiction.<br>
	Cypriot lawyers said the ruling was significant because it <br>
made Turkey responsible for the situation on the island rather <br>
than the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared in <br>
1983 and recognized only by Ankara.<br>
	"I believe its effects can be enormous," Cypriot President <br>
Glafcos Clerides told reporters following the judgment. "If we <br>
take into account those who were forced to leave their homes then <br>
the effects can be greater."<br>
	About 200,000 Greek Cypriots were displaced when Turkish <br>
troops took control of the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 after <br>
a brief coup engineered by a military junta then ruling Greece.<br>
	The court upheld a complaint by tourist guide Titina <br>
Loizidou that Turkey violated her property rights by denying her <br>
access to land she owned in Kyrenia, northern Cyprus.<br>
	It found by a vote of 11-6 that the Turkish army "exercised <br>
effective overall control" in Cyprus.<br>
	Loizidou told reporters she was sure the judgment would help <br>
the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem.<br>
	"This is an historic decision. It is the first time an <br>
international court has taken a legal decision on Turkeys <br>
responsibility in northern Cyprus and found Turkey guilty for <br>
denying people the right to enjoy their property," she said. <br>
	In the second case, the court, an arm of the 40-nation <br>
Council of Europe that promotes human rights and democracy, ruled <br>
that Turkish police tortured a Kurd, Zeki Aksoy, in 1992 after <br>
arresting him as a suspected terrorist.<br>
	Ankara was ordered to pay 4.3 billion Turkish lire ($41,000) <br>
in damages plus legal fees of 20,710 pounds sterling ($34,586). <br>
	But the court found no evidence that Aksoy was murdered by <br>
the state after complaining to Strasbourg about his treatment <br>
while he was held incommunicado for at least two weeks at the <br>
Kiziltepe security prison in southeast Turkey in late 1992. <br>
	Aksoy, who complained to the European authorities in May <br>
1993, was found murdered in April 1994. Two days before his death, <br>
he received a telephoned warning that he would be killed unless he <br>
withdrew his complaint, according to his lawyers. <br>
	Turkey told the court a member of the Kurdistan Workers <br>
Party (PKK) had been charged with the murder.<br>
	Though never charged, Askoy said he was subjected to a form <br>
of torture known as "Palestinian hanging" in which he was stripped <br>
naked and hung by his arms, causing him to lose the use of his <br>
arms and hands.<br>
	He was also given electric shocks to his genitals, kicked, <br>
slapped and verbally abused, he said.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. AEF NAMES PETROSSIAN EDUCATOR OF YEAR<br>
<p>
BY GARO MOUMDJIAN<br>
<p>
GLENDALE-More than 350 people were gathered at the Brandview <br>
Collection Hall at noon, on December 8, to honor one of Glendales <br>
outspoken, most energetic, and esteemed educators Alice <br>
Petrossian, who was named "Educator of the Year" during Armenian <br>
Educational Foundation's annual Poinsettia Brunch.<br>
	Present at the gathering were the Glendale Unified School <br>
District Superintendent James R. Brown, Assistant Superintendent <br>
Dr. Joanne Myrick, Glendale Unified School District Board member <br>
Linda Rocamora, Judge Alice Altoon, holder of AEF Chair in <br>
Armenian Studies Prof. Richard Hovanissian, former President of <br>
the American University of Armenia Dr. Mihran Aghbabian, as well <br>
as principals and vice-principals of Armenian schools, educators, <br>
professionals, journalists, and scores of relatives, associates <br>
and friends, who had come to honor Petrossian for her decades long <br>
services to the cause of education and the betterment of future <br>
generations.<br>
	AEF vice-president Nora Sahagian delivered the welcoming <br>
remarks, underlining the importance of education in the Armenian <br>
psyche and stressed that Alice Petrossian is the personification <br>
of that psyche, because she endured many hardships in her quest to <br>
excel and was able to accomplish the goals she set for herself.<br>
	Ralph Tufenkian, a benefactor and AEF Board member, <br>
delivered the opening remarks. He was followed by AEF president <br>
Shahen Nazarian who explained the reasons behind choosing <br>
Petrossian as the recipient of the organizations "Educator of the <br>
Year Award." <br>
	He stressed that it was a well-deserved award, since <br>
Petrossian was-by nature-an advocate of education and a civic <br>
leader who makes her voice heard in matters pertaining to the <br>
education, because she firmly believes that the youth are our <br>
future assets and, as such, much should be devoted to their proper <br>
upbringing and development. <br>
	Nazarian cited Petrossians own family as an example, saying <br>
that she, together with her husband, Vahik, attended to the needs <br>
of their two sons, Chris and Shant, who are university graduates <br>
and who devote their time to causes beneficial to their community.<br>
	Nazarian then called upon AEF member Berdj Karapetian to <br>
present the award. Karapetian highlighted several aspects of <br>
Petrossians accomplishments in the fields of education and <br>
Armenian community affairs. With tears in her eyes, Petrossian <br>
walked to the stage as attendees gave her a standing ovation. <br>
	"I would have not been able to do all this if it was not for <br>
you, my friends and associates, who encouraged me at all times," <br>
Petrossian said, as she thanked the AEF for honoring her. <br>
	She also expressed gratitude to her parents and her closest <br>
relatives for their encouragement, but most of all to the <br>
unequivocal support of her family, her husband and two sons, who <br>
endured her frequent absences on the path of advocacy for <br>
educational matters.<br>
	An appearance by the Valley View Elementary School choir was <br>
a part of a surprise organized by the brunch committee. The <br>
children entertained the guests with renditions of several popular <br>
Armenian songs, under the direction of their principal, Jackie <br>
Kurkdjian, a close friend of Petrossian.<br>
	Musical entertainment for the event was also provided by <br>
flutist Salpi Kerkonian with Sossi Carian (harp), and Missak <br>
Alexanian (cello).<br>

HEADLINE: President Aliyev says new oil project improves ties with USA <br>
SOURCE: Interfax news agency, Moscow, in English 1443 gmt and 1544 gmt 14 Dec<br>

<p>
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev has described the signing of a 2bn-dollar<br>
deal with a consortium of international oil companies to develop two oil<br>
deposits in the Caspian as "a remarkable event" in the life of Azerbaijan and<br>
of significance for the development of relations between his country and the<br>
United States, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 14th December. <br>
<p>
"The signing of this contract is of great importance for the development of<br>
the entire economy of my country, which is confidently showing to the world<br>
its openness and readiness for cooperation, and makes confident steps along<br>
the path leading to international integration," the agency quoted Aliyev as<br>
saying after the signing ceremony on 14th December. <br>
<p>
Noting the contract's significance in terms of promoting Azerbaijan's<br>
relations with the USA, Aliyev said the participation vc of the two US<br>
companies, Amoco and Unocal, in the project "meets the strategic interests of<br>
the two countries" , the agency reported. <br>
<p>
Interfax news agency quoted Aliyev as saying on the same occasion that Baku<br>
had no intention of changing its strategic policy for the development of<br>
offshore Caspian oil and gas fields "despite interference from some circles<br>
outside the country" . <br>
<p>
"The unsettled status of the Caspian Sea cannot influence the implementation<br>
of the contract signed," the agency quoted the Azerbaijan president as<br>
saying. Aliyev said US Vice President Al Gore had called him on 13th December<br>
"expressing US support for Azerbaijan' s strategy for the development of<br>
energy resources" . <br>
<p>
There are five companies involved in the project to develop the Dan Ulduzu<br>
and Ashrafi offshore oil and gas fields. They are Amoco, which has a<br>
30-per-cent stake; the Azerbaijani State Oil Company SOCAR and Japan's<br>
Itochu, which have 20 per cent each; and the USA's UNOCAL and Saudi Arabia's<br>
Delta acting in tandem with 30 per cent, divided into 25.5 and 4.5 per cent<br>
respectively, Interfax reported. <br>
<p>
In a separate report the same day, Interfax quoted SOCAR Vice President Ilham<br>
Aliyev as saying that the exclusion of Russian oil companies from the deal<br>
should not be viewed as a political move. In particular, the absence of<br>
Lukoil, which has a stake in Azerbaijan's three other oil deals, "is not<br>
linked in any way to Russia's political interests" , he was quoted as saying.<br>
<p>
<p>
"The two fields in question are adjacent to the Karabakh deposit, in which<br>
Lukoil has a 32.5-per-cent development stake, and the present contract could<br>
in the future be merged with the Karabakh one. That would give Lukoil an<br>
indirect stake," he added, as quoted by Interfax . <br>

HEADLINE: Azeris want new look at Tashkent accord <br>
SOURCE:  Jane's Defence Weekly,   December 18, 1996<br>
<p>
Azerbaijan remains nervous about its neighbours, especially Armenia where the<br>
ceasefire over Nagorno Karabakh is fractious.  Meanwhile, Russia's intentions<br>
may pose a threat. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan's armed forces would like to renegotiate the Tashkent Agreement<br>
for the sharing vc of former Soviet weaponry, but not at the expense of<br>
Russia gaining more materiel, a senior army officer told Jane's Defence<br>
Weekly. <br>
<p>
The source, who wished to remain anonymous, pointed out that Azerbaijan has<br>
longer borders and more citizens than Armenia and Georgia - something not<br>
considered when the agreement was signed. He complained that weapons continue<br>
to reach Armenian forces, which, despite the May 1994 ceasefire, are still in<br>
a state of war with Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno Karabakh.<br>
The officer said small arms fire is exchanged daily between Azeri and<br>
Armenian forces despite reports that the ceasefire is holding. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan disputes independently published reports on Armenian force<br>
strengths and official Armenian-declared strengths in Nagorno Karabakh and<br>
offers its own estimates: <br>
<p>
- Personnel: Published: 12, 000,  Armenian claims: -, Azeri claims: 40, 000+;<br>
<p>
<p>
- MBTs: Published: 13, Armenian claims: 100, Azeri claims: 150+; <br>
<p>
- AFVs: Published: -, Armenian claims: 100, Azeri claims: 200+; <br>
<p>
- Artillery (100 mm+): Published: 16, Armenian claims: 200, Azeri claims:<br>
200+. <br>
<p>
He said: "The problem in verifying the estimates is the failure of inspection<br>
teams under the CFE [Conventional Forces in Europe] Treaty and Vienna<br>
Document-94 to make inspections where they really matter." <br>
<p>
Illegal arms transfers from Armenia to Nagorno Karabakh take place along<br>
three major access routes: Dilijan to Kelbajar in the northern sector; Megri<br>
to Zangelan in the south; and Sisian to Shusha in the central sector, which<br>
"have never been inspected". <br>
<p>
Armenia and foreign military forces there also hold more equipment than<br>
allowed under CFE treaty limitations, he claimed: 177 main battle tanks<br>
(MBTs), 435 other armoured combat vehicles (ACVs), 220 artillery pieces and<br>
12 attack helicopters. The officer also accused Iran of sending arms to<br>
Armenia. French, Lebanese, Libyan and Syrian mercenaries are based in Nagorno<br>
Karabakh, he claimed. <br>
<p>
One of the main difficulties in implementing the CFE Treaty, he said, is the<br>
problem of non-recoverable losses of Treaty-limited equipment in the course<br>
of military operations against Armenia. He says Azerbaijan has lost 186 MBTs,<br>
119 ACVs and 57 artillery pieces of 100 mm-plus. <br>
<p>
Under the terms of the CFE treaty, Azerbaijan has also retired 15 MBTs, 174<br>
ACVs and 40 artillery pieces above 100 mm and cascaded a further 100 to<br>
border troops in the Azeri enclave of Nakhchivan. <br>
<p>
A lot of the equipment received by Azerbaijan was "in very poor technical<br>
condition", and maintenance and spare parts are a serious problem. <br>
<p>
He said that Armenia has failed to implement UN resolutions in the area and<br>
that NATO, under the terms of Partnership for Peace, should recognise this<br>
and take action against Armenia. <br>
<p>
"We hope to find a peaceful solution to this problem," he said, but according<br>
to Western diplomats in Baku, no Azeri politician would be able to hold<br>
office without declaring his intention to recover captured areas by force,<br>
should negotiations fail. <br>
<p>
This, however, appears to be rhetoric rather than reality. Azerbaijan has<br>
signed major contracts with Western consortia for the exploitation of its oil<br>
wealth and it fears any renewed large-scale fighting would, at the very<br>
least, delay pumping and much needed foreign income. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan's own frail internal political system and fears for the future of<br>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin are also cause for concern in Azerbaijan.<br>
Since gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has faced coups, revolts,<br>
mutinies, states of emergencies and separatist threats as well as joining,<br>
leaving and rejoining the Commonwealth of Independent States. <br>
<p>
The country is held together by President Heydar Aliev, but he is ageing and<br>
appears to have no suitable successor. An internal power struggle is likely<br>
and the popular policy of retaking Nagorno Karabakh by force may swing the<br>
balance in any leadership struggle. <br>
<p>
Although Azeris downplay the possibility, they fear that an expansionist<br>
Russian leader may replace Yeltsin. First on the list for "reintegration" may<br>
be Azerbaijan and its oil fields, some Azeris believe, but not before the<br>
wells and pipelines are pumping. <br>
<p>
Russia continues to back ousted President Ayaz Mutalibov, who is in exile in<br>
Moscow and has attempted to regain power in Azerbaijan. Senior Azeri military<br>
officials point to reports that Gen Alexander Lebed, Russia's ousted national<br>
security chief, was attempting to establish a 'foreign legion', comprising<br>
mainly Armenian and Serbian personnel. They believe Russia could try to<br>
re-enter Azerbaijan by supporting a full-scale invasion via Armenia, using<br>
the Armenians as a proxy force. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijani forces continue to operate under the old Soviet force structure<br>
and doctrine "but now with greater co-operation with NATO and with frequent<br>
military exchanges, we are able to make new decisions on the best way to<br>
operate." Azerbaijan is restructuring its forces. <br>
<p>
As well as weapons acquisitions from Russia, Azerbaijan also buys equipment<br>
<i>&gt;from Israel, Turkey and China. Modernisation and standardisation are the main</i><br>
priorities of the armed forces. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan publicly declared its support for NATO's moves to expand the<br>
alliance eastward at the latest meeting of the council of ministers of<br>
defence in Moscow. <br>
<p>
While the country has no immediate plans to make any of its forces available<br>
for peacekeeping operations, a special unit has been set up to study and<br>
train for peacekeeping, but now, "we need all our troops for any crises in<br>
Nagorno Karabakh", said the officer. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan acknowledges only four terrorist attacks in the country - all in<br>
1994 - and no group claimed responsibility. Azerbaijan's foreign ethnic<br>
community comprises  around 300,000 Russian nationals of Azeri citizenship; a<br>
similar number of Armenians; and a smaller number of Daghestanis. <br>
<p>
Because these claim discrimination against them internal unrest and  renewed<br>
terrorist activity are possible. <br>
<p>
Around 90 per cent of Azeris are Shi'ite Muslims, although there is little<br>
 religious activity. Turkey appears to be leaning to a more fundamentalist<br>
way of life and may influence its Azeri neighbours in bordering Nakhchivan,<br>
while Iran regularly broadcasts religious radio and television programmes to<br>
Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
One theory to try to explain why Iran supported Armenia over Nagorno Karabakh<br>
is that Azerbaijan would need Iran to support or mediate any future conflict<br>
between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Iran would then have the leverage to demand a<br>
more religious life in Azerbaijan and less Azeri involvement with the West,<br>
especially NATO. <br>

<p>
The Baku-to-Novorossiisk northern route will have the first 30,000 tons of<br>
Azeri oil flowing in February, 1997. <br>
<p>
According to president of the Azerbaijan international operations company<br>
Terry Adams, the initial 30,000 tons of Azeri oil are to be carried to world<br>
markets via Russia in February, 1997. <br>
<p>
Those shipments are supposed to be followed up by deliveries of another<br>
40,000 tons of oil by the northern route vc from Baku to Novorossiisk, a<br>
Russian port on the Black Sea. No figures are yet finalized for such supplies<br>
in the following months, though relevant feasibility studies submitted to the<br>
government of Azerbaijan specify annual exports of 1 million tons. <br>
<p>
Mr Adams, for his part, sees no problems with transporting Azeri oil across<br>
Russian territory. <br>

Secret Police Files In Berlin Show That Someone Was Watching Over Polish Pope<br>
John Paul Ii In The Holy See - And It Wasn'T Just God, Writes Gabriel Ronay <br>
<p>
A communist spy infiltrated the Vatican in the guise of a high-ranking<br>
Catholic cleric to keep an eye on Pope John Paul II at the height of the Cold<br>
War. <br>
<p>
John Paul was the first non-Italian in four centuries to be elected to the<br>
Papacy, and the Kremlin believed his Eastern European roots as the former<br>
Bishop of Kracow vc in Poland made him an active spiritual opponent of<br>
atheistic communism. A fellow Pole within the church was recruited to watch<br>
over him. <br>
<p>
Stalin had previously regarded the Vatican as irrelevant to power politics,<br>
asking dismissively: "How many divisions has the Pope got?" But spying became<br>
an absolute imperative with the Pope's financial support for the Solidarity<br>
trade union in his native country and in view of the 'holy alliance' forged<br>
between the Vatican and US president Ronald Reagan in their drive against the<br>
influence of the 'evil empire' of the Soviet Union. <br>
<p>
The mysterious figure of an East European 'James Bond in a cassock' has only<br>
now emerged from previously unexamined files of the East German Stasi secret<br>
police archives in Berlin which include copies of Polish security service<br>
reports dating back to the early 1970s. They contain more than 300 pages of<br>
startling revelations ranging from Pope Paul VI's secret discussions with the<br>
late West German Chancellor Willy Brandt about his Ostpolitik vision, and<br>
also top secret CIA briefings for the current Pope that were given during the<br>
1980s. <br>
<p>
The Soviet bloc's Vatican spy, it appears, passed on all the information he<br>
gleaned from the Pope's entourage to the KGB who then distributed it to the<br>
other Warsaw Pact secret services. <br>
<p>
Vatican spokesman Monsignor Joaquin Navarro-Valls at first dismissed the<br>
newly-discovered Berlin spy files, claiming that these were "pure<br>
fabrications intended to show how well informed the Polish secret service had<br>
been." Warsaw's main daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, which has close<br>
connections with Solidarity and the Catholic Church in Poland, also tried to<br>
play down the story. <br>
<p>
But Rome is now taking the revelations much more seriously and German church<br>
historian Erwin Gatz has been entrusted with the delicate task of comparing<br>
the Stasi files to the Vatican originals. <br>
<p>
Now Henryk Bosak, a former high-ranking Polish secret service officer, has<br>
revealed that his country's Catholic credentials made possible the<br>
penetration of the Holy See, and he confirmed that his service had spied on<br>
the Vatican during the Cold War. <br>
<p>
In his recently published book, An Officer from the Centre, he states: "The<br>
Polish secret service had its sources within the walls of the Vatican,<br>
including one very highly placed one, who told us all about the Pope's<br>
dialogues and conversations." <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the positive identification of the traitor at the Pope's side<br>
has been made more difficult by the shrewd decision of General Czeslaw<br>
Kiszczak, the last communist interior minister of Poland, to shred all secret<br>
service files on the Catholic Church in 1989. <br>
<p>
Jerzy Urban, the former communist government spokesman and present editor of<br>
the popular Warsaw satirical weekly Nie, noted in his journal that "since<br>
some 1,800 Polish priests had collaborated with the secret services up to the<br>
change-over to democracy, these shredded documents could have cast<br>
interesting light on the totally unknown face of the church". <br>
<p>
But the popular interest generated by the spy story has been such that, with<br>
the eager help of former secret service officer Bosak, the media have managed<br>
to narrow down the list of potential suspects to three. They are: Father<br>
Tadeusz Pieronek, the secretary of the Polish Bishops Conference, who had a<br>
very cordial relationship with the highest echelons of the Vatican; Father<br>
Tadeusz Rakoczi who served 14 years in an influential position at the Holy<br>
See, and Monsignor Juliusz Paetz, the bishop of Poznan, who served in Rome as<br>
the official go-between between the communist Polish government and the<br>
Vatican for 15 crucial years. <br>
<p>
The evidence is purely circumstantial in each case. <br>
<p>
Certainly, it would not produce a guilty verdict in a Scottish court of law.<br>
Therefore, the unmasking of the Polish mystery man with a double life and the<br>
key to all the secrets of the Vatican must await the final report of the<br>
Gauck Commission, which is sifting through the Stasi files. <br>
<p>
There is, as yet, no known connection between the Polish spy and Mehmet Ali<br>
Agca, the Armenian Turk who attempted to assassinate the Pope in 1981. <br>
<p>
The blame for that has been put on the Bulgarians. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately for the Vatican, the Polish 'James Bond in a cassock' was not<br>
the only cleric to betray the Vicar of Rome. It recently came to light in<br>
Romania that Monsignor Luigi Vitoria Blassuti, the Vicar-General of<br>
Bucharest, had spied on Vatican officials for Romania's secret police, the<br>
Securitate, for 30 years. <br>
<p>
It has now been established that the Romanian cleric was paid by the<br>
Securitate to influence the Vatican's East European appointments, to<br>
discredit dissidents and opponents of the Ceausescu regime, and to mislead<br>
the Vatican about Romania's true intentions towards its Catholic communities.<br>
<p>
<p>
The treacherous Vicar-General of Bucharest would never have been suspected of<br>
such nefarious activities had the Romanians been as efficient as the Poles in<br>
destroying the church files when the murderous Ceausescu regime was toppled. <br>
<p>
But the Securitate's successor, the Romanian Intelligence Service, simply<br>
buried tonnes of old Securitate dossiers in a forest. <br>
<p>
These were dug up by villagers and sold to the press. Thus, the brilliant<br>
career of Monsignor Blassuti - secret police code name Iacobescu - has come<br>
to light. <br>

RED CROSS KILLINGS CONDEMNED. The UNHCR and the French organization
Medicins du Monde formally announced the suspension of relief operations
in Chechnya and neighboring North Caucasus republics following the
murder of six Red Cross workers on the night of 16-17 December, Western
agencies reported. Speaking to journalists in Moscow on his return from
Grozny, Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin condemned the
killings, as did Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembskii, who
described them as a "provocation" and expressed the hope that they would
not derail the ongoing peace process, according to ITAR-TASS. AFP quoted
Chechen security chief Abu Movsaev as stating that "there are suspects"
and that his men are currently trying to apprehend them. The murders
have also been widely condemned by Western governments. -- Liz Fuller

LEBED WINS CASE AGAINST KULIKOV. Former Security Council Secretary
Aleksandr Lebed won a libel suit against Interior Minister Anatolii
Kulikov on 17 December, international agencies reported. A Moscow
district court judge ruled that Kulikov had defamed Lebed's character at
a press conference on 16 October when he accused him of plotting an
armed mutiny. Lebed was fired soon after. The court awarded Lebed the
symbolic damages of 1 ruble he sought and ordered Kulikov to take back
the allegations at a news conference within 15 days. Kulikov, who is
himself suing Lebed over remarks he made to Argumenty i fakty, plans to
appeal. Lebed and Kulikov have been bitter foes since the summer, when
Lebed called for the interior minister's resignation over Chechnya.
Moscow is currently awash with rumors that Kulikov will be promoted to
the post of deputy prime minister, although on 18 December he checked
into hospital for a week-long "check up." -- Penny Morvant

FSB CHIEF ON ESPIONAGE AGAINST RUSSIA. Federal Security Service (FSB)
Director Col.-Gen. Nikolai Kovalev told reporters on 17 December that
combating foreign espionage remains the principal activity of his
agency, Russian and Western media reported. He argued that Western
interest in spying on Russia has increased because of "Russia's place
and role in the international community" and complained in particular
about the activity of British, Turkish, and Baltic intelligence agents.
Kovalev, who was appointed in July, said that over the last two years
the FSB has exposed 400 foreign agents, arrested 39 Russian citizens on
espionage charges, and blocked more than 100 attempts to transfer
classified information to foreign intelligence services. On the other
hand, he said the FSB is cooperating with foreign colleagues in the
fight against terrorism, organized crime, corruption, and drug
trafficking but admitted to less success in these areas. -- Scott

FOREIGN MINISTRY REJECTS CLAIM ON SEVASTOPOL. Belatedly rejecting the 5
December Federation Council resolution claiming Sevastopol, Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadii Tarasov reiterated that the Russian
government accepts that "Sevastopol and all of Crimea belongs to
Ukraine," Russian media reported on 17 December. Tarasov expressed
"bewilderment" at the Ukrainian parliament's 6 December protest against
Russian territorial claims (see OMRI Daily Digest, 6 and 7 December
1996). He stressed that under the 1993 Russian constitution, it is the
executive and not the Federal Assembly that directs foreign policy. He
also harshly criticized Primorskii Krai Governor Yevgenii Nazdratenko
for his continuing opposition to the demarcation of the Russo-Chinese
border under a 1991 bilateral agreement. Tarasov said the agreement
would be "unconditionally fulfilled," adding that Nazdratenko's "crude"
and "demagogic" attacks on it were "unacceptable." -- Scott Parrish

WESTERN OIL COMPANIES URGE RUSSIA TO BE MORE OPEN TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT.
The Petroleum Advisory Forum, which unites 30 Western corporations,
released a plan prepared jointly with the Russian Academy of Sciences on
17 December detailing the possible benefits for Russia of six major oil
and gas projects, Reuters reported. The projects would require $100
billion of Western investment over the next 50 years but could boost
annual oil output by 90 million metric tons, create 550,000 new jobs,
and generate $590 billion in revenue, 87% of which would go to Russia.
Progress on these projects has been blocked by ambiguous tax legislation
and the Duma's failure to pass a list of approved sites covered by the
1995 production-sharing law. Russia's oil production fell from 570
million metric tons in 1987 to 305 million tons in 1995, largely because
of lack of investment in new fields. It dropped another 2% in the first
10 months of 1996. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
CAPITAL OUTFLOW STILL STRONG. Deputy Procurator General Vladimir Davydov
told a press conference that capital flight from Russia tops $12 billion
a year, ITAR-TASS reported on 17 December. Russian individuals and
companies hold a total of $40-50 billion abroad and operate an estimated
60,000 off-shore companies. Davydov said the situation is exacerbated by
discrepancies in customs practices between Russia and other CIS
countries. He estimated that the absence of customs duties on foreign-
currency transfers between Russia and Belarus cost the Russian budget $2
billion in 1996. -- Natalia Gurushina

FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA. In its
annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based Freedom
House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 most
repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December.
Uzbekistan, which last year also appeared in the worst category,
improved its record in 1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, Georgia,
Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine are rated "partly free;" and Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan
are listed as "not free." Freedom House ratings are based on a check-
list of political rights and civil liberties, including the degree of
autonomy for minorities, the status of the opposition, the nature of
electoral laws, and the degree of freedom of assembly and freedom of the
media. -- Lowell Bezanis

CHECHNYA DEMANDS SHARE OF TRANSIT TARIFFS FOR CASPIAN OIL. Chechen
government representative Eduard Khachukaev met recently in Baku with
the chairman of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC),
Terry Adams, to discuss the transportation of Azerbaijani oil through
Chechnya, Turan reported on 17 December. Khachukaev said that Chechnya
should receive a share of the transit tariffs from the transportation of
Caspian oil via the Baku-Chechnya-Tikhoretsk-Novorossiisk pipeline and
that it wants a share in the AIOC. Adams assured Khachukaev that he
would raise the issue with the Azerbaijani leadership. Under the terms
of an agreement signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
interim Chechen Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov on 23 November, the
Russian and Chechen authorities were supposed to conclude an agreement
by 1 December on the unimpeded transportation of oil through Chechnya.

DEMONSTRATION IN KYRGYZSTAN. About 300 people, mostly pensioners,
gathered in front of the government building in Bishkek on 17 December
to demand compensation for savings lost when several state banks
collapsed, RFE/RL reported. The leaders of the demonstration met with
Kyrgyz Prime Minister Apas Jumagulov, but no agreement was reached. One
of the protesters, Topchubek Turgunaliyev of the Erkin Kyrgyzstan Party,
was detained by police as he left the government building. Turgunaliyev
was accused of embezzling state property, but Jumagazy Usupov, leader of
the Ashar movement, argued that Turgunaliyev's detention was linked to
his role in the recent formation of the "For Deliverance from Poverty"
movement. Usupov speculated that the detention is aimed at stopping
Turgunaliyev from organizing further protests and preventing the new
movement from holding a congress scheduled for 21 December. -- Bruce

UN OBSERVERS IN TAJIKISTAN VICTIMS OF "MOCK EXECUTION." Two teams of UN
observers in Tajikistan were stopped at a government checkpoint,
verbally and physically abused, and subject to forced to stand in a line
for a mock execution, according to an 18 December UN press release. The
teams were traveling to Garm to verify reports of cease-fire violations
in the area when they were stopped at the Saripul post. Their
communications equipment was confiscated and members of the teams were
ordered to line up in a field for execution. Government soldiers then
fired above and around the men. The UN team was able to escape when the
appearance of a car on the road diverted the soldiers' attention. This
is the second time this month that government forces have mistreated UN
observers. -- Bruce Pannier

SERBIAN PRESIDENT MEETS WITH STUDENTS . . . As mass demonstrations
continued across Serbia and the independent trade union Nezavisnost led
another huge rally in Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic met with
students on 17 December. A student delegation which had marched to
Belgrade from Serbia's second largest city, Nis, delivered Milosevic a
protest letter and samples of spoiled ballots. The opposition Zajedno
coalition has accused of vote-rigging in the 17 November municipal
elections, costing it victories in a dozen municipalities. Milosevic
pledged to investigate allegations of electoral improprieties and a
state TV broadcast quoted him as saying, "Mistakes are always possible
... I assure you that this state will not protect someone who has broken
the law, whether that someone is a citizen or an official." -- Stan
Markotich
<p>
. . . BUT REMAINS DEFIANT. Milosevic also told the students he would not
tolerate their alleged promotion of foreign meddling in Serbia's
"domestic" affairs. "We must be completely clear, however much your
leaders go to embassies and send envoys and travel to world capitals, a
foreign hand shall not rule Serbia," Reuters quoted him as saying.
Meanwhile, the OSCE confirmed on 17 December that it would send a
delegation, headed by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, to
Belgrade to investigate circumstances surrounding the disputed 17
November election results. -- Stan Markotich

KOMMERSANT-DAILY 18 December 1996 pages 1, 3<br>
<p>
   Report by Georgiy Bovt:  "For Terrorists, 'Druzhba' [Friendship] Comes<br>
First" <br>
<p>
  Yesterday, more bloody news came from Chechnya:  Six employees of the<br>
International Red Cross Committee were killed in the village of Novyye<br>
Atagi.  All of them were foreigners working at a hospital.  Meanwhile, the<br>
controversy around the captured policemen continued:  Security Council<br>
Secretary Ivan Rybkin yesterday arrived in Groznyy to clarify the situation<br>
as Dagestan Security Council Secretary Magomed Talbeyev earlier in the<br>
morning went to the Gudermes district of Chechnya to negotiate with Salman<br>
Raduyev who had captured the policemen.  The reign of terror in Chechnya,<br>
however, will not prevent its leaders from holding negotiations on<br>
international cooperation in, of all places, Japan. <br>
   While Rybkin and Talbeyev try to reason with the kidnappers [preceding<br>
word an English borrow in Cyrillic]  the separatist leaders went to the<br>
Japanese Islands to discuss vast foreign economic plans.  At their press<br>
conference in Tokyo, Khozh-Akhmed Nukhayev, first deputy premier of the<br>
Chechen government; and Ruslan Chimayev, head of the Ichkerian Foreign<br>
Ministry, declared the intention of the Chechen leadership to create an<br>
international consortium with the participation of Ukraine and Poland to<br>
transport oil via Chechnya to Georgia.  The new consortium is, in<br>
particular, to build a pipeline through Ukraine to Poland and is to be<br>
subsequently linked to the Druzhba [Friendship]  oil export pipeline in<br>
order to pump oil going through Chechnya and the Georgian port of Poti.<br>
Mansur Yakhimchik, chief foreign policy adviser in the Chechen government,<br>
told ITAR-TASS that the ambitious idea has already received support "at the<br>
level of Polish and Ukrainian presidents."  It is quite natural considering<br>
that this idea fits well into plans hatched, in particular, in Baku and Kiev.<br>
   The intention is to organize the so-called Eurasian transport corridor,<br>
bypassing Russia.  In the current Chechen interpretation (which is, to all<br>
appearances, shared not only in Groznyy), bypassing Russia means going via<br>
Chechnya.  In the separatists' estimate, their option for transporting, say,<br>
Azerbaijani oil will be some 20 percent cheaper than "a purely Russian<br>
option" (by sea via Novorossiysk and then by pipeline via Bulgaria and<br>
Greece).  Groznyy is also pinning great hopes on a pipeline that could be<br>
extended to the republic's borders from the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. <br>
   So, the separatists have big plans for oil transit, primarily with<br>
respect to the Caspian International Consortium.  According to Terry Adams,<br>
head of the consortium's action committee, a preliminary route for the<br>
export of "primary" oil from the Azerbaijani sea deposits of Azeri, Chirag,<br>
and Gyuneshli will be approved in May 1997.  As is known, two routes have<br>
been defined for "early" oil: via Russia (Novorossiysk) and Georgia (Poti).<br>
Adams, however, said that at present "two to three route options" are being<br>
discussed: Along with the Baku-Jeihan (Turkey) and Baku-Novorossiysk routes<br>
there is also the possibility (it is also promoted by Moscow) of "bypassing<br>
the Bosphorous" via Burgas (Bulgaria) and Alexandropoulos (Greece).<br>
Earlier, Baku was quite unequivocal in supporting the idea of the Turkish<br>
route.  Ilgam Aliyev, vice president of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan,<br>
even now indicates that Baku still gives preference to the export of<br>
"primary" oil via Turkey because "the problems involved in accessing Black<br>
Sea ports are well known." Turkey, according to him, fully guarantees the<br>
security of the transportation. <br>
   And still Baku's position is no longer as intransigent as is used to be.<br>
Its readiness to discuss other route options (from the purely commercial<br>
point of view, it is more advantageous to have multiple market accesses --<br>
in particular, in order to knock down transit charges) has become more<br>
conspicuous in connection with at least two circumstances:  The end of the<br>
war in Chechnya and the shuttle diplomacy of Boris Berezovskiy who, among<br>
other things, discussed in Baku Russian oil transit routes.<br>
   The separatists back up their vast plans in the oil transit sphere by<br>
purely bandit-like actions: murders, kidnappings, and other acts of<br>
terrorism.  In this context, for instance, the recent attempts to export the<br>
"Chechen green revolution" to Dagestan should be attributed not only to the<br>
slogans of such outlaws as Raduyev concerning the "reunification of all<br>
Chechen lands," but also this purely pragmatic calculation:  a wish to<br>
scuttle all attempts by Russia to create a transport network and<br>
infrastructure in Dagestan that could make up for the loss of Chechnya.<br>
   The principal novelty of the current "oil" situation is also that the<br>
field commanders, having done the fighting, aspire to roles as active<br>
players in the big-time oil game in the region, seeking to create the<br>
impression that they are open to negotiation.  They have developed certain<br>
contacts, justifying such hopes, back during the war with Azerbaijan and<br>
Turkey.  In principle -- through certain circles -- such contacts could even<br>
be established with Moscow.  From the purely objective point of view, the<br>
Chechen route could even become a compromise between the key players: for<br>
instance, Moscow and Ankara.  Although each of them would in principle like<br>
to have full control.  There is good reason to believe that Turkish Prime<br>
Minister Tansu Ciller, who was yesterday in Moscow, in fact conducted a<br>
delicate conversation on the relations within the Moscow-Groznyy-Ankara<br>
triangle.<br>
   And still, it is rather difficult to ponder objectively and impartially<br>
on Chechnya and its current rulers.  Meanwhile, those who are building<br>
speculative schemes on oil pipelines, transport corridors, and linkages<br>
based on generous infusions from the Russian budget (in the hope that the<br>
Chechen black hole would prove highly lucrative) could be in for a nasty<br>
surprise that will come when these players learn from their own experience:<br>
It is very difficult to come to terms with people who kill doctors from the<br>
Red Cross, and for whom kidnapping and gangsterism have already become a way<br>
of life -- be it Ankara, Moscow, or faraway Tokyo.<br>

<p>
   Interview with Magomed Tolboyev, secretary of the Dagestani Security<br>
Council, by Igor Rotar:  "The Execution of Six Doctors Has Become a Crime<br>
Against Humanity.  This Action Is Aimed To Scuttle the Peace Settlement"<br>
<p>
  At the negotiations on the release of the 22 Penza special purpose militia<br>
[OMON] troopers, Dagestan is represented by Security Council Secretary<br>
Magomed Tolboyev.  Your correspondent got in touch with him on the phone.<br>
 [Rotar]  What impression did Raduyev produce on you?<br>
 [Tolboyev]  It is very difficult to negotiate with him.  He has, in effect,<br>
all trumps in his hands, and we have to tread very cautiously, even though<br>
his demands are inadequate, to it mildly.  This person has no doubts about<br>
his force whatsoever.  His confidence stems from, among other things, his<br>
firm belief in the early comeback of Dudayev.  But still, I am sure that we<br>
shall manage to resolve this problem, and all the hostages will be released,<br>
safe and sound. <br>
 [Rotar]  Will Raduyev lay down arms?<br>
 [Tolboyev]  Oh no.  Certainly not.  It is no use even trying to raise this<br>
question with him.<br>
 [Rotar]  Do Raduyev's fighters constitute a serious military force?<br>
 [Tolboyev]  They certainly do.  In Chechnya, familial (like in Dagestan)<br>
and clannish ties are very important.  So, in the Gudermes district, from<br>
which he hails, Raduyev is king and god; he commands an unquestionable<br>
authority.  Whatever might be said, this man has made a name for himself.  <br>
 [Rotar]  Are clashes between Raduyev's fighters and Chechen-Ichkerian armed<br>
forces possible?<br>
 [Tolboyev]  The Chechen-Ichkerian leadership will not do that -- at least<br>
not before elections. <br>
 [Rotar]  Do you think that this latest hostage taking was accidental or<br>
inevitable?   <br>
 [Tolboyev]  There is no question that this particular excess could have<br>
been avoided.  As is known, Raduyev was going to Khasavyurt to take part in<br>
a festival with our Dagestani Checheno-Akkins.  The leaders of Dagestan's<br>
Chechen community knew about that.  Had they warned me, there would have<br>
been no problem.  Now they are themselves upset that they did not do that.<br>
It is another matter that such excesses are also possible in the future.<br>
Especially given that the Gudermes district borders Chechnya.<br>
 [Rotar]  What preventive measures are the Dagestani authorities going to take?<br>
 [Tolboyev]  First of all, of course, the Dagestani border should be beefed<br>
up.  It is another matter that this should have been done much earlier, not<br>
now.  I, for one, spoke about that six years ago.  There is no hope that we<br>
can establish full border control in six months.  Gaps will certainly<br>
remain.  But we are trying to do what is in our power.  Thus, we have made<br>
sure that one regiment from both the 101st and the 205th Russian Brigades<br>
currently being withdrawn from Chechnya stay in Dagestan.  Unfortunately, we<br>
are simply in no position to accommodate more Russian troops.  It is also<br>
very important that Dagestanis do their military service in their republic.<br>
We should like all Russian military units deployed in the republic to be 50<br>
percent manned with Dagestanis.  Self-defense detachments should be formed<br>
in areas bordering Chechnya -- of course, without violating any Russian laws.<br>

<p>
   Interview with Foreign Intelligence Service [SVR] Director Vyacheslav<br>
Trubnikov by Andrey Poleshchuk under the "Special Services" rubric:  "The<br>
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Is Second To None in the World.  This<br>
Is the View of SVR Director Vyacheslav Trubnikov, Who Is Planning To<br>
Congratulate the New CIA Director On Assuming Office"<br>
<p>
  [Poleshchuk]  Vyacheslav Ivanovich, a year has passed since you were<br>
appointed to the post of SVR director.  Have you had more grounds for joy<br>
over your successes or disappointment at failures during this period of time?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  There is the following logic to an intelligence service:<br>
The more it knows, the more additional questions arise.  For this reason it<br>
is on rare occasions that an intelligence officer has the feeling of<br>
satisfaction with the results of his work.  As for joys and disappointments,<br>
I would rather speak about life's being saturated with both instead of<br>
trying to assess their proportions.<br>
   Intelligence is a fairly conservative thing, and so it finds evolutionary<br>
measures preferable to drastic ones.  Generally speaking, one should not<br>
forget the old maxim:  God gives one the strength to change what can be<br>
changed; patience, to put up with what cannot be changed; and intelligence,<br>
to distinguish one from the other.  By the way, not so long ago I saw this<br>
maxim pinned to the office wall of one of my Western colleagues -- a prayer<br>
of sorts for every day's work.<br>
   To sum up the results of the SVR's evolution, it has undergone serious<br>
restructuring, its staff has been trimmed, it has become leaner, more<br>
efficient -- I hope not to the detriment of the quality of its work.  We<br>
have relinquished globalism in the way we set our objectives, concentrating<br>
our efforts in the most crucial areas.  The legal framework of our activity<br>
continues to improve -- the federal law "On Foreign Intelligence" was<br>
approved a year ago.  Much has been done to open up the SVR to Russian<br>
society, although the specifics of intelligence operation inevitably place<br>
certain restrictions on our contacts with the press.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  How do you assess the results of the Russian intelligence<br>
service's performance in 1996?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  The SVR examines the results of its activity every year,<br>
like any state agency or a private firm, checking the realization of its<br>
plans, setting the effort and funds spent against the results achieved.  To<br>
assess the quality of our work in the most general outlines, I can only note<br>
that we are competitive at the international level -- something that far<br>
from all Russian enterprises can boast.  Seriously speaking, what is<br>
important for us is the generally positive assessment of our work by the<br>
country's leadership.  It will be noted for the taxpayer that his money was<br>
not frittered away by the intelligence service for nothing in 1996.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  It is well known that intelligence successes are classified<br>
as top secret information.  For this reason let me ask you only how many<br>
Yasenevo [SVR seat in Moscow] officers were decorated with state awards<br>
during this passing year?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  I can give you the combined figure -- about 80.  Yet edicts<br>
on giving awards to specific SVR officers who are still in service are, as a<br>
rule, secret in nature and currently we cannot give you this information<br>
without violating the law.  You will have to wait, maybe, for several dozen<br>
years.  I can recall with pride, however, that in the summer of this year as<br>
many as five foreign intelligence veterans were awarded the title of Hero of<br>
Russia by presidential edict for their outstanding contribution to ensuring<br>
our country's security.  Three of them -- Leonid Romanovich Kvasnikov,<br>
Anatoliy Antonovich Yatskov, and Leontina Vladislavovna Cohen (also known as<br>
Helen Kroger), unfortunately, were given this high award only posthumously.<br>
As for Vladimir Borisovich Barkovskiy and Aleksandr Semenovich Feklisov,<br>
although currently in retirement, they are still actively taking part in the<br>
training of young intelligence officers, are engaged in research and<br>
publicist activities.<br>
   Thanks to the efforts of these outstanding intelligence officers -- and<br>
very good and modest people at that -- our country obtained the most crucial<br>
materials on the military use of nuclear energy during the years of World<br>
War II, which enabled it within the shortest possible time to break the<br>
United States' monopoly in the area of nuclear weapons.  This might have<br>
been done later than it should have, but the country finally gave them due<br>
credit for their work.  Our thanks for the restoration of justice go to<br>
Russia and its president, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  When did you last meet with the president?  And who<br>
received reports of the SVR director during his forced absence from the Kremlin?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  I saw him last in July, when I delivered a report personally<br>
to the president.  After that I have not reported personally to anyone, but<br>
information from the SVR has been sent to the prime minister and government<br>
members.  The intelligence service knows very well who needs it and what he<br>
needs from it, and it fully meets the state agencies' requirements.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  The end of the year was marked by two noisy scandals that<br>
appear to have added a considerable degree of tension to Russian-American<br>
relations, particularly, in the relations between the SVR and the CIA.  I<br>
mean the case of former SVR Colonel Vladimir Galkin and the arrest of Harold<br>
Nicholson, a Langley officer accused of spying for Russia.  First, a ritual<br>
question:  Does the SVR recognize having ever recruited Nicholson?  Second,<br>
what would you say about the theory whereby freedom for Galkin was paid for<br>
by the surrender of Nicholson?  Generally speaking, do you think there is<br>
any connection between these two developments?  Third, what did you think<br>
about the words of John Deutsch, now a former CIA director, who emphasized<br>
at his news conference he gave jointly with his FBI counterpart, Louis<br>
Freeh:  "We should display vigilance with regard to attempts by Russia and<br>
other hostile intelligence services to infiltrate into the structure of<br>
agencies dealing with matters of U.S. national security."  Fourth, how do<br>
you assess the work of the domestic media and the SVR press bureau during<br>
these conflict situations?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  First of all, let me remind you that in keeping with the<br>
practice of all intelligence services around the world the SVR  does not<br>
discuss publicly -- therefore, neither confirms nor denies -- reports<br>
alleging that one Russian citizen or another or citizens of other countries<br>
may have been involved in its operations.<br>
   In the case of former SVR officer Vladimir Galkin, we had to make an<br>
exception from that iron rule, struck as we were by so blatant a<br>
provocation.  The actions of the U.S. special services created a dangerous<br>
precedent for the future, but most important not one Russian citizen should<br>
be left to his own devices without his state's assistance.  The<br>
circumstances of Galkin' release are currently well known all over the<br>
world, and there are no grounds whatsoever for any speculation on that<br>
score.  Galkin's release was the result of concerted actions by Russian<br>
state agencies -- the SVR, Federal Security Service [FSB], and the Foreign<br>
Ministry -- at several levels at that, and, finally, personal intervention<br>
by Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian government, who gave a call<br>
to U.S. Vice President Albert Gore.  We cannot but point out the dignified<br>
and courageous line of conduct in that situation by Galkin himself -- he<br>
flatly rejected all FBI attempts to cajole him into cooperation, thus laying<br>
the firm foundation for measures aimed at securing his release to succeed.<br>
   Calls by the CIA director on American state agencies to step up their<br>
vigilance are a fully normal and understandable phenomenon.  For its part,<br>
the SVR has always called for greater vigilance at Russian state agencies,<br>
where, by the way, things in this regard stand much worse than in the United<br>
States.<br>
   As for assessing the actions of the Russian media, I would like to<br>
express yet another time our heartfelt thanks on behalf of all our<br>
employees.  Support of the official stance by the Russian press, television<br>
and radio, their impartial and competent comments on the gist of the problem<br>
expedited the positive outcome of this case.  We are also pleased with the<br>
way the SVR press bureau was operating during those days.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  It is an open secret how much money the U.S. government<br>
appropriated to the U.S. intelligence community and, separately, to the CIA<br>
for 1997.  If I am not mistaken, the CIA got more than $3 billion.  As a<br>
taxpayer, I would like to learn the size of the SVR's annual budget, on<br>
which no information has ever been disclosed.  Could you lift this veil of<br>
secrecy over this subject?  And give at least an approximate number of<br>
foreign intelligence officers into the bargain?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  It is not the intelligence service that passed the law on<br>
state secrets, so it is not up to us to disclose the size of our annual<br>
budget or the number of intelligence officers.  As far as we know, the CIA<br>
itself has never officially revealed data relating to its budget or its<br>
payroll.  Yet, knowing the state of our two countries' economies you can<br>
yourself guess the approximate ratio of the Russian special service's<br>
financial, material, and personnel resources to those of its American<br>
counterpart.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  Who exercises control over the SVR's activity, in what<br>
form, and how often?  How many times have you delivered reports to<br>
Federation Council members and State Duma deputies?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  The current legislation set clear-cut rules of control over<br>
intelligence activity.  This function falls under the jurisdiction of the<br>
president and the parliament of the Russian Federation.  Supervision over<br>
the way the foreign intelligence service complies with federal laws is<br>
exercised by the general prosecutor of the Russian Federation and the<br>
prosecutors he assigns.<br>
   The intelligence service tries to maintain the closest possible contacts<br>
with the Federal Assembly at the most diverse levels.  My deputies and I<br>
meet regularly with representatives of the legislative branch.  Recently we<br>
were audited by the Comptroller's Office.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  Did the comptrollers find any shortfall?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  There was certain criticism -- not for misappropriations,<br>
but for some mistakes unrelated to the financing of our main activity.  We<br>
have constructive relations with all controlling agencies.  Absolutely all<br>
of them.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  I would like to dwell on the subject of the SVR's<br>
relationship with non-government organizations.  It is obvious that in<br>
Russia the state authorities have merged with powerful financial groups.<br>
The consequences of this process probably cannot but affect the domestic<br>
special services, including the foreign intelligence service.  It is no<br>
secret that the so-called information-analysis services, administration,<br>
departments, and so forth, which operate within large banks, groups, and<br>
corporations are essentially but intelligence and counterintelligence<br>
agencies.  Highly professional ones at that, because they are for the most<br>
part staffed with former officers of Russian special services.  Many of them<br>
have not only retained their ties with their former colleagues at the FSB,<br>
Federal Government Communications and Information Agency [FAPSI], Main<br>
Intelligence Directorate [GRU], the Internal Affairs Ministry, and so forth,<br>
but they try to engage them in cooperation.  Do you make provision for this<br>
circumstance when organizing work to ensure your own security?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  Yes, of course, the SVR leadership takes into account the<br>
threat of unauthorized information leaks outside the intelligence service.<br>
There are temptations that are based on the very inadequate pay we get for<br>
our work.  This is our headache, something with which the intelligence<br>
service leadership has always fought and will always fight.  We proceed from<br>
the assumption that foreign intelligence services cannot participate in<br>
domestic competitive struggles.  We shall not help one bank make money at<br>
the expense of another.  This is not our business.  It is another matter if<br>
the interests of our Central Bank are at stake when it seeks more profitable<br>
terms of investing capital abroad -- here we do have our say.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  Some time ago the press actively discussed the possibility<br>
of creating a Russian intelligence community, whose operation, modeled on<br>
U.S. experience, should be coordinated and guided by the foreign<br>
intelligence director.  At the time we learned your skeptical attitude to<br>
this idea.  Have you not changed your views?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  The idea of setting up the Russian intelligence community<br>
has been periodically put forward by the political and government circles of<br>
our country; in so doing various advocates of this idea sometimes pursue<br>
diametrically opposed objectives, which often have nothing to do with<br>
intelligence itself.  In the end, it is always not the appearance, but the<br>
essence that matters.  At present the objectives of intelligence activity<br>
are set by the president of the Russian Federation.  The SVR is represented<br>
on the Security Council and the Defense Council, it participates in the work<br>
of various interagency groups and commissions.  The coordination of<br>
operations by various intelligence services of the country is carried out on<br>
the basis of bilateral agreements and existing working contacts.<br>
Definitely, this system can and should be improved, but this should be done<br>
in a thought-out manner, putting above anything else the objective of<br>
improving its effectiveness and saving human and material resources.  As for<br>
yet another state bureaucratic structure modeled on foreign patterns, we do<br>
not need it.  In the meantime, the existence of an intelligence community in<br>
the United States is, in my view, predetermined first and foremost by the<br>
aggressive orientation of U.S. special services, which concentrated<br>
three-fourths of their efforts on the territory of the USSR.<br>
   [Poleshchuk]  Did Aleksandr Korzhakov, former chief of the Presidential<br>
Security Service, try, if not to bring the SVR under his control, then at<br>
least engage its assistance in order to realize what was reportedly his<br>
overriding idea of creating an intelligence super-service?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  As for Aleksandr Vasilyevich Korzhakov in person, my answer<br>
will be unequivocal and short:  He did not.  Yet this idea has periodically<br>
resurfaced, coming from the entrails of the Russian state apparatus.<br>
Undoubtedly, both the joint and separate existence of intelligence and<br>
counterintelligence services has its pros and cons.  In 1991, however, a<br>
crucial choice was made in favor of the SVR's independent existence, and<br>
currently we think that, on the whole, taking account of all these pros and<br>
cons, everyone -- both the intelligence service and the Russian state<br>
apparatus -- have benefited from that.  The main thing is that for the first<br>
time since our inception we were given the opportunity of direct access to<br>
the country's leadership, to whom we can report information without the<br>
filters or censorship of our superiors within a joint agency.<br>
   When such questions are discussed, one should also not forget the fact<br>
that any large-scale reorganization will automatically disrupt the normal<br>
operation of all special services participating in it for a long period of time.<br>
  [Polishchuk]  At all times in various countries there have always been<br>
certain contradictions between the intelligence and counterintelligence<br>
services.  Do tensions arise between the SVR and the FSB?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  We do have certain contradictions and tensions with the<br>
counterintelligence services of other countries.  As for the FSB, we<br>
maintain good, close working and personal contacts with our<br>
counterintelligence officers.  We are not just colleagues, we are comrades.<br>
All problems that might arise are resolved within the framework of<br>
agreements our agencies sign.  As has already been noted, the FSB's stance<br>
largely expedited Galkin's release, and we are sincerely grateful for that.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  What has happened to the series of the so-called open SVR<br>
reports on the most urgent problems of our time?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  This series will be continued.  Given the interest our<br>
previous reports have generated in this country and abroad we do not want to<br>
spend our efforts on trifles, and for this reason we are now particularly<br>
careful in selecting subjects for further publication.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  One of the reports that has already been published set<br>
forth the SVR's fairly tough stance on NATO expansion.  Has it changed?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  No, it has remained just as tough and it fully corresponds<br>
to that of the Foreign Ministry.  We are categorically opposed to NATO<br>
expansion.  This does not and cannot suit us!  Such is the presidential<br>
directive.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  It is considered inappropriate to report the SVR director's<br>
meetings and talks as well as his foreign trips.  Could you violate this<br>
taboo today and give us a brief account of the work you have done in this area?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  To maintain contacts with various intelligence and<br>
counterintelligence services of foreign states is one of the new and fastest<br>
growing areas in our activity.  It is a matter of collaboration on the basis<br>
of the strict accounting of Russian national interests -- naturally, our<br>
partners, too, proceed exclusively from the interests of their countries.<br>
Priority issues during such contacts are the problems of combating such<br>
international threats as the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass<br>
destruction, international terrorism, drug trafficking and illicit arms<br>
trade, and the search for and release of hostages as well as citizens of<br>
Russia and CIS countries who are reported missing.  Meetings of intelligence<br>
service chiefs are undoubtedly useful, if only because they enable us to<br>
become better acquainted with one another and to avoid unnecessary<br>
complications in the future due to the absence of the right understanding of<br>
the other party's intentions, since we have by no means ceased our main<br>
activity.  As for me, I have visited eight countries during this past year.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  Anthony Lake was appointed the new CIS director.  Is it<br>
appropriate for intelligence service chiefs to congratulate each other on<br>
the occasion of assuming office or to send best wishes when they resign?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  Yes, it is.  When Mr. Lake officially assumes office, I will<br>
undoubtedly send him a congratulatory telegram.  Even if the previous CIA<br>
director, Mr. Deutsch, did not think it necessary to congratulate me on my<br>
new appointment.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  Who do you think forms the club of the world's top<br>
intelligence services?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service is second to none!<br>
Next comes Britain's SIS and Israel's Mossad.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  The dream of any intelligence service of the world is to<br>
infiltrate its mole into the central staff of its opposite numbers.  To all<br>
appearances, the Russian intelligence service, the SVR in particular, has<br>
been quite successful in that.  Your opponents are surely not sitting on<br>
their hands either.  How does the SVR currently ensure its own security?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  This is a very serious problem, and one can never say that<br>
everything possible has been done to ensure security or that we are secured<br>
against emergencies in this regard.  I can only emphasize that the SVR<br>
leadership keeps this aspect of our activity under its unremitting control.<br>
For understandable reasons I cannot go into detail.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  From time to time journalists return to the fate of Aldrich<br>
Ames, a former CIA officer and one of the most valuable "moles" in the<br>
history of international espionage.  It is well known that the U.S. court<br>
sentenced Ames to life imprisonment without the right of pardon for his ties<br>
with Moscow.  The U.S. Congress passed the law called "Debt of Honor" ["Dolg<br>
chesti"], which guarantees comprehensive assistance to the families of KGB<br>
and GRU officers who were executed by firing-squad according to Ames' leads.<br>
Has the SVR done anything to ameliorate his fate?  Does it give any<br>
assistance to the Ames family?  Can there arise a realistic situation where<br>
talks on exchanging Aldrich Ames could begin?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  You have finally forced me to quote our press bureau's<br>
formula:  The SVR does not discuss such matters.  We get information on the<br>
situation in which Ames and his wife, who is also in jail, have found<br>
themselves from Western media, because Russian journalists have not yet<br>
spoken to Ames.<br>
   Americans have a penchant for affectation and posturing, for this reason<br>
they pass laws without taking into consideration whether or not members of<br>
the families of KGB and GRU officers who were found guilty of espionage want<br>
this assistance.  We think that all factors should be taken into account in<br>
so sensitive a case.<br>
   [Polishchuk]  Some time ago a statement was made to the effect that the<br>
SVR will no longer use the journalistic profession as a cover for its<br>
officers.  Is this really so?<br>
   [Trubnikov]  I'd rather not tell you something that is untrue.<br>

MONITOR - A DAILY BRIEFING ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
<p>
NEWS:<br>
<p>
RADUEV STILL HOLDING HOSTAGES. As of last night, Chechen rebel leader Salman<br>
Raduev had not released any of the 22 Russian hostages he and his men are<br>
holding somewhere on the Chechen-Dagestan border. Negotiations are being<br>
conducted by Russian deputy Security Council secretary Boris Berezovsky. He<br>
told Russian TV that provisional agreement had been reached to release the<br>
hostages within the next 24 hours. But Raduev said he was still awaiting an<br>
apology from the Russian and Dagestani authorities and from the Russian<br>
media. (ORT, December 17)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE DOESN'T RULE OUT APPLYING TO JOIN NATO. Ukrainian deputy foreign<br>
minister Anton Buteyko stated at a Kiev briefing yesterday that Ukraine no<br>
longer rules out the possibility of a future application for NATO<br>
membership. Ukraine's decisions will depend on the Russian parliament's<br>
actions, Buteyko said, evidently alluding to the territorial claims recently<br>
raised by both chambers of that body. (Itar-Tass, December 17; see also<br>
Perspective section below) Ukrainian officials have recently issued several<br>
warnings along these lines, but Buteyko's statement is unusually explicit.<br>
<p>
LEBED WINS LAWSUIT. Aleksandr Lebed yesterday won his defamation case<br>
against Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov. The court found no evidence to<br>
support Kulikov's allegations that Lebed had been plotting a coup. No one<br>
had believed the allegations, though they served as the pretext for Lebed's<br>
ouster from his post as Security Council secretary last October. The court<br>
ordered Kulikov to retract his statement and to pay Lebed symbolic damages<br>
of one ruble--less than one-tenth of one cent. Kulikov said he would appeal.<br>
(NTV, Itar-Tass, BBC, December 17)<br>
<p>
UN REFUGEE COMMISSION WITHDRAWS STAFF FROM DAGESTAN-CHECHEN BORDER. The<br>
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is evacuating the four<br>
UNHCR officials who have been working in the Dagestani village, Khasavyurt,<br>
on the Chechen border. They will be resettled in the Dagestani capital,<br>
Makhachkala. The decision follows the murder of six Red Cross workers in the<br>
Chechen village of Novyie Atagi early yesterday morning. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 17)<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV CRITICIZED FOR SUPPORTING MILOSEVIC. Serbian opposition leader Vuk<br>
Draskovic slammed Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov during a Russian<br>
TV interview on December 16 for Primakov's outspoken support of Serbian<br>
president Slobodan Milosevic. Draskovic accused Primakov of backing "the<br>
last Communist dictator in Europe," and said that the Russian minister had<br>
"insulted democratic Serbia by supporting the theft of our votes by<br>
Milosevic."  Primakov had earlier praised Milosevic and said he opposed<br>
outside interference in Belgrade's "internal affairs." (NTV, Itar-Tass,<br>
December 16)<br>

<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS PROD RUSSIA ON TACTICAL NUKES; URGE START II<br>
RATIFICATION. Meeting in Brussels, NATO defense ministers yesterday called<br>
on Russia to complete the reductions of tactical nuclear weapons it had<br>
promised in 1991 and 1992. The ministers were meeting as the Nuclear<br>
Planning Group, which does not include France. They also urged Russia to<br>
make "additional significant reductions" in its tactical nuclear weapons<br>
stockpile once the earlier rounds of cuts had been completed. (NATO<br>
Communique, December 17) In October 1991, former Soviet leader Mikhail<br>
Gorbachev had pledged that Russia would destroy one-half of its nuclear<br>
warheads for surface-to-air missiles and tactical aircraft bombs by 1996,<br>
one-half of its naval tactical nuclear weapons by 1995, and all nuclear<br>
artillery shells by 2000. Yeltsin made similar pledges in January 1992. In<br>
September of this year, U.S. defense secretary William Perry complained that<br>
Russia was dragging its feet in destroying these weapons. (Associated Press,<br>
September 22. See Monitor, September 23)<br>
<p>
While some Russian military leaders and politicians have suggested that<br>
Russia might aim its strategic missiles at Eastern and Central European<br>
countries that join NATO, these weapons are hardly suitable for such a role.<br>
Tactical nuclear weapons are another matter, and this could explain Moscow's<br>
apparent reticence to make deep cuts in this category of weaponry before its<br>
relations with NATO are clarified. <br>
<p>
The NATO ministers also urged Russia to ratify the START II treaty. Here<br>
they got an unexpected ally. The previous day Army General Igor Sergeev,<br>
commander-in-chief of the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), threw his<br>
considerable weight behind the treaty. "We believe that Russia needs START<br>
II," he said, "because this document builds a balance of strategic nuclear<br>
forces." (Interfax, December 16) Many Russians have balked at some of the<br>
treaty's provisions, particularly the one that would eventually ban all<br>
land-based multiple-warhead strategic missiles. They feel that Russia has an<br>
advantage in this category and it would be prohibitively expensive to<br>
replace them with single-warhead missiles. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN COMPANIES SIGN MODEST OIL DEALS WITH IRAQ. Three Russian oil<br>
companies--LUKoil, Zarubezhneft, and Nafta Moskva -- signed contracts on<br>
December 15 to purchase Iraqi oil, and are awaiting what is expected to be<br>
quick UN approval for the deals. The Russian companies anticipate being able<br>
to begin moving the oil by January 10. In total, the purchases by the<br>
Russian companies will equal about 55,000 barrels per day, which is less<br>
than ten percent of the 600,000 barrels per day that the UN has permitted<br>
Baghdad to sell under a recently concluded "oil for food" deal. With those<br>
figures in mind, a Russian daily complained yesterday that Iraq has turned<br>
to Western companies to export much of its oil, despite the fact that Moscow<br>
had vigorously championed Baghdad's efforts to win a relaxation of<br>
international sanctions. Three other Russian companies -- Rosneft,<br>
Machinoimport, and MES -- are reported to be interested in buying Iraqi oil,<br>
but have not yet signed any contracts with SOMO, the Iraqi state oil trading<br>
agency. (UPI, Reuter, Kommersant-daily, December 17) <br>
<p>
On December 11 a Russian government official had cautioned that Russian<br>
companies might not profit greatly from the "oil-for-food" deal because<br>
non-Russian firms were in a better position to supply Iraq with the<br>
humanitarian goods that Baghdad will be allowed to purchase with its oil<br>
revenues. He suggested that earlier, well-publicized deals between Russian<br>
companies and Iraq were likely in the short term to bring the former only a<br>
"few tens of millions of dollars." (Interfax, December 10)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA AVOIDS RECOGNITION OF UKRAINE'S BORDERS. In the midst of a visit to<br>
South Korea, Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma said yesterday that a<br>
possible Russian-Ukrainian conflict over Sevastopol "would be a grave crime<br>
against humanity." Also yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry's chief<br>
spokesman, Gennady Tarasov, stated at a briefing that Moscow "cannot<br>
comprehend" a statement from the Ukrainian parliament that rejected Russian<br>
"territorial claims" to Sevastopol. "The official position of Russia's<br>
executive branch is that Sevastopol and Crimea belong to Ukraine," Tarasov<br>
said. In Kiev, however, the Ukrainian General Staff's chief cartographer,<br>
Col. Vyacheslav Zhyhulin, complained that the Russian side is leaving<br>
unanswered Ukraine's repeated proposals to proceed with the delimitation and<br>
demarcation of their mutual, 2,063 kilometer-long border. Romania has<br>
adopted the same attitude, Zhyhulin said. By contrast, Slovakia has<br>
completed, and Poland and Hungary are well on their way toward completing,<br>
the demarcation of their respective borders with Ukraine. In Odessa for<br>
talks with Moldovan officials, Ukrainian deputy foreign minister Konstantin<br>
Hrishchenko (who handles border delimitation and demarcation talks with<br>
Ukraine's neighbors) said that the work on that sector is advancing in "the<br>
most propitious atmosphere." (UNIAN, December 16; Interfax-Ukraine, December 17)<br>
<p>
All of these countries, with the exception of Slovakia, have had historical<br>
and post-World War II border problems with Ukraine. But only Russia and<br>
Romania have questioned independent Ukraine's borders since 1991. Romania's<br>
new, right-of-center president and government signaled last week that they<br>
are prepared to change that position. That would leave Moscow alone in the<br>
position of questioning Ukraine's border.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
SHEVARDNADZE APOLOGIZES TO UKRAINE FOR RUSSIAN "PIRACY," BUT PROBLEMS WITH<br>
RUSSIAN BORDER TROOPS MULTIPLY. Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze told<br>
the country during a radio broadcast that the Russian border troops' recent<br>
seizure of the Ukrainian ship Almaz and its crew in Batumi, Georgia<br>
"amounted to piracy." Shevardnadze apologized to Ukraine in the name of the<br>
Georgian government for the Russian action on Georgian territory. (See<br>
Monitor, Western Region section, December 16) The Georgian parliament's<br>
defense and security commission chairman, Revaz Adamia, and the commander of<br>
Georgian border troops, Maj. Gen. Valeri Chkheidze, stated that the Russian<br>
border troops' action in Batumi has undermined prospects for Georgian<br>
ratification of the 1994 treaty with Russia on "joint protection" of<br>
Georgia's borders. (Radio Tbilisi, December 16; Interfax, December 15-16)<br>
The Russian authorities released the crew and the ship on December 15, after<br>
having detained them incommunicado for 11 days, but the captain is still<br>
being held. <br>
<p>
It appears, moreover, that Tbilisi faces more problems with Russian border<br>
troops. A delegation representing Russia's Stavropol krai arrived yesterday<br>
in Batumi for direct talks on bilateral trade and economic cooperation with<br>
Ajaria, which is a part of Georgia. Strangely, the delegation included Maj.<br>
Gen. Vladimir Gorodinsky, the commander of Russia's Caucasus Special Border<br>
district. (Interfax, December 17) In the Almaz incident, the Russian border<br>
troop command had dealt with the Ajarian authorities behind Tbilisi's back.<br>
The command seems to be engaged in a policy of encouraging the Ajarian<br>
authorities to enter into direct relations with Russia.<br>
<p>
At Georgia's opposite end, in South Ossetia, Russian border troops are<br>
blocking the transit of passengers and goods at the Georgian-Russian border<br>
in either direction. The Georgian side of that sector is "protected jointly"<br>
by Russian and Georgian border guards. The latter are powerless to change<br>
the situation, which Tbilisi considers to be an "economic blockade."<br>
(Iviria, December 12)<br>
<p>
ROUTING AZERBAIJANI OIL: CHECHNYA WANTS ITS SHARE "OR ELSE." The Chechen<br>
government demands a share in the project to pump Azerbaijani oil via<br>
Chechnya to the Russian port Novorossiisk, a Chechen government<br>
representative identified as Eduard Hachukaev stated yesterday in Baku. He<br>
said that he had participated in talks with top management of the Azerbaijan<br>
International Operating Company (AIOC), and had notified the consortium that<br>
it "must take Chechnya's interests into account, or else oil will not be<br>
transported on the Baku-Novorossiisk route. Moreover, it will not be<br>
transported through another North Caucasus route either." Hachukaev claimed<br>
that the existing pipeline's stretch through Chechnya is in good condition.<br>
(Turan, December 12)<br>
<p>
Moscow wants a large portion of the oil output from Azerbaijan's "deal of<br>
the century" to be detoured through Russia via the North Caucasus. Although<br>
the AIOC considers that route as one option, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia<br>
favor the shorter and safer export route in the opposite direction. During<br>
the recent war, Chechen leaders had threatened to foil any Russian-AIOC<br>
deal, offering to negotiate with the AIOC themselves for a cut of the<br>
revenue. Moscow now hopes that the end of the war will facilitate the AIOC's<br>
acceptance of the Russian route and induce the Chechens to cooperate in<br>
guaranteeing the pipeline's security. Yesterday's warning undermines that hope.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TURKISH INTEREST IN KAZAKHSTAN REAFFIRMED. Turkish president Suleyman<br>
Demirel yesterday completed a two-day official visit to Kazakhstan on the<br>
fifth anniversary of the country's independence. (See Monitor, December 17)<br>
Demirel agreed to open a Turkish credit line of $300 million, on top of the<br>
$1.2 billion already invested by mostly small- and medium-size Turkish firms<br>
in Kazakhstan. He also cut the ribbon of a Turkish bank and a Turkish-funded<br>
college in Almaty, and discussed with President Nursultan Nazarbaev the<br>
participation of Turkish companies in building up Kazakhstan's new capital<br>
city Akmola. Nazarbaev expressed the wish that the largest Turkish firms<br>
also invest in Kazakhstan. He praised Turkey for "standing by Kazakhstan at<br>
every step of its development as an independent state." Approximately 2,000<br>
young Kazakhs are studying in Turkey. The two presidents termed their<br>
peoples "fraternal" on the strength of their common Turkic origins.<br>

OPPOSITION OFFERS NEW ELECTIONS<br>
<p>
By Yekaterina Sytaya<br>
<p>
_Armenia_=20<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From NG=92s folder:</i><br>
<p>
Vazgen Manukian was born in 1946. In 1963 he was admitted to Yerevan State<br>
University. In 1966 he was transferred to Moscow State University but after<br>
he participated in a demonstration of protest at the embassy of Turkey in<br>
Moscow he was forced to go back. Manukian graduated from Yerevan State and<br>
got his Ph.D. in mathematics and physics from the Novosibirsk branch of the<br>
USSR Academy of Sciences. In July 1988 he became the coordinator of the<br>
Karabakh Committee. On December 10, 1988 he along with other Karabakh<br>
Committee activists was arrested and spent six months in the Matrosskaya<br>
tishina (Sailors=92 Silence) prison. In 1989 he was elected an honorable<br>
citizen of the city of Grenoble, France. He was the first Chairman if the<br>
Board of the ANM.  In 1990 he was elected to the Supreme Soviet of Armenia.<br>
In 1991 Manukian was Prime Minister, In 1992-1993 acting Minister of<br>
Defense. Today he is the leader of one of the major opposition parties NDU<br>
(National Democratic Union).   =20<br>
<p>
__ On the eve of presidential elections five opposition parties of Armenia<br>
united and supported you as the candidate for elections. Are there any<br>
chances that the electoral coalition will become a political bloc?  =20<br>
<p>
__ We united for the term of elections and six months after elections. We<br>
hoped to conduct new fair and free elections to the National Assembly and a<br>
referendum on the new Basic Law of Armenia. New Constitution  would balance<br>
branches of power in Armenia by limiting the executive, presidential power,<br>
and reinforcing the legislative power, the parliament. Upon resolving these<br>
problems, each party of the electoral coalition would go back to individual<br>
political  activity according to economic and political program. Truly<br>
democratic countries have a bright palette of political colors. In<br>
pseudo-democracies colors are black and white. In the events of September 25<br>
it was not only the opposition and its supporters who gathered near the<br>
parliament but also those who voted  for Levon Ter-Petrosyan.  They, too,<br>
demanded that the results of elections be verified.  When authorities and<br>
nation form antagonistic relations opposition easily unites.   Elements that<br>
differentiate opposition parties become insignificant before  common tasks.<br>
<p>
On September 25-26, formally,  no changes took place in Armenia but the<br>
nation came to realize that it lives not in a democratic country. The only<br>
mechanism which can change this situation is new elections. It is hard even<br>
to utter words like "uprising" today, but, as many see it in Armenia, all<br>
democratic methods of struggle have been exhausted.  =20<br>
<p>
__ You have returned to your party=92s office which was sealed after=<br>
 September<br>
events. Does not this mean that the authorities have made the first step<br>
towards a dialogue and democracy?=20<br>
<p>
__ The process of transition to democracy in Armenia as in the entire Soviet<br>
Union began in 1988 and then Armenia was ahead of all other Republics. The<br>
problem of Karabakh forced our society to concentrate attention on political<br>
issues. As early as in 1988 we had elected to the Supreme Soviet four<br>
members of the opposition movement. The ANM came to power in Armenia in 1990<br>
as a result of democratic elections. In 1991 the election of Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosyan became a further step towards democracy.=20<br>
Now Armenia is sliding back. In 1995 elections to the National Assembly were<br>
falsified. The majority of the nation was reluctant about participation in<br>
presidential elections as authorities were imposing the view that the<br>
results were pre-determined. Many parties wanted to boycott elections. I<br>
took the responsibility of calling on others to try to change things once<br>
again by a democratic procedure.  In my opinion, Levon Ter-Petrosyan<br>
suffered an excruciating defeat in the elections. After the defeat he and<br>
his entourage did everything in their capacity to cling to power. We are in<br>
a dead alley of some kind now =96 the mechanism of elections is not trusted=<br>
 by<br>
the people. Under the circumstances the choices are wither to become<br>
enslaved by the regime or to rise against it. Both choices are unacceptable.<br>
That=92s why we are discussing another option. We think that the story is=<br>
 not<br>
over yet and we offer new presidential elections. If we can achieve that,<br>
then the concession of authorities will open a possibility for negotiations<br>
to find new gentlemen rules of the game and get back to the road towards<br>
democracy.=20<br>
<p>
__How realistic is that the power holders will ever agree to new elections?=<br>
=20<br>
<p>
__They will be forced to. That depends not only on us, but also on external<br>
conditions =96 what will they be for Armenia? Currently, there is an erosion<br>
of power in Armenia. Everybody understands that  Levon Ter-Petrosyan was not<br>
elected and as a result the gradually it becomes more difficult to run the<br>
country.  This can force authorities to start a dialogue on new elections.<br>
But a dialogue on sharing power we consider absurd. =20<br>
Had the view of Europarliament been expressed by one country or a group of<br>
countries, one could have concluded that the view was biased by ulterior<br>
interests in the region (NeGa: The resolution of Europarliament from<br>
November 14 put under suspicion results of elections and demanded runoffs in<br>
the precincts where violations of electoral law were registered.)  However,<br>
the resolution of Europarliament is general. European deputies do want to<br>
see Armenia democratic. Unfortunately, their opinions were not taken<br>
seriously in Armenia.  It was clear that the Constitutional Court under this<br>
regime could not arrive at a fair ruling but we still decided to apply as we<br>
were pursuing three goals: this gave Ter-Petrosyan and his entourage a<br>
face-saving opportunity to find an honorable exit from this situation since<br>
the illegitimacy of power is limiting Armenia=92s capabilities; it was an<br>
opportunity for us to present our views to the nation and to demonstrate how<br>
elections were falsified; and we had to try all democratic methods available<br>
despite their limitations.  =20<br>
<p>
--When did a discord begin between you and Ter-Petrosyan? After all you were<br>
so close both in Karabakh movement and in the ANM?=20<br>
<p>
__In 1988 I led the Karabakh Committee and started to invite new people.<br>
Among them was Ter-Petrosyan whom I did not know well before that. When in<br>
two years we came to power Armenia was not a presidential republic.<br>
Ter-Petrosyan was the Chairman of the parliament and I headed the<br>
government.  We did not have any political or economic bones of contention<br>
(he did not know anything in economics, anyway). Eventually I  walked out<br>
against my own team which had as a goal clinging to power at any cost. I<br>
could not but resign. In a sense we had a bourgeois revolution in Armenia<br>
and advanced ideas and concepts of private property but many of our friends<br>
gradually became interested only in personal wealth.  To the date by and<br>
large only members of that same team continue to get wealthier  in Armenia<br>
by using levers of power which they obtained only accidentally. =20<br>
<p>
-- In the post-Soviet space generally proponents of market economy are<br>
opposed to by people of less democratic political inclinations. In Armenia<br>
the situation seems to be unique. Why then confrontation resulted in<br>
introduction of troops after elections?<br>
<p>
In the US Democrats and Republicans are both for private property and free<br>
market. Their ideas too coincide by and large. In Russia, the "Gorbachev<br>
revolution" touche only two-three major cities whereas the heartland<br>
remained Communist in structure and in mentality. In Armenia the struggle<br>
for power is not between Communists and democrats but between democrats and<br>
pseudo-democrats.   The role of Communists in Armenia is really marginal =96<br>
their leader got only 6% of votes. As an ideology Communism was always weak<br>
in Armenia and since 1988 it broke beyond repair against Karabakh movement.<br>
Certainly, people feel nostalgic about the past but that is only because<br>
people want the state to play a larger role in protecting their social<br>
rights.  Armenian Communists today are speaking about restoration of the<br>
USSR. But that is against economic and political interests of Russia.=20<br>
<p>
__ There are however some other forms of cooperation. What is your take on<br>
Armenia=92s participation in integration processes. =20<br>
<p>
__To restore the Armenian industry we need economic levers. We can restore<br>
our economic potential to 20-30% by entering the common economic space but<br>
remaining an independent country. CIS integrational processes are extremely<br>
important for us. I think not a single former Soviet country can re-build<br>
its economic capacity without that integration.  But integration shall not<br>
be a result of some short-term  political interests when leaders of CIS<br>
countries exploiting the feeling of nostalgia of their respective<br>
populations sign meaningless documents.  Besides, to restore the economy<br>
Armenia needs large scale investments. Today we do not really know what<br>
happens to the IMF credits. Armenian economic progress is possible only<br>
under conditions of political democracy. If we find common economic<br>
interests with other CIS countries in developing our economies and creating<br>
jobs, we shall pursue such cooperation which will ultimately improve<br>
standards of living.   (Yerevan-Moscow) (end)=20<br>

TURKEY MAY OFFER A POLITICAL DEAL TO RUSSIA<br>
<p>
By Dmitrii Chernogorskii<br>
<p>
_Diplomacy_<br>
<p>
Today Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister of Turkey, Ms. Tansu<br>
Ciller is arriving in Russia. She was invited to visit Moscow by her<br>
opposite number, Evgenii Primakov. However, taking into consideration the<br>
experience of her previous numerous meetings with Prime  Minister<br>
Chernomyrdin in the capacity of Turkish Prime Minister, one may suggest that<br>
this time, too, conversations won=92t be limited by the protocol -- several<br>
Russian-Turkish agreements have been prepared for signing. =20<br>
<p>
Despite statements of the Turkish side that the bulk of the time will be<br>
devoted to economic issues, it is clear that some political problems in<br>
relations with Moscow of a serious concern to Ankara will be discussed.<br>
Among these problems one of the acute ones is the Kurdish problem. As<br>
previously, Tansu Ciller may try to secure the support of the Turkish<br>
position by the Russian Federation.  It is most probable that in exchange<br>
Moscow may ask assistance of Turkey in the dialogue with NATO against<br>
expansion plans of the alliance. This data was provided to NG shortly before<br>
the visit by well informed sources close to the PKK leadership which is<br>
fighting against the Turkish authorities.  The biased and highly negative<br>
attitude of these sources to the Turkish government is obvious. But it is<br>
quite logical to assume that such a scenario cannot be ruled out, the more<br>
so because Turkey and Russia are irreconcilable competitors, if not<br>
opponents, for spheres of influence in southern Russian border areas =96<br>
Transcaucasia and Central Asia. The competition has been increasingly tense<br>
in the recent years. =20<br>
<p>
Lately Turkey has been a target of harsh criticism from the USA and a number<br>
of European countries as well as international organizations for its abysmal<br>
human rights record in the areas of compact Kurdish settlements. The<br>
European Parliament has suspended $450 million credit line to Ankara and the<br>
decision on acceptance of Turkey to EU has been postponed to the year 2000.<br>
The military campaign of the Turkish government  against Kurdish separatist<br>
fighters has a negative impact on the economy of Turkey which in its turn<br>
scares foreign investors.=20<br>
<p>
Under the circumstances, Turkey may try to play the Russian card. Firstly,<br>
natural gas supplies from Russia may somewhat improve economic conditions.<br>
Secondly, the Western attention may be again attracted to the Turkish<br>
position on the Kurdish problem. =20<br>
<p>
Meanwhile Ciller=92s assurances that Turkey is opposed to NATO=92s expansion=<br>
 can<br>
hardly be sincere.  Lobbying Russian interests in Brussels is only a<br>
tactical step of the Turkish leadership albeit Ankara may even make some<br>
public statements on that issue. However, Russia=92s rejection of contacts<br>
with Kurds and recognition of their struggle as a terrorist activity may<br>
only result in the loss of Moscow=92s influence on a rather large Kurdish<br>
nation. It will not reinforce positions of Moscow in the dialogue with NATO<br>
but will deprive Moscow of maneuvering space against Ankara.=20<br>
<p>
Certainly, the importance of a country like Turkey and the need in a<br>
constructive cooperation with that country shall not be mollified. But it<br>
would not be expedient to make concessions on Russia=92s long-term interests<br>
even if those interests  are contrary to the positions of the partner in a<br>
dialogue. (end)  (Translated by AM)<br>

<p>
<p>
1. COURT TRANSCRIPT ISSUING DELAYS "DRO" APPEAL PROCESS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Combined Sources)-Delays in processing the official court <br>
transcripts raised concerns over the deadline to file an appeal <br>
regarding the so-called "Dro" trial.<br>
	Upon handing down the maximum allowable sentences, presiding <br>
Judge Edward Manoukian announced last Tuesday that defense <br>
attorneys had one week to appeal the decision. <br>
	However, according to an Armenpress correspondent, the <br>
defense attorneys received the court transcripts of the sentencing <br>
phase  Tuesday, one day before the Wednesday  deadline set by the <br>
court.<br>
	According to Armenpress, the delay in transcribing and <br>
distributing the court records was due to a lack of modern <br>
technology. Supreme Court clerks still use manual typewriters for <br>
transcription, Armenpress said.<br>
	Three defendants received death sentences, while others in <br>
the so-called "Dro" group trial were sentenced to three to 15-year <br>
prison terms, as the trial ended last Tuesday with Armenias <br>
Supreme Court determining that the alleged clandestine terrorist <br>
group had no links to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.<br>
	The court handed down death sentences to defendants Arsen <br>
Ardzrouni, Armen Grigorian and Armenak Munjoyan. The remaining <br>
defendants were sentenced in the following manner: Armen Zakarian, <br>
15 years; Hovik Mkrtchian, 10 years; Ara Harmandarian, six years; <br>
Edik Simonian, five years; Tatul Gabrielian and Gevork <br>
Alahverdian, three years each.<br>
	The court found that a group involved with so-called <br>
"banditism" engaged in drug trafficking and planned and executed <br>
the assassinations known as "Top 1" and "Kerop" operations, as a <br>
result of which Gagik Sahakian, Ashot Nercissian and his wife were <br>
murdered.<br>
	The court also found that ARF leader and Karabakh liberation <br>
movement organizer Hrand Markarian was in no way tied to the so-<br>
called "Dro" group, and thus was cleared of those charges. <br>
However, Markarian was sentenced to five years in prison on <br>
illegal weapons possession and forged documentation charges.<br>
	Co-defendant Gegham Manoukian was sentenced to three years <br>
in jail as an accessory.<br>
	The court found no direct links between Markarian and the <br>
so-called "Dro" group, thus absolving any alleged ties between the <br>
ARF and the purported clandestine group, although, according to <br>
initial charges the ARF-"Dro" relations  were conducted solely by <br>
Markarian. <br>
<p>
<p>
2. ARMS HANDED OVER VOLUTARILY, DEFENDANT TESTIFIES<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Co-defendants Gevork Gazarian, Ofik Assikian <br>
and Gagik Assikian, who had been charged with illegal possession <br>
of weapons in the "Trial of 31," said they had voluntarily handed <br>
over their weapons to the military police.<br>
	According to the court documents, these weapons were stored <br>
in Karapet Gazarians house during the meeting on the eve of the <br>
alleged coup. After the arrest of Manvel Yeghiazarian, commander <br>
of "Arapo" detachment, the weapons were reportedly taken to  Ofik <br>
Assikian-an acquaintance of one of the participants of the <br>
meeting.<br>
	Her co-defendants said Ofik Assikian voluntarily handed over <br>
the weapons to the military police, and Arthur Gazarian, another <br>
defendant, had also intended to do the same. It was revealed in <br>
court that Gazarian had never talked to the other defendants about <br>
a military coup.<br>
	According to the evidence, the defendants were detained and <br>
taken to a Mashtots regional police station. Gevork Gazarian and <br>
Gagik Assikian were in police custody for 72 hours without being <br>
formally charged.<br>
	According to Ofik Assikian, Vladik Karapetian, "was beaten <br>
and disfigured." Assikian and her son Gagik spent four months in <br>
custody, while Gevork Gazarian spent three months in custody. They <br>
were later released and advised not to leave the country.<br>
	The defendants said they had no information regarding the <br>
missing machine guns.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-As of Dec. 1, 1996, 156,909 people were <br>
unemployed in Armenia, of whom 48,237 live in Yerevan. Deputy <br>
Minister of Social Security Stepan Hayrapetian said that women <br>
make up 72 percent of the unemployed.<br>
	There were 131,705 unemployed people in Armenia on Jan. 1, <br>
1996. According to Hayrapetian, if compared to the previous year, <br>
the rise in unemployment was insignificant. The unemployment rate <br>
is currently 9.2 percent.<br>
	People between the ages of 30-50 make up the largest sector <br>
of the unemployed (71,625).<br>
<p>
<p>
4. ARMENIAN ARTISTS EXHIBIT IN CAIRO FESTIVAL<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenian artists Aram Issabekian, Samvel <br>
Hambartsoumian and Ara Hayatsian and sculptor Albert Avetissian <br>
took part in the sixth international art festival in Cairo, Egypt.<br>
	Since Sunday, each of the artists have exhibited three of <br>
their works-paintings and sculptures-in the halls of the Cairo <br>
National Arts Center.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. NEGOTIATIONS TO RESUME AFTER ELECTION OF MINSK CO-CHAIRMAN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Respublica Armenia)-The next round of negotiations for <br>
the resolution of the Karabakh conflict will be delayed until a <br>
new candidate for the position of co-chairman of the Organization <br>
for Security and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group is found, <br>
Russian mediator to the Group Yuri Yukalov said.<br>
	According to Yukalov, the problem will probably be resolved <br>
before the new year. He did not say whether military operations <br>
will resume under the current situation.<br>
	"I dont believe that the situation will last much longer," <br>
he said, and added that the opposition in Azerbaijan has called <br>
for a military/political resolution of the conflict. "We are <br>
interested in the official opinion of Azerbaijan, which is in <br>
favor of the continuation of negotiations," Yukalov concluded.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. NAYIRIT PLANT HEAD OPPOSED TO SALE THROUGH AUCTION<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Azg/Fact)-According to a new privatization program, the <br>
Armenian government plans to sell 16 large companies, including <br>
the Nayirit Rubber Plant, a joint stock company, through an <br>
international auction.<br>
	Selling the plant through an international auction would be <br>
a great mistake, and the government is making the wrong decision, <br>
since the largest companies in the world will do their best to buy <br>
Nayirit and shut it down, Gevork Nersissian, head of the plant, <br>
said.<br>
	According to Nersissian, Nayirit is a national wealth, and <br>
it is not right to sell it for a small amount of money which may <br>
have significant negative results for the whole country in the <br>
future.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. ARMENIANS ARRESTED ON POLAND-GERMANY BORDER<br>
<p>
WARSAW (Azg, Fact)-Sixteen Armenian citizens, including six <br>
children, were arrested by Polish authorities in an attempt to <br>
illegally cross the German border.<br>
	Polish sources reported that the 16 Armenians were traveling <br>
in a Volkswagen bus. The driver was also arrested.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. SCOUTING LEADERSHIP SEMINAR CONVENES IN AUSTRALIA<br>
<p>
SYDNEY-Homenetmen scout leaders from throughout the Diaspora <br>
gathered in Australia Saturday for the third Pan-Homenetmen <br>
Scouting Leadership Conference at Sydneys Payton Paul <br>
campgrounds.<br>
	Twenty-eight participants from the United States, Canada, <br>
Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, England, Jordan, Iran and Australia <br>
were present at the conference organized by the Homenetmen Central <br>
Executive, which was represented by four members.<br>
	The organization of the camp was entrusted to the Homenetmen <br>
Australia Regional Executive and Garbis Kabasakalian was named <br>
director of the 10-day seminar.<br>
	The official opening ceremonies of the camp took place at 3 <br>
p.m. local time with a flag ceremony, and opening remarks were <br>
made by Kabasakalian and Homenetmen Central Executive vice-<br>
president Varoujan Seropian.<br>
	At the onset of the seminar, each region presented a <br>
synopsis of its regional activities and a background on the <br>
Homenetmen organization in each region. The participants were then <br>
taken to the Armenian Cultural Centre for a reception, which was <br>
attended by Australian Prelate Archbishop Aghan Baliozian, <br>
chairman of Australias Minority Council Stepan Kirkyasharian, <br>
representative of New South Whales governor parliamentarian John <br>
Watkins, Armenian Revolutionary Federation At-Large Committee <br>
chairmen Panos Manjian, Australian Scouting Council <br>
representatives Kate Stringfellow and Row Pate, as well as <br>
Homenetmen Australian Regional Executive chairman Berdj Momdjian <br>
and Scout leader Levon Balkabanian.<br>
	All praised the role of the Homenetmen in the international <br>
scouting movement and emphasized the importance of its activities <br>
for the enhancement and longevity of the Armenian nation.<br>
	In his remarks, Seropian emphasized the Homenetmens role in <br>
the process of including Armenias Scouting Association by the <br>
International Scouting Association. He also thanked the Australian <br>
Scouting Organization and the Homenetmen Regional Executive.<br>
	The conference is scheduled to conclude on Dec. 23.<br>
	Participating from the Homenetmen Western USA were Vartug <br>
Yaghmourian, Harut Madenian, Shogher Kassardjian, Aline Aghababian <br>
and Armine Mendzikian.<br>
	The Homenetmen has been an active entity in the <br>
international athletic and scouting movements and has represented <br>
Armenia internationally.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. HEANEY HEADLINES READING IN SUPPORT OF ARMENIAN POETS<br>
<p>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.-Making a statement for increased support and <br>
backing of Armenian poets and writers currently living abroad, <br>
some 500 people gathered at Harvard University Dec. 2 on the <br>
occasion of a Benefit Reading for the Armenian Writers Union <br>
Publication Fund. <br>
	The event was sponsored by the New England Poetry Club and <br>
the Harvard Advocate. The guest readers of the evening were James <br>
Tate, Pulitzer Prize winner, and Seamus Heaney, Nobel Prize <br>
laureate in Literature in 1995.<br>
	The evening began with a welcome by Diana Der-Hovanessian, <br>
poet and president of the New England Poetry Club, and an <br>
introduction by Christopher Lydon, radio talk show host on WBUR in <br>
Boston, who connected the founding of the New England Poetry Club <br>
in 1915 to the beginning of the Armenian Genocide, when in April <br>
of the same year 200 Armenian poets were assembled and murdered in <br>
Istanbul. <br>
	He stressed the importance for the support of poets in <br>
Armenia, and read several poems written by modern Armenian poets <br>
and translated into English by Der-Hovanessian.<br>
	Carolyn Mugar, president of the Armenian Assembly, read <br>
modern poetry by women Armenian poets which were also translated <br>
by Diana Der-Hovanessian.<br>
	Lydon then introduced the first guest speaker, James Tate, <br>
Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts. Tate read <br>
many poems from his repertoire, including "A Knock on the Door," <br>
"Where Babies Come From," "Days of Pie and Coffee," "The <br>
Definition of Gardening," and "Dream On." His poetry, touched with <br>
a flair of humor and, at times, surrealism, was well received by <br>
the audience. <br>
	Tates books of poetry include Selected Poems published in <br>
1991, for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the William <br>
Carlos Williams Award, and most recently, Worshipful Company of <br>
Fletchers.<br>
	Seamus Heaney, Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard University, <br>
followed as the last reader of the evening. <br>
	He began first by explaining his inspiration from an <br>
Armenian poet who wrote the poem "Journey to Armenia," dealing <br>
with the return to the senses and the overcoming of writers block <br>
while living in the Soviet Union during the 1920s. <br>
	The poet traveled to Armenia in order to conquer the <br>
repression of his instincts and conscience, and wrote the poem <br>
thereafter. Heaney was first introduced to Armenian poetry and the <br>
plight of the Armenians by his friend, Professor and poet Peter <br>
Balakian.<br>
	Heaney read many of his poems including "Two Lauries," "The <br>
Lupines," "The Key," "The Guttural Muse," and his own translation <br>
from Old English of the last 50 lines from the epic poem <br>
"Beowulf." <br>
	His readings evoked a sense of loneliness, and an attachment <br>
to nature with bold phrases and thought-provoking schemes.<br>
	Heaneys works include Selected Poems, 1966-1987 and The <br>
Spirit Level.<br>

HEADLINE: IMF Says Armenia Needs to Get Back on Reform Track <br>

 <br>
Armenia must make corrections to its economic course after recent problems<br>
with reform, the head of the International Monetary Fund delegation to the<br>
country, Thanos Satsambas, said on Monday. <br>
<p>
"We have found certain digressions from the programme we had approved and we<br>
are trying to find ways to put it back on track in January or February," he<br>
told a news conference. <br>
<p>
"This time it is not a crisis," he added, referring to vc the reform process.<br>
"But things have to be returned to their normal shape." <br>
<p>
He said government plans to allow inflation to climb to an annual 14 percent<br>
in 1997 after this year's approximately 10 percent were not acceptable to the<br>
IMF. <br>
<p>
"We cannot agree to this level of inflation for 1997. If it is possible to<br>
have a 10-percent inflation this year, it is not advisable to set it higher<br>
for 1997," Satsambas said. <br>
<p>
Inflation quickened to 2.4 percent in November from an average of two percent<br>
in September and October, and Satsambas said December inflation appeared to<br>
be quickening even faster. <br>
<p>
He said the system of commercial banks had to be re-shaped, allowing mergers<br>
and closures of weaker banks. <br>
<p>
Satsambas said Armenia had not met a number of economic targets. <br>
<p>
Government expenditures had not decreased as planned in 1996, while income<br>
was not meeting agreed-upon targets and central bank credits to the<br>
government had exceeded planned levels, he said. <br>
<p>
That put pressure on the national currency and reduced the central bank's<br>
reserves, he added. <br>
<p>
The mission last time visited Armenia in August and it was happy with the<br>
course of economic reform in the country. <br>
<p>
Armenia is among the few former Soviet republics where the economy showed<br>
signs of steady growth over the past several years.  Industrial output rose<br>
by 1.5 percent over the first nine months of the year, and Gross Domestic<br>
Product rose 4.5 percent. <br>

HEADLINE: Armenia Starts to Place the First Tranche of Government Bonds on<br>
December 18 <br>

<p>
The Central Bank of Armenia will start to place the first tranche of<br>
government coupon bonds on December 18, 1996, stated the bank's press<br>
service. <br>
<p>
The yield on bonds worth three million drams, each having a par value of<br>
10,000 drams, is expected at 54%. The bonds will be redeemed vc on a<br>
quarterly basis. According to bank experts, the issue of bonds will make it<br>
possible to raise 500 million drams. <br>

HEADLINE: Giant Plane's Cargo of Christmas Cheer <br>
SOURCE:  Press Association, December 16, 1996<br>
<p>
The world's biggest commercial plane took off from Liverpool Airport today -<br>
weighed down with Christmas cheer for thousands of needy children in Armenia.<br>
The Antonov 124 jet was carrying 65,000 shoe boxes packed with toys, gifts,<br>
letters and photographs collected by schools, churches and other<br>
organisations all over Britain since September for the seventh year of<br>
Operation Christmas Child.   Another 100,000 boxes have already set off from<br>
vc Dover in a convoy of 11 trucks bound for Romania, Russia, Belarus, and<br>
Serbia.  Leading UK parcel carrier Parcelforce donated a dozen vehicles to<br>
help in the massive exercise of collecting the shoe boxes from schools all<br>
over Britain and preparing them for their journey to Eastern Europe.  Dave<br>
Cook, 42, from Chester, founded Operation Christmas Child after seeing<br>
television pictures of needy children in Romania in 1990, but even he never<br>
dreamed the scale to which his initial idea would mushroom.  Mr Cook and his<br>
son Simon, 15, joined today's six hour flight to Armenia where they will<br>
spend a hectic few days helping to distribute the parcels.  Before taking off<br>
Mr Cook said "It will be touch and go whether we make it home to my wife and<br>
the other three children in time for Christmas - but it is well worth it for<br>
what we are doing.  "It is an amazing sight when you see the looks on the<br>
kids' faces as they open the boxes - that says it all really." <br>

HEADLINE: New Black Sea Link Could Ferry Caspian Oil to West <br>
SOURCE:  Reuter European Business Report, December 16, 1996<br>
<p>
Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan opened a new Black Sea ferry link on Monday,<br>
marking the start of a Euro-Asian Transport Corridor (EATC) aimed at bringing<br>
Caspian oil to the West. <br>
<p>
Ministers from the three countries signed deals in Ukraine's Black Sea port<br>
of Odessa to open the link between the nearby port of Illichyovsk and the<br>
Georgian port of Poti. <br>
<p>
"This is a very important event and it marks the start vc of a Euro-Asian<br>
transport corridor," Ukrainian Transport Minister Ivan Dankevich said. <br>
<p>
The ferry link could soon bring oil to Ukraine, which is heavily dependent on<br>
Russian oil supplies. <br>
<p>
The link is also a breakthrough for Georgia, largely isolated since the<br>
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 by years of conflict with separatists in the<br>
Transcaucasus republic. <br>
<p>
"The opening of the EATC is a necessary alternative for Georgia," said<br>
Georgian Transport Minister Merab Adeishvili. "Georgia hopes to become a<br>
bridge between Europe and Asia." <br>
<p>
The deal, also signed by Azeri Deputy Prime Minister Izzat Rustamov, would<br>
allow dry cargoes to be transported at first. <br>
<p>
But a new railway connection which can carry oil will be added in September<br>
next year, Dankevich said. <br>
<p>
An oil terminal with early capacity of 40 million tonnes is under<br>
construction at Pivdenny near Odessa but funds have been slow to reach the $<br>
300 million project. <br>
<p>
Georgian experts say that once construction at an oil terminal in Batumi is<br>
complete, 25 million tonnes (500,000 barrels per day) of Azeri oil could be<br>
delivered a year to Ukraine. <br>
<p>
Kiev currently imports 35 to 40 million tonnes (700,000 to 800,000 bpd) of<br>
oil a year, more than 30 million tonnes of it from Russia. <br>
<p>
Cargo volumes via the new link should be three to five million tonnes (60,000<br>
to 100,000 bpd) a year in the near future, reaching 20 million tonnes<br>
(400,000 bpd) by 2000 and more than 30 million tonnes 600,000 bpd) by 2010,<br>
transport officials say. <br>
<p>
Ukrferry, which will serve the route, plans to open another ferry link next<br>
month between Skadovsk and Poti and has already been serving a route between<br>
Illichyovsk and Bulgaria's Varna. <br>
<p>
The Illichyovst-Poti route leads on to a connection between the Azeri capital<br>
and the port of Turkmenbashi in Turkmenistan with onward links to Iran, the<br>
rest of Central Asia and China. <br>

SOURCE:  Itar-Tass, December 16, 1996 (Dicran Liloian)<br>
<p>
Azeri troops opened cross borderfire at targets in south-western Armenia<br>
overnight from Sunday to Monday,a spokesman for the Armenian Defence Ministry<br>
told Itar-Tass on monday. <br>
<p>
According to the spokesman, Azeri units poured machine-gun and tommy-gun fire<br>
at the village of Tsirani Dzor in Armenia's Syunik region. <br>
<p>
No one was killed or wounded, the vc spokesman said. <br>
<p>
The Armenian troops responded with "adequate retaliatory measures" to<br>
suppress the Azeris gun-fire attack. <br>
<p>
No incidents were reported at other sections of the Azeri-Armenian border,<br>
the spokesman said. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, reports from Baku said, the Azeri Defence Ministry refuted<br>
Armenian reports about Azeri gunfire attack across the border between the two<br>
states. <br>
<p>
The Azeri armed forces "strictly comply with the ceasefire regime in the<br>
conflict zone and along the Armenian-Azeri borders, agreed upon two and a<br>
half years ago under Russia's mediation," Itar-Tass was told at the Azeri<br>
defence ministry. <br>

le petrole azeri <br>
SOURCE:  Le Monde, December 14, 1996<br>
<p>
Robert Kotcharian est le president d'un pays de la taille d'un departement<br>
francais, reconnu par aucun Etat dans le monde, meme pas par la republique<br>
d'Armenie, voisine et amie: le Haut-Karabakh, une republique autoproclamee<br>
independante, peuplee d'Armeniens mais situee en Azerbaidjan le theatre du<br>
plus vieux conflit (neuf annees) de l'ex-URSS, ou un cessez-le-feu dure<br>
depuis mai 1994. Les entretiens qu'il a eus a Paris, du mercredi 11 au<br>
vendredi 13 decembre, ne pouvaient donc etre que prives, comme l'a souligne<br>
le Quai d'Orsay, ou M. Kotcharian a ete recu par un haut- fonctionnaire,<br>
avant de rencontrer un conseiller de l'Elysee. <br>
<p>
Mais le president du Haut-Karabakh, fort de son election triomphale le 24<br>
novembre, vc etait porteur d'un message: les interets recemment manifestes<br>
par la France pour le petrole azerbaidjanais pourraient nuire au negociations<br>
de paix dans sa region du Caucase, a-t-il explique lors d'un entretien<br>
accorde au Monde. M. Kotcharian faisait reference a la visite, le 11 octobre,<br>
du ministre francais des affaires etrangeres, Herve de Charette, en<br>
Azerbaidjan, ou la compagnie Elf est entree dans un consortium dirige par<br>
British Petroleum pour l'exploitation des immenses reserves petrolieres de la<br>
mer Caspienne le contrat du siecle. <br>
<p>
La France, ou vit une importante communaute armenienne (400 000 personnes)<br>
aurait, selon M. Kotcharian modifie sa position de soutien amical envers les<br>
Armeniens du Caucase. Il en veut pour preuve la declaration faite par le Quai<br>
d'Orsay au lendemain de son election, selon laquelle toute solution au<br>
conflit du Haut-Karabakh doit passer par la reconnaissance de l'integrite<br>
territoriale de l'Azerbaidjan. <br>
<p>
Difficile Processus De Paix <br>
<p>
La question du petrole ne doit pas etre liee a celle du statut du<br>
Haut-Karabakh, estime M. Kotcharian. <br>
<p>
Que ceux qui veulent profiter de ce petrole le fassent, ce n'est pas notre<br>
probleme. <br>
<p>
M. Kotcharian craint en effet que la question de l'exportation du petrole<br>
azeri vers l'Ouest par un eventuel pipeline reliant Bakou a la Turquie, via<br>
la Georgie, ne mene les pays occidentaux a bloquer l'accession du<br>
Haut-Karabakh a une reelle independance . <br>
<p>
Le dirigeant armenien se montre sceptique quant au difficile processus de<br>
paix dans le Haut-Karabakh, mene par le groupe de Minsk de l'Organisation<br>
pour la securite et la cooperation en Europe (OSCE). Dans ces negociations,<br>
a-t-il affirme, nous ne faisons confiance a personne, pas plus a la Russie<br>
qu'a l'OSCE, et ne comptons que sur l'Armenie et les communautes armeniennes<br>
dans le monde. La diaspora armenienne (3,5 millions de personnes) fournit<br>
depuis des annees d'importantes aides humanitaires et financieres aux<br>
Karabakhtsi. M. Kotcharian devait ces jours-ci effectuer une tournee des<br>
Armeniens de France, notamment a Marseille. <br>
<p>
Ce chef militaire beneficie de l'aura de celui qui avait mene, fin 1993, les<br>
combattants du Haut-Karabakh a la victoire fin 1993, lorsque ces derniers<br>
s'etaient empares d'une zone de securite autour de leur enclave. Les forces<br>
du Haut-Karabakh controlent un cinquieme du territoire de l'Azerbaidjan,<br>
ayant rattache par les armes le Haut-Karabakh a la republique d'Armenie. La<br>
reunification de ces terres historiques armeniennes, ouvertement souhaite par<br>
M. Kotcharian, est un fait accompli: les habitants du Haut- Karabakh et<br>
d'Armenie usent d'une meme monnaie. <br>
<p>
Nous contruisons notre Etat , dit sobrement M. Kotcharian, et nous ne nous<br>
retirerons des territoires que nous controlons que le jour ou nous aurons<br>
toutes les garanties necessaires de securite.  L'appui de la France,<br>
estime-t-il, fait a cet egard defaut. <br>

HEADLINE: Turks Hope U.S. Will Push Cyprus Pact <br>
SOURCE:  The New York Times, December 17, 1996<br>
<p>
With President Clinton's new foreign policy team now nominated, Turkish<br>
officials are wondering whether the expected American "big push" to resolve<br>
the festering Cyprus conflict, and perhaps the larger Greek-Turkish<br>
confrontation, will materialize in 1997. <br>
<p>
On Friday, Mr. Clinton sent a letter to Congressional leaders saying tensions<br>
on Cyprus have risen to "their worst level in many years." While not<br>
explicitly promising an initiative, Mr. Clinton vc referred to "the urgency<br>
of the current situation" and said his Administration was "committed to<br>
promoting a lasting peace on the island." He said recent outbreaks of<br>
violence "underscored the unsustainability of the status quo and the need for<br>
redoubled efforts toward a negotiated solution." <br>
<p>
In another sign that the world community may be preparing a new effort to<br>
resolve the dispute, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind of Britain arrived in<br>
Cyprus on Sunday for a round of meetings. It was the first visit to Cyprus by<br>
a British foreign secretary in more than 30 years. <br>
<p>
"I think there is a real scope for progress," Mr. Rifkind said today.  "One<br>
must acknowledge that it is not going to happen overnight, but that 1997<br>
ought to be the year in which perhaps the important breakthrough is made." <br>
<p>
The special United Nations envoy to Cyprus, former Foreign Minister Han Sun<br>
Joo of South Korea, announced recently that he was preparing for an extended<br>
stay on the island beginning in January. He will seek to organize "proximity<br>
talks" between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders. <br>
<p>
Many European diplomats say 1997 will be an ideal time to confront the Cyprus<br>
dispute and related issues, largely because the Greek Cypriot Government has<br>
applied for membership in the European Union.  The Greek Cypriots, they<br>
reason, can be told that they will not be admitted unless they make peace<br>
with their Turkish Cypriot neighbors. <br>
<p>
Turkish Cypriots, in turn, could be told that if they do not cooperate in a<br>
peace process, Greek Cyprus will be admitted to the European Union without<br>
them. If both sides can reach a broad agreement, the entire island could join<br>
as a single entity. <br>
<p>
 <br>
The Greek and Turkish Governments on Cyprus are responsive, respectively, to<br>
Athens and Ankara.  Any peace effort would have to include the patron<br>
Governments, either formally or informally. That might hold out the<br>
possibility of agreement on larger issues that divide Greece and Turkey. <br>
<p>
"Quite a bit of momentum has built up, and we are expecting the big push in<br>
the first half of next year," said Michael Lake, the European Union's envoy<br>
to Turkey. "All signs have been that after the American Presidential election<br>
and the appointment of the national security team, the United States would<br>
make a substantial effort. It would be aimed at bringing Cyprus into the E.U.<br>
as a bizonal, binational state." <br>
<p>
"Membership in the E.U. would be a great prize for everyone on the island,"<br>
Mr. Lake said. "It would give the Greek Cypriots what they want, the<br>
political and economic benefits of full integration with the European Union."<br>
<p>
<p>
"For the Turkish Cypriots, who are effectively stateless because of the<br>
international embargo on them, it would mean a secure prospect of recognition<br>
as part of the world community," he continued. "They would also become the<br>
first identifiably Muslim community inside the E.U., which could be very<br>
important for Turkey. All of this might also pave the way for a broader<br>
solution to problems in the Aegean between Greece and Turkey." <br>
<p>
After Mr. Clinton announced his nomination of Madeleine K. Albright to be<br>
Secretary of State, Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister, Necmettin Erbakan,<br>
praised her as a "positive and constructive person." The two met in Ankara in<br>
July, and Mr. Erbakan said he hoped that she would visit again soon. Ms.<br>
Albright also visited Cyprus in July. <br>
<p>
The Turkish Daily News, an English-language newspaper, said in a front-page<br>
article last week: "Albright is anticipated by both the Greek and Turkish<br>
Cypriots on the eastern Mediterranean island, as well as in the Turkish and<br>
Greek capitals, to place Turkish-Greek disputes and the Cyprus problem at the<br>
very top of her 'first to be dealt with' list of foreign policy targets. That<br>
anticipation, of course, is creating nerves on both sides." <br>
<p>
The state-run Anatolian News Agency quoted unidentified Turkish diplomats as<br>
saying Ms. Albright's appointment was "something favorable from our point of<br>
view" because she had visited Turkey and had "no known bias in favor of one<br>
of the sides in the Turkish-Greek and Cyprus disputes." <br>
<p>
Turkish governments have traditionally been friendly toward the United<br>
States, but they instinctively mistrust American efforts to mediate<br>
Greek-Turkish disputes because they fear that potent Greek and Armenian<br>
lobbies in the United States will force American diplomats to take<br>
anti-Turkish positions. <br>
<p>
Tensions between Greeks and Turks on Cyprus have been almost continuous since<br>
1960, when Britain granted the island independence. In 1974, fearing that<br>
Greece's military dictatorship was planning to absorb the island and turn it<br>
into Greek territory, Turkish leaders sent troops there. About 35,000 remain,<br>
and the "green line" dividing the Turkish and Greek zones has become one of<br>
the world's tensest borders. <br>
<p>
The Greek Cypriot Government is internationally recognized, while the Turkish<br>
Cypriot state, declared in 1983, is recognized only by Turkey.  There is<br>
almost no contact between the two, and the bitterness that divides them is<br>
reflected in periodic outbreaks of violence along the border. Four people<br>
have died in such incidents since August. <br>
<p>
Both Greece and Turkey are members of NATO, and their continued hostility, as<br>
well as that of their allies on Cyprus, is a flashpoint that security<br>
planners in foreign capitals fear could one day flare into war. <br>
<p>
Richard C. Holbrooke, the former State Department official who presided over<br>
the conference in Dayton, Ohio, that produced an agreement to end fighting in<br>
the Balkans, was among the first American diplomats to urge that a "big push"<br>
be made in 1997 to resolve disputes in the eastern Mediterranean. Some<br>
diplomats are wondering whether Mr. Holbrooke might be asked to serve as a<br>
special envoy to the eastern Mediterranean. He has maintained a steady<br>
interest in the region, and played a key role in defusing tensions when the<br>
two countries came to the brink of war a year ago in a dispute over a small,<br>
uninhabited island. <br>
<p>
Soon after Ms. Albright's nomination, Turks were treated to a sobering<br>
reminder of how little most Americans know about this region. <br>
<p>
Four United States Senators appeared on a CNN talk show to comment on her<br>
nomination, and the host asked if there were any other female foreign<br>
ministers in the world. None of the Senators could think of any. Only half an<br>
hour later, after several Turkish-American viewers called the CNN<br>
switchboard, did the host note that the Turkish Foreign Minister, Tansu<br>
Ciller, is a woman. <br>

CLINTON NOMINEE FOR U.N. AMBASSADOR A PROPONENT OF ARMENIAN <br>
AMERICAN ISSUES IN CONGRESS<br>
<p>
New Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson Has Backed Aid to Armenia, <br>
Peace in Nagorno Karabagh, the Azeri Aid Ban, and Commemoration of <br>
the Genocide<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC - President Clinton's nominee to serve as U.S. <br>
Ambassador to the United Nations, New Mexico Congressman Bill <br>
Richardson, has a record of supporting a range of issues of concern <br>
to Armenian Americans, including aid to Armenia, the equitable <br>
resolution of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict, sanctions on Turkey <br>
due to its blockade of Armenia, and the commemoration of the <br>
Armenian Genocide, reported the Armenian National Committee of <br>
America (ANCA).<br>
<p>
In June of this year, Congressman Richardson voted in favor of the <br>
Visclosky Amendment, which stregthened the Humanitarian Aid <br>
Corridor Act sanction on Turkey for obstructing U.S. humanitarian <br>
supplies to Armenia.  The Amendment, which limited the President's <br>
authority to waive the Corridor Act, was designed to cut off all <br>
U.S. economic assistance to Turkey until it had ceased to block the <br>
delivery of relief assistance to Armenia.  In June, 1995,  Rep. <br>
Richardson voted in favor of the Porter Amendment to the FY 1996 <br>
foreign aid bill, sharply reducing U.S. aid levels to Turkey <br>
because of that nation's continued blockade of Armenia, occupation <br>
of Cyprus, mistreatment of the Kurds, and worsening human rights <br>
record.  He has also supported a number of other issues of concern <br>
to Greek and Kurdish Americans.<br>
<p>
During the 103rd Congress, Rep. Richardson cosponsored H.Res. 86, <br>
introduced by House Democratic Whip David Bonior, which presented a <br>
six-point guideline for U.S. involvement in the Nagorno Karabagh <br>
Peace process.  The resolution 1) Called for continued humanitarian <br>
aid for Armenia; 2) Promoted a "lasting and equitable resolution to <br>
the conflict within the U.N. and CSCE;" 3) Called for the "full <br>
participation of the representatives of Nagorno Karabagh in all <br>
negotiations," 4) Encouraged "Turkey, which has provided military, <br>
economic and diplomatic support for Azerbaijan, to play a neutral <br>
role," 5) Condemned the "blockades of Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh <br>
and demanded "the immediate lifting of the blockades and the <br>
opening of humanitarian corridors to facilitate the delivery of <br>
humanitarian goods to Armenia; and 6) Supported the continuation of <br>
the ban on U.S. aid to Azerbaijan until its ceases its aggression <br>
against and blockades of Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
<p>
Congressman Richardson voted for the Armenian Genocide resolution <br>
both times that it came before the House during his term of office, <br>
in 1987 (H.J.Res.132), and 1985 (H.J.Res.192).  He did not, <br>
however, support the Radanovich-Bonior Amendment to the FY 1997 <br>
foreign aid bill.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 242, Part I, 17 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
RED CROSS WORKERS SLAUGHTERED IN CHECHNYA. Six medical personnel working
for the International Committee of the Red Cross in a Norwegian-funded
hospital in Novye Atagi, south of Grozny, were shot dead on the night of
16-17 December. In response to the killing of the six international
volunteers, the Red Cross announced it was suspending all operations in
Chechnya. Meanwhile, Chechen field commander Salman Raduev said on 16
December he would release 10 of the Russian Interior Ministry troops
abducted by his men two days earlier in return for an apology from the
Russian military for preventing his men from entering Dagestan, Russian
and Western agencies reported. He added that he would exchange the
remaining Russian hostages for Chechen fighters currently held prisoner
by the Russians and accused the Russian security services of planning to
assassinate him. Later the same day, however, after receiving a "tough
warning" from interim Chechen Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov, Raduev
agreed to release all the hostages on 17 December, Reuters reported
citing Interfax. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
BUDGET VOTE REVEALS SPLIT AMONG COMMUNISTS. Although Communist Party
(KPRF) leader Gennadii Zyuganov supported the draft 1997 budget in the
Duma on 15 December, 44 of 147 KPRF deputies voted against it, along
with all 46 Yabloko deputies and some of Sergei Baburin's supporters in
the left-wing Popular Power faction, Segodnya reported on 16 December.
Zyuganov said his party had been forced to choose a "very bad" outcome
in order to avoid a "total disaster," NTV reported on 16 December. Yet
leading KPRF official Valentin Kuptsov told ITAR-TASS that the
Communists who voted against the budget had done so "with the consent of
the faction leadership." The latest edition of Itogi (no. 31) argues
that the KPRF faces deep ideological divisions and that party leaders
adopt a vague "general opposition" stance partly to avoid alienating
current supporters and partly because provoking confrontation with the
authorities would jeopardize their own chances of joining the ruling
elite. -- Laura Belin
<p>
FEDERATION COUNCIL TO REVIEW RUSSIA-CHINESE BORDER TREATY. Federation
Council Deputy Chairman Vasilii Likhachev, who heads a special
parliamentary commission reviewing the 1991 Russo-Chinese border
agreement, told ITAR-TASS on 16 December that the treaty "inflicts
damage on Russia's geostrategic interests" and should be amended. The
commission has been visiting the Russian Far East to discuss the ongoing
demarcation of the Russo-Chinese border with officials from Primorskii
Krai and Khabarovsk and Amur oblasts. Although the Russian Foreign
Ministry has insisted that the treaty does not harm Russia's national
interests, the commission supports local officials' opposition to the
scheduled transfer to China of some small areas along the border.
Likhachev said the treaty could be amended to address these concerns
without undermining its framework. The Federation Council is scheduled
to discuss the issue in mid-January. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA OPPOSES NATO EXPANSION, BUT WANTS DIALOGUE. Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgenii Primakov said on 16 December that Moscow has agreed to
open a dialogue with NATO not because it has softened its opposition to
the alliances's plans to enlarge, but in order to "alleviate our
concerns about some developments in Europe," ITAR-TASS reported.
Primakov, who was speaking at a joint news conference with his visiting
Slovak counterpart Pavol Hamzik, added that Moscow would sign a
"corresponding document" with the alliance only if those talks directly
addressed Russian concerns. Primakov did, however, note some recent
"positive changes" in "NATO's position on Russian concerns," including
the decision to open talks on revising the 1990 CFE treaty and the
declaration that the alliance does not plan to deploy nuclear weapons in
new East European member states. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry
announced that NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana will visit Moscow
next January. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RODIONOV ON MILITARY REFORM. Defense Minister Igor Rodionov said in an
interview with Nezavisimaya gazeta on 16 December that a "general plan"
for military reform is on the verge of being adopted by the Defense
Council. However, he stressed that reforms would require sufficient
financing and described the draft 1997 budget's planned defense
expenditures as "totally unrealistic." Even with the significant force
reductions planned for 1997, it is a "dangerous illusion" to think the
country can economize on defense spending, he said. While giving no
details of the plan, he noted that it will have five major priorities:
maintaining nuclear deterrence, matching manpower levels to current and
prospective threats, purchasing modern weapons systems, improving the
system of command, and upgrading working conditions for officers and
soldiers. Rodionov refused to answer a question about the imbroglio
surrounding the dismissal of Ground Forces commander Vladimir Semenov.
-- Scott Parrish
<p>
YELTSIN SIGNS WEAPONS LAW. President Boris Yeltsin signed the federal
law on weapons on 13 December, ITAR-TASS reported on 16 December. The
law, passed by the Duma on 13 November, regulates the acquisition,
licensing, and use of arms. It allows individuals to use weapons in
self-defense and, unlike previous legislation on arms, to acquire gas
sprays and electric shock devices without a license. As before, other
weapons cannot be bought without a license and must be registered with
the Interior Ministry, according to NTV. Licenses to purchase weapons
are valid for six months, while those for the production, trade,
collection, or exhibition of weapons are good for three years. -- Penny
Morvant
<p>
RUSSIA ADHERES TO DEATH PENALTY BAN SINCE AUGUST. No death sentences
have been carried out in the Russian Federation since August, Chairman
of the Presidential Commission on Pardons Anatolii Pristavkin told ITAR-
TASS on 16 December. The Council of Europe called on Russia to place an
immediate moratorium on executions when Russia was admitted to the
organization in February of this year, but 53 death sentences were
carried out in 1996. In 1995, 40 people were executed, and in 1994, 10.
In the new Criminal Code, which goes into effect on 1 January 1997, the
number of crimes punishable by death has been reduced to five.
Pristavkin called for the adoption of a law banning capital punishment
to prevent the authorities from resuming executions. -- Nikolai
Iakoubovski
<p>
TRADE UNION BOSSES BECAME ABLE CAPITALISTS. An article in Obshchaya
gazeta of 11-18 December accuses the leaders of the Federation of
Independent Trade Unions (FNPR) of lining their pockets at the expense
of their 45 million members. Author Vakhtang Yakobidze estimates that
membership dues provide only 5% of the FNPR's income: the rest comes
&gt;from operating the extensive network of hotels, sanatoria, etc. that the
FNPR inherited from its Soviet predecessor. Much of this real estate has
been sold off at nominal prices to private companies controlled by FNPR
officials. Yakobidze singles out the joint-stock company formed on the
basis of the FNPR's former Central Council for Tourism and Excursions,
which now owns the massive Izmailogo and Salyut hotels in Moscow and
others in the Mineralnye Vody resort. The company's president is Viktor
Pugiev, deputy chairman of the FNPR for financial affairs. -- Peter
Rutland
<p>
NATIONAL ELECTRONIC MEDIA SILENCED IN MURMANSK. Communications workers
in Murmansk Oblast declared an indefinite strike on 16 December to
protest non-payments from the federal budget, ITAR-TASS reported. The
workers first switched off transmitters for national television networks
and radio stations during a one-hour strike in November, then declared a
warning strike on 10 December, silencing Russian Public TV (ORT),
Russian TV (RTR), St. Petersburg Channel 5, and radio stations including
Radio Mayak. ITAR-TASS estimated back wages owed to communications
workers across Russia at 120 billion rubles ($22 million) and suggested
that broadcasts in other regions could soon be disrupted by strikes.
Meanwhile, FNPR Chairman Mikhail Shmakov predicted another coordinated
nationwide strike during the first quarter of 1997, noting that isolated
groups of teachers, machine-builders, and power industry workers are
already on strike to protest wage arrears, RIA-Novosti reported. --

<p>
ANOTHER POLITICAL CASUALTY IN UZBEKISTAN. The regional governor of the
Bukhara region, Mavlon Rahmonov, asked to be relieved of his duties on
14 December, Uzbek Radio reported. Current Deputy Finance Minister
Samoiddin Husinov, has been nominated by President Islam Karimov to
replace Rahmonov, who is the fourth regional governor to lose his job
this year. Poor harvest figures were cited as the reason for Rahmonov's
departure. While still incomplete, figures on Uzbekistan's grain harvest
reveal that, on average, less than 80% of the expected quota was
attained. Poor weather and mismanagement at the regional level have been
blamed for the shortfall. And, as in 1995, the result has been a
reshuffling of key positions in the government. -- Roger Kangas
<p>
STATE ENTERPRISES TO BE AUCTIONED IN TURKMENISTAN. Foreign and domestic
investors will be offered an equal opportunity to buy 100 state
enterprises specializing in sales before the end of the year, Finansovye
izvestiya reported on 17 December. According to unnamed sources in
Turkmenistan's ministries of economics and finance, more than 2,000
enterprises involved in public catering and the retail trade are to be
privatized over the next two years. Meanwhile, the Turkish firm Artpaper
has won a tender to build a cellulose plant in Turkmenistan, ITAR-TASS
reported on 16 December. The plant is to begin production in 1998 and
will produce 32,000 tons of various cellulose products. The project is
worth $110 million and is being financed by the Turkish side. -- Lowell
Bezanis
<p>
DEMIREL IN KAZAKSTAN. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel completed a
two-day visit to Almaty on 17 December, Western and Russian agencies
reported. The visit coincided with celebrations of the country's fifth
year of independence and was designed to highlight Turkish-Kazakstani
relations, which Demirel described as "eternal." Demirel and his
Kazakstani counterpart, Nursultan Nazarbayev, discussed expanding
bilateral trade and utilization of a $300 million line of credit from
Turkey. According to the Turkish Daily News, Demirel also presented a
list of complaints from Turkish investors operating in Kazakstan. Over
200 Turkish firms have invested an estimated $1.2 billion in the
country. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
CONCERN OVER PKK ACTIVITIES IN KAZAKSTAN. The Turkish daily Yeni Yuzyil
on 17 December used Demirel's visit to focus attention on the activities
of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) in Almaty. The paper claimed that
the group was causing distress to Turkish students and businessmen in
Almaty because of its alleged involvement in protection rackets. One
business was reportedly bombed and a businessmen kidnapped. -- Lowell

SERBIAN OPPOSITION TAKES A SECOND TOWN . . . A court in the Serbian town
of Smederovska Palanka on 16 December ruled that the local electoral
commission must turn over the municipal council to the opposition
Zajedno coalition, thereby recognizing the opposition's victory in the
17 November municipal elections. It was the second such ruling in two
days (see OMRI Daily Digest, 16 December 1996). For his part,
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said that "recognition of
second round [17 November] elections is the best solution," Nasa Borba
reported on 17 December. Finally, in another sign that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic may be willing to make concessions and amid growing
trade union support for the daily mass demonstrations across Serbia, the
Serbian government announced it would not debate an unpopular labor bill
that could throw as many as 800,000 people out of work, Reuters reported
on 17 December. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
. . . AND VOWS TO CONTINUE WITH MASS DEMONSTRATIONS. Opposition leaders
have pledged to continue with peaceful mass rallies at least until
Milosevic recognizes opposition victories in all 12 of Serbia's largest
municipalities, where the Zajedno coalition scored second-round
victories. On 16 December, the 27th consecutive day of peaceful rallies
in Belgrade, an estimated 100,000 people demonstrated, Nasa Borba
reported. Zoran Djindjic, leader of the opposition Democratic Party,
told the crowd that the opposition coalition would continue to back
nationwide protests and encourage groups from all across Serbia to trek
to Belgrade in solidarity with protesters in the capital. Reuters quoted
him saying: "One thousand people from each of 30 towns in Serbia will
walk to join us here in Belgrade in the new year, we will be world
champions in protest marathons." -- Stan Markotich
<p>
PLAVSIC WARNS OF WAR OVER BRCKO. Republika Srpska President Biljana
Plavsic said on 16 December that the contested strategic town of Brcko
is and will remain Serb. She warned that there will be war if
international arbitration takes it away from the Serbs, VOA reported.
"Through its force and its good organization, the army must show that
Brcko is a territory which is inviolable and dangerous for all enemies,"
Plavsic told the local military contingent. The formerly mainly Muslim
town controls the key land corridor that links the eastern and western
halves of Republika Srpska. It is the only territorial issue that was
not resolved at Dayton. Mediation was to have settled the matter by 14
December, but the deadline was moved to 15 February after the Serbs
refused to attend meetings. Plavsic may be trying to repair links to the
army, whose leadership she purged in November. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
OPPOSITION PARTIES FROM BOTH BOSNIAN ENTITIES TO FORM SHADOW-GOVERNMENT?
The Sarajevo-based Union of Bosnian-Herzegovinian Social-Democrats
(UBSD) and the Banja Luka-based Liberal Socialist Party on 15 December
proposed the formation of an alliance of non-nationalist parties to try
to resolve various disputed issues and prevent the country from falling
apart, Onasa reported. The Democratic Alternative Forum (FDA) alliance
would stand against nationalists who are working for Bosnia's division.
Miodrag Zivanovic, head of the Liberal Socialist Party, said the
opposition in both entities is long overdue in creating a reconstruction
project to improve living conditions in all of Bosnia. He added that the
situation in Republika Srpska is critical because no foreign aid is
coming in. "The isolating policy of the current Bosnian Serb leadership
jeopardizes the population," international agencies quoted him as
saying. -- Daria Sito Sucic

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF JUDGES OF<br>
CRIMINAL CASES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF<br>
ARMENIA, THE PRESIDING PERSON AT THE "DRO" TRIAL, EDUARD<br>
MANUKIAN<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 17, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 More than 1.5 year-long trial of the "Dro" case, which followed a six<br>
 month investigation, indicates that the Board of Judges of Criminal<br>
 Cases of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Armenia has examined<br>
 the case in great detail. For months, this case was and still remains<br>
 in the center of attention of the press and the public. For months,<br>
 certain forces tried to attach political reasons to the trial,<br>
 despite a series of serious crimes, including 5 murders.<br>
 Mr. Eduard Manukian, who presided at the trial, always refused to<br>
 meet with the press in order to avoid giving any premature statements<br>
 and opinions. However, now, when the verdict is reached and the trial<br>
 is over, Mr. Manukian gave an interview to Armenpress.<br>
<p>
 Question.- Mr. Manukian, since a certain political atmosphere was<br>
forming<br>
 around this criminal case throughout the trial, I would like you to<br>
 address this issue first. Very often the Court was blamed for<br>
 carrying out certain "political order."<br>
<p>
 Answer.- I think the whole content of the trial itself shows that it<br>
 was conducted in the conditions of complete independence of judicial<br>
 power. I think that these people would like to find the opposite<br>
 meaning in the verdict. But the vedict was passed only by the firm<br>
 believes and opinions of the members of the Board of Judges, and<br>
 there was no outside pressure whatsoever on them.<br>
<p>
 Q.- The politization of the case was reflected in the "Dro"-ARF<br>
 (Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Dashnak Party) link suggested by<br>
 the preliminary investigation, one of the sections of which was the<br>
 Artsruni-Margarian link.<br>
<p>
 A.- There is no clearly stated opinion in the verdict that "Dro" had<br>
 no connection with the Dashnak Party. This conlusion can be reached<br>
 by the sentence for Hrant Margarian and Gegham Manukian, which can<br>
 cause wrong interpretations.<br>
 Arsen Artsruni was not the kind of person who could independently<br>
 establish such an organization. He was a member of the ARF who came<br>
 from Lebanon and continued his party activities and carried out party<br>
 orders. Artsruni's economic activity was also not his own initiative.<br>
 It pursued the goals of improving financial and economic means of the<br>
 party. The economic intelligence unit was also not his initiative. As<br>
 stated in the verdict and in various documents prepared by Artsruni<br>
 himself, it was established by the decision of the Supreme Body of<br>
 the ARF, which is stated in the veridict. From the point of view of<br>
 grounded proofs, the Artsruni-Margarian link was unsatisfactory.<br>
 However, this does not mean that Artsruni-ARF link is impossible.<br>
<p>
 Q.- In any case, in the verdict Hrant Margarian was not recognized as<br>
 a leader of "Dro".<br>
<p>
 A.- It should be taken into consideration that, according to the<br>
 Article 299 of the Code of Criminal Laws of the Republic of Armenia,<br>
 the verdict of "not guilty" may be reached if the proofs of guilt are<br>
 not sufficient. In case of Margarian, the Board of Judges was<br>
 governed by this.<br>
 The Board of Judges considered the proofs of establishing the "Dro"<br>
 organization within the security council as insufficient. The fact<br>
 that "Dro" was a part of ARF is indicated by Artsruni's testimony, as<br>
 well as other documents in the case and the testimony of other<br>
 accused, while there are no other evidence about the security council<br>
 than Artsruni's testimony. In the document which was accepted by the<br>
 investigating authorities as a basis, there are the names of 8 more<br>
 security council members, other than Margarian. In these<br>
 circumstances, the proofs have been treated arbitrarily. If<br>
 Artsruni's testimony and the document were used as basis, then other<br>
 members of the security council should have been called to Court.<br>
<p>
 Q.- The Board of Judges didn't address the appeal of the Prosecutor<br>
 General, who asked to decide on the issue of responsibility of ARF,<br>
 and pass the case to the Constitutional Court.<br>
<p>
 A.- This issue was not a subject of discussion by the Board of<br>
 Judges. The Board of Judges only examines the evidence in the case.<br>
 It is not in the power of the Board to appeal to the Constitutional<br>
 Court. That is why the Board of Judges didn't address this issue.<br>
<p>
 Q.- What evidence was the verdict based on: evidence of the<br>
 preliminary investigation or the trial?<br>
<p>
 A.- It is our principle to base our decisions on the evnidence which<br>
 has been proven by the investigation. Whether the evidence was<br>
 acquired by the preliminary investigation or the trial, does not<br>
 matter to us. All the evidence is evaluated. The main criteria is the<br>
 validity of the evidence. This is how all the examined and<br>
 established facts are taken as proofs in the case.<br>
 Sometimes it happens that the facts accepted by the investigation as<br>
 sufficient evidence are not considered as such by the court in the<br>
 process of trial. Then, the court can not use them as valid evidence.<br>
<p>
 Q.- The members of the group were sentenced from 3 years in prison to<br>
 the capital punishment. Compared to the suggestions of the Prosecutor<br>
 General, this punishement is much milder. However, three people are<br>
 sentenced to death.<br>
<p>
 A.- During the investigation, it was established that the "Dro"<br>
 organization was a criminal organization and it functioned. The<br>
 results of the group's activities are well known. From the point of<br>
 view of human rights the capital punishment has a different flavor to<br>
 it, but it is strange that the victims of the criminals are not<br>
 considered from the same point of view. We should not forget the<br>
 tragic consequences of the these crimes. No one in the Board of<br>
 Judges could sign the death sentence if he or she had even the least<br>
 doubts about the rightness of this decision. The evidence stated in<br>
 the verdict are a clear indication of this. I think that whoever<br>
 reads the evaluation of the evidence, can have no doubts that the<br>
 murders have been committed by these people.<br>
 Another issue is the degree of participation of various people in the<br>
 group. The Board of Judges carefully examined the degree of<br>
 participation of each person. The Board was very strict toward the<br>
 organizers and the activists of the group and the murders. I mean<br>
 Arsen Artsruni, Armenak Mnjoyan, Armen Grigorian, Armen Zakarian,<br>
 Hovnaness Mkrtchian.<br>
<p>
 Q.- It is stated in the verdict that a separate decision will be<br>
 passed on the violations which took place during the preliminary<br>
 investigation.<br>
<p>
 A.- Taking into consideration that there have been some violations in<br>
 gathering documents, arresting some people, and other actions during<br>
 the preliminary investigation, the Board of Judges thought it<br>
 necessary to pass a separate decision about this issue.<br>
<p>

        INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND'S ACTIVITIES IN ARMENIA TO<br>
        CONTINUE NEXT YEAR<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 17, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 According to Mr. Tanos Cacambas, head of the International Monetary<br>
 Fund's Mission in Armenia, in the last months there have been<br>
 deviations from the government's and Central Bank's program of<br>
 economic reforms. During his 12-day visit to Armenia, the IMF<br>
 official negotiated the possibilities of correcting these deviations<br>
 and getting back into the program's framework.<br>
 Yesterday, during a press conference, the IMF official announced that<br>
 certain preliminary agreements have been reached, which (if passed)<br>
 will allow to return to the previously agreed program before the end<br>
 of January.<br>
 Mr. Cacambas said that the main deviations took place in two areas:<br>
 fiscal policies and structural reforms. Thus, in the area of fiscal<br>
 policies, the process of collecting the revenue has slowed down, and<br>
 the expenses were not adjusted accordingly. The amount of the actual<br>
 loan from the Central Bank have been exceeded. Pressure was put on<br>
 the exchange rate, which resulted in decrease of the Central Bank's<br>
 reserves. After low inflation in the previous 10 months, the<br>
 inflation in November was 2.4%. It is expected that in December the<br>
 inflation rate will be even higher.<br>
 As for the stuctural reforms, Mr. Cacambas thinks that reforms in the<br>
 banking and energy sectors have slowed down. According to prior<br>
 agreements, those banks which "could not be saved" should have been<br>
 closed or merged with more powerful banks, which has not been done.<br>
 The IMF official expressed a hope that the Committee headed by the<br>
 President of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia Bagrat<br>
 Asatrian will develop a program of recovery of the bank system.<br>
 Mr. Cacambas informed that it was suggested to the Government of the<br>
 Republic of Armenia to cut down the expenses. It was also suggested<br>
 to determine the expenses in accordance with the revenues and to<br>
 speed up the banking reforms and to strengthen the achievements in<br>
 the evergy sector.<br>
 The ESAF loan program of the IMF is scheduled for three years,<br>
 starting in 1996. Under this program Armenia is to receive $50 mln<br>
 per year.<br>
 The 1997 program will be discussed during the IMF delegation's visit<br>
 in February. Mr. Cacambas informed that the IMF, in particular, does<br>
 not agree with the 14% inflation rate expected by the Armenian<br>
 government. He said, if the inflation rate at the end of this year<br>
 will be 10% (instead of expected 18%) and at the same time the gross<br>
 domestic product will grow by 6% (as expected), than there is no<br>
 reason to expect a 14% inflation in 1997.<br>

the Montreal Gazette.  It is reproduced here with permission from the author,<br>
who is also copied this message.  Mr. Fiorito is publishing 3 more articles<br>
on the same subject starting Dec. 28.<br>
<p>
I have noted that the article was not carried by other newspapers.  I have<br>

<p>
In Yerevan, they pray the lights will not go out*<br>
<p>
By Joe Fiorito<br>
<p>
Yerevan, Armenia- The alley is dusty and narrow and cuts an oblique path<br>
between two rows of stone buildings near Republic Square. The buildings are<br>
low and gray, their sides rubbed smooth by years of weather. <br>
<p>
The alley that runs between the buildings is lined with market stalls. Each<br>
stall is piled with boxes. The boxes spill a bright disorder of plastic toys<br>
and bars of laundry soap; smoked fish, pencils and dried beans; bottled<br>
water, soda, vodka; Russian cigarettes and stationery. <br>
<p>
And two kinds of candles. <br>
<p>
The white ones are for use at home; electricity is uncertain here. The skinny<br>
yellow ones are for use in church; people still pray in Yerevan. They pray<br>
the lights will not go out. <br>
<p>
The alley is choked with people who weigh each purchase carefully. They<br>
pause. they look, they move on. There s not a lot of laughter here, but there<br>
is music in the air, Celine Dion s voice, a love song aching from a boom-box<br>
on a shelf behind some plastic bags. <br>
<p>
There are two lines of people in this alley, heading in opposite directions;<br>
shoppers entering with empty bags, and shoppers leaving, not will full bags,<br>
but with less-empty ones. <br>
<p>
Nobody has much money to spend. <br>
<p>
Any dumb foreigner can see that much, just as any dumb foreigner knows their<br>
isn t room enough to linger for more than a moment; you move along on your<br>
own, in one line or the other, or you re moved along by the crowd. <br>
<p>
Most people here have little more than the clothes on their backs, and a bit<br>
of money for a candle or a fish. Many are refugees, dispossessed by a nasty<br>
little war. It was a war that took place along one of the bloody fault lines<br>
between Christianity and Islam. A war with ethnic underpinnings. <br>
<p>
You may remember: <br>
<p>
Nagorno-Karabagh, landlocked inside Azerbaijan, fighting to rejoin its<br>
neighbor and ethnic relative, Armenia; there were sharp battles, thousands<br>
dead, a catalogue of blistering atrocities. <br>
<p>
Armenians were killed, were beaten or kicked out of Azerbaijan simply for<br>
being Armenian: and Azeris were booted out of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh.<br>
One million refugees, all told. <br>
<p>
The first and worst of the atrocities were committed in Azerbaijan in 1988<br>
when, in the cities of Sumgait, Kirovabad and Baku, women were raped, men<br>
were thrown into bonfires on the streets, and people were beaten to death<br>
simply for being Armenian. <br>
<p>
Yes, Azeris died, too. <br>
<p>
The war has been quiet in recent years. Nagorno-Karabagh has achieved its<br>
primary objective, a physical link to nearby Armenia. That link, a<br>
seven-kilometer stretch of narrow mountain road, is maintained with the<br>
threat of blood and bullets. <br>
<p>
I spent a week there recently to observe the aftermath of the war, and the<br>
would-be republic s first democratic presidential elections. <br>
<p>
People are breathing clear air because, for the moment, their guns are<br>
silent, there are no fresh reasons to mourn, and because they view the<br>
election as a step toward achieving recognition as a country. <br>
<p>
Then I spent a week in the ancient city of Yerevan, where there were<br>
widespread allegations of fraud during the Armenian election last September.<br>
Seventy years of Soviet rule have ingrained blunt habits in certain of its<br>
politicians. <br>
<p>
But political fiddles may be the least of their problems; there was an<br>
earthquake in Armenia in 1988. The toll: 25,000 dead and 500,000 homeless. To<br>
make matters worse, Armenia has taken in some 300,000 refugees since the war<br>
began, and it remains cut off from the rest of the world by an Azerbaijani<br>
trade blockade. <br>
<p>
Some goods trickle northward from Iran, but poverty is so widespread in<br>
Armenia that ordinary suffering does not stand out unless you are a<br>
westerner, and easily shocked. <br>
<p>
That afternoon, in the alley market near Republic Square, I watched a woman<br>
not much older than I am wandering between the lines of shoppers. She was<br>
talking to herself. She had a coffee pot in her hand. Now and then she d<br>
reach for someone s sleeve. She d praise the value of the coffee pot. It was<br>
for sale at a good price. You couldn t find a better one anywhere. She didn t<br>
want to sell it, but she needed the money for food. The pot was all she had.<br>
Please. <br>
<p>
No takers. <br>
<p>
She looked at me, once. She didn t touch my arm. No point. She knew I<br>
wouldn t buy her pot. She knew I wouldn t understand its value. <br>
<p>
Perhaps I don t. <br>
<p>
But I understand its worth. <br>
<p>
If there were any goodness in the world, her pot would be worth a fortune and<br>
there would be no end buyers for it in this market. <br>
<p>
No, that s not right. <br>
<p>
If there were any goodness in the world, no one would be forced to sell a<br>
coffee pot to buy a little food. <br>

	+&gt; Yemen LNG, Turkey's Botas sign deal  <br>
	+&gt; Turkey's Ciller ordered to pay damages  <br>
	+&gt; Turkish police move against ex-minister  <br>
                               ======	 <br>
 Yemen LNG, Turkey's Botas sign deal<br>
	The Yemen Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Thursday signed a<br>
memorandum of understanding with the Turkish group Botas<br>
covering long-term LNG sales to Turkey, the French oil company<br>
Total announced. It said the deal covers the supply to Turkey of<br>
the entire production of one of the two trains of Yemen LNG's<br>
gas liquefaction plant, or about 2.6 million tonnes of LNG per<br>
year. The supply would last for a period of 25 years &gt;from the<br>
train's start-up. The terms of the sales contract are to be<br>
neogiated over the coming months, Total said. Total is the main<br>
shareholder in the Yemen Liquefied Natural Gas Co., which was<br>
set up last year to produce around 5 million tonnes of LNG a<br>
year from the year 2001, for an estimated inward investment of<br>
around $2.5 billion. A memorandum of understanding on the deal<br>
was signed in the Yemeni capital Sanaa in the presence of senior<br>
government officials from Turkey and Yemen.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey's Ciller ordered to pay damages<br>
	A Turkish civil court Thursday ordered Deputy Prime<br>
Minister Tansu Ciller to pay $20,000 for insulting Justice<br>
Minister Sevket Kazan, the Anatolian News Agency said. The court<br>
ruled that Ciller had insulted Kazan for saying in the National<br>
Assembly that he "lacked honor and national pride." A court<br>
last month ordered Ciller, now in the same Cabinet with Kazan,<br>
to pay $40,000 damages for falsely accusing Prime Minister<br>
Necmettin Erbakan last year of misappropriating money collected<br>
for Bosnian Muslims. Erbakan is the leader and Kazan a member of<br>
the hard-line Muslim Welfare Party, while Ciller leads the<br>
center-right True Party Party. Erbakan and Ciller in July formed<br>
a coalition government, in which she also serves as foreign<br>
minister.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkish police move against ex-minister<br>
	Turkey's prime minister planned late Thursday to speak<br>
to reporters about allegations of government-underworld ties, as<br>
the Justice Ministry considered a move to lift a former<br>
minister's parliamentary immunity.  "After I meet with<br>
President Suleyman Demirel tonight, I will answer questions from<br>
the press," Necmettin Erbakan said Thursday. A prosecutor asked<br>
the Justice Ministry on Wednesday to lift the immunity of Mehmet<br>
Agar, who was Interior Minister until last month. The<br>
prosecutor's request was based on a police report that accused<br>
Agar of "malpractice," Turkey's Anatolian News Agency<br>
said. Allegations of corrupt government officials having links<br>
with criminals came to a head after a security chief, a gangster<br>
wanted by Interpol and a parliamentarian were involved in a<br>
Nov. 3 vehicle collision. The security chief and the gangster<br>
were killed, but the parliamentarian -- Sedat Bucak of the True<br>
Path Party, the junior partner in the coalition government --<br>
survived to admit that a cache of weapons found in the car<br>
belonged to him. Agar initially passed the crash off as a<br>
"traffic accident," but was forced to resign when opposition<br>
parliamentarians accused him of trying to cover up<br>
government-underworld links. Turkey's newspapers continued to<br>
pursue every conceivable angle on the crash, speculating on the<br>
contents of a dossier on corruption allegations that the leader<br>
of the main opposition party, Mesut Yilmaz of Motherland, has<br>
delivered to President Demirel. Turkish news reports said<br>
Thursday that Demirel was expected to discuss the dossier at his<br>
meeting with Erbakan, who has so far kept a low profile on the<br>
scandal. Newspapers have said Bucak, a Kurdish tribal chief who<br>
supports the government against Kurdish separatists, receives<br>
$1.3 million a month for providing "village guards" in the<br>
war-racked southeast of Turkey. More than 21, 000 people have<br>
been killed since the Kurdistan Workers Party began its<br>
insurgency for an independent Kurdistan in 1984.<br>

<p>
1. KOCHARIAN IN FRANCE, SAYS KARABAKH IS A NATIONAL ISSUE<br>
<p>
PARIS (Gamk)-Nagorno-Karabakh Republic President Robert Kocharian <br>
arrived in France last Tuesday for meetings with governmental <br>
organizations and the Armenian community.<br>
	On Wednesday, Kocharian was welcomed at Alfortville city <br>
hall during a reception organized by French senator and chairman <br>
of the "France-Armenia" friendship organization Renee Rouquet. <br>
Community leaders and members attended the reception during which <br>
the French senator addressed the Karabakh question, emphasizing <br>
its importance in modern times.<br>
	Rouquet specifically praised the will of the Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh population, who, through their selfless determination, <br>
struggled for victory in Karabakh.<br>
	Rouquet, who is also the mayor of Alfortville, did not mince <br>
words in praising Karabakhs right to self-determination and said <br>
that the inalienable principle was more important than a nations <br>
territorial integrity, which has become a tool for world leaders <br>
to pursue their interests.<br>
	The senator called on the entire Diaspora to assist the <br>
heroic people of Karabakh, which today has its own <br>
president-Robert Kocharian.<br>
	In response, the Karabakh leader thanked Rouquet for his <br>
hospitality and support and stressed that today Karabakh had the <br>
strongest army in the region and was capable of defending the <br>
Karabakh territory and the fragile cease-fire.<br>
	Kocharian also stressed the pivotal role the Diaspora <br>
played-and will continue to play-in the fate of the Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh Republic.<br>
	At 8 p.m. local time, Kocharian, his wife, and the Karabakh <br>
delegation, which included Karabakhs representative to Armenia <br>
Alexander Harutunian, Karabakhs representative to France and the <br>
European Parliament Varoujan Grigorian and Evangelical pastor Rene <br>
Levonian, arrived at the Armenian Cultural Home of Paris where <br>
community leaders and members had gathered to greet the president.<br>
	ARF Central Committee chairperson Hagop Yenikomshian and ARF <br>
CC member Dikran Shirvanian were joined with the Regional <br>
Executive members of the Armenian Blue Cross of France (ARS) and <br>
the Homenetmen Scouts who greeted the president with a salute.<br>
	The president was then directed to the editorial offices of <br>
our sister publication Gamk newspaper where he was interviewed.<br>
	"As I stated during  my campaign, the fundamental issues for <br>
Karabakh today is its independence and peace. Today, it can be <br>
said, that Karabakh is independent and  has declared its <br>
independence through a referendum. However, if other states have <br>
not yet recognized Karabakhs independence then that is another <br>
question...," stated Kocharian during his interview, the <br>
translated text of which will be published in future editions of <br>
Asbarez.<br>
	Following the interview, a community gathering took place at <br>
the Armenian centers hall, during which on behalf of the ARF CC <br>
and the Gamk newspaper, Shirvanian welcomed Kocharian and the <br>
Karabakh delegation to France.<br>
	In his remarks, Shirvanian stressed that the ARF has <br>
remained  and will always remain in solidarity with the Karabakh <br>
cause and the people of Artsakh, once again, pledging the partys <br>
resources to the needs of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.<br>
	In response, Kocharian thanked the community representatives <br>
and stressed the importance of the Diaspora in the fundamental <br>
state-building processes in Karabakh. Kocharian said that it was <br>
the responsibility of Karabakhs leadership to work and cooperate <br>
with all facets of the community.<br>
	Kocharian also stressed that any fundamental decision <br>
regarding Karabakh could not be made unilaterally, and the input <br>
of all Armenians was necessary since any decision would have its <br>
effect on the entire Armenian nation and the world.<br>
	Kocharian also visited Lyons, Marseilles and Geneva, from <br>
where he is scheduled to return to Stepanakert Thursday.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. AZERBAIJAN SIGNS $2 BILLION CASPIAN OIL DEAL<br>
<p>
BAKU (Reuter)-Azerbaijan and a consortium of foreign oil companies <br>
led by Amoco Corp.s Amoco Eurasian Petroleum Company signed a $2 <br>
billion deal Saturday in Baku to develop the Ashrafi and Dan <br>
Ulduzu oil fields.<br>
	The 25-year contract is Azerbaijans fourth major deal with <br>
a consortium of Western companies in the Caucasus republics <br>
Caspian Sea reserves.<br>
	Amoco said it hopes to sign another exploration agreement <br>
with the former Soviet republic soon.<br>
	The Western consortium in Saturdays deal includes Amoco <br>
Eurasian, with a 30 percent stake, Unocal with 25.5 percent, <br>
Japans Itochu with 20 percent and Saudi Arabias Delta Nimir with <br>
4.5 percent.<br>
	The Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR will have a 20 <br>
percent stake in the deal, and Azeri oil officials say 65 to 80 <br>
percent of profits from the development of the fields will go to <br>
the Azeri government.<br>
	The Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu fields lie approximately 30 miles <br>
off the Apsheron peninsula. They are spread over 175 square miles <br>
at depths of 246 to 656 feet and are estimated to contain 150 <br>
million metric tons of crude. <br>
	First production is expected to come on line in 2003 and <br>
will reach seven million metric tons per year by 2007.<br>
	The deal requires an up-front bonus payment to the Azeri <br>
government of $75 million from consortium members and must be <br>
ratified by the Azeri parliament.<br>
	The deal brings total western investment in Azerbaijans <br>
promising oil sector to over $12 billion.<br>
	Azeri President Gaidar Aliyev said the agreement was <br>
evidence of the growing importance of the former Soviet republic <br>
for American companies.<br>
	"I am happy that the Clinton administration is finding <br>
cooperation with Azerbaijan," Aliyev said, adding that he had <br>
received a telephone call from Vice President Al Gore Friday.<br>
	"I consider the US and Azerbaijan as strategic partners... <br>
The Vice President said the administration supports cooperation <br>
with the Azeri oil sector and regards the contract as of the <br>
utmost importance," he said.<br>
	Azerbaijan, with its vast Caspian oil potential, has been <br>
the center of a tug-of-war between Russia, Iran, Turkey and <br>
Western countries since independence in 1991.<br>
	Tom Stacy, Chairman of Amoco Eurasian Petroleum Company, <br>
said the oil giant hoped to sign another Caspian contract with the <br>
Azeri government soon.<br>
	"We are happy to work in Azerbaijan and hope to sign another <br>
contract soon on exploration of the southern part of the Azeri <br>
sector of the Caspian basin," he told a news conference.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. GENOCIDE REFERENCES IN ARAB HISTORIOGRAPHY STUDIED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-National Academy of Sciences member and <br>
director of the Institute of Oriental Studies, Nikolay Oganessian, <br>
recently published a monograph on the causes of the Armenian <br>
Genocide as documented in Arab historiography.<br>
	Arabs lived under Ottoman rule for more than 400 years <br>
(1516-1918) and went through many hardships under the Sultans <br>
rule, however, the cause of the religious stand-off was omitted in <br>
the works of the Arab historians, Oganessian said.<br>
	Arab historians used the word genocide to describe the <br>
deportation of Armenians in 1915 in an effort to create a "pure <br>
Turkish society" as part of Pan Turanism, Oganessian said.<br>
	In addition, Arab historians view Soghomon Tehlirian, <br>
Arshavir Shirakian, Petros Ter-Poghossian and Stepan Dzaghikian, <br>
who assasinated the organizers of the Genocide not as terrorists <br>
but as "national avengers," said Oganessian, citing 56 sources of <br>
Arab historiography.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. COMPETITION FOR BEST ARMENIAN TEXTBOOK PUBLICATION<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Eighteen publishing houses will compete in a <br>
bid to win publication rights of Armenian language and literature <br>
textbooks for children, ages 5-10 years.<br>
	Samples of the proposed textbooks will be submitted to a <br>
special commission in February 1997.<br>
	In spring, a competition for the best publication of <br>
textbooks on the Russian and English languages, and also <br>
mathematics will be announced. The competition will be funded by <br>
the World Bank, which provides financing of 155 publications in <br>
Armenia and $3.5 million has been earmarked for the implementation <br>
of the project.<br>
	The Minister for Education of Armenia, Artashes Petrossian <br>
said the commission which will judge textbooks will consist of the <br>
authors of the 1994-96 year textbook projects, secondary school <br>
teachers, lecturers of higher education establishments, <br>
psychologists and researchers.<br>
	Petrossian said the given project provides no publication of <br>
textbooks for primary school. Students age one to four will be <br>
using the new textbooks. The rest of the pupils are to use the old <br>
textbooks kept in school libraries.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. SARKISSIAN VISITS LONDON<br>

Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian had several meetings with <br>
representatives of major companies, such as Siemens, Johnson &amp; <br>
Johnson, IMG bank, Microsoft, Inchcape and others.<br>
	Sarkissian asked those companies to invest in Armenia, <br>
assuring that the Armenian government would do its best to <br>
encourage and support foreign investments. Sarkisian was visiting <br>
London for the last time as ambassador from Armenia to the United <br>
Kingdom. He had held this position since 1992. British government <br>
and diplomatic officials held a ceremony in Sarkissians honor, <br>

perform in Yerevan in the near future.<br>
	On Dec. 10, Sarkissian met with representatives of the local <br>
Armenian community in St. Peters Church. He thanked the British <br>
community for supporting the Armenian embassy.<br>
	He underlined the importance of strengthening ties between <br>
Armenia  and the Diaspora, saying that it is the obligation of <br>
each Armenian to support his homeland.<br>
	Representatives of the British government, foreign <br>
diplomats, as well as President of the Armenian General Benevolent <br>
Union, Louise Manoogian-Simone and Primate of the Ararat Diocese, <br>
Archbishop Garegin Nersissian attended Sarkissians farewell <br>
party.<br>

<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The Korean electronics giant, Samsung <br>
Electronics, opened a store in Yerevan last Friday making it the <br>
first major electronics company to open for business in the <br>

(behind Sony and Panasonic) and the first largest producer of <br>
microwaves.<br>
	In 1996, Samsungs profits increased by 36 percent to $87 <br>
billion. Currently,  Samsung Electronics is manufacturing more <br>
than 500 items.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CANDIDATE POOL SHOULD EXPAND<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Chairman of the Constitutional Court of <br>
Armenia, Gagik Haroutunian, said that it is necessary to enlarge <br>
the number of agencies eligible to apply to the Constitutional <br>
Court.<br>
	Haroutunian emphasized that it is necessary that the <br>
parliament speaker, prime minister,  the prosecutor-general, <br>
courts, physical entities, local self-government bodies and <br>
churches have the right to apply to the Constitutional Court.<br>
	According to the Article 101  of the Armenian Constitution, <br>
presently that right is reserved by the president of Armenia, one-<br>
third parliamentarians and presidential and deputy candidates.<br>
	The Constitution can be amended through a referendum only. <br>
According to Haroutunian, it is necessary that the Constitutional <br>
Court review a number of  laws (especially those which regulate <br>

9. UN OFFERS OSCE HELP IN KARABAKH SETTLEMENT<br>
<p>
BAKU (Noyan Tapan)-Azeri sources defined the adoption of a <br>
resolution by the UN General Assembly and Council of Foreign <br>
Ministers of the Islamic Conference Organization as another <br>
victory for Azeri diplomacy.<br>
	Despite Armenias protests, the UN General Assembly adopted <br>
a resolution last Thursday offering the cooperation of the <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. <br>
	The ninth article of the resolution again confirms <br>
Azerbaijans territorial integrity. Azeri diplomats insisted on <br>
the adoption of this point of the resolution, which also asks for <br>
cooperation by the UN and OSCE in the settlement of the Karabakh <br>
conflict.<br>
	According to ANS-Press, diplomats reported that "it was only <br>
representatives of Armenia, which earlier blocked the adoption of <br>
the decision on the principles of settlement of the Karabakh <br>
conflict at the Lisbon Summit, that did not take part in the <br>
voting."<br>
	ANS-Press also reports that ICOs resolution bans military <br>
assistance to Armenia on the part of ICO member states. Demanding <br>
unconditional pulling out of Armenias armed forces from the <br>
occupied Azeri territories, foreign ministers of Islamic countries <br>
backed OSCE managing chairmans statement on principles of <br>
solution to the Karabakh conflict.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. EU ASK BELARUS TO ALLOW DEMOCRACY FACT FINDERS<br>
<p>
DUBLIN (Reuter)-The European Union urged Belarus President <br>
Alexander Lukashenko Saturday to restore full respect for <br>
democracy and accept a fact-finding mission, warning relations <br>
would otherwise suffer.<br>
	In a statement adopted at a summit in Dublin, EU leaders <br>
said they were seriously concerned at developments in Belarus <br>
after last months disputed referendum adopted a constitution <br>
greatly widening Lukashenkos powers at parliaments expense. <br>
	"The European Council calls on the leadership of Belarus to <br>
re-establish full respect for internationally accepted democratic <br>
and constitutional principles and practices and hopes that the <br>
leadership will accept the Unions proposal for a fact-finding <br>
mission," the declaration said.<br>
	"The absence of progress in these areas would have a <br>
negative impact on relations between Belarus and the European <br>
Union, and on Union support for Belarus accession to the Council <br>
of Europe," it said.<br>
	The European Parliament urged the 15-nation Union on <br>
Thursday to stop financial aid to the former Soviet republic <br>
because of doubts over its commitment to democracy.<br>
	Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, as EU president, raised <br>
the idea of sending a fact-finding mission when he met Lukashenko <br>
at an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) <br>
summit in Lisbon on December 3.<br>
	EU foreign ministers later endorsed the proposal but there <br>
has been no official answer from Minsk.<br>
	A senior opposition figure in Belarus has been sentenced to <br>
15 days in prison for organizing an unauthorized rally in Minsk <br>
earlier this month, a spokeswoman for his Social Democratic Party <br>
said Saturday.<br>
	"The leader of our party, Mikola Statkevich, got a 15-day <br>
prison term yesterday for the December 8 anti-presidential rally," <br>
Lyubov Arestovich told Reuters.<br>
	Up to 7,000 people marched in central Minsk to denounce <br>
President Alexander Lukashenko and a referendum on November 24 <br>
which gave him sweeping powers over rival institutions.<br>
	Arestovich said several people had been sentenced to shorter <br>
terms for taking part in the rally last Sunday.<br>
	Irma Tabushava, 60, the sister of Justice Minister Valentin <br>
Sukala, was sent home from prison on Friday suffering from <br>
"serious heart problems" after she was sentenced to 10 days for <br>
taking part in the rally, Belapan news agency said on Friday.<br>
	Lukashenko has taken a tough line on rallies, banning them <br>
during the harvest season. On several occasions police have been <br>
sent in to break them up.<br>
	Scores of people have been arrested, though most have been <br>
held for days rather than months.<br>
	Arestovich said 15 people, mostly students, had been fined <br>
between $2.50 and $25. The average monthly salary in the former <br>
Soviet republic of 10 million is about $50.<br>
	"The Social Democrats have started a collection to support <br>
victims of political repression in Belarus," Arestovich said. "We <br>
would like to collect money to pay lawyers and fines." <br>
<p>
<p>
11. NEW ARMENIAN CENTER INAUGURATED IN EAST VALLEY<br>
<p>
STUDIO CITY-The Armenian Revolutionary Federation "Papken Suni" <br>
Gomideh (North Hollywood, Studio City, Van Nuys East of the 405 <br>
fwy) inaugurated its new center Sunday during an official ceremony <br>
attended by more than 100 community representatives and city <br>
officials, including Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors <br>
member Zev Yaroslavsky.<br>
	The new center, located at 11719 Moorpark St., Studio City, <br>
will serve the burgeoning East Valley community. It is estimated <br>
that the Armenian-American population of East San Fernando Valley <br>
has doubled during the past six years and numbers more than <br>
40,000. Large numbers of Armenians who settled in the Hollywood <br>
area when they immigrated to the United States in the 1970s and <br>
1980s have relocated to the East San Fernando Valley.<br>
	Reverend Vicken Vassilian presided over the ribbon-cutting <br>
ceremony and blessed the new center on behalf of Western Prelate  <br>
Right Rev. Moushegh Mardirossian, who was on a visit to the Utah <br>
parish.<br>
	"Running an Armenian center is difficult and may encounter a <br>
number of obstacles in its effort to serve the community, but I am <br>
convinced that with hard work and determination it can be <br>
accomplished," Rev. Vassilian said, and added "I wish that this <br>
new center becomes a thriving bastion of activity full of young <br>
and old members of the community."<br>
	Berdj Karapetian, past chairman of the Armenian National <br>
Committee of America-Western Region Board of Directors, welcomed <br>
the gathering and recalled the humble beginnings of the recently <br>
transplanted East San Fernando Valley Armenian community. "Most of <br>
us grew up in the Hollywood area, and in the 1970s we began our <br>
work at the small center on Santa Monica Blvd., and some time <br>
later moved into a two-story center on Vermont Ave.," Karapetian <br>
said, adding that the Vermont center continues to serve the <br>
considerable Hollywood community and houses sister organizations.<br>
	"We hope that this small center will also be a starting <br>
point for an even larger one with which we may serve the <br>
community," Karapetian added, before introducing city and county <br>
officials.<br>
	Gomideh chairperson Charles Lousararian was presented with <br>
several proclamations from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordans <br>
representative Steve Parker, LA City Councilman Mike Feuers <br>
representative Undine Petanlis, as well as one from Supervisor <br>
Yaroslavsky.<br>
	Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky congratulated the new centers <br>
opening. He advised the community to not disregard the potential <br>
of a new, yet small center and to look to the future in <br>
anticipation of the great things that will be accomplished there.<br>
	"This new center is a part of the mosaic of the Armenian <br>
community of Los Angeles County," Yaroslavsky said. The new center <br>
will help newly arrived immigrants to adapt to their respective <br>
communities as well as helping them become US citizens, <br>
Yaroslavsky said, in light of new and changing legislation.<br>
	In recalling the birth of the new Gomideh, Lousararian said <br>
that the somewhat hesitant steps taken toward the establishment of <br>
this center will be chronicled in the history of this regions <br>
Armenian community.<br>
	"The ARFs history is marked by service to the community. <br>
Incidentally, the ARF was born out of the need to defend the <br>
Armenian people and in order to provide physical and moral support <br>
at an important juncture in its history," Lousararian said.<br>
	"It is not a coincidence then that wherever an Armenian <br>
community undergoes expansion, the necessity to establish an <br>
Armenian center also arises and the ARF responds," he added.<br>
	According to Lousararian, the establishment of a new Gomideh <br>
was approved by the ARF Central Committee on March 20, 1996, and <br>
as it coincided with the 100th anniversary of the seizure of Bank <br>
Ottoman, it was called "Papken Suni" after the leader of that <br>
operation.<br>
	The center also houses the local ANC chapter, the ARF-Youth <br>
Organizations "Hrayr Tjokhk" Chapter , and will soon welcome the <br>
local ARS chapter.<br>
	ARF Central Committee member Ara Khanjian delineated the two <br>
functions that an Armenian center serves: to meet the needs of the <br>
local community and to serve as link between the Diaspora and <br>
Armenia and Karabakh.<br>
	The final speaker of the day was Koko Mgrdichian, <br>
representing the newest ARF-YO chapter, who presented a brief <br>
background of its namesake-Hrayr Tjokhk-and on behalf of the <br>
chapters other members pledged to uphold the legacy of the turn-<br>
of-the-century national hero who waged a national liberation <br>
struggle against the Ottoman Empire.<br>

        SIMON OSBOURNE POSITIVELY EVALUATES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE<br>
        CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 16, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 6, the Coordinator of OSCE International Observers during<br>
 the presidential elections in Armenia Simon Osbourne participated in<br>
 the meeting called "Armenia: Transition to Democracy," organized by<br>
 the "Zorian Institute" in London. During that meeting, Mr. Osbourne<br>
 stated that in general the voting process was correct and in<br>
 accordance with the elections laws.<br>
 According to Mr. Osbourne, representatives of the presidential<br>
 candidates were present in 93.3% of the polling stations. The only<br>
 open questions are the voting of the military personnel and the<br>
 discrepance between the numbers submitted by the Central Electoral<br>
 Committee and the number of voting stubs. However, according to Mr.<br>
 Osbourne, no one can give an exhaustive answer to these questions.<br>
 Mr. Osbourne also doubted the numbers submitted by the opposition. he<br>
 said that the opposition often tends to exaggerate.<br>
 As for the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia, Mr. Osbourne said, "Despite the fact that many people in<br>
 Yerevan and around the world are not happy with the Constitutional<br>
 Court's decision, I can not deny that the Constitutional Court, as<br>
 well as the authorities, reacted positively to my statement and<br>
 announced that they will take our suggestions into consideration and<br>
 will re-examine the voting process, particularly, in Yerevan."<br>
 "I think, continued Ms. Osbourne, that Armenia is in the transitional<br>
 phase of the road to democracy, and this phase will take a long time.<br>
 Any little step towards improving the situation, the improvements in<br>
 the area of administration and electoral processes, is an important<br>
 step for establishment of democratic structures in the country.<br>
 Addressing some of these questions by the Constitutional Court's<br>
 decision is a positive step. And that is very important," concluded<br>
 Mr. Osbourne.<br>
<p>
        "DRO" ESTABLISHED BY THE ARMENIAN REVOLUTIONARY FEDERATION<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 16, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Recently, the trial of the "Dro" case ended in Yerevan. The 11<br>
 accused persons were found guilty of their crimes sentenced to<br>
 various degrees of punishment. The question that interests a lot of<br>
 people after the trial is the connection between the Dro group and<br>
 the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) (Dashnak Party).<br>
 It is stated in the final verdict, that the Board of Judges of the<br>
 Supreme Court of the Republic of Armenia considers the following<br>
 facts as established and proven.<br>
 The accused A. Artsruni and A. Harmandayan (ARF members since 1981<br>
 and 1982) continued their activities as party members in Armenia and<br>
 carried out orders given by the party. In order to implement the<br>
 party's suggestions in the area of economy, in 1992-1993 prepared the<br>
 proposal and program of the "Dro" organization, and later, the<br>
 charter and all the necessary founding documents for the "Dro"<br>
 organization. Thus, violating the laws of the Republic of Armenia, a<br>
 secret intelligence organization (Dro) based on military discipline<br>
 has been established in Armenia. The purpose of this organization<br>
 was to uphold the principle of the ARF and at the same time to gather<br>
 political, military, economic, diplomantic and other information.<br>
 The economic branch of the Dro was also established. It engaged in<br>
 illegal economic activities. It also engaged in terrorist activities<br>
 against people who had ever said or done anything against any ARF<br>
 members.<br>
 The verdict is based on the "Dro" organization's charter and other<br>
 important documents, which clearly state that the economic<br>
 intelligence unit of the "Dro" was established by the decision of the<br>
 ARF's highest body and operated in conditions of absolute secrecy.<br>
 Thus, according to the Court, there are serious grouds which prove<br>
 the "Dro" organization was created by the Armenian Revolutionary<br>
 Federation.<br>
<p>

        TWO CHURCHES REOPENED IN APARAN<br>
<p>
 APARAN, DECEMBER 16, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 There will be two more acting churches in the Aparan region next<br>
 year. After 60 years of closure, the Surb Khach (St. Cross) church<br>
 (5th century A.D.) was renovated and recently reopened in Aparan<br>
 (north-eastern Armenia). Another church will reopen in the Kuchak<br>
 village. This church was built in 1901 by the local community, but<br>
 was closed in 1930s by the Soviet authorities.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST<br>
No. 241, Part I, 16 December 1996<br>
<p>
RUSSIA<br>
<p>
DUMA ACTS AGAINST REGIONAL SEPARATISM. The Duma approved on 11 December<br>
in the second reading a bill designed to stop Russia's autonomous okrugs<br>
from seceding from the krais or oblasts to which they are subordinate,<br>
Kommersant-Daily reported on 15 December. The bill declares that all<br>
resources in the okrugs belong to the krai or oblast and that the okrugs<br>
must hold elections for the oblast or krai governor. The wealthy Khanty-<br>
Mansi, Yamal-Nenets, Nenets, and Taimyr (Dolgan-Nenets) autonomous<br>
okrugs want greater independence in order to gain more control over the<br>
income generated from the resources on their territory. The Duma is<br>
moving quickly in order to try to preserve the integrity of Tyumen<br>
Oblast, where gubernatorial elections are set for 22 December. Khanty-<br>
Mansi and Yamal-Nenets are working to prevent the elections from being<br>
valid on their territory. -- Robert Orttung<br>
<p>
MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE COORDINATING COUNCIL. Duma deputy Ramazan<br>
Abdulatipov on 15 December announced plans to set up a Coordinating<br>
Council of Russia's Muslim organizations. He said that the council will<br>
coordinate the activities of about two dozen Russian Muslim<br>
organisations and seek to defend the rights of Russia's Muslims in<br>
cooperation with the authorities, Kommersant-Daily reported on 16<br>
December. Abdulatipov, a former deputy chairman of the upper house of<br>
the parliament, will head the new council. He opposed a plan by the<br>
Union of Muslims to organize a Muslim group in the Duma (see OMRI Daily<br>
Digest, 13 December 1996). -- Nikolai Iakoubovski<br>
<p>
RUSSIA HAILS NEW UN SECRETARY-GENERAL. Russian Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman Gennadii Tarasov welcomed the UN Security Council's 13<br>
December nomination of Kofi Annan as the next secretary-general of the<br>
organization, terming him a "flexible and skilled leader," ITAR-TASS<br>
reported on 14 December. The Security Council unanimously approved<br>
Annan, a Ghanaian diplomat currently serving as UN undersecretary-<br>
general for peacekeeping, after France withdrew its objections to his<br>
candidacy. He now faces a confirmation vote in the General Assembly on<br>
17 December. Tarasov expressed hope that Annan would "make an active<br>
contribution to the rebuilding of the UN" and help it adapt "to the<br>
needs of the emerging multipolar world." -- Scott Parrish<br>
<p>
MOSCOW PIQUED OVER CHECHEN OFFICE IN WARSAW. Although Polish officials<br>
have assured Moscow that the Chechen Information Center in Warsaw has no<br>
official status, the Russian Foreign Ministry is still unhappy with<br>
Warsaw's actions, Izvestiya reported on 15 December. An anonmyous<br>
Russian diplomat described the ceremonial opening of the center on 13<br>
December, which reportedly included the raising of the Chechen flag and<br>
was attended by Polish parliamentarians, as "unacceptable," calling it<br>
interference in Russian internal affairs. Russian Deputy Foreign<br>
Minister Sergei Krylov told NTV that any attempt to transform the office<br>
into a "pseudo-embassy" would have "the most negative consequences" for<br>
Russian-Polish relations. Chechen Foreign Minister Ruslan Chimaev told<br>
Izvestiya , however, that Chechnya's only offical foreign mission is in<br>
Moscow, adding that Chechnya cannot recieve international recognition<br>
until it resolves its relationship with Russia. -- Scott Parrish<br>
<p>
MARS PROBE UPDATE. Chilean Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez<br>
said on 13 December that the failed Russian Mars-96 probe, reported to<br>
have fallen into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile on 17<br>
November, actually fell in Bolivia near the Chilean border, Reuters<br>
reported. Despite assurances by Russian officials, Chilean and Bolivian<br>
officials have expressed worry about possible radioactive contamination<br>
resulting from the 200 grams of plutonium the probe carried as part of<br>
its power supplies, and Santiago accused Moscow of being "tremendously<br>
unwilling" to share technical information about the probe. A spokesman<br>
for the Lavochkin design bureau, which worked on the probe, refuted the<br>
Chilean report on 14 December, telling ITAR-TASS that it had indeed<br>
fallen in the ocean without causing any damage. -- Scott Parrish<br>
<p>
IMF RESUMES LOANS. The IMF executive board approved on 13 December the<br>
disbursement of the eighth (October) $336 million tranche of the $10.1<br>
billion Extended Fund Facility loan it granted Russia in March, ITAR-<br>
TASS and AFP reported on 14 December. The decision was made on the basis<br>
of improvements in tax collection, which totaled 20.1 trillion rubles<br>
($3.8 billion) in November (up from 14.6 trillion in October), of which<br>
87% was actual cash, rather than tax credits. However, Kommersant-Daily<br>
on 15 December reported that the IMF executive board criticized the<br>
Russian government for their inability to pay pensions on time and for<br>
their failure to liberalize energy prices, which are still distorted. --<br>
Natalia Gurushina<br>

TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN SIGNS ANOTHER OIL CONTRACT. Representatives of Azerbaijan's<br>
state oil company SOCAR signed on 14 December a $2 billion 25-year<br>
contract with a consortium of U.S., Japanese, and Saudi Arabian<br>
companies to develop the Dan Ulduzu and Ashrafi Caspian shelf deposits,<br>
Russian and Western agencies reported. The deposits are estimated to<br>
contain 150 million metric tons of oil and up to 50 billion cubic meters<br>
of gas. SOCAR will have a 20% stake in the project, Amoco 30%, Unocal<br>
25.5%, Itochu 20%, and Saudi Arabia's Delta 4.5%. Russia's LUKoil is not<br>
a direct participant in the consortium but could acquire an interest,<br>
since SOCAR plans to link the development of Dan Ulduzu and Ashrafi with<br>
that of the nearby Karabakh deposit, according to AFP of 14 December<br>
quoting Interfax. -- Liz Fuller<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN NAVAL COMMANDER REJECTS RATIONALE FOR SACKING. Rear Admiral<br>
Aleksandr Djavakhishvili, former commander of the Georgian navy, has<br>
rejected criticism from Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze<br>
that he failed to eradicate financial irregularites and raise the combat<br>
efficiency of the service, ITAR-TASS reported on 13 November.<br>
Djavakhishvili was dismised from his post last week by Nadibaidze. The<br>
two men have very different views on the optimum size of the navy,<br>
whether Georgia should persist with its claim to part of the Black Sea<br>
Fleet, and military cooperation with Ukraine, according to Segodnya of 5<br>
December. A member of the opposition National Democrats faction within<br>
the Georgian parliament, Beso Djugeli, has demanded Nadibaidze's<br>
impeachment on the grounds that he has allegedly ruined the country's<br>
entire military-industrial complex, Nezavisimaya gazeta reported on 15<br>
December. -- Liz Fuller<br>
<p>
CEASE-FIRE TAKING HOLD IN TAJIKISTAN. The cease-fire agreement signed at<br>
the conclusion of a 10-11 December meeting between Tajik President<br>
Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri appears to be<br>
reducing fighting in central Tajikistan, according to international<br>
sources. This latest agreement seemed doomed when less than 24 hours<br>
after its signing two bombs went off in the Tajik capital and fighting<br>
was reported in Garm. Four government soldiers were killed and 14<br>
wounded in the town on 13 December. However, by 15 December only<br>
sporadic gunfire was reported near Garm, although a special unit of<br>
government troops remains surrounded. AFP reported that a special<br>
meeting was held on 13 December in Dushanbe attended by representatives<br>
of the government, opposition, and UN special envoy Gerd Merrem to<br>
prevent the cease-fire agreement from falling apart. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

BIGGEST BELGRADE PROTEST YET. An estimated 250,000 people participated<br>
in a demonstration in Belgrade on 15 December in the largest gathering<br>
of the ongoing peaceful protest to date, Radio B92 reported. On the same<br>
day, a court in Nis ruled that the opposition coalition Zajedno had won<br>
the 17 November runoff municipal elections, and urged the local<br>
electoral commission to recognize those returns. Serbia-wide mass<br>
demonstrations, now backed by students and trade unionists, developed<br>
first as a call for the regime to recognize opposition wins at the<br>
municipal level but have evolved into calls for the resignation of<br>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Finally, on 15 December, U.S.<br>
Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum met with Serbian opposition<br>
leader Vuk Draskovic for more than two hours in Geneva. Kornblum emerged<br>
<i>&gt;from the meeting expressing his support for the "democratic process" in</i><br>
Serbia, Reuters reported. -- Stan Markotich<br>
<p>
SERBIAN PRESIDENT REACTS TO ZAJEDNO. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of<br>
State Warren Christopher released on 13 December, Slobodan Milosevic<br>
finally broke his silence on the issue of the opposition Zajedno<br>
coalition and the ongoing mass public demonstrations. Milosevic denied<br>
all allegations that he had engaged in or engineered electoral fraud to<br>
undermine the 17 November opposition victories, international media<br>
reported. He also stressed that he would not use force against<br>
"peaceful" demonstrators but described the protesters as "vandals" and<br>
"political terrorists." Meanwhile, the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia<br>
condemned Zajedno, dubbing it a force bent on "destabilizing" Serbia. --<br>
Stan Markotich<br>
<p>
BOSNIAN ELECTIONS ON HOLD? The Croatian member of the three-man<br>
presidency, Kresimir Zubak, said that the postponed local vote will not<br>
be held in the spring as many had suggested. Zubak stated that the<br>
ballot will take place instead in the summer or even later, AFP reported<br>
on 14 December. The local elections were postponed from 14 September<br>
into the new year following a dispute over what was called the P-2<br>
option. That provision allowed persons to register in any locality where<br>
they say they will eventually live. P-2 led to massive fraud, especially<br>
by the Bosnian Serb authorities, who forced voters into registering in<br>
strategic towns. The Muslims then complained and forced the OSCE to<br>
postpone the vote. The Serbs, for their part, refuse to honor any new<br>
ballot without the P-2 option. The deadlock continues despite some hopes<br>
expressed over the weekend that it might soon be broken. -- Patrick<br>
Moore<br>
<p>
CROATS, MUSLIMS AGREE ON NEW GOVERNMENT. . . Officials of the mainly<br>
Croatian and Muslim Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina agreed on 14<br>
December that the legislature will elect a new government on 18<br>
December. At a subsequent session, the legislature will select a<br>
president and vice president, international and local media reported.<br>
Kresimir Zubak is the current federal president but must step down<br>
because he holds a post on the joint presidency that includes a Muslim<br>
and a Serb as well. The two sides agreed on setting up joint police<br>
forces for Sarajevo, Mostar, and central Bosnia, as well as on setting<br>
up the ministries of commerce, transport, energy, and industry in<br>
Mostar. -- Patrick Moore<br>
<p>
. . . BUT NOT ON EVICTION ISSUE. Kresimir Zubak on 13 December blocked a<br>
session of the Muslim-Croat Federation planning to discuss the evictions<br>
of Muslims from the Croat-held part of Mostar, Oslobodjenje reported the<br>
next day. Zubak claimed the agenda had been set without prior<br>
consultation with Croat members. The federation's vice president, Ejup<br>
Ganic, said after the meeting that the future of the Dayton peace<br>
accords is at stake in Mostar. But Zubak tried to play down the<br>
evictions, saying that events in Mostar "have been purposely exaggerated<br>
... to cover up other problems in the rest of the federation and what is<br>
happening to Croats," AFP reported. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomat Robert<br>
Beecroft said the U.S. is prepared to apply the heaviest of pressure to<br>
make the federation work. NATO also warned Bosnian Croat forces, who<br>
allegedly participated in the evictions of Muslims, that "swift military<br>
action" would be taken against them if their involvement was confirmed.<br>

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT URGES CROATIA TO RESPECT PRESS FREEDOM. The European<br>
Parliament on 12 December passed a resolution expressing deep concern at<br>
the government's treatment of the independent Zagreb radio station Radio<br>
101, Hina reported the next day. The resolution called on Croatia to<br>
"renew Radio 101's permit to broadcast before it runs out on 15 January<br>
1997." Last month, the government gave Radio 101's broadcasting<br>
concession to the rival station but later backtracked on the move after<br>
100,000 people demonstrated against it in Zagreb. Meanwhile, Croatian<br>
police on 13 December detained a senior official of the Croatian Open<br>
Society foundation, and released her two hours later, Reuters reported.<br>
Police also released two of her colleagues who were detained for not<br>
reporting how much money they had when entering the country (see OMRI<br>
Daily Digest, 13 December 1996). According to the law, travelers<br>
entering Croatia are not required to report foreign currency in their<br>
possession. -- Daria Sito Sucic<br>

HEADLINE:  The Eyes of Armenia  Vision: A land groping toward a brighter<br>
future gets help from Orange County doctors who bring hope, one clear eye at<br>
a time.<br>
SOURCE:  The Orange County Register, December 8, 1996<br>
<p>
Part 2 of 2<br>
<p>
On the night Hill is to return to the United States, he is to leave for the<br>
Yerevan airport at 12:30 a.m. At midnight, he finishes his last surgery, then<br>
hangs a lab coat with his name on it in the hallway of the little suite he<br>
shares with Ohanesian.  <br>
<p>
The two leave their coats hanging there after every trip. They want the<br>
people of this hospital to know they will be coming back.  <br>
<p>
Eyes make up one-five hundredth of the body, and if they are the window to<br>
the soul, the souls of Armenia have been blessed with acutely compelling<br>
windows. <br>
<p>
Like their dark, powerful coffee steaming in demi-cups, black eyes are a<br>
distinguishing trait that give a marked soberness to a people of uncommonly<br>
gracious humor. <br>
<p>
In a few days of medicine in Yerevan, it is as if all those eyes have seen<br>
trouble and have come for a cure. <br>
<p>
With news having spread that the Orbis team, as well as Ohanesian and Hill,<br>
are in town, bedlam reigns outside Republican Eye Hospital. Guards are called<br>
to maintain order. The Orbis director, a veteran observer of some of the<br>
world's most remote and extensive desperation, calls on hospital director<br>
Alex Malaian to appeal to the swelling crowd. <br>
<p>
Inside, the sound of knuckles knocking on windows frequently interrupts Roger<br>
Ohanesian's examinations in a room where the hospital cat patters quietly and<br>
freely about.  <br>
<p>
"You see cases here that you just don't see other places," Ohanesian says.  <br>
<p>
Particularly pronounced are diabetes-related cases and ailments found in the<br>
youth of Armenia that aren't usually manifested in Americans until their<br>
later years. <br>
<p>
Ohanesian is especially concerned about diabetes in the country and hopes to<br>
do a study to determine why it is so common.  <br>
<p>
Milton James, an Orbis doctor making his first visit to Armenia, says his<br>
group does not usually see the variety and severity of problems it has seen<br>
in Armenia. <br>
<p>
Some causes are sadly obvious.  <br>
<p>
On his first trip to Armenia, Ohanesian met Seyran Hasratian, brought to him<br>
straight out of combat in Karabakh.  <br>
<p>
Hasratian's battalion had been pinned down by an Azerbaijan tank. The soldier<br>
charged the enemy tank and lobbed an explosive down its hatch. <br>
<p>
An ill-intentioned vehicle of war was the last thing Hasratian saw clearly<br>
four years ago. The explosion that freed his comrades from enemy fire took so<br>
much of his sight that the gallant soldier now has to be led through crowded<br>
halls of Republican Eye Hospital, with his large, powerful hand gripping his<br>
sister's elbow. <br>
<p>
In 1992, Ohanesian operated from 10 p.m. until sunrise removing shrapnel from<br>
the 32-year-old soldier's eyes. <br>
<p>
Later, he arranged to have Hasratian brought to New York, where a specialist<br>
repaired a detached retina.<br>
<p>
He also had a corneal transplant _ usually a procedure in which only a<br>
portion of the cornea has to be replaced, typically no more than 8<br>
millimeters. In Hasratian's, however, shell fragments so badly damaged his<br>
eye that 11 millimeters _ surgeons call it a "wall to wall" transplant _ had<br>
to be restored. <br>
<p>
Now the soldier is back, his dramatically thick glasses of little use, as the<br>
patched cornea has clouded over. As always, his sister attends to his care<br>
and cries when she hears that no help is available at the moment. <br>
<p>
He needs a fresh cornea. When Ohanesian returns next spring, he will take one<br>
with him and do another corneal transplant inside the already repaired one. <br>
<p>
If Ohanesian's efforts are successful, patients such as Hasratian someday<br>
will not have to look to America for corneas.  <br>
<p>
Legislation, inspired by Ohanesian and written by American doctors, is on the<br>
table in the young republic to create a cornea bank for Armenia.  <br>
<p>
Self-reliance is a tough lesson in a country where the outsides of homes<br>
often go unrepaired because residents accustomed to Soviet ways say, "That's<br>
the state's job." <br>
<p>
But American eye doctors whose mission is not only to heal but to train are<br>
making their own progress in Armenia. <br>
<p>
The medical school now uses a curriculum drafted by Ohanesian. And, through<br>
Hill, Ohanesian and Kupperman's efforts, Armen Vartanian, from the Republican<br>
Eye Hospital, is at UCI this winter on a medical fellowship. <br>
<p>
The hospital that has become Ohanesian and Hill's distant annex of sorts is a<br>
five-story, 500-bed, distinctly Soviet facility of proletarian design. It<br>
sits in an unremarkable section of Yerevan, and for several days this October<br>
the sidewalks leading through its stout iron gates are a path toward promise.<br>
 <br>
<p>
They take buses as far as they go, from distant parts of the city and even<br>
<i>&gt;from hours away in Georgia, and then walk as needed _ these Armenians with</i><br>
storybook images of America and its doctors.  <br>
<p>
And even late at night on unlighted streets, if the doctors venture onto<br>
those same sidewalks, they will be stopped by patients wanting examinations<br>
curbside.<br>
<p>
On the fourth floor of Republican Eye Hospital, three mementos hang behind<br>
the desk of director Alex Malaian.  <br>
<p>
There is a stone bust of his grandfather, the first generation of Malaian<br>
doctors. There is a portrait of his father, who started this hospital 40<br>
years ago, a man who died at 42 but not before establishing a precedent of<br>
health care that his son proudly continues. <br>
<p>
Between those family icons is a photo of Roger Ohanesian and his family.  <br>
<p>
If an explanation for such prominence is needed, it can be found down the<br>
hall on a wall next to an operating room, where a copper plaque says: <br>
<p>
"Operating Room named for Roger Ohanesian. Token of gradidute."  <br>
<p>
Since 1992, the goodwill of American medical companies and doctors who know<br>
little of Armenia but much of its unofficial ambassador, Ohanesian, has sent<br>
$3.5 million worth of medicine, equipment and supplies to Armenia. <br>
<p>
Microscopes and lamps throughout Republican Eye Hospital are from American<br>
companies solicited by Ohanesian. Surgical scrubs carry the stenciled names<br>
of distant American hospitals. Eyedrops, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and<br>
lens implants are from American medical suppliers. <br>
<p>
The American doctors work for free, pay for their own travel and rearrange<br>
their own clinic schedules to accommodate their two-week, semiannual visits<br>
to Armenia. <br>
<p>
"I think (the trips to Armenia) appeal to something very basic in any<br>
physician," Ohanesian says. "It is the basic instinct to want to do something<br>
charitable." <br>
<p>
If he were Ross Perot or a Forbes, Ohanesian says, he would simply buy<br>
Armenia whatever it needs. But:  <br>
<p>
"I don't have those kind of resources," he says. "But I do have my talents. I<br>
know that I'm a good teacher and a capable ophthalmic surgeon. <br>
<p>
"I would feel badly if I didn't do something."<br>
<p>
It is a conviction first evident in Ohanesian's grandfather, who, after<br>
immigrating to the United States in the early 1900s, returned to Armenia to<br>
join the war against the Turks.  <br>
<p>
Ohanesian, 57, was raised in Waterford, Mass., and learned early about the<br>
hardships of his ancestral home.  <br>
<p>
As a pre-teen boy, Roger Ohanesian had a playmate named Lilly.    <br>
<p>
Shortly after World War II, Lilly's father announced he was returning to<br>
Armenia to re-establish life there. He would send for his family once he got<br>
settled. Meanwhile, he would write and report how things were there.  <br>
<p>
"I will send back a photograph," Lilly's father said. "If we are standing in<br>
the photograph, you will know things are good. If we are sitting, it means<br>
things are not good." <br>
<p>
Weeks later, a photo came to Lilly's mailbox. It was of Lilly's father and<br>
his family and they were lying on the floor.<br>
<p>
In 22 years in Orange County, Roger Ohanesian has made a comfortable life for<br>
his family after moving here for the weather and to use his Harvard-trained<br>
skills in a growing medical market.  <br>
<p>
("When I left Boston," he says, "my uncle said to me, 'Roger, why would you<br>
leave Boston? It is the hub of medicine.' And I said to him: 'But remember,<br>
it is near the hub that the wheel moves the slowest.' ") <br>
<p>
Now, with the memory of a playmate's family pictured prostrate, the doctor's<br>
passion is to help a struggling country pull itself up.  <br>
<p>
"He is an angel," says Osheen Keshishian, editor of the Armenian Observer<br>
newspaper in Los Angeles. "He is considered a miracle worker in Armenia." <br>
<p>
All he wanted to be was a doctor. <br>
<p>
As a child, someone teased Roger Ohanesian with the "rich man, poor man,"<br>
game in which the buttons of a shirt are tapped to a nursery rhyme: <br>
<p>
"Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief," the<br>
game went. <br>
<p>
Ohanesian remembers tearing off the buttons from his shirt that didn't<br>
represent "doctor." <br>
<p>
In high school his aspirations were more narrowly defined. Beside his photo<br>
in a yearbook, he wrote that he wanted to be an ophthalmologist. <br>
<p>
His grandmother was a reason why.  <br>
<p>
Her name was Nevart Roupenian, but Roger and his sister called her "Rocko,"<br>
because she used to sit in her window and rock.  <br>
<p>
As a little boy he felt her warm embrace with deep hugs. As a teen-ager, he<br>
saw Rocko watch television an inch from her face.  <br>
<p>
Cataracts took his grandmother's sight and inspired Roger Ohanesian's vision.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Boy Scouts helped, too. <br>
<p>
"I remember reading Boy's Life," Ohanesian says, "and there would always be<br>
some true-life story about a Boy Scout saving someone's life. I went around<br>
looking for people in trouble."  <br>
<p>
Thirty years after earning Eagle Scout status, Ohanesian did, in fact, help<br>
save a life, as he and another motorist pulled a passenger from a burning<br>
vehicle on a freeway.) <br>
<p>
He was not his family's first doctor, nor its most recognized.  That would be<br>
Varastade Kazajian. <br>
<p>
In a South Boston movie theater during World War I, Flora Kazajian, future<br>
mother of Roger Ohanesian, was watching a newsreel and translating it for her<br>
Armenian-speaking mother.  The newsreel was about a young doctor who had<br>
developed methods for reconstructing war-damaged faces of soldiers in Europe.<br>
 <br>
<p>
"That's my brother! That's my brother," Roger Ohanesian's grandmother<br>
shouted.  <br>
<p>
It was, in fact, Kazajian, one of this country's first reconstructive<br>
surgeons, and the newsreel was of him being knighted by Britain's King George<br>
VI for his medical service during wartime.  <br>
<p>
When he first came to this country, Ohanesian's uncle worked at Worcester<br>
Wire near Boston. Later he became a dentist. Using a combination of skills,<br>
Kazajian used wire to connect the mouth and the eyebrows of a soldier whose<br>
jawbone had been destroyed _ and launched his career in reconstructive<br>
surgery.  <br>
<p>
By raising his eyebrows, the soldier was able to open and close his mouth.  <br>
<p>
Ingenuity, the Armenian way: Use what you have if you don't have what you<br>
need.    <br>
<p>
In Stepanakert, the capital of Karabakh, the great-nephew of the knighted<br>
dentist-turned-reconstructive surgeon uses a utility knife when tweezers<br>
aren't available.  <br>
<p>
Here, there is a need for a "miracle worker."<br>
<p>
It would take, it seems, at least a miracle to restore this region of only<br>
150,000 to the reasonable living conditions it enjoyed before successfully<br>
resisting Azerbaijan's invasion, at a terrible cost.  <br>
<p>
Major buildings are without roofs, gutted by missiles and turned to great<br>
stone sieves by artillery fire.  <br>
<p>
Soldiers are as prevalent as civilians, and the very air is a shawl of unrest<br>
around the burdened shoulders of these, the most beseiged Armenians. <br>
<p>
When Ohanesian speaks to various Armenian civic groups in the United States,<br>
one question, he says, is always asked:  <br>
<p>
"And what of Karabakh?"<br>
<p>
Two years into a cease-fire, the partial answer comes from a 19-year-old<br>
soldier too wary of persecution to have his name appear even in a foreign<br>
newspaper. <br>
<p>
"I lost four brothers and four cousins in the war," he says.<br>
<p>
"There is no one in Karabakh who did not lose a family member or a friend."<br>
<p>
There is a prosthetics factory in Stepanakert. War created that need.    <br>
<p>
There are, says Melic Agopjanian, Karabakh's minister of culture, 7,000-8,000<br>
invalids of war.  <br>
<p>
"We are allowed to have problems," the minister says, "and allowed to fight<br>
to not have them tomorrow. But when you see peace, it is hard to go back to<br>
war. It is like a bad dream that is past." <br>
<p>
Then, at lunch welcoming the American doctor, the minister raises a cordial<br>
glass of Petrov vodka and says:  <br>
<p>
"Let us drink to all doctors, to those who do not cause injury, but to those<br>
who heal wounds caused by others."  <br>
<p>
On a Sunday after examining 100 or more citizens of Karabakh in a clinic<br>
without so much as tweezers, Ohanesian's answer to "what of Karabakh" is on a<br>
folded piece of brown paper he has tucked in his shirt pocket. <br>
<p>
Antibiotics. Anti-inflammatories. Dilators. Anesthetics. Glaucoma meds.<br>
Reichart tonometer. Functioning slit lamp. Keratonometer . . . <br>
<p>
"For less than $10,000 Karabakh could be fully equipped (for eye care),"<br>
Ohanesian says. "I am concerned, because supplies are running out and<br>
equipment is falling apart."  <br>
<p>
And demand to save the beautiful eyes of Armenia does not lessen.  <br>
<p>
In the antiquated operating room of Republican Eye Hospital, stooped over his<br>
teen-age patient,  Roger Ohanesian sees only a single need: to rescue the<br>
vision of one child, whose letter three years ago was a prayer. <br>
<p>
"I want to believe you haven't forgotten me ..."<br>
<p>
Ohanesian does not speak the mother language, except in broken attempts close<br>
enough to lead to eventual understanding.  <br>
<p>
But he tries, nicknaming Christine, "aghvor aghchik."    He knows little<br>
about her, except that she is his son's age and her face reminds him of old<br>
pictures of his grandmother. <br>
<p>
So he calls her "beautiful girl." <br>
<p>
Upon returning to Laguna Beach, the doctor checks records to find out more<br>
about her. <br>
<p>
Her name, he learns, is Christine Ohanesian. <br>

HEADLINE:  The Eyes of Armenia  Vision: A land groping toward a brighter<br>
future gets help from Orange County doctors who bring hope, one clear eye at<br>
a time.<br>
SOURCE:  The Orange County Register, December 8, 1996<br>
<p>
The snowy, ancient head of Mount Ararat catches the first sun and sprays a<br>
soft, rosy light toward the windows of this operating room, where a child<br>
sleeps in  anesthetized peace.<br>
<p>
Noah's ark, it's said, landed on that mountain, and the first rainbow was<br>
God's contract that nature would never again destroy itself.<br>
<p>
This close to holy ground, hope is an instinct, an extra sense that mercy<br>
follows long suffering; that peace follows war; that freedom follows<br>
oppression; that prosperity follows struggle.<br>
<p>
Hope that sight can be restored to clouded eyes.<br>
<p>
And so a sleeping Armenian child dreams of waking to a clear view of that<br>
mountain.<br>
<p>
But it is not the God of Noah she turns to for a miracle, but an American<br>
doctor.<br>
<p>
A teen-ager named Christine sleeps in guarded quiet while Roger Ohanesian of<br>
Laguna Beach slides the thinnest of scalpels across the exterior of her left<br>
eyeball, cutting away darkness for a child who said to him:<br>
<p>
"Do not abandon me."<br>
<p>
In 1993, Christine came to Republican Eye Hospital in Yerevan because she had<br>
heard an American doctor was there.<br>
<p>
Ohanesian treated her for uveitis glaucoma, a progressive disease that, like<br>
many disorders here, is seen more often in these children than those in<br>
America.<br>
<p>
She was 13 when he first operated to save her sight and to relieve the<br>
discomfort of the painful ailment. <br>
<p>
After Ohanesian returned to Laguna Beach, he received a letter addressed<br>
"Dear Mr. Roger" and signed "Christine" that said:<br>
<p>
"I want to believe you haven't forgotten me and my fate excites you as much<br>
as the fate of the American children who are under your treatment. I envy<br>
them, because I trust in you. I met you by chance and began to hope for the<br>
best.<br>
<p>
"After your leaving I began to see badly again. My parents' unhappy faces and<br>
the doctors' avoiding answers made me understand that they are unable to save<br>
me. Again I remembered you. If only you were here and helped me again. You<br>
are the only one who could help me ..."<br>
<p>
Complications from other procedures left Christine with hemorrhagic<br>
 choroidal detachment, a condition in which fluid is trapped behind the lens<br>
of the eye, causing severe pain.<br>
<p>
At Harvard Eye Associates, one of three offices he and partners started in<br>
south Orange County, the doctor would operate with ultramodern equipment in<br>
pristine surroundings.<br>
<p>
But this dank operating room in Yerevan is 6,000 miles and a world away from<br>
those facilities. The equipment is sufficient because most of it has been<br>
donated by American physicians, including the Armenian American Medical<br>
Society, who learned of Ohanesian's work in Armenia.<br>
<p>
Still, a look around this operating room is a vision of medicine as it used<br>
to be: tin pans (not stainless steel) hold instruments and assorted supplies.<br>
The patient rests not on a bed or table but on a gurney with wheels like the<br>
wayward coasters of a shopping cart.<br>
<p>
When Ohanesian operates at home, masks, gloves and gowns are used once, then<br>
discarded. Here, everything is recycled _ surgical gowns boiled so many times<br>
they are frayed and hold the scent of disinfectant.<br>
<p>
Here, cotton swabs are scarce but ingenuity is plentiful, so this hospital<br>
uses filters it gets from a cigarette company to serve the same purpose. The<br>
nurses even refer to the sponges as "cigarettes."<br>
<p>
But in these conditions, primitive by U.S. standards, eye surgeries take<br>
place daily that are sophisticated decades beyond the facilities in which<br>
they are performed.<br>
<p>
And not just by American doctors but by the staff members of this hospital,<br>
who, thanks to twice-yearly visits here, have been trained and tutored by<br>
Ohanesian, by Rick Hill of the University of California, Irvine, who just<br>
completed his sixth trip, and by other Southern California doctors who have<br>
donated time and skills.<br>
<p>
Hill has a favorite saying about the country to which he, without Ohanesian's<br>
roots, has attached himself by donating time, money and services:  <br>
<p>
"Don't go to Armenia if you can't take a joke," Hill says _ a reference<br>
applicable to the Armenians' remarkable delight in humor but also meaning<br>
that good-natured tolerance is a necessity.<br>
<p>
Even when electricity is regular, microscope bulbs burn out, with no<br>
replacements. And in winter, before the local doctors can sterilize<br>
themselves for surgery, ice must be broken from the water pans in the frosty<br>
operating room. <br>
<p>
In the absence of a sclerol depressor, a common accessory for American<br>
doctors, Ohanesian uses a cap from a ballpoint pen. And when simple tweezers<br>
were not available in one clinic, he used a Swiss Army knife to extract an<br>
errant suture that had caused inflammation. <br>
<p>
With 10 trips to his ancestral homeland as lessons, Ohanesian has learned to<br>
do the best he can with whatever is available.    <br>
<p>
It is a theme here.<br>
<p>
Since the day Noah landed on Ararat the people of Armenia have invoked inner<br>
resources when war, earthquakes, genocide or political oppression turned<br>
prosperity to dearth. <br>
<p>
Before World War I, Armenia included land now occupied by Turkey. (The<br>
 boundaries, like many Armenian assertions about the history of the region,<br>
are disputed by Turkey and its supporters.) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From about 1915 to 1920, Armenia suffered a defining tragedy. In what some</i><br>
call "war" and others "genocide," the Armenian population was devastated.  <br>
<p>
Many nations have recognized the action as a holocaust, which Turkey<br>
disputes. The estimate of the number of Armenians who died ranges 600,000-1.8<br>
million; Turkey's estimate is 300,000. <br>
<p>
Death established a familiarity with suffering _ and a reference point<br>
against which future Armenians could gauge the harshness of life _ a twisted<br>
parable reminding that horror, at least, isn't eternal.  <br>
<p>
"The ghastly procession of the dead marches on," wrote a Presbyterian<br>
missionary from Urmia (in modern Iran) in 1915. "A great many are able to get<br>
plain wooden coffins for their dead now, but the great mass are just dropped<br>
into the great trench of<br>
rotting humanity. As I stand at my window in the morning I see one after<br>
another of the little bodies carried by, wrapped mostly in a ragged piece of<br>
patch-work; and the condition of the living is more pitiful ...<br>
<p>
"A dozen times a day I pray: 'Oh, Lord, how long?' "<br>
<p>
It is a question not quickly answered.<br>
<p>
Armenia survived massacre only to be shrunk under Josef Stalin, whose system<br>
of divide and conquer gave a part of Armenia to Azerbaijan, under Soviet rule<br>
that extended from 1920 to 1991.    A portion of that land remains disputed,<br>
and an uneasy cease-fire exists with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a spit<br>
of land for which thousands (neither Azerbaijan nor Armenia have released<br>
official figures) died in 1988-94. <br>
<p>
Modern Armenia borders Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran and Georgia and is smaller<br>
than Maryland. In 1988 a portion of the tiny republic suffered destruction by<br>
an earthquake that killed more than 25,000 and from which many people are<br>
still recovering.  <br>
<p>
When the Soviet Union collapsed, Armenia was left to create a new republic,<br>
gladly freed, but unsteady as a toddler taking first steps toward democracy. <br>
<p>
At the beginning of this decade, the well-being of Armenia was tenuous, a<br>
whole nation loosed like lifelong captives, suddenly dangerously alone. <br>
<p>
Because of its strained relations with Turkey and Azerbaijan, and because of<br>
inner conflict in Georgia, the landlocked country's need for oil became so<br>
great that it relied on the ridiculous but necessary means of getting fuel<br>
into the country via airplanes.  <br>
<p>
Then came earthquake, war and some of the harshest winters in modern times,<br>
when even the relatively well-off of Armenia reduced their homes to one room<br>
and burned furniture for fuel.   <br>
<p>
Armenia, which once had one of the highest standards of living of all Soviet<br>
states, saw its national income fall by 75 percent in 1991-93, when the<br>
annual inflation rate averaged 3,730 percent.  <br>
<p>
Now, with trade routes opened through Georgia and improving political<br>
relations with Turkey, Armenia is a country eager to earn its place in the<br>
world market: By the end of last year the inflation rate was only 2 percent,<br>
and agricultural production increased 101.4 percent in 1995-96. <br>
<p>
More than 40 American companies are doing business in Armenia, where a<br>
British bank recently opened an office, responding to the new need for<br>
international financing. <br>
<p>
It is a country of great contrasts, where a link to the Internet is more<br>
accessible than good paper products; where former "state" artists whose<br>
commissioned work was rewarded with resort vacations during communist times<br>
now sell their own creations in the market for the price of art supplies. <br>
<p>
Here, there is evidence that communism was, for some, a shelter from<br>
self-reliance. Here, too, are signs of a new government's struggles to keep<br>
freedom's leash from becoming a noose.  <br>
<p>
Recent presidential elections led to street protests and charges of ballot<br>
tampering, which were met Soviet style by calling in tanks and soldiers to<br>
discourage public assembly. <br>
<p>
Here, taxi drivers are learning capitalism by gouging foreigners, while 70<br>
percent of the country (according to U.N. figures) is umemployed. Those with<br>
jobs had an official annual income of about $360 per capita in 1995.  <br>
<p>
Freedom has not broken the grip of hardship: Winters remain brutal, and<br>
electricity is a rationed blessing.  <br>
<p>
"We don't know what is happiness," says Marina Yedigarian, a medical student.<br>
"Our people have a very big struggle for new life. It isn't a good one, but<br>
it is better than the one before."<br>
<p>
It is a struggle shared by Armenians who have relocated to the United States<br>
_ the diaspora.  <br>
<p>
Armenia's population is about 3.5 million. There are nearly one-third that<br>
number of Armenians now in the United States. Of the estimated 1 million<br>
Armenian Americans, half are in California, with about 400,000 in Los Angeles<br>
and Orange counties. (In Yerevan, the country's capital, taxi drivers refer<br>
to Los Angeles as "Los Armenias.") <br>
<p>
Various support groups say $10 million-$25 million a month goes to Armenia<br>
<i>&gt;from family and friends in the United States and France.  </i><br>
<p>
Officially, the U.S. government has budgeted $95 million for Armenian relief<br>
next year _ second only to the amount set aside for Israel in per capita<br>
foreign aid. <br>
<p>
"During Communism (Armenians in America) were connected to Armenia in a<br>
limited sense," says Lena Kaimian, assistant director of the Armenian<br>
Assembly of America, a lobbying group in Los Angeles. "We were displaced<br>
after the genocide; now there is the opportunity for us to reconnect with our<br>
brethren in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh." <br>
<p>
In Armenia and Karabakh, the history of conflict is written in scars and<br>
crippled limbs and powder burns on the men who earned their country's<br>
reputation as fierce warriors, and in hard lines on the faces of women who<br>
waited and hoped. <br>
<p>
And too often, signs of struggle _ whether punctures from the thousands of<br>
land mines that still terrorize Karabakh, or disease resulting from poor<br>
health care _ are first evident in the dark eyes of Armenians whose<br>
bloodlines cross with Roger Ohanesian, who has come here for certain but<br>
unexplored reasons. <br>
<p>
It is an October Thursday that began at 8 a.m. It is now 2:30 p.m., and the<br>
doctor takes his only break for a lunch of fried eggplant, boiled eggs and<br>
grilled kabob at an airport medical-clinic lunchroom. <br>
<p>
Leaving the examination room, he ducked his way through a hallway full of<br>
needy patients desperate to see the American doctor.  <br>
<p>
The morning's patients included a 5-year-old boy who, one month ago, was<br>
struck by shrapnel from a latent land mine.  The boy's parents look to the<br>
American prayerfully, but, having traveled here twice a year for the past<br>
five years, Ohanesian has seen enough of these cases to know that the boy's<br>
vision will not improve. <br>
<p>
"What about surgery?" the mother asks. <br>
<p>
"No," the American says.<br>
<p>
"Medical help?"<br>
<p>
"No."<br>
<p>
"What about pupil surgery?"<br>
<p>
"No."<br>
<p>
"At this point we have to believe in God?" asks the mother, crying.<br>
<p>
"Yes," says the doctor, who wishes his reputation as a god were true.<br>
<p>
Another patient is an old woman who has heard the doctor would be in town,<br>
and has traveled many hours from an outlying city to see him.<br>
<p>
"I need your surgery," she pleads through a translator. "I know you can help<br>
me."<br>
<p>
And then she says words Ohanesian will hear too many times:<br>
<p>
"Touk eem vercheen hooses ek."<br>
<p>
They are the words that keep a lab coat with his name on it hanging<br>
year-round in a Yerevan hospital:<br>
<p>
"You are my last hope."<br>
<p>
The words stay with the doctor, but they do not define why he is here.<br>
<p>
"I haven't really examined my motives about why I'm doing this," Ohanesian<br>
says. "Maybe I'm just one of those guys who doesn't look at things too<br>
closely. <br>
<p>
"I wish I could tell you it was totally satisfying and I enjoyed every single<br>
aspect of it, but I don't. <br>
<p>
"But you don't get many chances in your life to do something altruistic. This<br>
is something that, because several things came together and because of my<br>
ancestral nationality, it presented itself. <br>
<p>
"I don't like to miss an opportunity."<br>
<p>
It is an opportunity created by war and sustained by Ohanesian's intent to<br>
ease war's effects. <br>
<p>
In 1992, a day before Ohanesian, his wife, Eileen, and son, Andrew, were to<br>
travel to London, the doctor received a fax from the minister of health in<br>
Armenia, who knew of Ohanesian through an Armenian medical association.<br>
<p>
The war, the minister said, was creating an overload of eye injuries.<br>
<p>
London was canceled, with his family's blessing, and Ohanesian was booked to<br>
Yerevan.<br>
<p>
Since that first trip, other American doctors have joined Ohanesian's trips<br>
to save the eyes of Armenia. <br>
<p>
Howard Conn, an ophthalmic plastic surgeon from Irvine, operated and lectured<br>
there in September last year.  <br>
<p>
In September 1994, Santa Ana retinal surgeon Sanford Chen saw 53 patients and<br>
performed nine surgeries in Yerevan.  <br>
<p>
In May 1995, Barry Kupperman of Irvine and Mary Davidian (formerly of Irvine,<br>
since relocated to New York) saw 320 cases and did 21 surgeries. <br>
<p>
Others have helped, this side of Armenia: John Lean, Ed Kim and Keane Ganan<br>
of Laguna Hills and Robert Ruper of Orange have operated on patients brought<br>
here by Ohanesian. <br>
<p>
In all, Southern California doctors led by Ohanesian have trained about 200<br>
eye doctors in Armenia, including about 75 surgeons. <br>
<p>
They have seen several thousand patients, about 40 percent of whom were<br>
children.  <br>
<p>
On their latest trip, Hill and Ohanesian together saw more than 1,000<br>
patients in 10 days.  <br>
<p>
Besides Ohanesian, no American has been more devoted to Armenia than Rick<br>
Hill, a glaucoma specialist from UCI. <br>
<p>
In 1994, Ohanesian told Hill he had a patient he'd like him to see and, by<br>
the way, she's in Armenia. <br>
<p>
With a week's notice, Hill joined Ohanesian's next trip, knowing little of<br>
Armenia except its great need. <br>
<p>
Now the two are so well-known in Armenia, doing follow-up checks every six<br>
months, they joke about having an international practice.<br>
<p>
For Ohanesian, devotion to the cause can be traced by bloodlines. Hill says<br>
his commitment is as easily explained. <br>
<p>
"When I see these kids who I operated on two years ago, who would be blind if<br>
I hadn't seem them, well, the answer to why I'm here is real easy," Hill<br>
says. "A lot of things are universal. Going blind means just about the same<br>
thing in any country.  <br>
<p>
"I wouldn't have much respect for someone who could help but wouldn't." <br>
<p>
On this trip to Armenia, Orbis, the New York-based international eye-care<br>
charity with a DC-10 equipped for surgery and teaching, is also in Armenia<br>
and has asked Ohanesian and Hill to be guest faculty.  <br>
<p>
Orbis' work is tightly scheduled, starting at 8 a.m., ending at 4 p.m.  <br>
<p>
But after that, Hill and Ohanesian begin second days in which crowds line up<br>
outside Republican Eye Hospital and wait long into the night, shoving to<br>
squeeze, one at a time, through the guarded hospital door. <br>
<p>
At 1:05 a.m., Hill's eyes look as if they've been under a diamond blade,<br>
rather than gazing from the other end of one.  <br>
<p>
These are the hours of his trips when Hill's inspired description of Armenia<br>
is "a severe pleasure."  <br>
<p>
He has been up since 7:30 the previous morning, doing exams, lectures and<br>
surgeries.  <br>
<p>
A surgery he could have done alone in 30 minutes has taken two hours because<br>
Hill insisted that one of Republican's staff doctors do the procedure while<br>
he assisted, so that the Armenian doctor will know how the work is done for<br>
future cases.  <br>
<p>
The doors finally swing shut behind him, and Hill leaves the operating room,<br>
on his way, he thinks, to rest.  <br>
<p>
But before he reaches his quarters _ a hospital room converted for his and<br>
Ohanesian's visits _ an old man catches Hill in the hallway. He has been<br>
waiting since the afternoon.  <br>
<p>
Hill takes the man to an examination room. He remembers having seen the<br>
patient before, a World War II veteran of the Russian Army who said to Hill:<br>
"I can't see who's responsible for this."  <br>
<p>
The old man has waited most of the day, and at 1:15 a.m. the doctor has a<br>
suggestion. <br>
<p>
On a brief visit to an inner-city market, Hill, a coin collector, saw a booth<br>
that sold magnifying glasses.  <br>
<p>
"Go to the market and get a magnifying glass," he tells the man who has<br>
waited intolerable hours to learn that nothing can be done for his condition.<br>
<p>
<p>
But he has heard the news from an American, and that seems to make a<br>
difference.  <br>
<p>
Cases like his, Hill says, "are why you sit for a couple of hours and let<br>
these doctors do the work. Because eventually they'll find a guy like this<br>
early enough that they can help."  <br>
<p>
And such cases are why Hill is working to establish an international chair in<br>
ophthalmology at UCI.  <br>

<p>
The situation remains critical at the Larsi checkpoint in Dariali gorge on<br>
the Georgian-Russian border [linking Georgia with North Osetia], an Iberia<br>
correspondent was told at the Georgian Border Service Department. Russian<br>
border guards do not let either individuals or goods through the border from<br>
or into Georgia.   They say they are acting on the order of the director of<br>
the Russian Border Service, Gen Andrey Nikolayev. Nikolayev himself said that<br>
the decision had been taken in accordance with the December 1994 decree by<br>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The decree declared a moratorium<br>
on the functioning of the border because of events in Chechnya. Nikolayev<br>
also said that the decree had not been implemented in respect of the border<br>
with Georgia until now and that it was being implemented now because the<br>
Russian government deemed it necessary. <br>
<p>
A senior official of the Georgian Border Service Department told the Iberia<br>
correspondent that Russia had virtually imposed an economic blockade on<br>
Georgia. The Russian as well as Georgian border guards permit the passage of<br>
individuals and goods from Armenia in both directions. <br>

<p>
The parliament of the self-proclaimed Nagornyy Karabakh Republic has<br>
criticized the recent Lisbon summit meeting of the Organization for Security<br>
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for supporting Azerbaijan's position and has<br>
questioned the wisdom of continuing to participate in the OSCE-sponsored<br>
Minsk peace process, Interfax news agency reported on 12th December. <br>
<p>
It said the parliament issued a statement that day expressing regret that the<br>
Lisbon summit failed "to denounce the Azerbaijani delegation' s position on<br>
the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict" . <br>
<p>
The statement described remarks made by the current chairman of the OSCE,<br>
Flavio Cotti, on the principles underlying a resolution of the Karabakh<br>
problem as "an attempt at dictating the status of Nagornyy Karabakh in total<br>
disregard of the people's right to self-determination and other OSCE<br>
principles" , the agency said. They also criticized Cotti for adopting "a<br>
biased position which reflects only Azerbaijani interests and is inconsistent<br>
with the essence of international cooperation" , the agency said. <br>
<p>
It called on Azerbaijan "to abandon the policy of annexation" and start<br>
bilateral talks with Karabakh representatives. "We are convinced that this is<br>
the shortest and most constructive road to accord and peace between Nagornyy<br>
Karabakh and Azerbaijan," the MPs said. <br>
<p>
The statement on Nagornyy Karabakh issued at the end of the Lisbon summit on<br>
3rd December recommended three settlement principles: " Territorial integrity<br>
of the Azerbaijani Republic and the Republic of Armenia; a legal status for<br>
Nagornyy Karabakh, outlined in an agreement on the basis of<br>
self-determination, which would give Nagornyy Karabakh the highest degree of<br>
self-government within Azerbaijan; guaranteed security for Nagornyy Karabakh<br>
and its whole population, including mutual obligations to abide by settlement<br>
provisions," ITAR-TASS news agency reported at the time. <br>

<p>
According to the [Georgian] 'Akhali Taoba' newspaper published in Tbilisi,<br>
the newly-elected president of Nagornyy Karabakh, Robert Kocharyan, has<br>
expressed concern over plans to build an oil pipeline for transporting<br>
Caspian oil from Azerbaijan via Georgia. This will help the Azerbaijani<br>
economy to grow, which is undesirable for Nagornyy Karabakh, he said.<br>
Kocharyan also said that he had sent his representatives to Abkhazia, South<br>
Osetia [breakaway regions of Georgia] and the Dnestr republic [a breakaway<br>
region of Moldova] to study their experience in shaping statehood. <br>

HEADLINE: Salonika to show off Byzantine legacy in 1997 <br>
SOURCE:  Reuters World Service, December 15, 1996<br>
<p>
Greece's second city has been delving into its rich cultural history,<br>
spanning more than 2,000 years, to come up with some rare gems for its year<br>
as Europe's cultural capital in 1997. <br>
<p>
An unprecedented exhibition of Byzantine art from the nearby all-male<br>
monastic community of Mount Athos, where women are forbidden, is expected to<br>
draw more than a million visitors. <br>
<p>
"After two years of preparation, the treasures of our Byzantine tradition,<br>
which has been kept alive for centuries, will be displayed for the first time<br>
outside Mount Athos," Salonika Mayor Constantine Kosmopoulos told reporters. <br>
<p>
A total of 589 items, ranging from gold-leaf icons to rare manuscripts, will<br>
be sent from the Byzantine monasteries dotting the Athos peninsula to be<br>
shown at the new Byzantine museum from June. <br>
<p>
Salonika, founded in 316 BC and named after Alexander the Great's sister<br>
Thessalonikeia, is determined to show off both its unique roots and its new<br>
air as a vibrant university city. <br>
<p>
"We want to project Greek culture as continuing to the present, not a relic<br>
of the past," said Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos while hosting a tour<br>
of the city. <br>
<p>
Events will range from ancient Greek drama to plays by Jean Cocteau and<br>
Samuel Beckett; from modern jazz to Puccini's La Boheme and Verdi's Il<br>
Trovatore. <br>
<p>
Exhibitions span the work of Caravaggio to sculptures by the surrealist Max<br>
Ernst and a retrospective of Hans Arp; from engravings by Goya to<br>
contemporary Yugoslav art. <br>
<p>
"We want to promote Greece through a festival of ideas, not by projecting a<br>
silly chauvinism," Panos Theodoridis, the cultural capital's artistic<br>
director, told reporters. <br>
<p>
ROWS BEHIND THE SCENES <br>
<p>
The fourth director since 1992, when Salonika was chosen to succeed<br>
Copenhagen, he took over in April only to face chronic delays, public<br>
indifference and his predecessors' conflicting visions -- which he quickly<br>
overturned. <br>
<p>
The initial idea was to promote the legacies of Christian Orthodoxy,<br>
Byzantium and Alexander the Great, the Macedonian king who spread the Greek<br>
language and ideas as far east as India. <br>
<p>
Salonika's intellectual elite decried the concept as nationalist hysteria and<br>
said it was wrong to give the top job to Athenians who knew nothing of the<br>
city's international past. <br>
<p>
They also accused the government in Athens, which earmarked 80 billion<br>
drachmas ($328 million) for the cultural capital, of not pushing through the<br>
construction needed to make it a success. <br>
<p>
"Surely some works have been delayed," Venizelos admitted. "The Cultural<br>
Capital Organisation has management problems. It has become a giant; it<br>
should be smaller and more agile." <br>
<p>
Theodoridis, a Salonika native, quickly decided it was never too late and the<br>
city's existing facilities would have to do. <br>
<p>
"The space is enough and more than enough. What I care about is for the<br>
public to come to watch the events," he said. <br>
<p>
HISTORIC COMMUNITIES LEAVE MARK <br>
<p>
Theodoridis's vision pays tribute to the medley of religions and ethnic<br>
groups that have left their mark on the waterfront city, where St Paul<br>
preached in 50 AD. <br>
<p>
"We remember and pay tribute to the historic communities of the Armenians and<br>
the Jews, who, along with the traditional communities of the Moslems and<br>
Christians, helped the city reach its peak," he said. <br>
<p>
Dotted with Byzantine churches, Ottoman mosques and bath houses, the city<br>
became part of Greece in 1913 during the Balkan Wars. Its streets combine the<br>
charm of an eastern marketplace with the grey solemnity of a western<br>
industrial hub. <br>
<p>
Part of the Roman and Byzantine empires, Salonika was ruled at times by<br>
Saracens, crusaders and Venetians until it fell to the Ottoman Turks. <br>
<p>
It is the birthplace of Cyril and Methodius, who converted the Slavs to<br>
Christianity in the 800s as well as Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern<br>
Turkey. <br>
<p>
Salonika got its major economic and cultural boost after the settlement of<br>
20,000 Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal in 1492. The Nazis sent 50,000<br>
Jews from the city known as the Second Jerusalem to the death camps. About<br>
2,000 Jews live here today. <br>
<p>
By the 16th century Salonika was a bustling international port city where<br>
Jews, Turks, Christians, Armenians and Slavs co-existed and flourished. <br>
<p>
About 30 European and Middle East countries are sending artists to perform<br>
next year. The United States, Canada, Australia and Japan are also<br>
participating. <br>
<p>
Salonika fears the year might be such a success that it could have difficulty<br>
putting up a huge numbers of visitors. <br>
<p>
"Salonika does have a problem with hotels," Venizelos said. "That's why we<br>
made arrangements to have cruise ships docked at the port to cover any such<br>
needs." <br>

HEADLINE:  Studio City Armenians to Open Community Center<br>
SOURCE:  Los Angeles Times, December 14, 1996<br>
<p>
Aimed at a growing San Fernando Valley population of Armenian Americans<br>
estimated at 100,000, the Armenian Cultural Foundation will open a new<br>
community center Sunday. <br>
<p>
Rep.-elect Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) is scheduled to attend an opening<br>
 ceremony at 5 p.m., along with state Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman<br>
Oaks) and other dignitaries. The center, located in an office complex at the<br>
corner of Moorpark Street and Colfax Avenue, will be open from 4 to 6 p.m.<br>
Sunday.<br>
<p>
"It's kind of a humble beginning," said Berdj Karapetian, who represents<br>
Armenian organizations that will have offices at the center. "Eventually we<br>
hope to purchase our own building and have athletic facilities and so forth."<br>
<p>
The center is the foundation's ninth in Southern California and will<br>
primarily serve Studio City, Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Van Nuys.<br>
Groups with offices there will include the Armenian Youth Federation,<br>
Armenian Athletic Union and Scouts, Armenian Relief Society, Armenian<br>
Cultural Assn., Armenian National<br>
Committee and the ARF-Dashnagtsutiun, a political party. <br>
<p>
Most of the large numbers of Armenians who came to America during the 1970s<br>
and '80s settled in Hollywood because of its affordable housing, Karapetian<br>
said. But in the past decade as the Valley became more affordable, many<br>
Armenian Americans began moving to the Valley.<br>
<p>
Karapetian said the number of Armenians living in the East Valley is<br>
estimated at about 40,000--a figure that has doubled in the last six years.<br>
<p>
"Businesses here have responded to the trend," he added. "You don't have to<br>
be in Hollywood now to get an Armenian doctor or an Armenian grocery store."<br>

HEADLINE:  Armenian Prelate Visits Salt Lake City<br>
SOURCE:  The Salt Lake Tribune, December 14, 1996<br>
<p>
The Right Rev. Moushegh Mardirossian, prelate of the Los Angeles-based<br>
Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, is visiting Salt<br>
Lake City's Armenian community this weekend.<br>
<p>
Salt Lake City's Hamaspure Chapter of the Armenian Relief Society of the<br>
Western USA will recognize him tonight  at a 7 p.m. dinner at the Airport<br>
Holiday Inn. The Society is a nonprofit organization that was known as the<br>
Armenian Red Cross until a name change 25 years ago.<br>
<p>
On Sunday, Mardirossian will celebrate Mass at 1 p.m. in Salt Lake City's<br>
Cathedral of the Madeleine. <br>
<p>
Asdghig Shahinian, one of the Salt Lake City chapter's 32 members, said there<br>
are 500 to 750 Armenians in Utah, mostly in the Salt Lake Valley.  <br>
<p>
"We have no central place of worship," Shahinian said. "Our organization gets<br>
priests or fathers from Los Angeles to visit two or three times a year. They<br>
do baptisms, blessings, weddings." <br>
<p>
In addition to the infrequent visits from Armenian clergy, she said, Armenian<br>
 Christians often worship in Salt Lake City's Greek Orthodox parish and at<br>
St. Jude's parish in Murray. <br>
<p>
While affiliated with Utah's Roman Catholic diocese, St. Jude's is a Maronite<br>
Rite parish. Maronite Christians, primarily from Lebanon, have their own<br>
liturgy but are in union with the pope. <br>
<p>
Armenian Christianity is among the oldest forms of the religion in the world.<br>
Cappadocian bishop and missionary Gregory the Illuminator brought<br>
Christianity to Armenia in the late 3rd century, according to The<br>
HarperCollins Dictionary of Religion. <br>
<p>
The Armenian liturgical tradition blends Cappadocian, Syrian and Byzantine<br>
elements. Today, the dictionary states, there are both Orthodox Armenian<br>
Christians, who sometimes are known as Gregorian Armenians, and Eastern-rite<br>
Catholic Armenians, not only in Armenia but in communities in the Near East,<br>
Europe, North and South America. <br>

  YEREVAN, December 16 (Itar-Tass) -- Azeri troops opened crossborder <br>
fire at targets in south-western Armenia overnight from Sunday to Monday, <br>
a spokesman for the Armenian defence ministry told Itar-Tass on <br>
Monday. <br>
   According to the spokesman, Azeri units poured machine-gun and tommy-gun<br>
<p>
fire at the village of Tsirani Dzor in Armenia's Syunik region. <br>
   No one was killed or wounded, the spokesman said. The Armenian troops <br>
responded with "adequate retaliatory measures" to suppress the Azeris <br>
gun-fire attack. <br>
   No incidents were reported at other sections of the Azeri-Armenian <br>
border, the spokesman said. <br>
   Meanwhile, reports from Baku said, the Azeri defence ministry refuted <br>
Armenian reports about Azeri gunfire attack across  the border between <br>
the two states. <br>
   The Azeri armed forces "strictly comply with the ceazefire regime in the<br>
<p>
conflict zone and along the Armenian-Azeri borders, agreed upon two and <br>
a half years ago under Russia's mediation," Itar-Tass was told at the <br>
Azeri defence ministry. <br>

HEADLINE:  Chess (by Raymond Keene)<br>
SOURCE:  The Times, December 14, 1996<br>
<p>
Perhaps the event of the year for British chess was Matthew Sadler's gold<br>
medal in the Erevan Olympiad in the autumn. In the November issue of the<br>
British Chess Magazine , he recounts his extraordinarily detailed<br>
preparation, which was not just confined to the analysis of chess moves. <br>
<p>
"I decided that it might be useful to get a small feel of Armenia before I<br>
went, and my preparation was meticulous. I bought CDs of Armenian classical<br>
and choral music, I learnt the Armenian alphabet. I even bought a Russian<br>
cookbook and made my poor mother slave over the cooker producing Armenian<br>
stews and Kazhakstan dried fruit tarts. So I was ready: I could eat Armenian,<br>
read Armenian, sing Armenian..." <br>
<p>
The English team performance was good, if not brilliant. Seeded second,<br>
England came in joint third, but missed the bronze medals on tie-break. <br>
<p>
As so often in the past, the English team was generously supported by the<br>
merchant bank Duncan Lawrie, which helped to ensure that the strongest<br>
possible side turned out. <br>
<p>
English Olympiad Results The chart below shows the English individual scores<br>
in the Erevan Olympiad. In any round, four of the six players are involved. 1<br>
indicates a win, 1/2 is a draw and 0 a loss. If a player did not play in any<br>
particular round, that is indicated by *. There were fourteen rounds, each of<br>
them indicated by a number at the top of the chart. For purposes of<br>
cross-reference, England played against Indonesia in round 1, Denmark in<br>
round 2, Latvia in round 3, then against Romania, Holland, Georgia, Spain,<br>
Croatia, Vietnam, Armenia 1, Sweden, China, Israel and Hungary. <br>

HEADLINE: Azeris, Oil Firms Sign $2 Bln Caspian Sea Deal <br>
SOURCE:  The Reuter European Business Report,  December 14, 1996<br>
<p>
Azerbaijan and a consortium of foreign oil companies led by Amoco Corp's<br>
Amoco Eurasian Petroleum Company signed a $ 2 billion deal on Saturday in<br>
Baku to develop the Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu oil fields. <br>
<p>
The 25-year contract is Azerbaijan's fourth major deal with a consortium of<br>
Western companies, in the Caucasus republic's Caspian Sea reserves. <br>
<p>
Amoco said it hopes to sign another exploration agreement with the former<br>
Soviet republic soon. <br>
<p>
The Western consortium in Saturday's deal includes Amoco Eurasian, with a 30<br>
percent stake, Unocal with 25.5 percent, Japan's Itochu with 20 percent and<br>
Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir with 4.5 percent. <br>
<p>
The Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR will have a 20 percent stake in the<br>
deal and Azeri oil officials say 65 to 80 percent of profits from the<br>
development of the fields will go to the Azeri government. <br>
<p>
The Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu fields lie appoximately 30 miles off the Apsheron<br>
peninsula. They are spread over 453 square km (175 sq miles) at depths of 75<br>
to 200 metres (246 to 656 feet) and are estimated to contain 150 million<br>
tonnes of crude. <br>
<p>
First production is expected to come on line in 2003 and will reach seven<br>
million tonnes per year by 2007. <br>
<p>
The deal requires an up-front bonus payment to the Azeri government of $ 75<br>
million from consortium members and must be ratified by the Azeri parliament.<br>
<p>
<p>
The deal brings total western investment in Azerbaijan's promising oil sector<br>
to over $ 12 billion. <br>
<p>
Azeri President Haydar Aliyev said the agreement was evidence of the growing<br>
importance of the former Soviet republic for American companies. <br>
<p>
"I am happy that the Clinton administration is finding cooperation with<br>
Azerbaijan," Aliyev said, adding that he had received a telephone call from<br>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Friday. <br>
<p>
"I consider that the U.S. and Azerbaijan are strategic partners... The Vice<br>
President said the administration supports cooperation with the Azeri oil<br>
sector and regards the contract as of the utmost importance," he said. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan, with its vast Capsian oil potential, has been the centre of a<br>
tug-of-war between Russia, Iran, Trukey and Western countries since<br>
independence in 1991. <br>
<p>
Tom Stacy, Chairman of Amoco Eurasian Petroleum Company, said the oil giant<br>
hoped to sign another Caspian contract with the Azeri government soon. <br>
<p>
"We are happy to work in Azerbaijan and hope to sign another contract soon on<br>
exploration of the southern part of the Azeri sector of the Caspian basin,"<br>
he told a news conference. <br>

HEADLINE: Pope signs partial reconciliation agreement with Armenian church <br>
SOURCE:  Deutsche Presse-Agentur,  December 13, 1996<br>
<p>
Pope John Paul II and the head of the Apostolic Armenian Church, Patriarch<br>
Karekin I, signed an agreement Friday which moves their churches closer to<br>
reconciliation. <br>
<p>
The agreement - a development in the ecumenical relationship and in<br>
theological discussion - cleared up "many misunderstandings", the two leaders<br>
said.   The agreement was reached after 25 hours of talks between the pope<br>
and Catholics. <br>
<p>
After 1,500 years, the Catholic church and the Armenian Church agreed to end<br>
their dispute about the nature of Christ. They broke in their beliefs during<br>
the Council of Chalcedon in 451. <br>
<p>
The joint statement expresses Christ's double nature - his godly and human<br>
sides. Until now, the Armenian church had only recognized Christ's godly<br>
side. <br>
<p>
"The squabbles and the deplorable discord (between the denominations) should<br>
no longer have negative effects on the life and testimony of the church,"<br>
both leaders said in the agreement. <br>
<p>
The biggest problem for furthering the two churches' relationship is the<br>
primacy of the pope, which is not recognized by the Armenian church. <br>
<p>
Karekin, who comes from Syria, represents about six million believers around<br>
the world. He arrived Tuesday at the Vatican for a five-day visit.<br>

Evaluation of Lisbon Summit results by political parties in Baku<br>
<p>
Baku, December 7, 96 ("Azdlyg")<br>
<p>
The statement of the Party of People's Front of Azerbaijan reads that "the<br>
PPFA prognosis on Lisbon summit results came true that is the summit did not<br>
give anything to Azerbaijan. The Azeri diplomacy once again demonstrated<br>
that it is not capable of resolving the problem." <br>
<p>
The Chairman of the "Mussavat" party Isa Gambar: "The fact that the<br>
concluding declaration did not include a clause on the territorial integrity<br>
of Azerbaijan cannot be evaluated positively. This OSCE summit only<br>
demonstrated its limitations.   <br>
<p>
General Secretary of the Party of National Independence Elshad Musayev: "We<br>
have to provide for the territorial integrity of our country ourselves. For<br>
the purpose of national solidarity reforms shall be accelerated and a strong<br>
national army shall be built." <br>
 <br>
Co-Chairman of the Social-Democratic Party, Zardusht Alizade: "It would be<br>
incorrect to consider that the Lisbon Summit did not give anything to<br>
Azerbaijan. Metaphorically speaking, the summit ended in a draw but our team<br>
dominated in the game."  <br>
<p>
Co-Chairman of the "Vakhdat" Party, Leyla Yunusova: "The Lisbon Summit did<br>
not result in anything new. The existing condition will continue for 10-15<br>
years."  <br>
<p>
Head of the organizational department of the party "new Azerbaijan",<br>
Siyavush Novruzov: "We evaluate results of the Summit fairly high. As a<br>
result of tremendous efforts of our President a statement was made which<br>
reflects our position. The Lisbon Summit ended with a convincing victory of<br>
Azerbaijani diplomacy."  <br>
 <br>
Baku, December 7, 1996 (IA "Turan")<br>
<p>
The Party of Civic Solidarity made a statement expressing party's views on<br>
the results of the Lisbon Summit. The document conveys "a serious concern<br>
with the absence of an article on territorial integrity of Azerbaijan in the<br>
final declaration." One is getting an impression that foreign states do not<br>
intend to recognize Armenia as an aggressor. Meanwhile, foreign countries<br>
are only concerned with their economic interests and therefore are<br>
interested in freezing the conflict, reads the document. The Council of the<br>
Party thinks that it is necessary to introduce military situation, to<br>
reinforce military-patriotic propaganda in mass media and to stop<br>
persecutions on political motives.<br>

 SEGODNIA: No. 232, 12/15/96<br>
<p>
By Arif Husseinov<br>
<p>
Turkish special services participated in an anti-Aliyev conspiracy<br>
Baku and Ankara conduct parallel investigations<br>
<p>
The scandal which began with a publication of facts on complicity of Turkish<br>
special services in the organization of a state coup in Azerbaijan in March<br>
1995 (see: Segodnya from 11/22) in a Turkish newspaper Hurriyet  continues. <br>
<p>
Investigation in Azerbaijan has established that some high ranking Turkish<br>
diplomats were involved in the organization of the coup. Among others is<br>
named citizen of Turkey Farman Demirgol who then was an advisor to the<br>
juridical department of the Milli Mejlis and, according to some sources, the<br>
former resident of the Turkish special services in Azerbaijan. 34 members of<br>
the parliament and some leaders of political parties of Azerbaijan were<br>
involved in the "conspiracy of diplomats."  <br>
<p>
At a press-conference last week President of Azerbaijan, Heidar Aliyev,<br>
stated that Farman Demirgol's guilt was proved beyond any doubt and he<br>
himself did not deny that he had participated in the organization of the<br>
coup. Moreover, in a televised speech the other day Demirgol "sincerely<br>
apologized" to the Azerbaijani nation. <br>
<p>
Answering numerous questions of journalists, Heidar Aliyev confirmed that<br>
Suleyman Demirel was the first to warn him about  the coup. It is not clear<br>
how special services of "the brotherly country"  dared to prepare a coup<br>
involving high ranking diplomats without sanctions from the top political<br>
leadership.  <br>
<p>
According to some information, the official Ankara is conducting a parallel<br>
investigation.  (end) (Translated by AM. Names transliterated from Russian.) <br>

HEADLINE: Azeri Parliament Approves 1997 Budget <br>
SOURCE:  Reuters Financial Service, December 13, 1996<br>
<p>
Azerbaijan's parliament on Friday approved a $ 758 million budget for 1997<br>
which includes a $ 163 million deficit, a significant increase over 1996. <br>
<p>
The Milli Mejlis, or parliament, approved spending of 3.18 trillion manats<br>
and revenues of 2.5 trillion manats.   The 680 billion manat deficit is<br>
significantly more than in 1996 which it was 516 billion manats ($ 117<br>
million at the then exchange rate). <br>
<p>
The deficit is to be covered mainly by issuing treasury bills and "bonuses"<br>
paid into state coffers by western oil companies signing new offshore Caspian<br>
Sea drilling contracts with the government. <br>
<p>
The government expects gross domestic product to rise two percent over 1996<br>
levels to 17.2 trillion manats. <br>
<p>
Education accounts for 648 billion manats, the biggest slice of government<br>
spending, while 357 billion go to defence, 278 billion for social security<br>
and 250 billion for health care. <br>
<p>
Servicing the government debt will take 413 billion manats. <br>
<p>
Some Milli Mejlis deputies complained about what they see as the relatively<br>
low level of military spending at a time when the country is still in<br>
conflict with neighbouring Armenia over the disputed territory of<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
<p>
Finance Minister Fikret Usifov said the government had collected nearly 100<br>
percent of expected tax revenues for 1996. <br>

SOURCE:  The Guardian, December 13, 1996<br>
<p>
Maneri/Morris/Maneri Three Men Walking (ECM CD 531-023-2) pounds 15.49 <br>
<p>
One of the best free-improvising discs of the year. Sixty-nine-year-old Joe<br>
Maneri plays clarinet, alto and tenor on this set, in the company of his son<br>
Mat on six-string electric violin, and Joe Morris on electric guitar (the<br>
latter's work has been described as sounding like 'Albert Ayler as played by<br>
Grant Green' or 'the missing link between Jimi Hendrix and Ornette Coleman').<br>
Maneri Senior has long sought to combine structural notions drawn from<br>
Schoenberg, Berg and Bartok with free-jazz and world music (he has<br>
particularly studied Turkish, Greek and Armenian forms) and has developed a<br>
form of microtonal music of his own - and though this is a long way from<br>
straight-ahead jazz, or straight-ahead anything, it's played with passion and<br>
skill, and they listen to each other like hawks. The British improv trio<br>
called Hession, Wilkinson and Fell, which toured during 1996, revealed many<br>
similar qualities, though the idiomatic references were narrower. <br>

HEADLINE: Black Sea Has Truckers Blue but Wheels are in Motion to Ease<br>
Customs Headaches in the Region <br>
SOURCE:  Journal of Commerce, December 6, 1996<br>
<p>
For Ahmed Sohn, director of Beyazit Exporters, a trucking company moving<br>
goods across the border of Balkan and Caucasian republics, times have never<br>
been tougher.  He fends off the angry calls of customers waiting for delayed<br>
goods. He bargains for the release of trucks stuck at remote border posts<br>
where bribes are common. And he navigates routes through ever-changing<br>
customs regulations. <br>
<p>
But soon Mr. Sohn's worries may be over. <br>
<p>
The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Council is planning to form a customs task<br>
force. The special unit, made up of officials from the 11-member-nation<br>
BSECC, will begin efforts to standardize customs procedures at international<br>
borders to allow the free passage of commercial goods. <br>
<p>
''What we are trying to do here is to streamline the procedure of moving<br>
commercial goods,'' said Mustafa Aksin, Turkish representative to the BSECC.<br>
''It's a small step, but it should do a lot, in time, to reduce the cost of<br>
transportation by unifying border-crossing procedures of all nations.'' <br>
<p>
Much of the problem, according to BSECC officials, has to do with instability<br>
throughout the region, particularly in the Russian Federation, the Balkans<br>
and the Caucasian republics. <br>
<p>
Because those nations are newly formed, and because they are facing stiff<br>
financial restraints, customs personnel, police and equipment are either not<br>
well trained or not present. <br>
<p>
''Crossing these borders is a joke, quite frankly,'' said Mr. Sohn. ''Some of<br>
my guys have been delayed for days while their cargoes are examined and<br>
searched, sometimes looted and the only way to get out alive is to pay.''<br>
Indeed, the region loses millions of dollars worth of trade, according to<br>
Turkish Customs officials, because of customs delays and deliveries gone<br>
wrong while crossing international borders. <br>
<p>
In Baku, Azerbaijan, a manager of Bertling Caspian Ltd. has similar<br>
complaints. But he says that he is comforted by the fact that his company<br>
hired him because of logistical experience in other difficult working<br>
environments. <br>
<p>
''There are bandits on the highways at night which makes delivery north,<br>
south and west of Azerbaijan difficult and sometimes time-consuming,'' said<br>
Greg Clemmons, Bertling's general manager in Baku. <br>
<p>
''Then there's the on-again-off-again war in Azerbaijan and Armenia which<br>
forces us to skirt around Armenia and into Georgia to make deliveries to and<br>
<i>&gt;from Turkey - it'd be great if everyone could agree that free trade is better</i><br>
for a nation's health than war.'' <br>
<p>
And while many had hoped that the fall of the Soviet Union would bring a new<br>
era of free trade to the Black Sea region, they are being confronted instead<br>
by disorganized and often corrupt customs officials. <br>
<p>
''If nations simply agreed and enforced worldwide customs conventions then we<br>
would not have any problems,'' said Peter Krausz, a manager with the<br>
Switzerland-based International Road Transport Union. ''There is clearly room<br>
for improvement, especially in the area of monitoring customs procedures.''<br>
The 11-nation body, formed in 1992, includes customs and trade officials, as<br>
well as business leaders from Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,<br>
Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Rumania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and<br>
Ukraine. And while no date has been set for their first meeting, BSECC<br>
officials say the new task force will meet once each quarter beginning in<br>
January 1997. <br>
<p>
"It's a dream, of course, to formalize all the various customs and<br>
border-crossing procedures - but it's a dream that I think is attainable,''<br>
said Mr. Aksin.  ''But it's the first step toward bringing a healthy economy<br>
to the region - the world must wish us luck.'' <br>

         BAKU, Dec 14 (Reuter) - Azerbaijan and a consortium of<br>
foreign oil companies led by Amoco Corp's Amoco Eurasian<br>
Petroleum Company signed a $2 billion deal on Saturday in Baku<br>
to develop the Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu oil fields.<br>
         The 25-year contract is Azerbaijan's fourth major deal with<br>
a consortium of Western companies, in the Caucasus republic's<br>
Caspian Sea reserves.<br>
         Amoco said it hopes to sign another exploration agreement<br>
with the former Soviet republic soon.<br>
         The Western consortium in Saturday's deal includes Amoco<br>
Eurasian, with a 30 percent stake, Unocal with 25.5 percent,<br>
Japan's Itochu with 20 percent and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir<br>
with 4.5 percent.<br>
         The Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR will have a 20<br>
percent stake in the deal and Azeri oil officials say 65 to 80<br>
percent of profits from the development of the fields will go to<br>
the Azeri government.<br>
         The Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu fields lie appoximately 30 miles<br>
off the Apsheron peninsula. They are spread over 453 square km<br>
(175 sq miles) at depths of 75 to 200 metres (246 to 656 feet)<br>
and are estimated to contain 150 million tonnes of crude.<br>
         First production is expected to come on line in 2003 and<br>
will reach seven million tonnes per year by 2007.<br>
         The deal requires an up-front bonus payment to the Azeri<br>
government of $75 million from consortium members and must be<br>
ratified by the Azeri parliament.<br>
         The deal brings total western investment in Azerbaijan's<br>
promising oil sector to over $12 billion.<br>
         Azeri President Haydar Aliyev said the agreement was<br>
evidence of the growing importance of the former Soviet republic<br>
for American companies.<br>
         ``I am happy that the Clinton administration is finding<br>
cooperation with Azerbaijan,'' Aliyev said, adding that he had<br>
received a telephone call from U.S. Vice President Al Gore on<br>
Friday.<br>
         ``I consider that the U.S. and Azerbaijan are strategic<br>
partners... The Vice President said the administration supports<br>
cooperation with the Azeri oil sector and regards the contract<br>
as of the utmost importance,'' he said.<br>
         Azerbaijan, with its vast Capsian oil potential, has been<br>
the centre of a tug-of-war between Russia, Iran, Trukey and<br>
Western countries since independence in 1991.<br>
         Tom Stacy, Chairman of Amoco Eurasian Petroleum Company,<br>
said the oil giant hoped to sign another Caspian contract with<br>
the Azeri government soon.<br>
         ``We are happy to work in Azerbaijan and hope to sign another<br>
contract soon on exploration of the southern part of the Azeri<br>
sector of the Caspian basin,'' he told a news conference.<br>

         BAKU, Dec 13 (Reuter) - Azerbaijan's parliament on Friday<br>
approved a $758 million budget for 1997 which includes a $163<br>
million deficit, a significant increase over 1996.<br>
         The Milli Mejlis, or parliament, approved spending of 3.18<br>
trillion manats and revenues of 2.5 trillion manats. The 680<br>
billion manat deficit is significantly more than in 1996 which<br>
it was 516 billion manats ($117 million at the then exchange<br>
rate).<br>
         The deficit is to be covered mainly by issuing treasury<br>
bills and ``bonuses'' paid into state coffers by western oil<br>
companies signing new offshore Caspian Sea drilling contracts<br>
with the government.<br>
         The government expects gross domestic product to rise two<br>
percent over 1996 levels to 17.2 trillion manats.<br>
         Education accounts for 648 billion manats, the biggest slice<br>
of government spending, while 357 billion go to defence, 278<br>
billion for social security and 250 billion for health care.<br>
         Servicing the government debt will take 413 billion manats.<br>
         Some Milli Mejlis deputies complained about what they see as<br>
the relatively low level of military spending at a time when the<br>
country is still in conflict with neighbouring Armenia over the<br>
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
         Finance Minister Fikret Usifov said the government had<br>
collected nearly 100 percent of expected tax revenues for 1996.<br>
         ($1 US &lt; 4250 manat)<br>

GORBACHEV ON KARBAKH<br>
(Excerpts from his &lt;Memoirs&gt;)<br>

     <br>
THE KARABAKH EXPLOSION [pp. 333-340]<br>
     <br>
In February 1988 the population of the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous oblast <br>
(which was 85-per-cent Armenian) of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist <br>
Republic demanded that it be made a part of the Armenian Soviet Social <br>
Republic. A resolution was passed by the oblast Soviet and immediately <br>
supported by thousands of people at demonstrations and meetings in Armenia. <br>
 These demonstrations were carried out in an organized way, without <br>
excesses.  The marches carried large posters supporting perestroika and <br>
glasnost.  Law-enforcement agencies only maintained order, without taking <br>
stronger measures_anyway, there was little they could have done against <br>
this sea of people.<br>
     <br>
This produced a sharp response in Azerbaijan, where mass meetings were <br>
likewise held, this time directed against Armenia. <br>
     <br>
In February the Politburo examined the Nagorno-Karabakh question. We <br>
received information about the position of the leaders of the republics.  <br>
The Azerbaijan leader, [Kiamran] Bagirov, insisted that Moscow should <br>
guarantee the unchanged status of Nagorno-Karabakh.  The Armenian leader, <br>
[Karen] Denmirtchyan [sic], suggested that the appeal of the <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh oblast Soviet should be considered in the Supreme Soviets <br>
of Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Soviet Union.  It became clear that the <br>
arguments between Baku and Yerevan over Stepanakert would have to be <br>
resolved by Moscow.<br>
     <br>
[Nikolai] Ryzhkov said that we must `act in accordance with the <br>
Constitution'. [Vikyor] Chebrikov reported that these events were having a <br>
bad effect in other republics.  In Estonia there was a growing sentiment in <br>
favour of leaving the Union. Tajikistan was debating its claim to Bukhara <br>
and Samarkand.<br>
     <br>
I believed that the problem had to be resolved by political means, that the <br>
Central Committee should declare any change of borders unacceptable, and <br>
that we needed to draft economic, social and cultural proposals aimed at <br>
improving the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.  We should let the Armenians <br>
and Azerbaijanis get together and decide the status of Nagorno-Karabakh for <br>
themselves, and we ought to accept any decision they made.  I felt that the <br>
Russian intelligentsia and workers should join in their discussions.  We <br>
decided to send Politburo representatives to both republics to lend <br>
assistance to the local leadership. [Yegor] Ligachev and [Georgy] <br>
Razumovsky flew to Baku, and [Aleksandr] Yakovlev and [Vladimir] Dolgikh to <br>
Yerevan.  Their mission was to establish contacts and reassure the people <br>
in those republics.<br>
     <br>
On 26 February I appealed to the peoples of Azerbaijan and Armenia, asking <br>
them to show understanding, responsibility and prudence.  I said that we <br>
would not sidestep frank discussions of various proposals, but that this <br>
must be done calmly, within the framework of the democratic process and <br>
legality.<br>
     <br>
My speech contributed to some normalization.  The continuous mass meetings <br>
in Yerevan stopped, and reassured people returned to their homes.  I tried <br>
to get a dialogue going and explore ways of finding a compromise, which I <br>
was firmly convinced was the only way out of the situation.<br>
     <br>
The dispute over Karabakh goes into the distant past. From time immemorial <br>
two peoples have lived side by side on this fertile land.  It passed from <br>
hand to hand; for centuries it was part of Persia.  But mainly it was <br>
populated by Armenians.  Immediately after the [Bolshevik] revolution their <br>
ancient dram of reunification with the motherland almost came true.  <br>
However, although the Azerbaijani leader of that time, Nariman Narimanov, <br>
initially gave his concent to this, he soon rescinded it.  Afterwards, the <br>
question was raised many time, including after the war, but was never <br>
resolved.  The result was that almost 500,000 Armenians lived in <br>
Azerbaijan, mainly in Karabakh, while 200,000 Azerbaijanis lived in <br>
Armenia.  First of all, we had to address practical problems.  Soon after <br>
the unrest started, a resolution was adopted to provide assistance to <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh, calling for 400 million rubles to be allotted for <br>
emergency needs there.  Initially, this made a strong impression, but after <br>
two or three months, we began to receive indications that the authorities <br>
in Azerbaijan were distributing the monies from the centre according to <br>
their own wishes, with only a small part reaching the intended recipients.  <br>
We had to send commissions to verify these assertions.  It appeared, <br>
however, that most of the needs of the local people had indeed been met. <br>
     <br>
If this had been done ten years earlier, if [Geidar ] Aliyev had conducted <br>
a valid internationalist policy, a catastrophe could have been prevented.  <br>
By 1988 it was already too late.<br>
     <br>
Events snowballed.  Acts of violence broke out, the peak being the bloody <br>
pogrom of 27-29 February against Armenians in Sumgait, where there was a <br>
large number of Azerbaijani refugees.<br>
     <br>
Troops were sent in.  Unarmed soldiers tried to bring the brutal hooligans <br>
to their senses. Many young soldiers were wounded, some permanently <br>
disabled.  However, I believe the consequences would have been even more <br>
severe if the soldiers had been armed.<br>
     <br>
We have often been reproached for `showing weakness'.  But when we were <br>
forced to bring in the militia and military units to avoid further <br>
bloodshed, we again fell under fire of criticism, this time for using <br>
force.  There is no doubt that the government had to act in the way they <br>
did.  Extreme measures were due to extreme circumstances.  The same thing <br>
would have been done in any democratic state.<br>
     <br>
The massacres in Sumgait produced universal outrage, everyone was shaken.  <br>
At the same time, sympathy was shown in the Muslim republics for the people <br>
of their faith.  Events threatened to get out of control.<br>
     <br>
The question of Nagorno-Karabakh was considered at the an extraordinary <br>
Politburo meeting on 3 March, where I noted that the situation had reached <br>
a critical stage, that we had been late in dealing with Sumgait and had <br>
underestimated its implications.<br>
     <br>
`Protective measures may be required,' said I, `in order to prevent loss of <br>
life, as occurred in Sumgait.  The main thing is to use political methods.  <br>
However, authority must always be authority.  And when it must be used, it <br>
must be used in time. The law must rule.'<br>
     <br>
I demanded that those responsible should be swiftly brought to justice, and <br>
that steps must be taken so that chaos would not `spill over' again.  <br>
However, I also demanded that we avoid further attempts at a `quick fix' in <br>
favour of working together patiently with our Armenian and Azerbaijani <br>
comrades.<br>
     <br>
Even before these tragic events I had a fairly complete picture of the <br>
sources of the conflict.  Let us recall that the Armenians had suffered <br>
both from Persians and from Turks.  Could they really erase from their <br>
memory the genocide of 1915, when the Turks slaughtered a million and a <br>
half Armenians and scattered two million through the world?  Eventually <br>
they turned to Russia, not out of love for their tsar, but in the hope of <br>
safety.  They came to the Russian people for protection.<br>
     <br>
But the roots of the Azeris in Karabakh also went deep.  Lenin had <br>
understood the complexity of this problem and commissioned [Georgy] <br>
Chicherin, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, to look into the <br>
matter.  Under Stalin those wo were in charge of nationality affairs lacked <br>
subtlety.  Problems and difficulties accumulated over the decades.  The <br>
Azerbaijan leadership did not treat the Karabakh population in the spirit <br>
of the traditions of Lenin, and sometime they simply acted in an inhumane <br>
way.  Problems of language and culture arose, and serious mistakes were <br>
made in the cadre policy.  All of this was brought to light under glasnost. <br>
 Problems quickly came to a head.<br>
     <br>
In both republics many highly placed officials had soiled themselves by <br>
corruption.  But when perestroika began and they sensed that the ground was <br>
shaking under them, it was these elements who tried to provoke ethnic <br>
conflicts.  The national feelings of people became the object of merciless <br>
exploitation.  In their hands Karabakh was a mine lad underneath <br>
perestroika.<br>
     <br>
We decided: (1) to publish our analysis of the situation in the press; (2) <br>
that the General Secretary should speak on television; (3) the question <br>
should be taken up in the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet; (4) the <br>
report of the procurator's office on the investigation of the events in <br>
Sumgait should be published; (5) administrative agencies were to decide on <br>
the stationing of troops at flash points, but without imposing a curfew.<br>
     <br>
The Azerbaijan and Armenian leaders were again told to come to an <br>
understanding.  This they were unable to do.  Again the question was sent <br>
back to us for a decision.<br>
     <br>
At the Politburo session of 6 July 1988, I expressed the opinion that some <br>
people in the higher levels of power in the republics were fanning the <br>
flames and igniting passions.  `The one thing that we can never agree to is <br>
to support one people to the detriment of another,' I said.  `We must never <br>
be blackmailed into this.  We will not permit, we must in no case allow the <br>
truth to be sought through blood!'<br>
     <br>
Under pressure from public opinion, the deputies of the Armenian Supreme <br>
Soviet resolved to agree to the transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, <br>
and asked the USSR Supreme Soviet to consider this matter.  Two days later <br>
the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet declared this to be unacceptable, and <br>
announced measures to accelerate the social and economic development of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh.  On 25 June public meetings were held in Stepanakert.  <br>
The people were angry that the local press had not reported the February <br>
resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh Soviet concerning its exit from <br>
Azerbaijan.<br>
     <br>
Tension grew rapidly.  Meetings and strikes in Stepanakert continued.  <br>
Then, on 6 July, the airport in Yerevan was blockaded.  The <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh oblast Soviet again passed a resolution `on withdrawal', <br>
but in Baku it was again declared to be illegal. <br>
     <br>
What could we do?  What was the way out of the situation?  [Andrei] Gromyko <br>
suggested the usual solution: `The army will appear on the street and order <br>
will be restored immediately.'  [Viktor] Chebrikov objected.  Yakovlev <br>
proposed that the administration of Nagorno-Karabakh should be transferred <br>
to Moscow.  [Eduard] Shevardnadze was in favour of immediately giving <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous republic status.  Ligachev tried to synthesize <br>
all of these ideas: `There are already 20,000 refugees.  People are <br>
homeless.  If republic status for Nagorno-Karabakh does not help, we must <br>
bring in the troops, dismantle factories, dismiss the Party organizations <br>
and Soviet executive committees and establish order.' <br>
     <br>
I supported the proposal to set up an autonomous republic, but I felt that <br>
this matter had to be resolved by the conflicting sides themselves.<br>
     <br>
The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet met on 18 July. All parties were <br>
invited to present their views.  The session was broadcast on television, <br>
so that everyone's position would be clear to the general public.  Our <br>
position--that of the central authorities--was supported by most people. <br>
     <br>
`How do you wish to solve this problem? I asked. `Victory at any price? <br>
Armenia wants to incorporate Nagorno-Karabakh.  Azerbaijan does not intend <br>
to allow this and will not yield even a millimetre.  This is all <br>
unrealistic!  We must find a compromise that will suit everyone.  Only a <br>
common victory will be a real victory.  You cannot resolve issues while you <br>
are fighting one another.  This is a political blind alley.  Sumgait and <br>
other events concerning Nagorno-Karabakh have already made a deep imprint <br>
on the relations between the two peoples and it will take time for this to <br>
be smoothed over even a little.  But even so, we must meet each other half <br>
way and find a compromise.'<br>
     <br>
Suggestions were made at the meeting for strengthening the guarantees to <br>
the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh in order to prevent a repetition of the <br>
violence.  In the past there had been many promises, but they had turned <br>
out to be hallow - essentially a fraud.  I proposed that a special <br>
commission for consideration of all proposals be set within the framework <br>
of the Council of Nationalities of the USSR Supreme Soviet.  This <br>
commission was created and carried out useful work.  Rasul Gamzatov's <br>
speech made a strong impression on me.  He proposed that the administration <br>
of Nagorno-Karabakh be transferred temporarily to the Union's central <br>
agencies.  Subsequently, the commission of the Council of Nationalities put <br>
forward the very same proposal.<br>
     <br>
On 20 July the resolution of the Presidium, reiterating that a change of <br>
boundaries was impossible, was published.  On 26 July the Party Central <br>
Committee and the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium passed a resolution to send <br>
an emissary, Arkady Volksky, to Nagorno-Karabakh.  However, the situation <br>
did not normalize.  On 21 September a state of emergency was declared and a <br>
curfew was put into effect in Stepanakert and the Agdam districts. <br>
     <br>
After the autumn session of the USSR Supreme Soviet on 3 December I met <br>
with deputies from Azerbaijan and Armenia and the leaders of both republics <br>
and Nagorno-Karabakh.  Ryzhkov, Slyumkov, Chebrikov, Lukyanov and <br>
Razumovsky were also present.  `We are on the brink of diaster,' I told <br>
them. `You, the respected representatives of the two peoples, must sit down <br>
and together find a way out of this mess.'<br>
     <br>
....[Discussion of the earthquake in Armenia]<br>
     <br>
Today I am even more convinced that the nationality issue can never be <br>
resolved by force.  The tsars fought wars for decades in North Caucasus, <br>
creating a system of fortresses, Cossack settlements, punishing, <br>
threatening, destroying, and all to naught, for nothing good came form all <br>
this. The only positive results came from trade, co-operation among <br>
peoples, the establishment of an alliance with the ruling elite and tribal <br>
elders, which brought them closer to the tsar's court, honours and <br>
privileges.  A kind of new association developed after the October <br>
Revolution.  In spite of all the faults of this union, a certain balance of <br>
interests was preserved.<br>
     <br>
The peacemaking process was extremely complicated.  It was even made more <br>
difficult by, among other things, the general atmosphere that had developed <br>
in the country, in the Supreme Soviets of the USSR and Russia.  Essentially, <br>
there were two positions.  One was that the moment the conflict developed - <br>
especially after the events in Sumgait - it was necessary to strike <br>
decisively against the `instigators' of the disturbances in Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
and nip the riots in the bud.  The other position was to ask: since the <br>
people of Karabakh wished to reunite with their motherland, and we <br>
recognized the right of nations to self-determination, why not allow this?  <br>
After all, the Nakhichevan autonomous republic is a part of Azerbaijan, even <br>
though separated from Azerbaijan by Armenian territory.  The <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh question could be solved in exactly the same way.<br>
     <br>
At some point it seemed that a possible solution was to give Karabakh, like <br>
Nakhichevan, the status of autonomous republic, while keeping it as part of <br>
Azerbaijan.  There was a time when this proposal was on the point of being <br>
implemented.  However, it was just at this moment that the Supreme Soviet <br>
in Yerevan passed a resolution to incorporate Nagorno-Karabakh as part of <br>
Armenia and so everything fell apart.  It fell apart because of internal <br>
antagonism, because the battle for power, for replacement of the ruling <br>
elite, was already in full swing there.  If fell apart because the Armenian <br>
national movement, which was formed on the basis of the Karabakh committee, <br>
was in a hurry to seize power.<br>
     <br>
In this connection another possibility was mentioned in the Politburo <br>
meeting: the central authorities should use the armed forces to preserve <br>
the status quo.  In other words, preserve the status quo in favour of <br>
Azerbaijan; at least this would be done not by Azeri extremists, but by <br>
forces of legitimate power.  I asked my colleagues: `OK, so we introduce <br>
rule from the centre. The what?' I did not get a clear answer.<br>
     <br>
Some members were very strongly in favour of `imposing order'.  Under such <br>
conditions it was not easy to defend my position.  Nevertheless, I held to <br>
it from beginning to end, even though in extreme cases we were unable to <br>
avoid strictly limited harsh measures. <br>
     <br>
During this time, 1987-8, I strove to work out a uniform democratic approach <br>
to disputes between nationalities.  The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh did <br>
not at all push into the background other, seemingly more tranquil, but no <br>
less significant processes which were gaining strength in the Baltic <br>
republics, Moldova and Georgia, and which have begun in Central Asia and in <br>
Ukraine.  Issues such as the languages of indigenous people, economic <br>
sovereignty, and expanding rights were raised more and more frequently in <br>
various regions.  To counter Russification, people often went to the other <br>
extreme, thus introducing a spirit of confrontation into the mass <br>
consciousness.  However, in 1987 no-one raised the question of withdrawal <br>
<i>&gt;from the Union except, perhaps, for extremist groups such as the Estonian </i><br>
independence association, J. Barkans's group in Latvia, and certain <br>
nationalist groups in Lithuania.<br>
     <br>
But we were unable to achieve harmony of interests, where should the way <br>
out be sought?  In patiently and persistently working for the achievement <br>
of a compromise, but mainly in changing the very conditions that produced <br>
the conflict.   Indeed I believed that a lasting solution to the problems <br>
between nationalities could be found only in the general context of <br>
economic and political reform.  By the end of my time as President I had no <br>
doubt that preservation and renewal of the Union could keep the peace.<br>
     <br>
A formula was put forward: `A strong centre and strong republics.'  Others <br>
expressed it differently: `Strong republics and a strong centre.'  Either <br>
way, it basically comes down to the same.  After all, the new centre was to <br>
be formed on different foundations, to deal with issues such as security, <br>
co-ordination of the fundamentals of economic and social policy, <br>
co-ordination of foreign policy, maintaining order at borders, and so forth. <br>
 And, of course, playing the role of arbiter when conflicts arose. <br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 240, Part I, 13 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
ON CONSTITUTION DAY, FILATOV WARNS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. Russians
marked 12 December, Constitution Day, in a subdued manner. The occasion
has become Russia's "quietest holiday" and may have been observed this
year for the last time, according to a 12 December commentary by NTV's
Vadim Gluzker. He noted that the first anniversary of the 12 December
1993 constitutional referendum coincided with the escalation of fighting
in Chechnya, which "was no cause for celebration." Sergei Filatov,
chairman of the All-Russia Coordinating Council responsible for electing
pro-Yeltsin governors, warned on 12 December that a political crisis
could be triggered by efforts by the Federation Council to amend the
constitution. He claimed that, following the current round of
gubernatorial elections, the leftist opposition will have more than
enough members to put such amendments on the upper house's agenda, RIA
Novosti reported. Federation Council Speaker Yegor Stroev, however, said
that the governors tend to become moderate in their views after the
elections no matter what their campaign rhetoric, Radio Mayak reported.
-- Laurie Belin and Robert Orttung
<p>
PLANS TO ORGANIZE MUSLIM GROUP IN DUMA. A spokesman for the Union of
Muslims of Russia has announced plans to organize a Muslim deputies'
group in the State Duma, according to a 12 December Interfax report
monitored by the BBC. The union's chairman, Nadir Khachilaev, won a Duma
by-election in Dagestan on 8 December, and the spokesman said
Khachilaev's victory showed that the North Caucasus regions are
experiencing an "Islamic revival." However, Khachilaev is known in
Dagestan as a former karate champion and prominent businessman, not as a
religious leader. Most of the 26 Muslims currently serving in the Duma
belong to the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction. Even if all of
them joined the new group, it would lack the 35 deputies needed to form
an officially registered faction. Unlike small informal deputies'
groups, registered Duma factions are represented on the Duma Council and
may chair parliamentary committees. -- Laura Belin
<p>
ROKHLIN ON RODIONOV, MILITARY REFORM. In an interview with NTV on 11
December, Duma Defense Committee Chairman Lev Rokhlin hailed President
Yeltsin's decision to convert retired Army Gen. Igor Rodionov into a
civilian defense minister, saying the move would improve coordination
between the country's political and military leadership. Rokhlin, who
like Rodionov is a retired general, said officers would respect a
knowledgeable and qualified civilian defense minister and refuted
criticism that the change would undermine military discipline. He added
that plans to bolster the authority of the General Staff would
ameliorate but not resolve the problem of rivalry among the various
power ministries, which was highlighted by squabbles between the
Interior Troops and Defense Ministry forces during the Chechen conflict.
Rivalries will persist as long as the power ministries are directly
subordinated to the president, and can appeal to him over the head of
the General Staff, he argued. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
TATARSTAN EXPANDS REGIONAL, INTERNATIONAL TIES. The State Council of
Tatarstan on 12 December signed a protocol on interparliamentary
cooperation with the Legislative Assembly of Ulyanovsk Oblast, RIA
Novosti reported. The chairman of Tatarstan's legislature, Vasilii
Likhachev, said 10 similar agreements have already been signed with the
legislatures of neighboring republics and regions as well as with the
parliaments of some CIS states, Canada, Turkey, and Hungary. Tatarstan's
legislature also plans to sign such treaties with Amur and Khabarovsk
oblasts, Primorskii Krai, and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast to foster
better economic ties. -- Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
RUSSIA ON NEW UN SECRETARY-GENERAL. Although some Russian officials had
earlier suggested that Moscow would veto any candidate for UN secretary
general other than Boutros Boutros Ghali, Russia has now accepted his
withdrawal. Russian UN representative Sergei Lavrov told Russian Public
TV (ORT) on 12 December that Russia will support any of the four African
candidates currently under consideration by the Security Council. Lavrov
said Russia insists only that the new secretary general be "qualified"
but complained that some countries have "other" criteria. France has so
far refused to support the leading candidate, Kofi Annan of Ghana,
currently UN undersecretary general for peacekeeping. Paris reportedly
resents Washington's earlier veto of Ghali's candidacy and opposes Annan
because he does not come from a Francophone African state. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA, CHINA RATIFY EXTRADITION TREATY. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigorii Karasin and Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang
exchanged instruments ratifying a bilateral extradition treaty in
Beijing on 12 December, international media reported. According to AFP,
citing the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, the agreement is the
first extradition treaty between China and a foreign country. The agency
quoted a Chinese official as saying that growing economic ties between
the two states had increased the need for cross-border cooperation in
fighting crime, especially economic offenses. Meanwhile, after meeting
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei Bolshakov, Chinese Prime
Minister Li Peng said "strategic partnership between China and Russia"
is "our correct and historical option." Peng, scheduled to visit Moscow
later this month to prepare for an April Russian-Chinese summit, said he
hoped annual bilateral trade would quadruple to $20 billion by the year
2000. -- Scott Parrish

LUZHKOV ORDERS EARLY START OF CHRISTMAS SEASON IN MOSCOW. Moscow Mayor
Yurii Luzhkov has officially brought forward the New Year and Christmas
season in the capital in an attempt to boost trade turnover, loosen
consumer purse strings, and cheer up fellow Muscovites, Reuters reported
on 13 December. Under the decree, shops and businesses were ordered to
move up the day when they display New Year and Christmas decorations
&gt;from the traditional 15 December to 1 December. The Moscow government
also dispatched teams of inspectors to ensure the decree is complied
with. Some large department stores, including GUM, started the holiday
season on 25 November. Many shops are also adopting new business
practices, such as offering consumers holiday discounts. -- Natalia

WAGE SURVEY PUBLISHED. A VTsIOM survey has found that only 30% of wages
in Russia were paid on time and in full in 1996, down from 45% in 1995,
Segodnya reported on 11 December. Some 31% of wages were delayed and 39%
of workers were not paid at all (compared to 38% and 17% in 1995). High-
ranking officials and managers, white-collar workers, and inhabitants of
Moscow, St. Petersburg and European North were more likely to get paid
on time, while manual workers and those living in rural areas, the Far
East and Siberia, had their salaries delayed. The proportion of people
who say that price and wage arrear increases may cause social unrest in
their regions and those who are willing to take part in protest
demonstrations increased from 26% and 23%, respectively, in 1995 to 40%
and 26%, respectively, in 1996. -- Natalia Gurushina

ARMENIAN CHURCH HEAD MEETS WITH POPE. Pope John Paul II said he hopes
the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Roman Catholic Church will
eventually reunite, after meeting with Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos
of All Armenians Garegin I in the Vatican on 11 December, Reuters
reported. The independent Armenian church split from the Vatican in the
5th century. Garegin said he is praying for the pontiff's health for
"the good of all humanity." -- Emil Danielyan

SELEZNEV IN TBILISI. Georgian parliament chairman Zurab Zhvania made
clear to visiting Russian State Duma chairman Gennadii Seleznev on 12
December that the future course of Russian-Georgian relations hinges on
a solution to the Abkhaz conflict, NTV reported. Parliament deputies
&gt;from the National Democrat faction staged a walkout prior to Seleznev's
address to the Georgian parliament to protest Russia's role in the
region. Seleznev proposed the opening of a Russian consulate-general in
Batumi to safeguard the interests of more than 30,000 ethnic Russians in
Adzharia, according to Radio Rossii. Meanwhile, the Russian government
has closed a border crossing between Georgia and North Ossetiya on
orders from the commander of the Russian Border Troops, Gen. Andrei
Nikolaev. The move imposes a virtual economic blockade on Georgia,
although goods and passengers headed for Armenia are being allowed to
proceed, Iberia reported on 12 December. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
RUSSIAN OWNERSHIP OF KAZAKSTAN INDUSTRIES. The Russian electricity
monopoly EES Rossii has taken over full ownership of the Severnii coal
basin in Ekibastuz, Kazakstan, Radio Rossii reported on 12 December. An
agreement to that effect was signed by the Russian and Kazakstani
governments -- presumably as partial payment for Kazakstan's electricity
debts to Russia. Russian CIS Affairs Minister Aman Tuleev commented the
day before that "practically all of Kazakstan's industry is owned by
third countries," mentioning India and the U.S. as examples, Radio Mayak
reported. However, foreign companies which have leased Kazakstani
enterprises often have a hard time. ITAR-TASS reported on 12 December
that the Russian firm Postovalov and Co. was abandoning its control over
the Katagaily ore factory despite having sunk $3.8 million into the
project. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
YURII BATURIN IN TAJIKISTAN. Russian Defense Council Secretary Yurii
Baturin arrived in Tajikistan on 12 December to review the ceasefire
agreement signed by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and Tajik
opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri in Afghanistan on 10-11 December,
Russian media reported. High-ranking Russian officials always visit the
Central Asian nation prior to peace negotiations. All sides involved in
the Tajik conflict still agree Rakhmonov and Nuri will meet in Moscow on
19 December to sign agreements that UN special envoy to Tajikistan Gerd
Merrem said will be even "more rewarding" than previous settlements. --
Bruce Pannier
<p>
TAJIK CEASEFIRE VIOLATED IN FIRST 24 HOURS. The latest Tajik ceasefire,
which came into effect at midnight on 11 December, has already been
violated in the Garm region, Russian and Western media reported. The
Tajik government complained to the UN, claiming that opposition forces
in Garm, 150 km east of Dushanbe, attacked a special forces unit. At
least two soldiers are reported dead. Another attack by opposition
forces was reported in the village of Labijar, 120 km east of Dushanbe,
but no casualty figures were given. The reports failed to mention that
in the hours leading up to the signing of the latest ceasefire,
government forces moved a brigade near the city of Garm, which was
captured by the opposition on 1 December. Meanwhile, the opposition is
denying that it was behind two bombs that went off in Dushanbe on 12
December, one near the parliament building and the other near the
Pakistani Embassy. -- Bruce Pannier

  YEREVAN, December 13 (Itar-Tass) - The South Korean Samsung <br>
Electronics company opened an outlet in Yerevan on Friday. This is the <br>
only shop of Samsung Electronics in Transcaucasia. The 100 square metre <br>
shop offers a wide range of goods -- from video recorders to vacuum <br>
cleaners. The supplies will be made from Finland via Moscow. <br>
   The shop idea was put forward by the Mark International Russian-Armenian<br>
<p>
joint venture, the official and only dealer of Samsung Electronics in <br>
Armenia and Transcaucasia. In the words of venture head Armen Airapetyan, <br>
it is much better to buy video, audio and other appliances in the <br>
outlet -- prices are low and service is good. <br>
   Samsung offices in Moscow and Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, are <br>
competing for the Transcaucasian market. <br>
   "We accepted the proposal of our partners with satisfaction, studied <br>
their abilities and granted them dealer powers," the general manager and <br>
head of the Samsung Electronics Moscow office told Itar-Tass. He said <br>
the company will expand its presence in Transcaucasia. <br>

    VATICAN CITY (Reuter) - The Roman Catholic and Armenian<br>
Churches Friday formally buried a theological controversy that<br>
had divided them for 1,500 years.<br>
     Pope John Paul and Karekin I, spiritual leader of the<br>
world's some six million Armenian Christians, issued a common<br>
declaration officially ending the controversy over the nature of<br>
Christ.<br>
     The controversy dates back to the 6th century when the<br>
Council of Chalcedon condemned those, including Armenian<br>
Christians, who asserted that Christ had only a divine and not<br>
also a human nature.<br>
     Thursday's declaration spoke of the dual nature of Christ<br>
and said both sides agreed that past controversies "should not<br>
continue to influence the life and witness of the Church<br>
today."<br>
     The declaration, signed at the end of Karekin's official<br>
visit to the Vatican, said past disputes were due to<br>
"linguistic, cultural and political factors."<br>
     It capped renewed contacts and theological dialogue between<br>
the two Churches in the past three decades. In the declaration,<br>
both the Pope and Karekin said they were committed to eventual<br>
unity between their two Churches.<br>
     The Armenian Church is one of the so-called Ancient Churches<br>
of the East which split away from Byzantine Christianity before<br>
the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Eastern and Western<br>
Churches.<br>
     Karekin's official title is His Holiness Karekin I Supreme<br>
Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians. He resides in<br>
Etchmiadzin, near the Armenian capital Yerevan.<br>
     The Armenian Church is an independent Christian Church<br>
introduced to Armenia by the apostles Jude and Bartholomew. In<br>
AD 301 Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as<br>
a state religion.<br>
     The Armenian Church has various patriarchates around the<br>
world and has members in the countries of the former Soviet<br>
Union, North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and<br>
Asia.<br>

<p>
INTRO:  TURKISH PRIME MINISTER NECMETTIN ERBAKAN SAYS THE U-S-LED<br>
ALLIED OPERATION TO PROTECT IRAQI KURDS FROM POSSIBLE ATTACK BY <br>
IRAQI TROOPS IS -- IN HIS WORDS -- OVER.  AMBERIN ZAMAN IN ANKARA<br>
REPORTS THE PRIME MINISTER'S ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWS WEEKS OF <br>
NEGOTIATIONS INVOLVING TURKEY, THE UNITED STATES, BRITAIN, AND <br>
FRANCE WHICH TOGETHER MAKE UP THE OPERATION KNOWN AS "PROVIDE <br>
COMFORT."<br>
<p>
TEXT:  MR. ERBAKAN SAID ALLIED FLIGHTS WOULD CONTINUE OVER <br>
NORTHERN IRAQ IN COMPLIANCE WITH A UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTION.  <br>
BUT HE SAID THE REST OF OPERATION PROVIDE COMFORT -- WHICH ALSO <br>
INCLUDED GROUND TROOPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ ALONGSIDE A HUMANITARIAN <br>
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- IS  NO  LONGER NECESSARY.<br>
<p>
WESTERN DIPLOMATS CLOSE TO THE TALKS TO REDEFINE THE OPERATION <br>
CONFIRMED THAT THE GROUND OPERATION IN NORTHERN IRAQ WILL BE <br>
DISCONTINUED.  ALLIED TROOPS BASED IN THE KURDISH-CONTROLLED <br>
ENCLAVE WERE PULLED OUT LAST AUGUST AFTER ONE OF THE MAIN IRAQI <br>
KURDISH FACTIONS -- THE KURDISTAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE K-D-P -- <br>
INVITED IRAQI GOVERNMENT TROOPS TO HELP DEFEAT ITS RIVAL, THE <br>
PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN, THE P-U-K.<br>
<p>
K-D-P LEADER MASSOUD BARZANI'S ALLIANCE WITH IRAQI LEADER SADDAM <br>
HUSSEIN IS CITED BY WESTERN DIPLOMATS AS ONE OF THE CHIEF REASONS<br>
FOR THE U-S DECISION TO END ITS HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS <br>
IN NORTHERN IRAQ.<br>
<p>
DIPLOMATS CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH TURKEY OVER THE NEW <br>
STRUCTURE OF THE ALLIED PRESENCE DESCRIBE IT AS PUTTING LESS <br>
EMPHASIS ON DEFENDING THE KURDS AND MORE ON ENHANCING THE WESTERN<br>
STRATEGIC DETERRENT --  NOT  ONLY TO IRAQ BUT TO OTHER NATIONS, <br>
INCLUDING IRAN.<br>
<p>
UNDER EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS, THE MANDATE OF THE FORCE NEEDS TO BE<br>
RENEWED EVERY THREE MONTHS BY THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT.  PRIME <br>
MINISTER ERBAKAN IS UNDER MOUNTING PRESSURE FROM HIS ISLAMIC <br>
WELFARE PARTY TO STICK TO HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO EXPEL WHAT HE <br>
USED TO DESCRIBE AS THE INFIDEL FORCE.<br>
<p>
THERE HAS BEEN SUSTAINED PUBLIC HOSTILITY TO THE WESTERN MILITARY<br>
PRESENCE.  MOST TURKS BELIEVE THAT ITS HIDDEN AGENDA IS TO <br>
OVERSEE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT KURDISH STATE IN <br>
NORTHERN IRAQ -- A FEELING THAT HAS BEEN WIDELY EXPLOITED BY <br>
MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION IN ORDER TO EMBARRASS THE GOVERNMENT.<br>
<p>
WESTERN DIPLOMATS HOPE THAT THE FORCE'S PRESENCE WILL BECOME LESS<br>
CONTROVERSIAL.  THAT HOPE IS SHARED BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND<br>
MILITARY WHO FEAR THAT THE DEPARTURE OF WESTERN TROOPS WOULD <br>
ENCOURAGE PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN TO AGAIN STRIKE AGAINST HIS <br>
KURDISH POPULATION, TRIGGERING A MASS EXODUS OF REFUGEES.  SUCH <br>
ATTACKS IN 1991 PROMPTED MILLIONS OF KURDS TO FLEE TO THE TURKISH<br>
AND IRANIAN BORDERS.  (SIGNED) <br>

<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 13, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The "Ani" joint-stock company in Martuni has started the production<br>
 of starch. It is the only enterprise in Transcaucasia producing<br>
 starch. It processes 5 tons of potatos per hour, which yields 800 kg<br>
 of starch.<br>
 The profitability of the enterprise is not high (only 4%). However,<br>
 it solves some major problems. First of all, it buys large quantities<br>
 of potatos produced in the region, thus sparing the farmers lots of<br>
 troubles related to the selling of their produce. Second, it gives<br>
 employment to many people (workers of "Ani" who were left<br>
 unemployed).<br>

        AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA<br>
        AND THE INTERSTATE BANK SIGNED IN YEREVAN<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 13, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The President of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia Bagrat<br>
 Asatrian and the President of the Interstate Bank Vladimir Mashits<br>
 signed today an agreement on opening correspondent accounts.<br>
 The Interstate Bank was established in 1993 by a special agreement of<br>
 the leaders of the CIS countries (except Azerbaijan and Georgia). The<br>
 governments and the central banks of the participating countries are<br>
 the founders of the Bank. The original purpose of the Bank was to<br>
 enhance trade and facilitate transactions between the participating<br>
 countries.<br>
 The President of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia Bagrat<br>
 Asatrian stated in a press conference after signing the agreement,<br>
 that the Interstate Bank has been a mere formal organization, but he<br>
 expressed his hope that the newly signed agreement will become a<br>
 basis for real cooperation.<br>
 The President of the Interstate Bank said that soon a representation<br>
 of the Bank will open in Yerevan. This will activate the cooperation.<br>
 Mr. Mashits also informed the journalists that he has proposed to<br>
 increase the founding capital of the Bank from 5 billion roubles to<br>
 65 billion roubles. He said that currently this proposal is being<br>
 negotiated.<br>

HEADLINE: Spokesman links Karabakh issue resolution with opening Armenia<br>
border <br>
SOURCE: TRT TV, Ankara, in Turkish 1800 gmt 11 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
[Announcer] Turkey has said that it is not considering opening its border<br>
with Armenia until a substantive agreement on principles is reached between<br>
Armenia and Azerbaijan . <br>
<p>
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli, speaking at his weekly<br>
news conference, said that there had been no positive developments with<br>
regard to the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem since the decision [by<br>
Turkey] to close the Turkish-Armenian border on 3rd April, 1993.   He<br>
recalled that Armenia did not accept the principles on a solution to the<br>
problem contained in the joint communique issued at the end of the OSCE<br>
summit Lisbon at the beginning of this month. <br>
<p>
[Atacanli] Above all, Turkey believes that Azerbaijan and Armenia should<br>
reach a substantive agreement on principles for a solution to the<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh problem in line with Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, the<br>
evacuation of the occupied territories and the return of refugees to their<br>
homes. Until such an agreement is reached, Turkey will not consider reviewing<br>
its decision regarding its border with Armenia. <br>
<p>
[Announcer] In reply to a question, Atacanli said that Armenia had on various<br>
occasions expressed the desire to develop its relations with Turkey and that<br>
Turkey was , in principle, not opposed to that. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Turkish Officials' Links to Crime Lords are Probed <br>
SOURCE: Associated Press, December 12, 1996<br>
<p>
A traffic accident that revealed links between the Turkish government and the<br>
underworld has forced President Suleyman Demirel to step in and demand an<br>
accounting. <br>
<p>
Demirel met Tuesday with the main opposition leader, Mesut Yilmaz, who has<br>
played a key role in disclosing secret ties between the police and crime<br>
bosses. <br>
<p>
There also have been allegations of government-backed death squads to<br>
suppress dissidents and Kurdish rebels. <br>
<p>
Demirel is summoning other opposition leaders and is to meet with Prime<br>
Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Thursday. <br>
<p>
"Nothing will remain secret under the sky. You cannot hide anything," Demirel<br>
told the newspaper Hurriyet. "Whoever tries to hide it gets buried under it."<br>
<p>
<p>
The scandal surfaced after a Mercedes-Benz and a tractor-trailer collided on<br>
a highway 90 miles south of Istanbul last month. <br>
<p>
A Parliament deputy, a fugitive criminal and a police official were in the<br>
Mercedes; only the deputy survived. The criminal, Abdullah Catli, reputedly<br>
had links to the Turk who shot Pope John Paul II and was wanted in<br>
Switzerland, where he was convicted of drug smuggling and escaped from prison<br>
in 1990. <br>
<p>
The connections between the three men immediately appeared suspicious.  Sedat<br>
Bucak, the deputy who survived the crash and who is also a powerful official<br>
in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast, could not provide any reasonable<br>
explanation. <br>
<p>
After the accident, Interior Minister Mehmet Agar, who had close ties to the<br>
police chief, was forced to resign under pressure from opposition parties. <br>
<p>
The scandal grew when Yilmaz said Catli organized the killing of a casino<br>
operator, Omer Lutfi Topal, with three police officers in July to help Bucak<br>
seize his assets. Three police officers who were briefly detained after the<br>
killing assigned were later to guard Bucak. <br>
<p>
Yilmaz said he had tapes of phone calls between the three officers talking<br>
about their murder of Topal. <br>
<p>
Bucak runs a 2,000-man army in southeastern Turkey to fight Kurdish rebels<br>
and reportedly receives more than $1 million a month from the government for<br>
it. <br>
<p>
Newspaper reports say his men allegedly were members of death squads that<br>
killed hundreds of supporters of the Kurdish rebel movement and have smuggled<br>
drugs and weapons. <br>
<p>
The government's handling of the scandal has led to suspicions that Foreign<br>
Minister Tansu Ciller knew about the alleged ties between the state and<br>
underworld leaders during her three years as prime minister. <br>
<p>
Ciller said in a recent speech that Catli deserved being honored for fighting<br>
for Turkey. She also accused Yilmaz of supporting the Kurdish rebel groups<br>
and Armenian terrorists by getting tough on Catli. <br>
<p>
But on Monday, Ciller told reporters after being summoned by Demirel that the<br>
state's mission is to fight criminals. "The state does not form gangs," she<br>
said. <br>
<p>
The government took its first action last week in the unfolding scandal,<br>
removing Istanbul's well-respected police chief and the three officers linked<br>
to Topal's killing. But the move against the police chief caused an uproar. <br>
<p>
News reports said the police chief, Kemal Yazicioglu, was being punished for<br>
leaking the link between the three officers and Topal's slaying. <br>
<p>
The truck driver who crashed into the Mercedes received a "most respected<br>
citizen honor" from a small leftist party for his role in exposing the<br>
scandal. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Former Soviet republics form news agency alliance <br>
SOURCE:  Kyodo News Service, December 12, 1996<br>
<p>
News agencies from nine former Soviet republics established the Association<br>
of National Information Agencies on Wednesday, according to reports from<br>
Moscow monitored in Tokyo on Thursday. <br>
<p>
The members of the news agency alliance are Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan,<br>
Armenia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Kazakstan, all members<br>
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) formed after the collapse of<br>
the Soviet Union, the report said. <br>
<p>
The news alliance was formed in a bid to facilitate cooperation among member<br>
countries and the directors of the national news agencies elected Vitaly<br>
Ignatenko, Russia's deputy prime minister and president of Itar-Tass, to head<br>
the new organization, the report said. <br>

1. SARKISSIAN MEETS WITH ARF EXECUTIVE COUNCIL<br>
<p>
YEREVAN-Armenias Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian met with <br>
representatives of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Executive <br>
Council of Armenia, Rouben Hakobian, Hrayr Karapetian and Gagik <br>
Mkrtchian on Friday to discuss his new program of development for <br>
Armenia.<br>
	The delegation congratulated the newly-appointed prime <br>
minister and stressed the importance of involving political <br>
parties in resolving the current internal political crisis during <br>
the hour-long meeting.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. SOCIALIST YOUTH VOICE CONCERN OVER BREAKDOWN OF DEMOCRACY<br>
<p>
KATHMANDU, Nepal-A delegation of the Armenian Revolutionary <br>
Federation Youth Organization took part in the annual conference <br>
of the International Union of Socialist Youth in Kathmandu, Nepal <br>
from December 6-8.<br>
	The ARF-YO delegation focused the participants attention on <br>
the breakdown of democracy in the Republic of Armenia and the <br>
grave human rights violations following the Sept. 22 presidential <br>
elections.<br>
	The IUSY conference unanimously adopted a resolution on the <br>
democratic process in Armenia.<br>
	Below is the complete text of the resolution:<br>
<p>
	Resolution on the Democratic Process in Armenia<br>
<p>
	Since her independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and the <br>
formation of the 2nd Republic (the first being that of 1918 right <br>
after WWI), Armenia has undergone a series of rough political <br>
processes on the road to becoming a genuine democratic state.<br>
	That has yet to be accomplished not because post-Soviet <br>
political and economic trends have disallowed such a <br>
development-on the contrary, most Western countries, as well as <br>
Russia, have shown keen interest toward the achievement of <br>
democracy in all CIS countries-but due to the emergence to power <br>
of a group of opportunistic individuals who have formed a self-<br>
centered and dictatorial government, working under the guise of <br>
democracy.<br>
	The recent Armenian presidential elections of September 22, <br>
1996 have shown in effect that a democratic Republic of Armenia <br>
cannot become a reality unless the ruling government either <br>
acknowledges the fundamental rights of the Armenian populous to <br>
speak, think and act freely through open political expression or <br>
gives way to the mounting popular opposition, which has shown <br>
indisputable clarity that it is time for change.<br>
	Already, the European Parliament with its Resolution (Oct. <br>
1996) of condemnation on irregularities and illegitimacy of recent <br>
Armenian presidential elections, along with the attestation to <br>
that effect by the European Electoral Monitoring Commission, have <br>
expressed serious political concern over the lack of progress in <br>
the democratic process in Armenia.<br>
	It is time for the Armenian people to show its capability to <br>
create a democratically sound state.<br>
	In light of the aforementioned, IUSY and the World Council <br>
meeting, giving top priority to democracy, economic development <br>
and human rights for all nations, addresses the issue of the <br>
democratic process in Armenia with the following:<br>
<p>
1. Expresses deep concern in the lack of democracy in Armenia.<br>
2. Calls on the current Armenian government to lift all <br>
restrictions on banned political parties in Armenia and to return <br>
all confiscated property to their rightful owners.<br>
3. Joins in solidarity to the call of the Armenian people to move <br>
towards democracy.<br>
4. Calls on the Armenian government currently in power to be <br>
accountable to the International Community on any fraud or <br>
illegitimacy taken place during the presidential elections of <br>
September 22, 1996.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. POPE, CATHOLICOS AGREE TO END 1500-YEAR RIFT<br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY (Reuter)-The Roman Catholic and Armenian Churches <br>
Friday formally buried a theological controversy that had divided <br>
them for 1,500 years.<br>
	Pope John Paul II and Karekin I, Catholicos of All <br>
Armenians, issued a common declaration officially ending the <br>
controversy over the nature of Christ.<br>
	The controversy dates back to the 6th century when the <br>
Council of Chalcedon condemned those, including Armenian <br>
Christians, who asserted that Christ had only a divine and not <br>
also a human nature.<br>
	Thursdays declaration spoke of the dual nature of Christ <br>
and said both sides agreed that past controversies "should not <br>
continue to influence the life and witness of the Church today."<br>
	The declaration, signed at the end of Karekins official <br>
visit to the Vatican, said past disputes were due to "linguistic, <br>
cultural and political factors."<br>
	It capped renewed contacts and theological dialogue between <br>
the two Churches in the past three decades. In the declaration, <br>
both the Pope and Karekin said they were committed to eventual <br>
unity between their two Churches.<br>
	The Armenian Church is one of the so-called Ancient Churches <br>
of the East which split away from Byzantine Christianity before <br>
the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Eastern and Western <br>
Churches.<br>
	The Armenian Church is an independent Christian Church <br>
introduced to Armenia by the apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew. In <br>
AD 301 Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as a <br>
state religion.<br>
	The Armenian Church has various patriarchates around the <br>
world and has members in the countries of the former Soviet Union, <br>
North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. "TRIAL OF 31" DEFENDANT HAS NERVOUS BREAKDOWN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Co-defendant in the so-called "Trial of 31" <br>
Arthur Kazarian had a nervous breakdown Thursday in court as he <br>
learned about the pressure and insults incurred by his father.<br>
	Kazarian lost self-control, jumped on the bench and started <br>
to violently shake the holding cage and shout, sources close to <br>
the case said. The other defendants, who were in the same cage, <br>
tried to restrain Kazarian and calm him down.<br>
	Court was adjourned until Monday, Dec. 16.<br>
	Prior to the breakdown, Kazarian had said that during the <br>
preliminary investigation, he had given "false" testimony under <br>
duress for fear of his familys safety. He said that he had <br>
planned to tell the truth in court. Kazarian described the charges <br>
against him as "nonsense, lies and slander."<br>
	Also on Thursday, the judicial board ordered prison <br>
officials to submit a medical report on Kazarians condition, in <br>
response to the defendants complaint that his hand had been <br>
broken and his vision and hearing were deteriorating. Kazarians <br>
attorneys also asked the court to order the Military Police, for <br>
which Kazarian worked, to also submit their clients medical <br>
records.<br>
	Kazarians father, Gevork Kazarian, also testified Thursday <br>
to repeatedly being arrested although he was in no way connected <br>
to the alleged arms delivery. Kazarian is accused of delivering <br>
arms, allegedly stored in co-defendant Ofik Asikians garage, to <br>
the Military Police. Gevork Kazarian said following his <br>
intermittent arrests and questioning, he was subjected to "moral <br>
humiliation" in August.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. EUROPARLIAMENT FREEZES TURKISH AID<br>
<p>
STRASBOURG, France (Reuter)-The European Parliament voted to <br>
freeze EU funds worth 53 million Ecus ($66 million) promised to <br>
Turkey for 1997 to help set up an EU-Turkey customs union.<br>
	Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller blasted the European <br>
Union Friday, saying it had failed to honor a bilateral customs <br>
union and was unfairly shutting Ankara out of its plans to admit <br>
new members. <br>
	Ciller, who will dine with the blocs leaders Saturday at <br>
the Dublin summit, said the one-year-old customs union had fallen <br>
short of expectations, as associated aid had not been released.<br>
	"This first year, I have to say, has been a bit of a <br>
disappointment on the part of Turkey," Ciller told a news <br>
conference. "Its only fair that we would expect the conditions to <br>
be met by the European side."<br>
	She said that Turkey-which on account of its poor human <br>
rights record has been left out of the EUs plans to expand <br>
eastward-should be the first country to be admitted, rather than <br>
being excluded.<br>
	"We have protected Europe against the threat of communism. <br>
We have protected it for a long time as an ally of NATO. All <br>
this... makes us only a fair partner in this enlargement," she <br>
said, pointing to the fact that the customs union gave Ankara the <br>
most sophisticated trade links with the EU.<br>
	She hinted that Turkey could block the planned expansion of <br>
NATO, of which it is a member, unless the EU changes its attitude.<br>
	"You can not look at the enlargement of this institution as <br>
a separate issue-these are interlocked institutions," she said.<br>
	Greece, which is constantly at odds with its eastern <br>
neighbor over territorial and minority rights issues, has vowed to <br>
block any moves by the EU presidency Ireland at the Dublin summit <br>
to advance relations with Ankara.<br>
	Ciller said that Greece and Turkey should sit down and hold <br>
a dialogue in a bid to sort out their many problems.<br>
	"Its about time that  Greece and Turkey sit down and talk <br>
about their differences and see which we can resolve and what we <br>
can not," she said.<br>
	The two countries, despite being NATO allies, almost came to <br>
war earlier in the year over uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea. <br>
The United States stepped in to broker a compromise. <br>
	Under the customs union, Ciller said, Turkeys imports from <br>
the EU have increased by more than 40 percent while its exports to <br>
the rest of the Union had increased by only seven percent. <br>
	She said that Turkey was honoring its promise to improve on <br>
human rights.<br>
	"On the human rights front we are going to work in all <br>
directions," she said, adding: "This is our dedication. This is <br>
something we are doing for our people.... Its not something we <br>
are doing for our integration process."<br>
	The European Parliament said on Thursday it was concerned <br>
that the Turkish authorities were trying to muzzle the press, <br>
warning this would damage relations between the European Union and <br>
Ankara.<br>
	"The European Parliament expresses its strong opposition to <br>
attempts to restrict freedom of the press in Turkey," the EUs <br>
directly elected assembly said in a resolution, which charged that <br>
journalists have been imprisoned, abducted and assassinated.<br>
	Euro-parliamentarians called on the government in Ankara "to <br>
abandon its plans to adopt a new law to restrict freedom of the <br>
press, which would damage relations between the EU and Turkey."<br>
	Parliament said it was shocked to learn the Turkish police <br>
had detained, fined and expelled from Turkey a member of the <br>
Danish Parliament, sent there to observe the trial of Kemal Koc. <br>
	Koc, a naturalized Dane, was arrested and jailed by Turkish <br>
authorities in Ankara on July 9 while attending his brothers <br>
funeral and charged with giving economic assistance to the Kurdish <br>
Workers Party (PKK) from Denmark.<br>
	The Euro-deputies also condemned Ankara for compiling a <br>
black list of "undesirable" EU politicians and urged the EU <br>
Council of Ministers to take steps to ensure it was scrapped. <br>
	Turkey protested  Denmark in March for allowing the <br>
convention of a session of the Brussels-based Kurdish Parliament-<br>
in- Exile in the Danish legislature.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. NEW ARS CHAPTER ESTABLISHED IN RIVERSIDE<br>
<p>
CORONA-Responding to a formal request by the Armenian community of <br>
the San Bernardino County, the Western Regional Executive of the <br>
Armenian Relief Society established the ARS "Getashen" Chapter of <br>
Riverside on Dec.8.<br>
	Seventeen new members pledged to carry on the mission of the <br>
ARS in a special ceremony at the Corona home of Hasmig Dabaghian, <br>
one of the members of the charitable organizations 27th chapter <br>
in the Western United States. Representatives of the ARS Regional <br>
Executive and members of the Diamond Bar "Arpi" and Orange County <br>
"Sevan" chapters attended the gathering. <br>
	Regional Executive chairperson Alice Madenlian congratulated <br>
the 87-year old organizations newest members and wished them <br>
success in their endeavors to serve the Armenian people, <br>
specifically the growing community in San Bernardino County. <br>
Madenlian welcomed the novitiates, who had independently served <br>
their community before joining "the ARS family."<br>
	The official ceremony concluded with the singing of the ARS <br>
anthem and the patriotic song "Getashen," the city in Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh that witnessed heroic self-defense struggles and after <br>
which the chapter is named.<br>
	Newly-inducted members Hrip Dolmajian, Hasmig Dabaghian, <br>
Berjouhi Benyazian, Rosine Panjarjian, Kohar Zaher and Sona <br>
Demirjian were appointed to the chapters executive body.<br>
	During the past year and a half, members of the chapter have <br>
been operating a Saturday school to teach area children about <br>
their Armenian heritage.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. PRELATE MARDIROSSIAN HONORED IN ORANGE COUNTY<br>

SANTA ANA-The Armenian community of Orange County honored Right <br>
Rev. Moushegh Mardirossian, Prelate of the Western United States, <br>
for ten years of service to their community during a banquet in <br>
his honor on Dec. 1. The event also served to congratulate Right <br>
Rev. Mardirossian on his election as Prelate.<br>
	Prior to his election, Right Rev. Mardirossian, nee Sarkis, <br>
served as the spiritual leader of the Forty Martyrs Armenian <br>
Apostolic Church in Santa Ana.<br>
	Eastern United States Prelate Archbishop Mesrob Ashjian, <br>
Arch. Smpad Lapajian, Arch. Yeprem Tabakian and  Right Rev. Miuron <br>
Aznikian were on among the more than 400 people in attendance at <br>
the event.<br>
	A cultural program following the benediction by Rev. Nareg <br>
Pehlivanian featured the sixth grade students of Ari Guiragos <br>
Minassian Armenian School, who recited "The Armenian Language" <br>
poem and Sunday school students that made brief congratulatory <br>
statements to the Prelate.<br>
	Arpine and Elizabeth Pehlivanian performed duets by <br>
Ganachian and Kotoyan, followed by a solo performance by Arpine <br>
Pehlivanian, accompanied on the piano by Gloria Mikayelian. <br>
	Cellist Gasia Kaprielian, accompanied by Kevork Gulatian on <br>
the piano, performed selections from Tchaikovsky, Gomidas and <br>
Ayvazian.<br>
	Following the dinner, several community representatives and <br>
clergy reflected on the Prelates dedicated service to the <br>
Armenian Church and nation, his character  and beliefs and values.<br>
	Retired Rev. Ashod Kochian highly praised Mardirossians <br>
respect and devotion toward his people and his ability to preach <br>
and guide the community. Rev. Kochian described Mardirossian as <br>
"an exemplary clergyman with a stubborn will, unrelenting spirit <br>
and celestial talents and capabilities."<br>
	Right Rev. Miuron Aznikian of Fresnos Holy Trinity Church <br>
also had high words of praise for Mardirossian and his service. <br>
"As a member of the clergy, you directed your love and caring <br>
toward everyone, inspired people to understand one another and <br>
shared your faith, hope and spirit of self-sacrifice with all <br>
those that came to hear the kind sermons of the kind shepherd, " <br>
Aznikian said.<br>
	Chairman of the Prelacy Religious Council, Arch. Yeprem <br>
Tabakian voiced hope that similar events and occasions would draw <br>
the youth of the community toward serving the Armenian Church. <br>
Tabakian congratulated  Mardirossian on behalf of the Religious <br>
and Executive councils of the Prelacy and wished him success in <br>
fulfilling his duties as Prelate just as he did while in Orange <br>
County.<br>
	Eastern United States Prelate, Arch. Mesrob Ashjian, who had <br>
been Mardirossians first teacher at the Holy See of Cilicia <br>
Seminary in Antelias, Lebanon, expressed  confidence in his former <br>
students abilities. Because he did such a good job in Orange <br>
County, he was given a greater responsibility to lead the Western <br>
Prelacy, Ashjian said of Mardirossian.<br>
	His Holiness Aram I of the Holy See of Cilicia joined those <br>
honoring Mardirossian with a special message read by Rev. Papken <br>
Charian.<br>
	Chairman of the Forty Martyrs Church Board of Trustees, <br>
Baghdig Ohanian spoke of the Prelates days in Orange County. <br>
"With his enthusiasm and commitment, Right Rev. Mardirossian <br>
inspired and breathed new life into our community," Ohanian said, <br>
crediting Mardirossian with the expansion of  community <br>
organizations. Ohanian then presented Mardirossian with a  <br>
Bishops ring.<br>
	The guest of honor was humbled by the words of praise as he <br>
expressed his gratitude to Catholicos Aram I and thanked the <br>
members of the clergy for their kind words. "Their heartfelt <br>
praises were not for me, but for my service, and their words <br>
encouraged and inspired me to continue to serve, more dedicated <br>
and determined than ever," Mardirossian said.<br>
	Reflecting on his years in Orange County, Mardirossian was <br>
especially grateful to the Armenian community there  for its <br>
decade-long nurturing and support. He thanked them and wished them <br>
continued prosperity and growth. "Let growth and development of <br>
the community be your motivation for involvement," the Prelate <br>
advised.<br>
	The final speaker of the evening was the first Prelate of <br>
the Western US, Arch. Smpad Lapajian, who wished the new Prelate <br>
success and recalled the words of John the Baptist: "We have <br>
opened a door before you and that door will not close as long as <br>
you wish to serve God and your people with genuine faith, love and <br>
complete devotion."<br>
	The evening concluded with Arch. Lapajians closing prayers.<br>
<p>

8. EIGHTH HOMENETMEN PAN-ARMENIAN GAMES CONCLUDE<br>
<p>
PASADENA-The Eighth annual Pan Armenian Games of the Armenian <br>

Armenian music before the official program got underway.<br>
	Homenetmen Regional Executive member Siran Bosnoian acted as <br>
mistress of ceremonies, and on behalf of the Homenetmen Western <br>
Regional Executive and the Athletic Council, welcomed all in <br>

MONITOR - A DAILY BRIEFING ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
NEWS:<br>
<p>
YANDARBIEV HOSPITALIZED AFTER CAR CRASH. Chechnya's president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev was hospitalized yesterday in Grozny after breaking his arm and<br>
injuring his collarbone in a road accident. Yandarbiev was not seriously<br>
injured and said there was no reason to suspect foul play. (NTV, December<br>
12) Today Yandarbiev is reported to be feeling better, and is expected to<br>
leave the hospital soon and to resume his presidential campaign. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 13)<br>
<p>
MUSLIM UNION PLANS TO SET UP FACTION IN RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT. The Union of<br>
Muslims of Russia (UMR) hopes to establish a Muslim faction in the Russian<br>
Duma. At present, most of the 26 Muslim members of the Russian parliament<br>
belong to the pro-government "Russia is Our Home" faction. Formation of a<br>
Muslim faction will be spearheaded by UMR chairman Nadirshakh Khachilaev,<br>
elected to the Duma last weekend to represent Makhachkala, capital of<br>
Dagestan. (Interfax, December 12)<br>
<p>
LEBED TO FOUND NEW PARTY. Sources close to Aleksandr Lebed say he will<br>
announce plans to found a political party at a conference of supporters on<br>
December 26. They also expect Lebed to announce that he will run for<br>
election as Governor of Tula oblast. (Interfax, December 12) Meanwhile,<br>
Thomas Pickering, until recently U.S. ambassador in Moscow, has predicted<br>
that Russian voters will soon tire of the former general and will not<br>
support him as a presidential candidate in 2000. Pickering says Lebed is in<br>
danger of becoming "another Zhirinovsky" -- "a nationalist icon with no<br>
shelf life." (UPI, December 11)<br>
<p>
OVER A THOUSAND RUSSIAN SERVICEMEN MISSING SINCE START OF WAR. Russian<br>
military authorities say 1,198 servicemen have gone missing in Chechnya<br>
since the Russian military intervention began on December 12, 1994. (Radio<br>
Russia, December 11)<br>
<p>
DUMA LEADER CALLS FOR MEASURES AGAINST PROSPECTIVE NATO MEMBERS. The<br>
chairman of the Russian Duma's Security Committee said on December 11 that<br>
Moscow should consider retargeting its nuclear missiles on Eastern European<br>
and former Soviet states desirous of joining NATO if the alliance proceeds<br>
with plans to accept new members. Viktor Ilyukhin, of the Communist party,<br>
suggested that Russia should also consider unspecified political and<br>
economic moves against those states. (Itar-Tass, December 11)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN "PIRACY" IN BLACK SEA DENOUNCED. Ukraine's consul in Georgia<br>
yesterday denounced as "piracy" the seizure of a Ukrainian cargo ship by<br>
Russian warships attached to the Russian border troops in Georgia's port of<br>
Batumi. The Russians seized the "Almaz" on December 4, detained the captain,<br>
and flew the other 10 crewmen to Russia on December 11, all without<br>
explanation, the consul stated. Kiev has protested to Moscow, and Georgia's<br>
Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it is investigating the case.<br>
(Interfax, December 12. See also Georgia in Perspective section below)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RADICAL MILITARY REFORM ON THE TABLE IN RUSSIA? Speculation is rife in<br>
Moscow that Russia's political and military leaderships are discussing plans<br>
that would radically restructure and reduce the country's entire military<br>
establishment. According to the newspaper Izvestiya, a reform program<br>
drafted by officers from Russia's General Staff outlines a two-stage period<br>
of reform. During the first stage, from 1997-2000, the regular armed forces<br>
would be reduced to 1.2 million men (their nominal strength is currently 1.7<br>
million) while military formations attached to other state agencies (the<br>
so-called "power structures") would be cut by 30 percent. The newspaper says<br>
that during the second stage, from 2001-2005, the total manpower strength of<br>
the armed forces would be 1.7 million. This figure presumably refers to the<br>
combined strength of the regular army plus the other power structures<br>
(believed now to be well in excess of three million troops), although the<br>
report does not make this clear. During this second stage Russia's military<br>
forces would be manned solely by contract (which would fulfill Boris<br>
Yeltsin's election campaign promise to end conscription), and some 500<br>
generals would be retired. <br>
<p>
The plan reportedly also calls for a redrawing of military district<br>
boundaries and an amalgamation of various military service branches and<br>
structures. The Air Defense and Air Force would be combined, for example,<br>
while the commands of Russia's strategic forces and Ground Forces would be<br>
transferred to the General Staff -- which emerges in this plan as Russia's<br>
dominant military agency. Of equal or greater importance, the plan's authors<br>
reportedly cite the need to reduce military spending as the primary reason<br>
for implementing such radical changes. They acknowledge, moreover, that<br>
Russia today is capable of waging no more than a localized military<br>
operation and suggest that, because of the weakness of Russia's conventional<br>
forces, Moscow should make clear its readiness to employ nuclear weapons to<br>
prevent any large-scale war that would involve Russia and -- in the<br>
newspaper's words -- "its allies." (Izvestiya, December 11)<br>
<p>
Although it is unclear whether the program outlined by Izvestiya is among<br>
those being considered by Russia's political and military leaders, it is<br>
consistent on several key points with military reform proposals described in<br>
recent days and weeks by, among others, Defense Council secretary Yuri<br>
Baturin. (RTR, December 11) These common elements include especially the<br>
enhancement of the General Staff's authority within the armed forces, and<br>
the extension of its oversight responsibilities to Russia's other power<br>
structures. Political leaders, moreover, have appeared in recent weeks to be<br>
increasingly receptive to the Defense Ministry's demand that the other power<br>
structures undergo manpower reductions similar to those being imposed on the<br>
army. All of this suggests that radical military reform may at last be on<br>
the table -- nearly ten years after Soviet defense reformers first began<br>
pleading its desirability. What is less clear is whether the political<br>
leadership has the political will and authority to carry it out, given the<br>
heated opposition that restructuring and reductions of this sort are sure to<br>
provoke from the well-entrenched and independent bureaucratic interests that<br>
currently comprise Russia's defense and security establishment. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
KARABAKH REBUFFS OSCE. Karabakh's Foreign Ministry and National Assembly<br>
have warned in almost identical statements that they "question the<br>
advisability of Karabakh's further participation in the [OSCE-sponsored]<br>
negotiating process" to settle the conflict with Azerbaijan. Deploring the<br>
recent OSCE summit's acceptance of Azerbaijan's position, the Karabakh<br>
statements rejected OSCE chairman-in-office Flavio Cotti's concluding<br>
document on conflict settlement principles as "one-sided, contravening the<br>
essence of international mediation," "totally ignoring the<br>
international-legal and historic aspects of the problem, and offending<br>
against justice and common sense." The OSCE is ignoring the right of peoples<br>
to self-determination, the Karabakh statements charged, and added that<br>
Karabakh has won that right at high cost and will never give up its security<br>
by becoming again a part of Azerbaijan. (Interfax, December 11-12)<br>
<p>
The statements represent an internationally unprecedented rebuff to the<br>
OSCE's authority. The organization's biannual summit, held in Lisbon last<br>
week, cemented the consensus in favor of the territorial integrity of states<br>
at the expense of the right of peoples to self-determination. Armenia found<br>
itself alone in opposing the document on the principles of settling the<br>
Karabakh conflict as defined in Cotti's statement: territorial integrity of<br>
Azerbaijan, a high degree of autonomy for Karabakh within that country, and<br>
mutual security guarantees. This stance, which has taken increasingly firm<br>
shape over the last year, has encouraged Azerbaijan's intransigence and can<br>
only delay a political settlement of the conflict, since Armenian historical<br>
experience and that of Karabakh in particular preclude acceptance of<br>
Azerbaijani rule.<br>
<p>
SELEZNEV DISCOVERS "ANTI-RUSSIAN MOODS" IN GEORGIA. Russian Duma chairman<br>
Gennady Seleznev, in Tbilisi for a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of<br>
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, addressed the Georgian parliament<br>
yesterday. Seleznev conditioned Russia's ratification of the<br>
Russian-Georgian good-neighborly relations treaty on Tbilisi's own<br>
ratification of an agreement on Russian military bases in Georgia and on<br>
other concessions by Tbilisi. The latter should include the establishment of<br>
a Russian General Consulate in Batumi where "30,000 Russian-speakers<br>
including Russian military reside," Seleznev said. In a follow-up statement<br>
he opposed Georgia's claim to a share of the ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet. <br>
<p>
Seleznev complained of "anti-Russian moods" after the opposition<br>
National-Democratic parliamentary group walked out during his speech.<br>
Georgian parliament chairman Zurab Zhvania responded that "those of our<br>
statements that Russia deems sharp actually reflect the public opinion in<br>
our country." He also described Russian policy on Abkhazia as "the main<br>
stumbling block" in bilateral relations. (Interfax, ORT, December 12)<br>
<p>
The visit took place in the long shadow of Georgian president Eduard<br>
Shevardnadze's demonstrative cancellation of a scheduled meeting with<br>
Seleznev after the Duma's March 1996 resolutions asserting the continuity of<br>
the USSR. Shevardnadze and cabinet of ministers head Niko Lekishvili<br>
received Seleznev on this visit but complained of Russian policies,<br>
including economic ones, toward Georgia. (See Monitor, December 11) Tbilisi<br>
attaches considerable -- and perhaps excessive -- value to Russian<br>
ratification of the bilateral treaty because it stipulates respect for<br>
existing borders. Moscow hopes that Tbilisi will pay the price for<br>
ratification in military bases.<br>

Sensational Accusations Against Tansu Ciller<br>
<p>
A report to the current Prime Minister of Turkey Necmettin Erbakan on former<br>
Prime Minister and acting Foreign Affairs Minister Tansu Ciller's spending<br>
of 250 billion TL ($250,000) from a secret government fund has had an effect<br>
of a bomb explosion in Ankara.  According to the report, Prime Minister used<br>
that money for training of professional assassins hired to kill Abdullah<br>
Ocalan, the leader of the PKK.  The money was given to Abdullah Catli,<br>
leader of one of the mafia gangs, who was wanted by Interpol. In early<br>
November he died in an accident in the same car with a member of the<br>
Parliament from Ciller's True Path Party and officer of secret services. The<br>
accident was the prime reason for an investigation into penetration of the<br>
mafia octopus into government structures of Turkey.  <br>
<p>
The document indicates that the operation aimed at elimination of the leader<br>
of separatists, who have been fighting to build an independent Kurdish state<br>
in the south east of Turkey for many years now, was conducted without<br>
informing the Interior Minister, National Intelligence organization and<br>
General Staff. The operation was prevented only after Turkish intelligence<br>
service had interfered to warn Ciller about deficiencies in the operation<br>
planning.  The report also asserts that Catli's gangs were trained by<br>
instructors from Israeli Mossad  and were used by Tel Aviv in several<br>
actions against Palestinians. The gangs were involved in drug trafficking<br>
and control over illegal gambling business. (end) <br>

Dear Groong and Hayastan readers,<br>
<p>
Two days ago I presented to you a project to fund - subscribing Groong<br>
to Noyan Tapan. If you're subscribed to Groong today and you like it,<br>
you will be infinitely more please with Noyan Tapan's excellent news<br>
coming to you daily.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, out of 1150 readers on Groong and 350 participants on<br>
Hayastan, I've only heard from 66 people today, pledging to fund the<br>
subscription to NT. That's about 5% participation and truly deplorable.<br>
I can't believe that 95% of the lists' audiences DO NOT CARE about<br>
improving the content of our news list.<br>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is an excellent opportunity which WE<br>
CAN NOT PASS ON. I urge you to please respond to me immediately, if you<br>
haven't already, and pledge your support for improved future news<br>
reception and sources. The sooner we're done, the sooner we'll begin<br>
receiving news from Noyan Tapan.<br>
<p>
I'm including the text of the original proposal. I hope to hear from<br>
a strong number of you very soon.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
Asbed<br>
=====<br>
	Proposal for funding of Noyan Tapan Acquisition.<br>
<p>
Dear Hayastan and Groong readers,<br>
<p>
We've been in touch with Noyan Tapan (NT) to acquire their news on a daily<br>
basis for Groong. As you may already know, NT is based in Armenia and<br>
sells its news service for a fee.<br>
<p>
NT came forward voluntarily during September's elections in Armenia and<br>
informed us with up-to-the-minute news and events for altruistic reasons.<br>
We appreciated their work; we think that their news service is very<br>
informative and timely, and we'd like to read more of it, and regularly.<br>
<p>
Noyan Tapan has requested a fee of $250/month for a specially prepared<br>
"Groong Edition" daily bulletin, and has sent us many days' worth of<br>
samples. I'm attaching one day's worth below for your perusal and<br>
judgement. I feel the fee is reasonable and well worth it.<br>
<p>
In addition to improving our quality of news here on Groong, and being<br>
better informed on Armenia and the Caucasus region in general, our<br>
subscription to Noyan Tapan will be an explicit statement of support<br>
and approval for free and independent media in Armenia.<br>
<p>
As the daily readers of Groong News, there's only you to turn to, to fund<br>
such a project. Therefore I'm asking all interested parties to come<br>
forward with any amount of donation to fund the next 12 months' worth of<br>
Noyan Tapan reception on Groong.<br>
<p>
We need to raise $3000 for this. Groong has 1100 members and Hayastan<br>
has 350. If 100 members come forward with $30 each, we're there! If<br>
more members come forward, then we will arrange to receive as many<br>
more months of daily Noyan Tapan as we have money for.  And if we<br>
don't come up with the required funds, then I will assume that we're<br>
not interested in receiving Noyan Tapan daily.<br>
<p>
I ask that you send me email, with your pledge amount, which I will<br>
tally. The deadline for this initial drive is December 25. If we're<br>
well on the way, I'll extend the deadline a bit and continue reminding<br>
very often, as I feel that this is a very worthy service and would<br>
enhance our news from Armenia greatly.  I will of course update the<br>
list very regularly of our progress. In fact, I can tell you that we<br>
already have $260 from just 4 Groong readers!<br>
<p>
My goal at the moment is to receive NT news daily for all of 1997.<br>
<p>
Send no money now. Once final amounts are tallied, I'll inform the lists<br>
where to send checks and who to write it out to. As far as trusting that<br>
your (our) funds will be well used, I assure you that every penny will<br>
be spent on this project, and there will be not a penny of administrative<br>
overheard (I'll deal with that).<br>
<p>
I hope to hear from you very soon. Please help if you can.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Asbed<br>

CC RESOLUTION REGARDING ELECTION RESULTS ADOPTED BY<br>
MAJORITY OF VOTES<br>
     YEREVAN, November  26   (Noyan  Tapan). "This was the first<br>
attempt  to  raise a  dispute   between  the  opposition and the<br>
authorities  onto  a   civilized   level,"   Chairman   of   the<br>
Constitutional Court (CC) of Armenia Gagik Haroutiunian  said at<br>
a Monday news conference.<br>
     Haroutiunian said that the Constitutional Court had  chosen<br>
the right way -- a search for a final decision  through thorough<br>
scritiny and analysis of all available documents.<br>
     Haroutiunian  reported  that the  Constitutional Court  had<br>
charged  lawenforcement    agencies   to   institute    criminal<br>
proceedings in connection with a number of violations and  carry<br>
out a probe into those cases. Haroutiunian was  astonished  over<br>
the fact   that  a  person who  had   stolen a ballot box from a<br>
polling station was sentenced to 10  days  in  jail.  Meanwhile,<br>
according to him, that was a serious crime.<br>
     CC Chairman said that the law on the  Constitutional  Court<br>
of the Republic  of Armenia bans publicising the results of  the<br>
discussions.  He only said  that  the resolution  was adopted by<br>
the majority of votes. Constitutional Court  Chairman noted that<br>
under  the  legislation in  effect, protocols of closed  meeting<br>
were immediately sealed and sent to  state  archives.  "Pethaps,<br>
in some years they will be accessible,  and everybody will  have<br>
an opportunity to know what had happened," he said.<br>
     Haroutiunian said  it   was  not right   to  form electoral<br>
commission by   party  representation principle, since, he said,<br>
the commissions should be made up  of professionals, whose  work<br>
must be supervised.<br>
     Haroutiunian highly appreciated a worthy  behavior  of  the<br>
aggrieved party representatives at  the Court.  He  said that it<br>
thanks to  them  that  the  proceedings  were held  on  a really<br>
civilized level. "Our  country  needs opposition as we have  the<br>
Parliament,  Government   and   the  Constitutional  Court,"  CC<br>
Chairman said.<br>
<p>
<p>
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN KARABAKH AROUSED AZERBAIJAN'S<br>
ANGER<br>
     YEREVAN,  November 26   (Noyan Tapan).  The   November   24<br>
presidential election  in  the   Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  were<br>
held, despite statements from  a  number of countries that  they<br>
will not recognize the election results.<br>
     On the   same  day   rallies,   protesting   the   Karabakh<br>
presidential   election  were    staged   in  Azerbaijan.    The<br>
Instanbul-based  Armenian  "Marmara"  daily  reports  that Azeri<br>
Culture Minister Polad Bul-Bul ogly said, addressing  a rally in<br>
Baku,  that  the  elections  in Karabakh  were   nothing but  "a<br>
politcal irritator". He said that  Azerbaijan  was  against  any<br>
bloodshed, but,  if   necessary, they were ready  to  shed their<br>
blood to liberate the occupied Azeri territories.<br>

            --------------- ECONOMY ----------------<br>
<p>
<p>
ECONOMIC REVIEW (NOVEMBER 17-24)<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).<br>
<p>
     NATIONAL CURRENCY<br>
     Dollar rate did not practically  change for the  week.  The<br>
average cost of 1 USD decreased by 1 point and was equal to  434<br>
drams during   the week.  At   the  same  time, the  margin (the<br>
difference between sale and purchase prices) is still very  low.<br>
Maximal sale  price   (433 drams against 1  dollar) dropped by 2<br>
points, and minimal purchase price (436  drams) decreased by the<br>
same two points.<br>
     In principle, the  margin size is to  a certain  extent  an<br>
indicator of the health of the national currency. The higher  is<br>
the margin, the more alarming is  the  condition  of  the  given<br>
currency, and vice versa. In our case, drop of the  margin  from<br>
10 drams (2.5%  of the  dollar)  in  early November to  3  drams<br>
(0.7%)  is a sign  of  healthening,  though  its causes are  not<br>
clear.  The Government  did   not take  any efficient  steps  to<br>
protect dram from devaluation , and did  not even  make a formal<br>
statement on it. The Central Bank did only  one  thing:  for the<br>
first time during  two months it  took part  in  tradings at the<br>
Yerevan and Giumri Stock Exchange and purchased a rather  modest<br>
sum of 200,000 dollars.<br>
     But this   circumstance  could  never able  to  relax   the<br>
tension on currency market. Here, we  have  probably  the result<br>
of other factors: restraint from  emission, the  fact  that  the<br>
government used only those sums that are  in circulation, delays<br>
in pension and salary payments, and hence,  low consumer  demand<br>
and  relatively  stable consumer prices.  Anyway,  it should  be<br>
noted that it is not only the dollar rate that  affects consumer<br>
prices, but  also consumer  prices cause changes  in the  dollar<br>
rate.<br>
     Exchange  rate  at the Moscow  Interbank Currency  Exchange<br>
was 5,489 ruble on November 22.<br>
<p>
     CONSUMER BUDGET<br>
     By  the end   of  the  week the  cost  of   the living wage<br>
consumer budget   was  12,900  drams (29.6 dollars). The cost of<br>
the overalkl budget constituted 19,800 drams (45.5 dollars).<br>
     So, the cost of the consumer budget dropped by  200  drams,<br>
and 0.5 dollars.<br>
<p>
     CONSUMER PRICES<br>
     NT-16  index calculated   of  16 staple   food products was<br>
equal  to 1,000,  i.e.  general level of consumer prices  had no<br>
relation to changes in dollar rate and remained unchanged.<br>
<p>
     INVESTMENT ACTIVITY<br>
     Following the "Hrant"  index,  the investment  activity was<br>
9.55 during the week.<br>
<p>
     TREASURY BILLS MARKET<br>
     "Sed  Marced"  index of   profitability of   treasury bills<br>
constituted 0.3996, which is  456 points  lower  if  compared to<br>
the previous   week. The profitability  was 39.96%. According to<br>
President of   the Sed   Marced Firm  Tigran  Jerbashian,   such<br>
decrease  is  conditioned by  the fact that  2,000,000,000-worth<br>
treasury  bills were   used  up by  foreign  investors  two week<br>
before.<br>
<p>
<p>
            ------------- KARABAKH NEWS -----------<br>
<p>
<p>
KARABAKH DISAPPOINTED WITH HELSINKI NEGOTIATIONS, FM SAYS<br>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).  "We  are  disappointed<br>
with the results of this round of negotiations  on  the Karabakh<br>
conflict", Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady  Ghoukassian said at<br>
a Nov. 26 news conference.<br>
     He  noted that results  of  a  half-and-a-year  work of the<br>
OSCE  Minsk  group  and  principles  of  the conflict settlement<br>
worked out by the Armenian party were left out  of  the  account<br>
at  the   Helsinki    negotiations.   Ghoukassian  said    that,<br>
unfortunately, at the last moment  representatives of Azerbaijan<br>
refused  to participate  in   the work,   insisting   that   the<br>
negotiations  must be  held from the initial position,  i.e. the<br>
principle of territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.<br>
     Ghoukassian  said  that  the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic did<br>
not consider   itself to  be   a  part  of Azerbaijan,   and any<br>
decision must proceed from this position.  "We  are  against any<br>
attempts to   predetermine the  results   of  the  negotiations.<br>
Respecting the  territorial  integrity,   Karabakh is  ready  to<br>
discuss this issue only after both  contending sides  hold equal<br>
initial positions at the  negotiations  and the Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
Republic  is  viewed as   a subject  of the  international law,"<br>
Karabakh's FM said. He described  statements by  the Azeri  side<br>
as statements of the  lost party which  demands  capitulation of<br>
its enemy. "If Azerbaijan really viewed Nagorno Karabakh  as its<br>
integral part, it would have  decided this  problem  by  itself,<br>
without turning to international organizations," he noted.<br>
     According to Ghoukassian, Azerbaijan intends  to kick up  a<br>
row at   the  forthcoming  OSCE summit   in Lisbon.  He   voiced<br>
confidence  that if  Azerbaijan  insists  that  the  territorial<br>
integrity be a basic principle of the  conflict settlement, then<br>
Armenia will have to use its right to veto.<br>
     He stressed  that  the  issue of  territorial  integirty is<br>
directly connected with the problem of  Karabakh's  status. "The<br>
fact  that the  Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic  is   independent  is<br>
obvious  and the status of  Karabakh  must be  a  result  of the<br>
negotiations,  and not   a starting   point  for   the  latter,"<br>
Ghoukassian said.<br>
     He emphasized   that  the presidential  election in Nagorno<br>
Karabakh proved that the Karabakh people trusts its leadership.<br>
     Ghoukassian said that the internal political  situation  in<br>
Armenia had played a certain part in toughening of  position  of<br>
Azerbaijan. However, he voiced confidence that  this  would  not<br>
influence the positions of Karabakh and Armenia.<br>
<p>
CONFLICTING SIDES FAIL TO AGREE A COMMON DOCUMENT<br>
     YEREVAN, November  26  (Noyan   Tapan).  No document  to be<br>
submitted at   the forthcoming OSCE summit in  Lisbon  has  been<br>
adopted  at a recent  round of talks  over the Karabakh conflict<br>
held in Helsinki. The positions of the parties  to  the conflict<br>
remained unchanged,   President elect   of the  Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
Republic Robert   Kocharian  said   at  a  news   conference  in<br>
Stepanakert. He noted that no document had  been  adopted during<br>
Libaridian-Guluzade meeting as well.<br>
     Kocharian noted that there  is  still a  chance to  agree a<br>
common  document  in  Vienna, a   document,  which  will then be<br>
presented at   the  Lisbon summit.  But   he was skeptical about<br>
that. He  said Azerbaijan  would stick  to its  position  as  it<br>
hoped to   submit  its  own  document at   the   Lisbon  summit.<br>
According to   Kocharian, the   Azeri side   will be pushing for<br>
territorial integirty of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan counts  that the<br>
document will be supported by all countries-participants of  the<br>
cummit, and if Armenia  uses its rights to  veto  and  does  not<br>
vote for  that  document, it will have  to  confront with  other<br>
OSCE-member  countries.  Azerbaijan   believes  that  this  will<br>
seriously affect Armenia's international image.<br>
     "This is the major  position on  which  Azerbaijan  stakes.<br>
Taking  this    position  Azerbaijan  torpedoes  any  compromise<br>
decision which  might   be  achieved before the Lisbon  summit,"<br>
Kocharian said.<br>

MANVEL EGHIAZARIAN REFUSES TO ATTEND HEARINGS ON CASE OF 31<br>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan). At a  Nov.  25  hearing<br>
on the case of 31  Manvel  Eghiazarian's nephew Gagik Vanian did<br>
not plead guilty to committing an attempt on policeman's life.<br>
     Vanian  confirmed testimonies  that  he   had  given during<br>
preliminary  probe.   He   said  that  on  the  day  of   arrest<br>
Eghiazarian's house was encircled  by  armed people in masks and<br>
heavy  military  vehicles (Vanian said the house  was surrounded<br>
by tanks).  Armed  people burst  into the yard of the house  and<br>
opened  fire.  Eghiazarian was   crying out: "Don't shoot, there<br>
are small children at the house." Vanian said  he  was  not with<br>
Eghiazarian   and  could   not    remember   precisely   whether<br>
Eghiazarian returned fire or not. Vanian  said he  did not  know<br>
whether the  assailants   were agents   of  the   lawenforcement<br>
bodies.<br>
     Vanian said that out of the arms  seized at his  apartment,<br>
only 15 cartridges really belonged to him. He said he  kept them<br>
as a memory about the Karabakh war. He said he did not  know how<br>
the rest of the arms appeared at his apartment. As to arms  that<br>
had been found at Eghiazarian's, Vanian  said  that  "Manvel has<br>
always kept   arms at  home  and   even   much  more   than  the<br>
lawenforcement agents have found."<br>
     Manvel   Eghiazarian  said  that   he  refuses  to   attend<br>
hearings, whereas   his  wife Mariam Khzyrjian will not  come to<br>
the court as a witness.<br>

 Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, Bagrat Asatrian, the<br>
 Minister of Finance of the Republic of Armenia, Levon Barkhudarian,<br>
 and the Head of the Taxation Department of the Republic of Armenia<br>
 Pavel Safarian. During the meeting the sides discussed issues related<br>

 On the same day, President Ter-Petrossian met with the Minister of<br>

        ARMENIAN AND RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTERS MEET IN MOSCOW<br>
<p>
 MOSCOW, DECEMBER 11, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 After the meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the<br>
 Republic of Armenia Alexander Arzumanian, the Russian Foreign<br>
Minister<br>
 Evgeni Primakov stated that Russia is interested in the stabilisation<br>
 of the situation in Nagorny Karabagh and the quick resolution of the<br>
 conflict based on mutual compromise.<br>
 "The solution of the problem must be found in the recognition of the<br>
 Nagorny Karabagh's right to self-determination, while respecting the<br>
 territorial integrity of Azerbaijan," continued Mr. Primakov.<br>
 During the meetings, the Armenian and Russian Foreign Ministers<br>
 reached mutual understranding in various economic and political<br>
 issues. However, the sides maintained different attitudes toward the<br>
 recent presidential elections in Nagorny Karabagh. Mr. Primakov said<br>
 that the Russian side opposed the fact of holding presidential<br>
 elections in Nagorny Karabagh before finding a solution to the<br>
 problem.<br>
 The Armenian Foreign Minister Alexander Arzumanian pointed out that<br>
 the Armenian side does not consider the elections as an extraordinary<br>
 phenomenon outside the logical limits of the negotiation process. He<br>
 reminded that in 1992, the Minsk Group had decided that the elected<br>
 authorities of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabagh should<br>
 participate in the negotiations. "Thus, the elections do not break<br>
 the harmony of the negotiation process," added the Armenian Foreign<br>
 Minister.<br>
 As for the Russian military presence in Armenia, Mr. Primakov<br>
 informed that the appropriate documents have been sent to the State<br>
 Duma (parliament) for ratification. Meanwhile, Mr. Primakov asked<br>
 the Armenian side to speed up the passage of corresponsing documents<br>
 in the Armenian parliament.<br>
<p>

 According to the Deputy Minister of Economy of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia Vardan Movsisian, unlike other loans, which were used to<br>

        REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTING CHAIRMAN OF THE OSCE VISITS<br>
        NAGORNY KARABAGH<br>
<p>
 STEPANAKERT, DECEMBER 12, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The representative of the OSCE Acting Chairman, Ambassador Anjey<br>
 Casprcik has arrived in Stepanakert. There, he was received by the<br>
 Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nagonro-Karabagh Republic Arkadi<br>

        ARMENIAN-AMERICAN COOPERATION IN THE AREA OF AGRICULTURE<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 12, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 According to the Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia Ishkhan Martirossian, the country cooperates in the area of<br>
 agriculture with several foreign organizations, mostly American.<br>
 Thus, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a<br>
 training program, where each year ten agricultural specialists<br>
 undergo special training in the United States. Within four years,<br>
 about 50 people went through this training. The USDA also has a<br>
 humanitarian aid program which generates income from the sale of<br>
 wheat to finance the "Gitaspyur" program.<br>
 Many American organizations (UMCOR, CARE, US Peace Corps, etc) make<br>
 direct investments in various villages of the country, thus providing<br>
 much needed financial assistance to the newly emerging farmers.<br>
<p>
        CENTRAL BANK CLARIFIES...<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 12, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Recently, the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia passed a<br>
 decision, according to which physical persons can apply through the<br>
 Central Bank to participate in the first distribution auction of the<br>
 short term state bonds. Some experts think that such a decision will<br>
 hamper the development of the secondary securities market in Armenia.<br>
 The Central Bank will become a dealer for physical persons, which is<br>
 an unusual function for the Central Bank.<br>
 According to the Head of the Financial Transactions of the Central<br>
 Bank of the Republic of Armenia Tigran Davtian, the purpose of this<br>
 decision is to facilitate the process of buying securities for the<br>
 people. There is a lot of money in private hands right now, and<br>
 people do not trust commercial banks. But, according to Mr. Davtian,<br>
 people trust the Central Bank. Mr. Davtian also added, that this is s<br>
 temporary measure, which will help to increase people's confidence in<br>
 the securities.<br>

1. KARABAKH PARLIAMENT THREATENS TO REVIEW OSCE PARTICIPATION<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (Noyan Tapan)-"The National Assembly of Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh expresses its regret that during the Lisbon Summit of the <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe member states, <br>
the Azeri delegations provocative stance over the settlement of <br>
the Karabakh conflict did not find a proper denouncement," <br>
according to a statement released by the National Assembly of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh Tuesday.<br>
	"The National Assembly of Karabakh views the statement by <br>
the  OSCE Chairman-in-Office about the principles of the Karabakh <br>
problem as an attempt to predetermine Karabakhs status by <br>
completly ignoring its the right to self-determination. We are <br>
also indignant by the fact that in searching for a settlement, the <br>
participants of the OSCE Minsk Group persistently renounced the <br>
international legal aspects of the problem, the current <br>
military/political situation and continued attempts at  self-<br>
preservation of the forcibly divided Armenian nation.<br>
	"We consider Azerbaijans stance voiced at the Lisbon Summit <br>
to be a continuation of the policy of annexation of Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh, which is finally aimed at forcible deportation of the <br>
native Armenian population from its historical homeland. People <br>
have a right to freedom and security. Our people paid too much to <br>
gain this right and will never agree to become a pawn in the <br>
[Caspian] oil game and to delegate the guarantee of its security <br>
to Azerbaijan, which has a criminal past.<br>
	"The National Assembly of Karabakh calls on the Azeri side <br>
to renounce the policy of annexation, blackmail, political <br>
speculation, manipulation and commence bilateral negotiations.<br>
	"We are convinced that it is the constitutional way to <br>
achieve peace between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. <br>
	"Assessing the OSCE chairmans statement as a unilateral <br>
stance, which reflects the interests of only Azerbaijan and <br>
contradicts the essence of international mediation, the Karabakh <br>
Parliament claims that such a stance by the OSCE makes us wonder <br>
if Karabakhs further participation in the Minsk process makes any <br>
sense. <br>
	"The Karabakh Parliament calls on the United Nations, the <br>
OSCE, the Commonwealth of Independent States and other <br>
international organizations to display support for our peoples <br>
aspiration to freedom and self-determination and actively <br>
contribute to the peaceful settlement of the conflict on the basis <br>
of a fair, wise and mutually admissible decisions."<br>
<p>
<p>
2. APPEALS FILED IN "DRO" CASE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Shrjan)-The attorneys for Hrand Markarian, Ara <br>
Harmandarian and Armenak Mnjoyan announced plans Thursday to <br>
appeal the verdict and sentences in the case of the so-called <br>
"Dro" case, which concluded Tuesday more than a year later.<br>
	Rouben Rshdouni, who was not in the courtroom during <br>
Tuesdays sentencing, said he planned to file an appeal with <br>
Armenias Supreme Court. Rshdouni was not present due to another <br>
court appearance in Kapan Tuesday, sources close to the case said.<br>
	Armenian law on appeals allows ten days for attorneys to <br>
file with the Supreme Court. In the case of the "Dro" trial, the <br>
Supreme Court heard the original case. A new judicial board or a <br>
new judge may be assigned the case on appeal.<br>
	Sahakian said he will base his appeal on the fact that <br>
Markarian was never convicted of a crime, yet he received the <br>
maximum sentence for the crimes he was charged with. "[Judge] <br>
Edward Manoukian finally made his decision, but failed to outline <br>
the extenuating circumstances leading to the sentence," Sahakian <br>
said, adding that Manoukian also disregarded the testimony of <br>
character witnesses, especially a statement from General Arkady <br>
Tatevosian.<br>
	According to Sahakian, the judge was unable to establish a <br>
link between Hrand Markarian and the "Dro" group because in order <br>
do that he would have had to present evidence, which simply does <br>
not exist. "Manoukian, himself, acknowledged this fact and <br>
acquitted my client of those charges. I can only say that <br>
Armenias leadership does not want to see Markarian free," he <br>
said.<br>
	Ara Harmandarians verdict was also unfair, Sahakian noted.<br>
	Anahit Yessayan, co-counsel for Markarian, said that she <br>
expected acquittal of all charges, based on the fact that all the <br>
evidence presented in court had been compiled through questionable <br>
preliminary investigations and depositions. 	<br>
	"There was a document signed by the Defense Minister of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh giving Markarian permission to carry and <br>
distribute weapons," Yessayan said, pointing to Markarians <br>
charges of illegal possession of weapons and forged documents.<br>
	"Those charges are also morally wrong if you take into <br>
consideration that he [Markarian] fought for the defense of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh. And in that capacity, carrying forged documents <br>
oftentimes was imperative in securing the defense of a large <br>
portion of the Armenian population," Yessayan added.<br>
	In addition, Hrand Markarian reportedly affixed official <br>
Azeri stamps to the passports of the self-defense fighters in <br>
order to facilitate their travel throughout the region. "This <br>
charge was also unsubstantiated," Yessayan said.<br>
	Yessayan was convinced that the maximum sentence was given <br>
to her client based on unsubstantiated charges in order to free <br>

3. SCIENTISTS MARK ANNIVERSARY OF FOUNDER OF SPACE BIOLOGY <br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-A scientific conference dedicated to the <br>
90th anniversary of the founder of space biology and member of the <br>
National Academy of Armenia, Norayr Sisakian, took place Thursday <br>
at the National Academy of Sciences in Armenia.<br>
	"Today we are paying tribute to the greatest son of Armenia <br>
who achieved worldwide success in the creation of a number of new <br>
trends in science," President of the National Academy of Sciences <br>
of Armenia, Fadey Sarkissian said as he greeted the participants <br>
of the conference. Sisakians son, Vice-Director of the United <br>
Institute of Nuclear Studies, (Dubna) Alexey Sisakian, also <br>
attended the conference.<br>
	Fellow scientist Armen Galoyan briefed those present on the <br>
wide range of scientific problems which were first surveyed by <br>
Sisakian. He especially pointed out the scientific research of <br>
1960-1962, which dealt with biological and medical research on the <br>
preparation of a human being for space mission.<br>
	The participants also hailed Sisakians great contribution <br>
to the development of science when he was the Soviet Union <br>
representative to UNESCO. <br>
	Sisakian who died at 59  was the receipient of a number of <br>
awards including  a title of  Bach and Mechnikov prizes, as well <br>
as medals from the Liege University (Belgium, 1956) and Pasteurs <br>
Institute (Paris, 1959). One of the moons craters was named after <br>
Sisakian.<br>
	In January 1997, an international symposium, "Problems of <br>
Biochemistry, Radiation and Space Biology," dedicated to Sisakian <br>
will be held in Moscow and Dubna and will be sponsored by UNESCO. <br>
The Russian Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences <br>
of Armenia and the Yerevan State University will take part in the <br>
organization of the symposium. The President of the National <br>
Academy of France, Professor Grunberg-Manago, Academicians from <br>
the Russian Academy of Sciences and NASA representatives have been <br>
invited to attend the symposium.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. DEFENDANT KAZARIAN DENIES PRELIMINARY TESTIMONY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-At Wednesdays "Trial of 31" court session, <br>
defendant Arthur Kazarian pleaded not guilty to charges of <br>
plotting a coup detat and terrorist activity.<br>
	He noted that the preliminary evidence linking him to a coup <br>
detat and acts of terrorism were not true. The defendant said he <br>
had given these "false statements" to help his arrested father, <br>
relatives and neighbors. Kazarian refused to answer whether he had <br>
been tortured in the course of the preliminary investigation.<br>
	He said that he had been denied access to an attorney  from <br>
the onset of the trial. The court refused Kazarians request for a <br>
new attorney. Kazarian is the only defendant who does not have <br>
legal representation.<br>
	Kazarian also said that attempts to connect the "Dro" <br>
detachment which  fought  on the Armenian border  with the "Dro" <br>
case or the ARF Party had been early in the case.  Kazarian said <br>
the preliminary investigation was set up to connect these people <br>
with the "Trial of  31" case.<br>
	The defendant was bewildered over the fact that three hours <br>
after the policemen had been killed, he and co-defendant Gagik <br>
Karapetian were announced murderers and their photographs shown on <br>
numerous TV news broadcasts.<br>
	"This means that everything had been plotted including the <br>
murder of the policemen," said Kazarian.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. CENTRAL BANK OF AZERBAIJAN MAY JOIN BASEL COMMITTEE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Chairman of the Transcaucasian  Council, <br>
Rouben Valessian reported on Wednesday that the Central Bank of <br>
Azerbaijan would be joining the regional group of Trancaucasian <br>
and Central Asian countries of the International Basel Banking <br>
Control Committee.<br>
	The regional group of Transcaucasian and Central Asian <br>
countries of the International Basel Banking Control Committee was <br>
set up in Yerevan in 1995. Azerbaijan has never participated in <br>
the work of the Committee. <br>
	Valessian said that from now on all decisions on control <br>
standards would be taken by the International Basel Committee for <br>
banking control after they are agreed on with the regional groups.<br>
	The group's Ashkhabad conference dealt with problems of <br>
todays banking control methods and ways of controlling <br>
international banking systems. The next conference will be held in <br>
Tbilisi, in June 1997.<br>
	Valessian particularly stressed the importance of his <br>
meeting with representatives of Turkey. This was the first meeting <br>
at the Central Bank level. <br>
	Valessian said he planned to visit  Ankara to discuss <br>
problems with the  exchange of specialists and banking control.<br>
<p>

7. MAFIA SCANDAL EMBROILS POLITICS IN SCANDAL<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-A government parliamentarian Thursday faced <br>
possible prosecution in a security scandal that is drawing <br>
Turkeys politicians deeper into a twilight world of gangsters, <br>
mystery murders and heroin trafficking.<br>
	Justice ministry officials said a prosecutor had asked in a <br>
report for legal steps to be taken to lift deputy Mehmet Agars <br>
parliamentary immunity from legal censure.<br>
	"This report has reached our criminal affairs department. It <br>
is being studied," a ministry official told Reuters.<br>
	Agar, who quit as interior minister in November over the <br>
scandal, was accused this week of having signed a false police <br>
identity document for a fugitive gangster who was allegedly used <br>
by officials to kill Turkeys political opponents.<br>
	President Suleyman Demirel, who usually stays clear of day-<br>
to-day politics, has put his weight behind calls for five weeks of <br>
allegations to be cleared up.<br>
	"This is an important matter. It has to be brought to light. <br>
It has to go as far is it goes," he told Turkish television on <br>
Wednesday in a rare interview that was devoted to the scandal.<br>
	The media and opposition have alleged that leading officials <br>
directed hit squads to kill Kurdish rebel sympathizers and <br>
business rivals. More than 1,300 people have died since 1992 in <br>
unsolved political killings, human right activists say.<br>
	The scandal broke on November 3 when a car carrying a <br>
government parliamentarian who heads a Kurdish militia, a wanted <br>
gangster and a leading policeman crashed.<br>
	It has pushed problems like annual inflation of more than 80 <br>
percent, faltering revenue-raising plans and worsening relations <br>
with Europe almost off the political map.<br>
	Demirel said he feared the whole establishment could be <br>
tainted by the affair. "If the perpetrators are not found the <br>
state will get the blame. I am also uneasy about (the mystery <br>
killings)."<br>
	He said main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz had given him <br>
names of "people in high places" involved in the scandal. <br>
	Demirel met Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Thursday <br>
evening for talks on Yilmazs accusations that a network of up to <br>
120 people directed by senior policemen are involved in murders, <br>
extortion and drug smuggling.<br>
	"Whatever is necessary will be brought out into the open. <br>
The state is legal state. If there is within the state, a person <br>
or group acting against the law, none of us can accept this," <br>
Erbakan said after the meeting.<br>
	Erbakans coalition partner Tansu Ciller, linked by the <br>
media to the scandal, said the atmosphere of suspicion had dented <br>
public faith in the system.<br>
	"Turkey has been put under a cloud, from the office of the <br>
president to the police force and parliament," Foreign Minister <br>
Ciller told a meeting of her True Path Party.<br>
	Western diplomats say Ciller has lost much of her <br>
credibility for a speech she made last month in which she praised <br>
convicted heroin smuggler Abdullah Catli, who died in the crash, <br>
and suggested he had done political dirty work for the security <br>
apparatus.<br>
	Although Catli had been sought for murder for 18 years, a <br>
police identity document and a passport of a kind only issued to <br>
top officials were recovered in the car.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. EUROPARLIAMENT URGES BELARUS AID FREEZE<br>
<p>
STRASBOURG, France (Reuter)-The European Parliament on Thursday <br>
urged the 15-nation European Union to stop financial aid to <br>
Belarus because of doubts over its commitment to democracy.<br>
	Hard-line Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has been <br>
criticized in the West for using a huge victory in a November 24 <br>
referendum to rewrite the constitution and secure sweeping powers <br>
for himself.<br>
	The EU assembly, said that only democracy-related aid under <br>
the so-called TACIS program, which includes measures to support a <br>
free and independent media, should be maintained. <br>
	The Parliament confirmed an earlier statement that it would <br>
go no further with a planned cooperation and partnership accord <br>
with the former Soviet republic until it had received "clear <br>
signals from the Belarus authorities of their intention fully to <br>
respect basic democratic and human rights."<br>
	The Parliament said in a statement that the EU should use <br>
its weight to put pressure on international organizations to <br>
freeze their own aid in a bid to force democracy in Belarus.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. JOHN &amp; ASTGHIK PETROSSIAN DONATE $15,000 TO PRELACY<br>
<p>
LOS ANGELES-Mr. &amp; Mrs. John and Astghik Petrossian of Encino <br>
recently donated $15,000 to the Western Prelacy on the occasion of <br>
the new year and Christmas holidays.<br>
	For years the Petrossians have been regular contributors to <br>
the Prelacy and through their financial and moral generosity have <br>
supported the religious, education and cultural activities <br>
undertaken by the Prelacy.<br>
	Through this donation, the Petrossians, once again, have <br>
sponsored the annual traditional Christmas banquet hosted by the <br>
Prelate.<br>
	The Petrossians also underwrote all costs for His Holiness <br>
Aram I, Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia during his first <br>
pontifical visit to the Western Region.<br>
	Western Prelate Right Rev. Moushegh Mardirossian and the <br>
Prelacy Religious and Executive councils expressed their gratitude <br>
to the Petrossians for their continued generosity.<br>
	John Petrossian is a National Representative Assembly <br>
Delegate from Encinos Holy Martyrs Armenian Church.<br>

<p>
Some 16 Armenian citizens, including six children, were detained while trying<br>
to illegally cross the Polish-German border in Strzegow, Zielona Gora<br>
Province [western Poland], today, spokesman for the local Border Guard Piotr<br>
Zakowiak has reported. <br>
<p>
The Armenians were travelling in a large Volkswagen with Poznan registration<br>
plates. The driver of the car managed to escape but was seized later in the<br>
day. <br>

HEADLINE: Three members of "terrorist group" sentenced to death <br>

Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Three members of the 'Dro'organization who were accused of terrorist<br>
activities, including political assassinations, have been sentenced to death.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Armenian Supreme Court's panel of criminal judges sentenced "the<br>
organizer and the head of the armed band" , a Lebanese citizen, Arsen<br>
Artsruni, and two other members of the group - Armen Grigoryan and Armenak<br>
Minjoyan.   The latter is a grandson of the famous Soviet pharmaceutical<br>
chemistry scientist, Academician Armenak Minjoyan [1904-1970], the founder<br>
and director of the Yerevan Research Institute of Pure Organic Chemistry<br>
which now bears his name. <br>
<p>
Other members of the group received prison sentences of varying length. Among<br>
them Ara Kharmandayan, a Lebanese citizen, was sentenced to six years<br>
imprisonment. <br>
<p>
It was not proved that Grant Markaryan, an Iranian citizen, and Gegam<br>
Manukyan were members of the 'Dro' organization. Nevertheless, the former was<br>
sentenced to five years imprisonment for using a forged USSR passport and for<br>
illegal possession of arms and the latter got a three-year prison sentence<br>
for not reporting the planned crimes. The verdict specifies that the men have<br>
a week to appeal. <br>

HEADLINE: Islamic foreign ministers ready to condemn Armenia over Karabakh <br>
SOURCE: ITAR-TASS news agency (World Service), Moscow, in English 1502 gmt 10<br>
Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Foreign ministers from the countries of the Organization of the Islamic<br>
Conference (OIC) meeting in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, on 10th December<br>
backed Azerbaijan in condemning "Armenian aggression" and calling for the<br>
liberation of occupied Azerbaijani territory, ITAR-TASS news agency reported,<br>
quoting Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov. <br>
<p>
Hasanov said that on the second day of the meeting many speakers "<br>
unequivocally supported Azerbaijan's righteous cause" and condemned Armenia.<br>
"My country's assessment of Yerevan's actions as 'Armenian aggression' was<br>
politically backed by the OIC members," Hasanov said. <br>
<p>
He said the calls by speakers at the meeting for the withdrawal of Armenian<br>
troops from occupied Azerbaijani territory would be reflected in the<br>
meeting's final resolution on this issue, which, judging by the tone of the<br>
speakers, would differ very little from the original draft. <br>
<p>
Hasanov also expressed his appreciation of Russia's "sufficiently objective"<br>
stand on Nagornyy Karabakh, saying that recently Moscow had taken "a whole<br>
line of serious steps to achieve a fair settlement of this problem" , the<br>
agency said. <br>
<p>
"We must have only friendly relations with Russia," Hasanov added. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Turkey drops plan to open border gate with Armenia <br>
SOURCE:  Agence France Presse, December 11, 1996<br>
 <br>
Turkey said Wednesday that it would not open a border checkpoint with Armenia<br>
unless Yerevan moved to settle a territorial dispute over the disputed<br>
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in neighboring Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
"As long as Armenia does not take steps toward an agreement with Azerbaijan,<br>
Turkey's earlier decision (to keep its border with Armenia closed) will<br>
remain in effect," foreign ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli told reporters.<br>
<p>
<p>
Turkey closed its frontier with Yerevan in April 1993 amid an Armenian<br>
military campaign to capture Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave mainly populated by<br>
Armenians but within Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
Turkey gave signs of revising its decision this year, with Foreign Minister<br>
Tansu Ciller saying in October that Ankara was planning to open the border<br>
with Armenia at Akyaka. <br>
<p>
But diplomats said Armenia's recent refusal to acknowledge the need for a<br>
solution to the problem had forced Turkey to rethink. <br>
<p>
The Azeri-Armenian dispute threatened the publication of a final declaration<br>
at the end of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)<br>
summit in Lisbon last week. <br>
<p>
In the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute which flared in 1988, local Armenians have<br>
captured the whole of the enclave and surrounding Azeri lands. <br>
<p>
Turkey has given full diplomatic support to Azerbaijan, with which it has<br>
ethnic, linguistic and religious links, throughout the dispute. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Taiwan Buddhist group aids refugees in Azerbaijan <br>
SOURCE:  Deutsche Presse-Agentur, December 11, 1996<br>
<p>
A Taiwan Buddhist group will join London University in a<br>
3-million-U.S.-dollar aid programme for Azerbaijan refugees, the group said<br>
Wednesday. <br>
<p>
The Tzuchi International Relief Fund will donate 1.65 million dollars and<br>
London University will raise 1.35 million dollars. <br>
<p>
"One million Azerbeijans were made homeless by the territorial war with<br>
Armenia, which started after the collapse of the Soviet Union," Tzuchi<br>
spokesman Hsieh Ching-kuei said. <br>
<p>
The fund will be used to build new camps and to buy wheelchairs, blankets and<br>
clothing. <br>
<p>
The three-year project will start after the agreement is signed by Tzuchi<br>
founder Reverant Cheng Yen and Azerbaijan Deputy Prime Minister Izzat<br>
Rustamov. <br>
<p>
The international fund is part of the Tzuchi Buddhist Foundation, founded by<br>
Cheng Yen - hailed as Taiwan's Mother Teresa - in 1966 in Hualien county. <br>
<p>
Her fund has sent relief to China, Outer Mongolia, Ethiopia, Nepal, Cambodia<br>
and Rwanda. <br>

HEADLINE: Armenian Church leader visits Pope <br>
SOURCE:  Reuters North American Wire, December 11, 1996<br>
<p>
Pope John Paul on Wednesday welcomed to the Vatican His Holiness Karekin I,<br>
spiritual leader of the world's some six million Armenian Christians, who is<br>
on a five-day official visit. <br>
<p>
Karekin's official title is His Holiness Karekin I Supreme Patriarch and<br>
Catholicos of All Armenians.   He resides in Etchmiadzin, near the Armenian<br>
capital Yerevan. <br>
<p>
The two- the Pope wearing his traditional white cassock and the bearded<br>
Karekin wearing a hooded black robe- sat side by side on identical thrones<br>
during the Pontiff's general audience. <br>
<p>
The Armenian Church is one of the so-called Ancient Churches of the East<br>
which split away from Byzantine Christianity before the Great Schism of 1054,<br>
which divided the Eastern and Western Churches. <br>
<p>
The Pope told the crowd in the Vatican's audience hall that he hoped the two<br>
Churches could eventually reach full unity. <br>
<p>
Karekin said he was praying for the 76-year-old Pope's good health, "not only<br>
for the good of the Roman Catholic Church but for that of all humanity." <br>
<p>
The Armenian Church is an independent Christian Church introduced to Armenia<br>
by the apostles Jude and Bartholomew. In 301 A.D. Armenia became the first<br>
nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion. <br>
<p>
The Armenian Church has various patriarchates around the world and members in<br>
the countries of the former Soviet Union, North and South America, the Middle<br>
East, Europe and Asia.<br>

HEADLINE: Defendory International exhibition <br>
SOURCE:  Jane's Defence Systems Modernisation,  December 1, 1996<br>
<p>
The ninth biennial Defendory International exhibition took place in Athens,<br>
Greece, from 1 to 5 October. Exhibitors from 28 countries took part,<br>
including, for the first time, Armenia (which introduced a new assault<br>
rifle), Iran and Slovakia. The Editor, with input from Christopher F. Foss,<br>
reports from Piraeus, Athens. <br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 239, Part I, 12 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN ADDRESSES COUNTRY ON CONSTITUTION DAY. Russia marked the third
anniversary of the adoption of its constitution on 12 December 1993. In
a written address to the nation distributed by ITAR-TASS, President
Boris Yeltsin called the past year "particularly important for the
consolidation of the constitutional system" since elections were held at
the national, regional, and local levels. He stressed the fact that even
the majority of those who do not like the constitution try to change it
through constitutional procedures, meaning that the country's progress
toward democracy is irreversible. Moskovskaya pravda on 11 December,
however, reminded its readers that the constitution was drawn up "with
Yeltsin in mind" and that its approval in the December 1993 referendum
was surrounded by numerous allegations of fraud. The article complained
that the constitution gives Yeltsin so much power that he cannot use it
all, and it falls into the hands of unelected officials. -- Robert
Orttung
<p>
ZYUGANOV: OPPOSITION HAS DRAFTED 12 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. Communist
Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov announced that the opposition has
prepared 12 constitutional amendments to alter the balance of power,
which is currently heavily weighted toward the president, ITAR-TASS and
Russian Public TV (ORT) reported on 11 December. He regretted that the
current constitution does not sufficiently guarantee economic rights,
such as a right to a job and decent income, and again advocated creating
a State Council to approve policy, on which the presidential
administration, government, and parliament would all be represented.
Constitutional amendments must be approved by two-thirds of the State
Duma and three-fourths of the Federation Council before being sent to
regional legislatures. Zyuganov's proposals could gain enough votes in
the Duma but are unlikely to do so in the council. Meanwhile, Zyuganov
predicted that the only big celebrations of Constitution Day in Russia
would be on national television networks, NTV reported. -- Laura Belin
<p>
DEFENSE COUNCIL MEETS. Russia's Defense Council on 11 December decided
to increase the powers of the General Staff, granting it the authority
to coordinate some two dozen federal agencies that employ uniformed
servicemen, Russian media reported. But Defense Council Secretary Yurii
Baturin said the change would take time to implement. Russian TV (RTR)
reported that the council also discussed streamlining the number of
service branches while reducing military manpower to 1.2 million by
2001. The new military doctrine under consideration also reportedly
provides for the use of nuclear weapons if Russia faces an overwhelming
conventional attack, a move Russian officials have linked to NATO plans
for eastward expansion. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
MORE ON THE CHUBAIS, ILYUSHIN TAPE. Moskovskii komsomolets on 11
December published what it described as an expert analysis of the tape-
recording on which its controversial 15 November article "Vote or..."
was based. The transcript--of a conversation between Anatolii Chubais
and Viktor Ilyushin--raised awkward questions about the financing of
President Yeltsin's re-election campaign and the influence of the
executive branch on the Procurator's Office. Both Chubais and Ilyushin
have denied that the conversation took place. Moskovskii komsomolets
reported that the U.S.-based Dinatronic Laboratory found that the tape
had not been edited or tampered with and that the recording was probably
made on a portable cassette recorder. The paper said it had turned to a
U.S. company because it doubted the impartiality of the Federal Agency
for Government Communications and Information (FAPSI), which is
examining the tape for the Procurator's Office, and predicted that the
whole affair will be allowed to drop. -- Penny Morvant
<p>
RUSSIA, CHINA SIGN DEFENSE AGREEMENT. Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Aleksei Bolshakov and Chinese Central Military Council Deputy Chairman
Liu Huaqing signed a military-technical cooperation agreement in Beijing
on 11 December, Russian and Western agencies reported. While details of
the accord were not released, Bolshakov said Russia is "determined to
expand" military cooperation with China, according to AFP. The agency
also reported that an accord allowing China to produce SU-27 fighters
under license was finalized during Bolshakov's visit, and cited Valery
Mikhailov, head of the Russian government's military industry
department, as saying that future arms contracts with China will be
worth "billions of dollars." Russian officials often cite increased
military cooperation with China as a possible response to NATO
enlargement. Bolshakov's delegation also discussed possible Russian
participation in the Three Gorges hydroelectric project, and proposed
oil and gas pipelines to run from Irkutsk through Mongolia and northern
China. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA REGAINS MODERN SPY SATELLITE CAPABILITY. A Cyclone-2 booster
launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome sent a Russian Kosmos-2335 photo
intelligence satellite into orbit on 11 December, AFP and ITAR-TASS
reported. The satellite will restore Russia's ability to acquire high-
quality photo intelligence, which it has lacked since late September,
when a similar satellite fell from orbit, while earlier attempts to
replace it had failed. "Now we will be more comfortable," said a duty
officer at the cosmodrome, explaining that Russia also has a number of
older spy satellites, but they cannot produce high-quality photos or
transmit them to the ground as quickly as the Kosmos-2335. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
BUDGET PROSPECTS DISCUSSED. The Duma will reconvene on 15 December to
discuss the draft 1997 budget, having postponed a vote on it on 6
December. If the budget is not signed into law by the beginning of the
new year, spending will be limited to the average monthly outlays in
1996, according to Rossiiskaya gazeta on 11 December. Aleksei Golovkov,
the deputy head of the Duma Budget Committee, said this would mean a
sharp fall in spending in comparison with the 1997 draft. Industrial
subsidies would be down 39%, social spending down 38%, and regional
subsidies down 59%. Sergei Belyaev, head of the pro-government faction
Our Home Is Russia, admitted that "Our faction is not very enthusiastic
about the budget draft ... we believe that it should have been
formulated on the basis of different principles," Rossiiskie vesti
reported on 10 December. However, given that the government is unwilling
to submit an inflationary budget, deputies may see little alternative to
accepting the current draft. On 11 December, the controversial draft law
on money laundering failed to pass the Duma (see OMRI Daily Digest, 10
December 1996). -- Peter Rutland
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
TURKEY ABANDONS PLANS TO OPEN BORDER WITH ARMENIA. The Turkish Foreign
Ministry on 11 December announced that Turkey will not open its border
with Armenia unless the latter "takes steps" toward respecting
Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh and provides for a
withdrawal of Armenian forces from the "occupied Azerbaijani
territories," international agencies reported. The ministry statement
contradictsa an earlier announcement by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
that the border will be opened soon (see OMRI Daily Digest, 24 October
1996). The ministry might be reacting to Armenia's refusal to sign a
document that mentioned Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan at the
OSCE's recent summit in Lisbon. Turkey closed its border with Armenia in
early 1992 after accusing it of "military aggression" against
Azerbaijan. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTERS IN KAZAKSTAN COMPLAIN ABOUT RESTRICTIONS.
Representatives of more than 80 independent television and radio
stations in Kazakstan sent a letter of protest to President Nursultan
Nazarbayev complaining of "abuses" against non-governmental stations,
ITAR-TASS reported on 11 December. The letter specifically pointed to
the shut down of the radio and broadcasting company "M" and the radio
station Totem, both still off the air, as well as other stations banned
for several days at the beginning of November. The pro-government Kazak
TV on 9 December, in a broadcast monitored by the BBC, attributed the
independent stations' displeasure to their unwillingness to broadcast in
the state language, Kazak. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
GRIM SITUATION FOR KYRGYZ ORPHANS. Children in Kyrgyz orphanages are
mostly handicapped, live in buildings with little or no electricity and
where hygienic conditions are appalling, and they receive minimum
attention from staff, according to Reuters on 12 December. They are not
given toys because, as one worker said, "they would just break them."
Tatyana Rupyova, a nurse at one of the orphanages who is paid $15 a
month, explained "we don't have medicine, clothes, or vitamins to give
them." The Kyrgyz economy is in crisis and many families with
handicapped children cannot afford to take care of them, and often give
them up to one of the country's four orphanages. Orphanage Director
Maksim Yelizanov said when they die at the orphanages "the parents don't
even come to bury their children." A Norwegian worker with the Save the
Children agency in Kyrgyzstan said the situation is "worse than in
Romania." -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
NEW AGREEMENT ON TAJIK CEASEFIRE. Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and
United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri agreed to a ceasefire
on 11 December during their meeting in northern Afghanistan, according
to Russian and Western press. The ceasefire was due to come into effect
at midnight the same day and the two leaders will formally sign it at a
19 December meeting in Moscow. However, government forces were
reportedly launching an assault on Garm on 11 December in an attempt to
free a special forces unit trapped in the town. NTV reported that the
opposition had suffered heavy losses in the battle. In the Tajik capital
Dushanbe, two bombs went off on 12 December killing one person and
injuring another. One of the bombs exploded outside the Tajik
Parliament, the other near the Pakistani Embassy. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
CORRECTION: The item in the OMRI Daily Digest of 11 December 1996 (No.
238), titled "19 Former OPON Members Arrested in Azerbaijan," should
have said that Yagub Mamedov is the former Azerbaijani parliament
speaker.

UKRAINE CONCERNED OVER ARMS SALES ALLEGATIONS. Deputy Foreign Minister
Kostyantyn Hrishchenko called on the U.S. to make an official
declaration that Ukraine had not violated its international commitments
and sold arms to Libya, AFP reported on 11 December. The request was
made in response to a Washington Times article, allegedly based on top-
secret CIA documents, that said Kyiv sold SS-21 missiles to Libya.
Reuters reported that the official Libyan news agency Jana denied
Tripoli had made such a deal. Libya is under a UN arms embargo for its
failure to hand over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner
over Scotland that killed 270 people. Ukraine is the third largest
recipient of U.S. aid and has been cautious not to engage in any deals
that could strain its relations with the U.S. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
POLISH COMMENTS ON NATO ENLARGEMENT. Polish Deputy Defense Minister
Andrzej Karkoszka said Poland welcomes the NATO ministers' decision,
made on 10 December in Brussels, not to deploy nuclear weapons on the
territory of any new pact members. The decision removes the ground for
escalation of "suspicions and distrust" in the neighboring countries,
Karkoszka said after the "Integra '96" international seminar on
strategic planning after NATO enlargement. Polish Foreign Minister
Dariusz Rosati, commenting on recent statements by his Russian
counterpart Yevgenii Primakov in Brussels, said Russia wants to slow
down the process of NATO enlargement but is preparing to accept the

CHECHEN CONFERENCE IN POLAND. A "Round-table Conference on Rebuilding
Chechnya, Peace in the Caucasus, and Democracy in Russia" opened on 11
December in Warsaw under the auspices of the Warsaw and Krakow town
councils, Polish dailies reported. The Chechen interim deputy prime
minister and foreign minister are at the conference, and Alla Dudayeva,
deceased President Dzhohar Dudayev's widow, is a guest of honor.
Answering Russian official demands to clarify his government's position
on the conference, the Polish ambassador in Moscow, Andrzej Zalucki,
said it is a municipal and not a governmental initiative. He was told
that Russia is concerned by the activities of the "so-called Chechen
representatives" in Poland. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned on 27
November that efforts to establish Chechen representations abroad with
diplomatic status will be considered a gesture "inimical to Russia." A
Chechen center is active in Krakow and another one is to open in Warsaw
on 15 December. -- Jakub Karpinski

SERBIAN WORKERS JOIN PROTEST. Organized labor is beginning to add its
voice to the peaceful mass protests, which concluded their 22nd day in
Belgrade on 11 December, Nasa Borba reported. Meanwhile, CNN said that
in some centers, such as Serbia's second largest city, Nis, crowds are
beginning to thin. Nevertheless, delegations from throughout Serbia have
arrived in the capital and Belgrade demonstrations continue to draw at
least 100,000 supporters. Nasa Borba also reports that Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini is due in Belgrade on 12 December for talks with
both Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and leaders of the opposition
Zajedno coalition. Dini has told reporters he hopes to make "a
contribution to resolving the crisis." Reuters reported on 12 December
that Zajedno leaders are "pinning ... hopes on [trade] union backing and
growing international support" in their efforts to have their 17
November municipal election victories recognized. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
SERBIAN OPPOSITION CALLS FOR ASSET FREEZING. Serbian opposition leaders
asked the international community to freeze overseas assets of twenty of
Serbia's most influential families involved in the governing of the
state, international media reported. Miodrag Perisic, vice president of
the opposition Democratic Party, explained the request, observing "this
is a way in which the international community can punish this
dictatorship without imposing an economic embargo against the entire
population." Opposition leaders oppose a reintroduction of sanctions,
saying they hurt only ordinary people. Meanwhile, AFP reported that VOA
announced on 11 December it will be broadcasting a daily 30-minute TV
program throughout much of the former Yugoslavia in response to the
political upheaval in Serbia. The show, called "America Calling Serbia,"
will air five times weekly and feature newscasts. -- Stan Markotich

Primakov <br>
SOURCE: Interfax news agency, Moscow, in English 1423 gmt 9 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
There are no serious problems which would separate Russia and Armenia,<br>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeniy Primakov told a news conference in Moscow<br>
on Monday [9th December] after meeting his Armenian counterpart, Aleksandr<br>
Arzumanyan. <br>
<p>
Moscow supports stabilizing the situation in Nagornyy Karabakh as soon as<br>
possible through a search for mutual compromises, Primakov said.   A<br>
compromise solution to a Nagornyy Karabakh settlement lies in Azerbaijan's<br>
territorial integrity and Nagornyy Karabakh's highest possible autonomy<br>
within Azerbaijan, Primakov said. <br>
<p>
In comment on the recent presidential elections in Nagornyy Karabakh and<br>
Russia's negative attitude to them, Primakov said: "If the elections had been<br>
held as local elections in a region of Azerbaijan, there would have been no<br>
questions. But their organizers proceeded from Nagornyy Karabakh's<br>
independence, which is not recognized by anyone, including Russia." <br>
<p>
Ratification of the Russian-Armenian treaty on the deployment of Russian<br>
military bases in Armenia was one of the main subjects of the discussion,<br>
Primakov said. "We informed the Armenian side that this document has been<br>
approved by Duma committees and submitted for ratification," he said. For its<br>
part, Armenia pledged to do its best to resolve this issue simultaneously.<br>
"We are satisfied with this pledge," Primakov said. "Mutual understanding was<br>
reached on all issues of bilateral relations discussed at the talks,"<br>
Arzumanyan concurred. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: President Ter-Petrosyan, Russian border guard chief meet in Yerevan<br>
<p>
SOURCE: Interfax news agency, Moscow, in English 0709 gmt 7 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Russian Federal Border Service<br>
Director Andrey Nikolayev discussed a broad range of problems regarding<br>
Russia's and Armenia's security during their meeting in Yerevan on Friday<br>
[6th December]. <br>
<p>
The Armenian leadership has always supported a collective system for border<br>
defence, Nikolayev told a briefing in Yerevan later in the day .   Armenia<br>
sees bilateral relations with Russia and relations between Russia and other<br>
countries in the Transcaucasian region as the foundation of a collective<br>
security system, he said. The Armenian president is satisfied with border<br>
guards'activity, Nikolayev said. " In brief, the Armenian president supports<br>
Russia's presence on the Armenian borders with neighbouring countries." <br>
<p>
The Russian side at the talks set out the issues which should be settled in<br>
the interests of both countries and with which "the Armenian leadership<br>
expressed satisfaction" , Nikolayev said. Several agreements were reached<br>
which will be reflected in the protocols currently being prepared for<br>
signing, he said. The Russian and Armenian presidents believe that urgent<br>
measures are needed to settle the situation in trouble spots in the<br>
Transcaucasian region, Nikolayev said. "There is no firing there at present,<br>
but the core point is that the settlement process should be brought near a<br>
final political solution." <br>

HEADLINE: Azerbaijan welcomes Lisbon summit declaration, but Armenia critical<br>
<p>
SOURCE: Interfax news agency, Moscow, in English 1041 gmt 6 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Azerbaijani presidential aide Vafa Gulizade said on 6th December that the<br>
statement on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict made at the end of the Lisbon<br>
summit meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe<br>
(OSCE) on the 3rd was "a success scored by Azerbaijani diplomacy" because it<br>
confirmed the principle of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, Interfax news<br>
agency reported. <br>
<p>
The statement "effectively contained the formula suggested by Azerbaijan" ,<br>
Gulizade said.   The three principles outlined in it include Azerbaijan's<br>
territorial integrity, broad autonomy for Nagornyy Karabakh and security<br>
guarantees for the Karabakh Armenians, he told Interfax, adding that the OSCE<br>
Minsk Group talks on resolving the Karabakh conflict would now be geared<br>
towards the realization of these principles. <br>
<p>
Gulizade said that Armenia had effectively isolated itself at the Lisbon<br>
summit by vetoing Paragraph 20 of the Lisbon OSCE declaration on the Karabakh<br>
conflict, while the United States, Russia and other countries supported<br>
Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
However, Armenian presidential spokesman Levon Zurabyan told a Yerevan news<br>
conference on 5th December that "Azerbaijani posturing" had made it<br>
impossible to take a decision on Nagornyy Karabakh at the Lisbon meeting. <br>
<p>
He said that by demanding that the OSCE declaration include Azerbaijan's<br>
sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders,<br>
Azerbaijan had "defied the logic of the negotiating process" , obstructed the<br>
search for a compromise and made it impossible for the OSCE to pass a<br>
decision on the Nagornyy Karabakh problem, the agency reported. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Karabakh's self-proclaimed president appoints prime minister <br>

<p>
The president of the self-proclaimed Nagornyy Karabakh republic, Robert<br>
Kocharyan, appointed Leonard Petrosyan as prime minister on 7th December,<br>
Snark news agency reported, quoting Kocharyan's press office. <br>
<p>
Petrosyan was instructed to select a new cabinet within 10 days, the agency<br>
said. <br>
<p>
Kocharyan was re-elected president on 24th November. <br>

HEADLINE: Islamic ministers lay out views on Moslem issues <br>
SOURCE:  Reuters North American Wire, December 10, 1996<br>
<p>
Islamic countries laid out their views on issues affecting the Moslem world<br>
on Tuesday at the annual foreign ministerial meeting of the 54-member<br>
Organisation of the Islamic Conference (IOC). <br>
<p>
Conference sources said one of the most contentious issues was likely to<br>
arise in the political affairs committee, with Kuwait expected to propose a<br>
resolution hostile to Iraq, which Baghdad would strongly oppose. <br>
<p>
The conference was also expected to endorse a resolution condemning Aremenia<br>
for "aggression" against Azerbaijan and calling for the withdrawal of<br>
Armenian troops and the "liberation" of occupied Azerbaijani territory. <br>
<p>
The five-day conference opened on Monday with an attack on Israel over what<br>
speakers said was its "reneging" on agreements with the Palestinians, and<br>
calls for Moslem unity and economic cooperation and development. <br>
<p>
It is also seeking to dispel an image among some in the West equating Islam<br>
with violence and terrorism. <br>
<p>
The conference's Cultural and Islamic Affairs Committee is studying<br>
resolutions that include ways to unify Moslems in the defence of Islamic<br>
values. <br>
<p>
Ministers also met their counterparts for bilateral discussions on the<br>
sidelines of the conference. <br>
<p>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had a session on Tuesday with<br>
Afghanistan's Rahim Gafoorazai, who is deputy foreign minister in the<br>
government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. <br>
<p>
Rabbani was driven from Kabul in September by the purist Islamic Taleban<br>
militia, and is now allied with ethnic Uzbek leader Rashid Dostum in a bid to<br>
retake the capital. <br>

The OIC has left Afghanistan's seat vacant while urging the warring Afghan<br>
parties to form a government of national unity.REUTER <br>

HEADLINE: Activists say West encourages rights abuses in former USSR <br>
SOURCE:  Reuters North American Wire, December 10, 1996<br>
 <br>
The United States and its Western allies put political and economic interests<br>
ahead of the protection of human rights in the former Soviet Union, a<br>
watchdog group charged Tuesday. <br>
<p>
"In 1996 human rights principles were subordinated to current political and<br>
economic interests," said Alexander Petrov, Moscow representative of the<br>
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch/Helsinki group. <br>
<p>
"This particularly concerned the United States and the countries of the<br>
European Union," he told a news conference to mark International Human Rights<br>
Day. <br>
<p>
"An example of this kind of policy was provided by Russia's accession to the<br>
Council of Europe despite the renewal and continuation of intense military<br>
activity in Chechnya involving colossal violations of humanitarian law," he<br>
said. <br>
<p>
The Council of Europe, which sees itself as an arbiter of human rights,<br>
accepted Russia in February after months of delay due to concerns over<br>
Moscow's campaign in the breakaway region. <br>
<p>
Council members said at the time that having Russia on board would help it to<br>
push forward human rights, but critics charged that it did nothing to stop<br>
the Chechnya fighting, which killed tens of thousands before a peace deal was<br>
signed in August. <br>
<p>
"Things were no better in other republics," Petrov said, citing aid given to<br>
Armenia and Georgia despite government crackdowns on opposition groups. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan had also conducted a campaign to crush dissent, he said, but<br>
nevertheless won observer status in the Council of Europe. Kazakhstan and<br>
Kirgizia also got Western support. <br>
<p>
As far as the rights situation itself was concerned, Petrov said autocratic<br>
and arbitrary rule in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan made them the biggest<br>
causes for alarm. <br>
<p>
In Russia, Petrov said the only significant improvement was the end to the<br>
conflict against separatist rebels in Chechnya, begun when President Boris<br>
Yeltsin sent in troops two years ago. <br>
<p>
"If you set this aside human rights stayed on the same level and in some<br>
cases worsened," he said. <br>
<p>
He said the situation in Russia's regions was worse than in Moscow and other<br>
big cities, citing direct threats and financial sanctions which he said were<br>
used to gag the media. "There is no progress, but a regression here." <br>
<p>
Petrov also pinpointed a growth in xenophobia in Russia, particularly against<br>
people of Caucasian origin beaten up and deported from big cities by the<br>
authorities. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Oil Deal Possible in Nagorny Karabakh <br>
SOURCE:  Moscow News, December 5, 1996 (Ara Tatevosyan)<br>
<p>
The situation confronting the Lisbon talks is quite complicated. Russia and<br>
the U.S. have cast doubt on the legitimacy of the presidential elections held<br>
in the self-declared Republic of Nagorny Karabakh on November 24. For its<br>
part, Stepanakert has directed some tough comments at the Russian Foreign<br>
Affairs Ministry. <br>
<p>
On the eve of the meeting in Lisbon, Azerbaijan seemed to be enjoying an<br>
advantage. <br>
<p>
Baku seeks to raise the question of territorial integrity, which Yerevan<br>
intends to veto. However, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosian said:<br>
"Although I hope the matter doesn't come down to a veto, I assure you that<br>
our response will be adequate." <br>
<p>
In Lisbon at Azerbaijan's insistence the co-chairman of the Organization for<br>
Security and Co-operationing Europe "Minsk" group will be replaced. German,<br>
the U.S. and France are advancing candidates for the post. Sweden and Finland<br>
(former co-chairmen) have no interests in the region. The interests of the<br>
three who do are obvious - Baku oil. During a recent visit to the<br>
Transcaucasus region the German envoy at the "Minsk" group, Frank Lambach,<br>
said that he conceives of a resolution to the conflict only in the framework<br>
of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. By saying that, Lambach violated the<br>
gentlemen's agreement reached in 1992 that Karabakh's future status would not<br>
be discussed by the mediators. As for the U.S., a candidate is understood to<br>
have been was advanced only in order to force Karabakh to choose the lesser<br>
evil - Germany. <br>
<p>
After years of negotiations, highly-placed Azerbaijani politicians are for<br>
the first time openly offering Armenia an "oil for Karabakh" formula.<br>
Azerbaijan's Foreign Affairs Minister Gasan Gasanov announced that, "If<br>
Armenia doesn't get linked up with the oil business now, it's not going to<br>
happen in the foreseeable future." The position of Armenia and Karabakh are<br>
unambiguous - linking the Karabakh and oil issues is unacceptable. <br>
<p>
Today it's clear that if 1997 doesn't see the beginning of a genuine peace<br>
settlement, there is a high probability that it will be a year of renewed<br>
fighting for Karabakh.  Armenia and Nagorny-Karabakh realize that thanks to<br>
oil, Azerbaijan's military and economic potential is growing. It was no<br>
accident that on the eve of the Lisbon summit, the commander of Turkey's<br>
ground forces, General Hikmet Geksal, announced that, if necessary, his<br>
country would give Azerbaijan necessary military aid, in accordance with an<br>
existing agreement on "bilateral military cooperation." Russia, which has an<br>
analogous agreement with Armenia, not to mention the C.I.S. agreement on<br>
collective security, is keeping silent. Perhaps Lisbon will raise the curtain<br>
on a Russian secret connected with the trip by the new Deputy Security<br>
Council Secretary, Boris Berezovsky, to the oil centers of Almaty and Baku.<br>
In that case, the new Russian position on Karabakh will become clear. <br>

HEADLINE: No Headline (Armenia; Volume XLVIII, No. 45; Pg. 18)<br>
SOURCE: Current Digest of the Post-Soviet Press,  December 4, 1996<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, Nov. 6, p. 3. Condensed text)<br>
<p>
On the evening of Nov. 4, Armenia's Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan, who had<br>
held the position of head of government since February 1993, submitted his<br>
resignation.   President Levon Ter-Petrosyan accepted the resignation. On the<br>
same day, the President signed a decree appointing 42-year-old Doctor of<br>
Mathematics Armen Sarkisyan, who is now the Republic of Armenia's Ambassador<br>
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, to the position of Prime<br>
Minister of Armenia. <br>
<p>
In the opinion of local observers, Grant Bagratyan's departure marks the<br>
beginning of the major personnel reshuffles that President Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosyan promised after the Sept. 22 presidential election.<br>
<p>
According to local observers, efforts to solve social problems will become<br>
the main thrust of the government's activity. <br>

HEADLINE: Presidential Inauguration Held - A Third of the New government's<br>
Members Were Not in the Old One (Armenia; Volume XLVIII, No. 45; Pg. 19)<br>
SOURCE: Current Digest of the Post-Soviet Press,  December 4, 1996 (By Annen<br>
Khanbabyan. Nezavisimaya gazeta, Nov. 12, p. 3. Excerpts)<br>
<p>
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan signed decrees Nov. 8 on the structure of the<br>
Armenian government and rules governing its work, the personnel makeup of the<br>
Cabinet, and a reform of the republic's judicial and legal system. . . . <br>
<p>
More than a third of the Cabinet was replaced: Personnel changes affected,<br>
among other officials, the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs,<br>
Education and Science, Culture, Trade, and Social Security. In addition, the<br>
Ministry of Information was abolished, as were the posts of Minister for<br>
Liaison Between the Government and Parliament and Minister for Liaison<br>
Between Armenia and the CIS and European Union. On the other hand, a new<br>
Ministry of Privatization and Foreign Investment was established. . . . The<br>
decision to merge the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of<br>
National Security into a single department headed by Minister of National<br>
Security Serzh Sarkisyan seems quite sensational. As for former Minister of<br>
Internal Affairs Vano Siradegyan, he has been appointed mayor-governor of<br>
Yerevan. To all appearances, the merger of the Internal Affairs Ministry and<br>
the National Security Ministry marks the start of a profound reform of the<br>
entire system of power-wielding departments. . . . <br>
<p>
The new Prime Minister, Armen Sarkisyan, has offered assurances that economic<br>
reform in general and privatization in particular will be not only continued<br>
but accelerated, However, they will acquire a new focus. The Prime Minister<br>
said that the priority for the next three years will be the development of<br>
industrial potential and agriculture. . . . The Prime Minister thinks that<br>
foreign investment could provide impetus for a spurt forward. . . . The head<br>
of government regards the development of education and science as a key<br>
objective. . . . <br>
<p>
Since his appointment as Prime Minister, Armen Sarkisyan has been holding<br>
intensive consultations with representatives of both pro-President and<br>
opposition parties, including the parties in the National Accord bloc. During<br>
these meetings, he has continually stressed that the attainment of domestic<br>
political stability is a key to economic growth. So far, only the<br>
parliamentary faction of the National Democratic Union, led by Vazgen<br>
Manukyan, has declined to meet with the Prime Minister. . . . <br>
<p>
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was inaugurated on Nov. 11. . . . The ceremony<br>
marking the Armenian President's assumption of office was held despite the<br>
fact that the Constitutional Court has yet to hand down a ruling on the<br>
complaint filed by the leader of the united opposition, Vazgen Manukyan, who<br>
is asking that the official election results be declared invalid. . . . <br>

<p>
<p>
1. AMNESTY CALLS FOR COMMUTE OF "DRO" DEATH SENTENCES<br>
<p>
Levon Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia should immediately commute the <br>
death sentences of Arsen Ardzruni, Armen Grigorian and Armenak <br>
Munjoyan-three political prisoners who were sentenced to death <br>
Tuesday amid allegations that their year-long trial was unfair, <br>
Amnesty International said Wednesday.<br>
	"The President has stated that he is personally opposed to <br>
the death penalty. We ask him to show this commitment in a more <br>
concrete way-by not only refusing to sign execution warrants but <br>
also actually commuting all pending death sentences," the human <br>
rights organization said.<br>
	Amnesty International is calling for a thorough and <br>
impartial judicial review of the case.<br>
	"We are particularly concerned about allegations that <br>
several defendants were beaten or ill-treated in order to extract <br>
confessions, and that some had difficulties in getting access to a <br>
lawyer of their own choice," Amnesty International said.<br>
	The 11 defendants have been on trial in the so-called "Dro" <br>
case, accused of forming a clandestine terrorist group within the <br>
opposition Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Charges against them <br>
ranged from withholding information to illegal possession of <br>
weapons and premeditated murder. A 12th defendant, Ardavazd <br>
Manoukian, died in custody in May last year amid allegations that <br>
before his death he was denied adequate medical care for a range <br>
of health problems for several weeks.<br>
	The court found that the so-called "Dro" group had no links <br>
to the ARF.<br>
	Ter-Petrosyan has stated that he is personally opposed to <br>
the death penalty, and his office has assured Amnesty <br>
International that no executions have taken place, or will take <br>
place, during his term in office. It appears, however, thatTer-<br>
Petrosyan has not correspondingly used his authority to commute <br>
pending death sentences. This means that those currently on death <br>
row, believed to number 13 before this trial, may have been <br>
waiting years without knowing when they may expect their clemency <br>
appeals to be heard, or what the outcome may be.<br>
	Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all <br>
cases, on the grounds that it is a violation of the right to life.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. HELSINKI COMMITTEE URGES RELEASE OF PRISONERS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Fact)-The Yerevan-based Helsinki Committee of Armenia <br>
issued an announcement Monday calling for the release of all <br>
Armenian political prisoners. The announcement was issued to <br>
coincide with International Human Rights Day, Tuesday.<br>
	"Since 1993, Armenia has been moving toward a totalitarian <br>
regime and an intolerant struggle against opposing views," the <br>
statement read, specifically outlining the facts and events which <br>
have created political tension and have moved the nation to a <br>
crisis situation.<br>
	"We find that such undertakings by the leadership of Armenia <br>
are the continuation of violations of human and individual rights, <br>
a disregard for democratic principles and the establishment of a <br>
police state in Armenia," continued the statement.<br>
	"We urge the release of all political prisoners. We call on <br>
the leadership of Armenia to bring to justice all government <br>
officials before a court of law for violations of human rights, as <br>
is expected through international conventions to which Armenia has <br>
agreed," the statement asserted.<br>
	The Helsinki Committee also called for financial reparations <br>
to victims of inhumane acts by Armenias power ministries.<br>
	"We find that the only guarantee for human rights <br>
preservation is the punishment of the guilty and retribution for <br>
innocent victims," the statement said.<br>
	"We call on the leadership of Armenia to end state terrorism <br>
and their struggle against opposition views."<br>
<p>
<p>
3. KARABAKH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM DAY MARKED<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (ANIS)-The Armenia Revolutionary Federation Central <br>
Committee of Artsakh issued an announcement Tuesday on the <br>
occasion of the fifth anniversary of Karabakhs independence <br>
referendum.<br>
	Below is a translated text of that announcement:<br>
	Dear Compatriots,<br>
	Today, December 10, marks the fifth anniversary of the <br>
referendum for independence in Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
	Heeding our inner call, we conducted a referendum under <br>
bullets and bombs, and under international laws declared the <br>
independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.<br>
	This was our peoples political victory before the fall of <br>
the Soviet Union.<br>
	The successes of our people during the past five <br>
years-liberated territories, rebuilding of villages, stabilization <br>
of economy-affirm that the self-determining people of Karabakh can <br>
become equals in the international arena, without giving into <br>
international pressures.<br>
	The people of Karabakh, once again, proved their <br>
independence by electing a president on Nov. 24 through public <br>
elections.<br>
	December 10 is also International Human Rights Day. It seems <br>
that this coincidence was necessary for the benefit of Karabakh. <br>
However, the fact that universal human rights are being granted to <br>
our people through hesitation, by certain international <br>
institutions, despite our right to self-determination, is <br>
unacceptable. This, however, does not mean that the people of <br>
Karabakh will regress.<br>
	Today, by congratulating all, we are confident in our <br>
collective unity and are certain that we are building Karabakh for <br>
future generations and righting historys mistakes.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. KOCHARIAN IN PARIS FOR CONFERENCE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Nagorno-Karabakh President Robert Kocharian <br>
left for France Tuesday to attend the 70th anniversary <br>
celebrations of the International Academy of Diplomacy.<br>

<p>
<p>
5. POPE GREETS KAREKIN I<br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY (Reuter)-Pope John Paul II Wednesday welcomed to the <br>
Vatican His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians, who <br>
is on a five-day official visit.<br>
	The two-the Pope wearing his traditional white cassock and <br>
the bearded Karekin wearing a hooded black robe-sat side by side <br>
on identical thrones during the Pontiffs general audience.<br>
	The Armenian Church is one of the Ancient Churches of the <br>
East which split away from Byzantine Christianity before the Great <br>
Schism of 1054, which divided the Eastern and Western Churches.<br>
	The Pope told the crowd in the Vaticans audience hall that <br>
he hoped the two Churches could eventually reach full unity. <br>
	Karekin said he was praying for the 76-year-old Popes good <br>
health, "not only for the good of the Roman Catholic Church but <br>
for that of all humanity."<br>
	The Armenian Church is an independent Christian Church <br>
introduced to Armenia by the apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew. In <br>
301 A.D., Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as <br>
a state religion.<br>
	The Armenian Church has various patriarchates around the <br>
world and members in the countries of the former Soviet Union, <br>
North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.<br>
	Karekin I arrived in Rome aboard a private plane furnished <br>
by philanthropist Vatche Manougian and was accompanied by Bishop <br>
Barkev Mardirossian, Primate of the Artsakh Diocese; Archbishop <br>
Krikoris Buniatian, Primate of the Shirak Diocese and Archbishop <br>
Garegin Nercessian, Primate of the Ararat Valley  Diocese.<br>
	The pontiff was greeted at the Rome airport by the Patriarch <br>
of Istanbul Arch. Karekin Kazandjian and the Patriarch of <br>
Jerusalem Arch. Torkom Manougian, who were joined by Western <br>
Primate Arch. Vatche Hovsepian, Eastern US Primate Arch. Khajag <br>
Barsamian and the Paris Primate Bishop Kiud Nakkashian.<br>
	Karekin I and his delegation will remain Rome and the <br>
Vatican until Friday, where they will visit several Catholic <br>
leaders. <br>
	The visit will culminate with a private visit between the <br>
Catholicos and the Pope.<br>
	Karekin I is also scheduled to meet Italys president <br>
Saturday.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. AN ANALYSIS OF THE "DRO" VERDICTS<br>
<p>
BY INGA ZARAFIAN &amp;  SONA MASHOULIAN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The judicial board in the trial of the so-<br>
called "Dro" group rule Tuesday that charges linking the Armenian <br>
Revolutionary Federation with the so-called "Dro" group were <br>
groundless. The judicial board also acquitted co-defendant Hrand <br>
Markarian of charges of organizing the group and being an <br>
accomplice to murders and drug trafficking.<br>
	The courtroom was filled to capacity with friends, relatives <br>
and and foreign reporters during Tuesdays sentencing phase of the <br>
18-month trial.<br>
	The case drew international interest when the preliminary <br>
investigations were said to be politically motivated.<br>
	No reasons or explanations were offered in relation to the <br>
suspended ARF in the verdict despite prosecutor Mikayel <br>
Grigorians demands.<br>
	The court concluded that the "Dro" group was established by <br>
Arsen Ardzruni in 1990 when he moved to Armenia from Lebanon. In <br>
1992, according to the judicial board, Ardzruni proposed that the <br>
"Dro" group under the auspices of the ARF engage in intelligence <br>
and economic affairs. According to the groups by-laws, its aim <br>
would be to preserve the revolutionary principles of the party <br>
[ARF], repudiate principles of parliamentary activity as well as <br>
work on unveiling the "state mafia," the judicial board said, <br>
adding that if necessary, the group planned to use emergency <br>
measures against leaders of the mafia.<br>
	It was noted that the "Dro" groups by-laws differed from <br>
that of the ARF. The "Dro" groups by-laws reportedly call for <br>
stiff penalties for its members, including death. "Dro" members <br>
who wished to quit the organization would be subject to severe <br>
punishment, the court said.<br>
	According to Judge Edward Manoukian, these stiff penalties <br>
were what the "Dro" members were afraid of. <br>
	If one of the members was caught out of line, they were <br>
punished by not allowing them to carry a firearm. This punishment <br>
was handed down to Armenak Zakarian for being drunk while <br>
following Gagik Sahakian, who was later murdered by some of the <br>
group members, Manoukian said, but Zakarian did not take part in <br>
Sahakians murder because he was unarmed at the time. The judge <br>
noted that this punishment actually resulted in Zakarian not <br>
receiving the death penalty.<br>
	Co-defendants Armenak Mnjoyan and Armen Grigorian, were <br>
sentenced to death for the murder of Sahakian.<br>
	Zakarian, Mnjoyan and Grigorian were also found guilty of <br>
planning the murder of the Nersissian couple.<br>
	To ensure secrecy, Ardzruni gave members of the group codes <br>
and nicknames, the judge said, and secret information was conveyed <br>
to Mnjoyan and Ardzruni via messengers Rouzanna Gevorkian and <br>
Ovsanna Hovsepian. Lesser ranked members of the group kept in <br>
contact via Mnjoyan, according to the judge.<br>
	Ardzruni wanted to involve Gegham Manoukian in the <br>
organization and discussed his plans with him, which Manoukian <br>
later testified to in court. Markarian advised Manoukian to stay <br>
away from Ardzruni, the judge said.<br>
	The court sentenced Hrand Markarian to five years, Arsen <br>
Ardzruni, Armenak Mnjoyan and Armen Grigorian, death; Armenak <br>
Zakarian, 15 years; Hovaness Mkrtchian, 10 years; Ara <br>
Harmandarian, 6 years; Edik Simonian, five years; and Gevork <br>
Alaverdian, Tatul Gabrielian and Gegham Manoukian, three years.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. ARMENIA TO TAKE PART IN BLACK SEA CONFERENCE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Azg)-A parliamentary delegation from the Republic of <br>
Armenia, headed by Speaker Babken Ararktsian, left for the <br>
Georgian capital Tbilisi Tuesday to participate in the eighth <br>
conference of Black Sea Economic Cooperation members.<br>
	The delegation also plans to meet with Georgian President <br>
Eduard Shevardnadze.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. DEADLINE FOR PASSPORT EXCHANGE EXTENDED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Lragir)-The deadline to exchange old passports issued by <br>
the Soviet Union has been extended, the Passport and Visa <br>
Department of Armenias Foreign Ministry announced, but did not <br>
say what the new deadline was.<br>
	The Foreign Ministrys original deadline had been set for <br>
December 1996.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. US AGRICULTURE GROUP IMPLEMENTS PROJECT <br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The American Volunteers Overseas Cooperative <br>
Assistance organization plans to implement projects on production, <br>
processing and sale of agricultural commodities, the improvement <br>
of veterinary services and irrigation systems in Armenia starting <br>
next year.<br>
	Since 1992, VOCA whose projects are financed by the United <br>
Stated Agency for International Development, has implemented 120 <br>
agricultural assistance projects in different regions of Armenia.<br>
	VOCAs regional representative Paul Sommers said that in <br>
1996, 30 volunteers of the organization were working in Armenia. <br>
The production of dried tomatoes, apricots and canned grape leaves <br>
has been established in the Vayots Dzor and Ararat regions with <br>
VOCAs help, in addition to four irrigation projects also in <br>
Vayots Dzor for previously unirrigated land.<br>
	Sommers reported that an Armenian subsidiary of VOCA, <br>
VISTAA, has been set up at the request of Armenias agricultural <br>
experts. Scientists working with VISTAA have designed new pumps <br>
which supply water to mountainous lands and foothills without the <br>
use of electricity.<br>
	The pumps will be sold to farmers at reasonable prices, <br>
Sommers said.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. TURKEY SEEKS DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH IRAN<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-Turkey discussed defense industry cooperation with <br>
neighboring Iran, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said <br>
Wednesday.<br>
	"Various cooperation opportunities between Turkey and Iran <br>
were dealt with during Mr. Boroujerdis visit to our ministry. <br>
Defense industry cooperation...was only one of them," spokesman <br>
Sermet Atacanli told a news briefing.<br>
	Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Tuesday met Irans <br>
deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, who came to Ankara <br>
ahead of a visit by Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani <br>
later this month.<br>
	Boroujerdi told reporters after the meeting that the two <br>
countries defense ministers had held talks in Tehran in August <br>
during a visit to Iran by Erbakan.<br>
	Spokesman Atacanli said defense cooperation might be <br>
discussed during Rafsanjanis visit but he gave no more details. <br>
Defense Ministry officials declined to comment on any defense <br>
cooperation with Iran.<br>
	Ankara sealed a military training deal with Israel in <br>
February which drew sharp criticism from Arab countries and Iran. <br>
Turkey also has a defense industry agreement with the Jewish state <br>
under which Israel is to modernize Turkish air force F-4 jets.<br>
	Erbakan, Turkeys first Islamist prime minister, has <br>
promised to improve relations with the countrys Moslem neighbors.<br>
	Turkey and Iran signed a $23 billion gas deal that angered <br>
Ankaras close ally the United States when Erbakan visited Tehran.<br>
<p>
<p>

     ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OPENS STEPANAKERT OFFICE<br>
     STEPANAKERT, Nagorno Karabagh Republic _  "I want to congratulate all <br>
     of us for the opening of the Armenian Assembly of America's <br>
     Stepanakert Office," said N.K.R. Deputy Prime Minister Jirair <br>
     Boghosian to some 40 government officials and local NGO <br>
     (nongovernmental organization) representatives, who celebrated the <br>
     ribbon-cutting of the Assembly's new N.K.R. office November 7.  "We <br>
     are very familiar with the work the Armenian Assembly has accomplished <br>
     for Armenia and N.K.R., and I hope that with the opening of the <br>
     Stepanakert Office, the Armenian Assembly can [help to] support the <br>
     resolution of the Karabagh conflict and convey our concerns to the <br>
     international community."<br>
        N.K.R. Foreign Minister Arkady Ghukasian was among the government <br>
     officials attending the ceremony.  Representing the Armenian Assembly <br>
     at the event was Yerevan Office Director Edith Khachatourian, who has <br>
     been instrumental in the set-up of this newest Assembly venture.  "The <br>
     Armenian Assembly has offices in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, <br>
     Yerevan, Gyumri and now I am proud to witness the opening of an office <br>
     in Stepanakert.  Today is an unforgettable day for the Armenian <br>
     Assembly and, especially, for me," she said.  Over the last several <br>
     months, Khachatourian has made several trips to N.K.R. for planning <br>
     and consultation with N.K.R. President Robert Kocharian and the <br>
     foreign minister.  She will oversee the office's activities and act as <br>
     a liaison between the Assembly's Stepanakert and Yerevan offices.  Her <br>
     work will be supported by that of Karabagh native Inna Gabrielian, who <br>
     will staff the office full-time.  <br>
        Following an earlier meeting with President Kocharian, Assembly <br>
     Board of Trustees Chairman Hirair Hovnanian noted the commitment <br>
     reflected in the Assembly's decision to open an office in Stepanakert. <br>
      "The presence of an Assembly office in N.K.R. will facilitate our <br>
     organization's continuing advocacy for that nation's <br>
     self-determination," he says.  "This office will be a vehicle for <br>
     substantially enhanced efforts in Washington to promote increased U.S. <br>
     engagement in the peace process and in the region.  It is imperative <br>
     that our government moves beyond its standard defense of the <br>
     territorial integrity of all states and takes into much greater <br>
     account Karabagh's de facto status as an independent entity."<br>
        The Armenian Assembly is a nationwide nonprofit organization which <br>
     promotes public understanding and awareness of Armenian issues.<br>

	+&gt; Turkey: Iraqi oil exports by Monday  <br>
                               ======	 <br>
 Turkish exports increased<br>
	Turkisk ecports increased to $21.333 billion (by 4.4 per<br>
cent) in the first 11 months of the year from $20.436 billion in<br>
the corresponding period in 1995, the Turkish Exportes Assembly<br>
, TIM, said in an statement. Turkey's November exports were up<br>
4.8 per cent to $2.261 billion from $2.158 billion recorded last<br>
year for the same month, the statement said.Iron, steel and<br>
metal industry exportss increased by 3.8 per cent to $2.57<br>
billion, textile and related raw materfial exports rose 8.3 per<br>
cent to $2.30 billion, electric -electronic exports increased 33<br>
per cent to $1.71 billion in January -November, compared to the<br>
same 1995 period, TIM said.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkish troops discharged over religion<br>
	Turkey discharged Tuesday 69 military commanders and<br>
noncommissioned officers for immoral behavior and<br>
``undisciplined acts,'' an armed forces council said. Turkish TV<br>
and radio reports said the Supreme Military Council ordered the<br>
dismissals at the second session of its two-day meeting in<br>
Ankara because those involved had engaged in hard- line Muslim<br>
activities. Extremist and illegal religious activities in the<br>
middle ranks had sparked increasing concern among higher levels<br>
of the strongly secular armed forces, military analysts told<br>
United Press International. Concern has been building since the<br>
election of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, head of the<br>
hard-line Muslim Welfare Party, they said. Erbakan conducted<br>
Tuesday's defense meeting and approved the decision, as he had<br>
the dismissals of 18 officers and 32 other soldiers in August,<br>
also for religious activities prohibited in the armed forces.<br>
The prime minister is walking a tightrope with the military,<br>
which has risen three times since 1960 to depose governments<br>
opposed by its commanders. He signed Friday a deal heavily<br>
favored by the military for Israel to upgrade Turkish jet<br>
fighter trainers, even though he campaigned against close<br>
Turkish ties to Israel and Western nations.  When the council's<br>
first meeting Monday was conducted by the military chief of<br>
staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, Erbakan's absence was<br>
attacked by opponents. The prime minister heads the council,<br>
which meets twice a year. Turkey's military has prevented<br>
control by hard-line Muslims since being set up on a secular<br>
basis when the republic was formed in 1923. Furthermore, most<br>
mililtary leaders support Turkey's role in the North Atlantic<br>
Treaty Organization.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Tajik rivals to continue dialogue<br>
	Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader<br>
Said Abdullo Nuri said Tuesday they will continue peace talks<br>
next week in Moscow and agreed on the need to form a bilateral<br>
commission to work toward reconciliation, reports<br>
said. Rakhmonov and Nuri met in northern Afghanistan in a bid to<br>
ease fighting in Tajikistan and approach a consensus on the<br>
future of the troubled Central Asian nation. The Russian news<br>
agency Itar-Tass said they were planning to continue discussions<br>
Wednesday. After their first day of talks in a village in the<br>
Takhar province, where the Tajik opposition has been based since<br>
being driven across the frontier in a 1992 civil war, they<br>
agreed to meet again in Moscow on Dec. 19 and hold a new round<br>
of U.N.-mediated peace negotiations a few weeks later. They also<br>
agreed in the need to form a bilateral commission charged with<br>
hammering out a long-term solution to their struggle, Itar-Tass<br>
reported. The schedule of the commission and details about its<br>
goals and makeup will be discussed at the U.N.-sponsored<br>
talks. Similar agreements in the past have disintegrated amid<br>
argument over the terms of reconciliation. The opposition wants<br>
a share of power to govern the nation of 5.7 million, but<br>
Rakhmonov and his administration have been unwilling to release<br>
their increasingly loose grip on the country. The meeting was<br>
the first between Rakhmonov and Nuri in more than a year and<br>
came amid heavy fighting between government and pro-Islamic<br>
opposition forces east of the capital Dushanbe.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey, Yemen sign gas deal<br>
	A delegation led by Turkish Energy and Natural Resources<br>
Minister Racai Kutan and general director of the state-run<br>
pipeline company BOTAS, Mustafa Murathan, arrived to the Arab<br>
Republic of Yemen on Wednesday to sign a natural gas agreement,<br>
the Turkish officials reported. The Turkish delegation will<br>
return to Turkey on Friday.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey: Iraqi oil exports by Monday<br>
	Commercial loading of Iraqi crude oil pumped to Turkey<br>
will begin after an official ceremony Dec. 16, officials said<br>
Tuesday. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein inaugurated Tuesday the<br>
start of oil pumping operations at Kirkuk in central Iraq. Tests<br>
on the 556-mile (890-km) twin pipeline were expected to continue<br>
through Sunday, oil industry officials said. An official<br>
ceremony attended by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan will mark<br>
the start of crude oil loading operations at Yurmurtalik in<br>
southeastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency<br>
said. The pipeline was reopened under an oil-for-food deal<br>
agreed with the United Nations. It was closed when the<br>
U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in<br>
1990. Under the U.N. deal aimed at alleviating the suffering of<br>
some 20 million Iraqis, Iraq plans to sell $2 billion worth of<br>
oil for a renewable six-month period. The proceeds from the oil<br>
sale would be deposited in a U.N. escrow account in New York for<br>
use by the United Nations to buy food and medicine for Iraqi<br>
civilians. The pumping of oil was interrupted Tuesday to allow<br>
for further tests. A Turkish oil industry official said the<br>
first vessel to be loaded would be nominated by the Turkish oil<br>
company Tupras. Iraqi officials said in remarks quoted by the<br>
official Iraqi News Agency that Baghdad had received new offers<br>
from international exporting companies to buy Iraqi oil.<br>

                               ======	 <br>
 Tajik rivals meet<br>
	Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov met Tuesday in<br>
northern Afghanistan with the leader of the pro-Islamic Tajik<br>
opposition, Said Abdullo Nuri, reports said. Russian news<br>
agencies said Rakhmonov and Nuri met behind closed doors in a<br>
village in the Takhar province, where the Tajik opposition has<br>
been based since being driven across the frontier in a 1992<br>
civil war. The meeting, the first between the rivals in the<br>
Central Asian nation in more than a year, came amid heavy<br>
fighting between government and pro-Islamic opposition forces<br>
east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe. The talks were aimed to ease<br>
hostilities that have wracked several regions east of Dushanbe<br>
for more than a week and set the stage for a new round of<br>
U.N.-sponsored negotiations scheduled to take place this month<br>
in Moscow. Since the war, which killed tens of thousands of<br>
people and plunged the former Soviet republic further into<br>
poverty, the opposition has battled government troops within<br>
Tajikistan and Russian forces on the Afghan border. The<br>
opposition has made gains in increased fighting this year,<br>
seizing several towns on a key road from Afghanistan through<br>
Tajikistan to Kyrgyzstan and pressing closer to Dushanbe. The<br>
opposition has been seeking a share of the power since its<br>
defeat in the civil war and in the wake of susequent<br>
presidential and parliamentary elections that cemented<br>
Rakhmonov's power but were criticized as unfair.  The government<br>
and opposition have signed cease-fires and peace deals during<br>
five rounds of talks under the aegis of the United Nations, but<br>
the agreements have been short-lived and ineffective.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkish Foreign Minister to visit Russia<br>
	Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller will visit Russia<br>
next week to discuss bilateral ties with special emphasis on<br>
trade and economy, a Foreign Ministry sources said Monday. Her<br>
talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will also<br>
include regional developments and political issues, the source<br>
said. Ciller, who is due in Moscow Dec. 17, is also the deputy<br>
Prime Minister in the Islamist-led coalition government. During<br>
her two-day visit she will also confer with Russian Prime<br>
Minister Victor Chernomyrdyn and other Cabinet ministers. Russia<br>
is the fourth largest importer of Turkish goods and sixth in<br>
terms of exports to Turkey. Turkey currently imports 6 billion<br>
cubic metres of natural gas annually from Russia. The two sides<br>
agreed in principle last month to increase the gas flow to 16<br>
billion cubic metres annually over the next 10 years.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Indian, Kazakh presidents met<br>
	Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Kazakh<br>
President Nursultan Nazarbayev held a meeting in New Delhi<br>
Monday, the Russian Itar-Tass news agency said. ``India and<br>
Kazakhstan support the efforts being taken by the United Nations<br>
and the International Community to restore peace and stability<br>
in Afghanistan which remains to be an area of tension and<br>
bloodshed,'' Nazarbayev said. He also pointed out that his<br>
country is interested in developing closer interaction with<br>
India in order to prevent Islamic fundamentalists from<br>
increasing their influence in Asia, and to ward off new<br>
conflicts and tensions.<br>

By ZEYNEP ALEMDAR<br>
 Associated Press Writer<br>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A traffic accident that revealed links<br>
between the government and the underworld has forced President<br>
Suleyman Demirel to step in and demand an accounting.<br>
   Demirel was meeting Tuesday with the main opposition leader<br>
Mesut Yilmaz, who has played a key role in disclosing secret ties<br>
between policemen and crime bosses.<br>
   There also have been allegations of government-backed death<br>
squads to suppress dissidents and Kurdish rebels.<br>
   Demirel will summon other opposition leaders this week and meet<br>
with Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Thursday.<br>
   "Nothing will remain secret under the sky. You cannot hide<br>
anything," Demirel told the newspaper Hurriyet. "Whoever tries to<br>
hide it gets buried under it."<br>
   The scandal surfaced after a Mercedes and a tractor-trailer<br>
collided on a highway 90 miles south of Istanbul last month.<br>
   A Parliament deputy, a fugitive criminal and a police official<br>
were in the Mercedes. In the Mercedes, only the deputy survived.<br>
The criminal, Abdullah Catli, reputedly had links to the Turk who<br>
shot Pope John Paul II and was wanted in Switzerland, where he was<br>
convicted of drug smuggling and escaped from prison in 1990.<br>
   The connections between the three men immediately appeared<br>
suspicious. Sedat Bucak, the deputy who survived the crash and who<br>
is also a powerful official in the Turkey's Kurdish-dominated<br>
southeast, could not provide any reasonable explanation.<br>
   Interior Minister Mehmet Agar, who had close ties to the police<br>
chief, was forced to resign after the accident under pressure from<br>
opposition parties.<br>
   The scandal grew when Yilmaz claimed Catli organized the killing<br>
of a casino operator, Omer Lutfi Topal, with three policemen in<br>
July to help Bucak seize his assets. Three policemen who were<br>
briefly detained after the killing were later assigned to guard<br>
Bucak.<br>
   Yilmaz claimed he had tapes of phone calls between the three<br>
officers talking about their murder of Topal.<br>
   Bucak runs a 2,000-man army in southeastern Turkey to fight<br>
Kurdish rebels, and reportedly receives more than $1 million a<br>
month from the government for it.<br>
   Newspaper reports say his men allegedly were members of death<br>
squads that killed hundreds of supporters of the Kurdish rebel<br>
movement, and have smuggled drugs and weapons.<br>
   The government's handling of the scandal has led to suspicions<br>
that Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller knew about the alleged ties<br>
between the state and underworld leaders during her three years as<br>
prime minister.<br>
   Ciller said in a recent speech that Catli deserved being honored<br>
for fighting for Turkey. She also accused Yilmaz of supporting the<br>
Kurdish rebel groups and Armenian terrorists by getting tough on<br>
Catli.<br>
   But on Monday, Mrs. Ciller told reporters after being summoned<br>
by Demirel that the state's mission is to fight criminals. "The<br>
state does not form gangs," she said.<br>
   The government took its first action last week in connection<br>
with the unfolding scandal, removing Istanbul's well-respected<br>
police chief and the three officers linked to Topal's killing. But<br>
the move against the police chief caused an uproar.<br>
   News reports said the police chief, Kemal Yazicioglu, was being<br>
punished for leaking the link between the three officers and<br>
Topal's slaying.<br>
   The truck driver who crashed into the Mercedes received a "most<br>
respected citizen honor" from a small leftist party for his role<br>
in exposing the scandal.<br>
   "The accident unveiled the dark liaisons within the state.<br>
These facts now have to be further dug out," said opposition<br>
leader Bulent Ecevit.<br>

    VATICAN CITY (Reuter) - Pope John Paul II Wednesday welcomed<br>
to the Vatican the spiritual leader of the world's six million<br>
Armenian Christians, Karekin I, who is on a five-day official<br>
visit.<br>
     The two, the Pope wearing his traditional white cassock and<br>
the bearded Karekin wearing a hooded black robe, sat side by<br>
side on identical thrones during the Pope's general audience.<br>
     The Armenian Church is one of the so-called Ancient Churches<br>
of the East which split from Byzantine Christianity before the<br>
Great Schism of 1054 that divided the Eastern and Western<br>
Churches.<br>
     The Pope told the crowd in the Vatican's audience hall that<br>
he hoped the two Churches could eventually reach full unity.<br>
     Karekin said he was praying for the 76-year-old Pope's good<br>
health, "not only for the good of the Roman Catholic Church but<br>
for that of all humanity."<br>
     The Armenian Church is an independent Christian Church<br>
introduced to Armenia by the apostles Jude and Bartholomew. In<br>
301 A.D. Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity<br>
as a state religion.<br>
     The Armenian Church has various patriarchates around the<br>
world and members in the countries of the former Soviet Union,<br>
North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.<br>

VOICED AT: <br>
<p>
INTRO:  THE TURKISH MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT HAS PURGED 70 OFFICERS<br>
ACCUSED OF LINKS WITH ISLAMIC RADICALS AND OTHER OUTLAWED GROUPS.<br>
AMBERIN ZAMAN IN ANKARA REPORTS THE THE UPHEAVAL IS PART OF A <br>
CRACK DOWN ON ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES.  THE <br>
ANNOUNCEMENT CAME AFTER A SUPREME MILITARY COUNCIL MEETING THAT <br>
WAS CHAIRED BY NECMETTIN ERBAKAN, THE FIRST ISLAMIST WHO HAS HELD<br>
THE OFFICE OF PRIME MINISTER IN TURKEY.<br>
<p>
TEXT:  THE LATEST PURGE IS DEEPLY EMBARRASSING TO TURKEY'S <br>
ISLAMIST PRIME MINISTER, WHO PROMISED VOTERS BEFORE TAKING POWER <br>
THAT HE WOULD PUT AN END TO WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS THE PERSECUTION <br>
OF MUSLIM BELIEVERS.<br>
<p>
ANALYSTS SAY MR. ERBAKAN'S ABSENCE DURING THE FIRST DAY OF THE <br>
MILITARY SUPREME COUNCIL MEETING WAS A CLEAR INDICATION OF HIS <br>
DISCOMFORT ABOUT THE CONTINUED EXPULSION OF OFFICERS KNOWN TO <br>
HAVE PRO-ISLAMIC LEANINGS.<br>
<p>
MANY OF THE EXPELLED ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH <br>
ISLAMIC SECTS THAT WERE BANNED BY THE FOUNDER OF MODERN TURKEY, <br>
KEMAL ATATURK.  EXPERTS SAY THE ISLAMISTS HAVE LONG SOUGHT TO <br>
PENETRATE THE MILITARY WHICH REMAINS THE MOST UNASSAILABLE <br>
BASTION OF THE SECULARISM IN TURKEY.<br>
<p>
IN A SIMILAR MOVE EARLIER THIS YEAR, TURKEY'S SUPREME MILITARY <br>
COUNCIL PURGED 35 OFFICERS ALSO ACCUSED OF PRO-ISLAMIC LEANINGS. <br>
MORE THAN 35 OFFICERS HAVE APPEALED TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF <br>
JUSTICE TO OVERTURN THE COUNCIL'S DECISION, AS THEY  CANNOT  <br>
APPEAL TO A DOMESTIC COURT.<br>
<p>
MR .ERBAKAN WHO PUT HIS SIGNATURE TO THE DISMISSALS TUESDAY SAID <br>
THEY WERE FOR DISCIPLINARY REASONS.<br>
<p>
ANALYSTS WARN THAT MR. ERBAKAN'S CONCILIATORY APPROACH IS LIKELY <br>
TO OFFEND EXTREMISTS WITHIN HIS PARTY, WHO ARE ALREADY DISPLEASED<br>
BY A SERIES OF CONCESSIONS HE HAS MADE SINCE COMING TO POWER.  <br>
THESE INCLUDE RENEWING A MILITARY TRAINING AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 238, Part I, 11 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
RODIONOV BECOMES FIRST CIVILIAN DEFENSE MINISTER . . . Dispelling rumors
that he might dismiss Igor Rodionov, President Boris Yeltsin instead
issued a decree on 11 December retiring Rodionov from the military but
leaving him in his ministerial post, Russian and Western agencies
reported. Rodionov will be the country's first civilian defense minister
since it became independent in 1991. Army Gen. Rodionov reached 60, the
mandatory retirement age for Russian officers, on 1 December. Both sides
of the political spectrum quickly criticized Yeltsin's decision. Duma
member Sergei Mitrokhin (Yabloko) termed it "purely symbolic," while
Duma Security Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin (KPRF) argued it would undermine
discipline in the military. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
. . . WHILE CHUBAIS INVESTIGATES "SEMENOV AFFAIR." Presidential press
secretary Sergei Yastrzhembskii announced on 10 December that President
Yeltsin has instructed Chief of Staff Anatolii Chubais to "thoroughly
study" the circumstances surrounding Rodionov's proposal to dismiss Army
Gen. Vladimir Semenov as commander of the ground forces, ITAR-TASS
reported. Yastrzhembskii said Semenov had asked for such an
investigation in a letter to Yeltsin. It remains unclear whether Semenov
will be dismissed or on what grounds, as the earlier allegations of
misconduct and corruption appear to have been dropped. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
CHECHEN ROUNDUP. Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin met with
the head of the OSCE mission in Grozny, Tim Guldimann, on 10 December to
discuss arrangements for the OSCE and the Council of Europe to monitor
the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled in Chechnya on 27
January, ITAR-TASS reported. Rybkin also met with the Russian chairman
of the Russian-Chechen joint commission, Georgii Kurin, to discuss the
implementation of President Boris Yeltsin's 23 November decree on the
withdrawal of the last Russian troops still stationed in Chechnya. The
Chechen parliament has issued an appeal to the parliaments of other CIS
states to take a stand on the proposed participation of Chechen
parliament deputies in the work of the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly,
Kommersant-Daily reported on 11 December, citing Interfax. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
NEW INGUSH PRIME MINISTER APPOINTED. One day after sacking his
republic's government for economic mismanagement and possible
corruption, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev appointed a new prime
minister, Belan Khamchiev, ITAR-TASS reported on 10 December. Khamchiev
previously served as Ingush commissioner to the Russian president. The
ousted prime minister, Mukharbek Didigov, said it is "normal" for
governments to be dismissed for failing to meet economic targets but
denied any personal involvement in corruption. Meanwhile, Ingush
parliament Chairman Ruslan Pliev praised Aushev's decision, saying
Didigov's cabinet had been extremely inefficient. -- Laura Belin
<p>
NEW AIRBORNE FORCES COMMANDER APPOINTED. In a decree dated 4 December,
President Yeltsin appointed Lt.-Gen. Georgii Shpak commander of the
Airborne Forces, ITAR-TASS reported on 10 December. Shpak, 53, served in
the paratroops from 1966 to 1988 and fought in Afghanistan. His son,
also an officer, was reportedly killed in Chechnya. Shpak is a graduate
of the Frunze and General Staff academies, and a former commander of the
76th Airborne Division. Before his appointment as airborne forces
commander, he was first deputy commander of the Volga military district.
Shpak replaces Yevgenii Podkolzin, who was officially retired in October
but widely believed to have been sacked for his opposition to Defense
Minister Rodionov's plans to downsize the airborne forces. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
MOSCOW STANDS FIRM AGAINST NATO EXPANSION. NATO's recent moves to
assuage Moscow's fears over the alliance's eastward expansion have not
eased Moscow's opposition to the idea, Russian and Western media
reported on 11 December. Despite the 10 December declaration by NATO
foreign ministers that the alliance has no plans to deploy nuclear
weapons on the territories of new members, and their endorsement of
negotiations on a formal NATO-Russia charter, Foreign Minister Yevgenii
Primakov termed the expansion of the alliance "unacceptable" following a
meeting with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana. Primakov welcomed the
proposal to begin talks on a NATO-Russia agreement but said it must
contain "concrete arrangements," signalling that Moscow wants it to
contain legally binding security guarantees. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA SEEKS ENTRY TO WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. Speaking at the meeting
of the World Trade Organization in Singapore on 10 December, Deputy
Prime Minister Oleg Davydov said that he expects Russia to join the 125-
country organization by the end of 1997, Reuters reported. Davydov
argued that Russia has already abolished all quota restrictions on
imports. Russia originally applied to join the WTO's predecessor, GATT,
in 1993. Its application has been held up by lack of clarity over
industrial subsidies and trade statistics. The same day ITAR-TASS
reported that Russia's trade turnover in the first 10 months of 1996 was
up 7.2% over the same period last year, with exports of $71 billion and
imports $38 billion (not including any allowance for individual "shuttle
traders"). Trade with CIS countries accounted for 23% of the total. --

THREE DASHNAK PARTY MEMBERS SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ARMENIA. Armenia's
Supreme Court on 10 December sentenced to death three members of the
banned Dashnak party (HHD) on charges of terrorism after a trial that
lasted more than 16 months, international agencies reported. Arsen
Ardzrouni (a Lebanese citizen of Armenian origin), Armen Grigoryan, and
Armenak Mnjoyan have been convicted of forming a clandestine armed group
called Dro and committing three murders. Eight other members of the
alleged group were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to 15
years. The lawyers of the defendants can appeal the verdict within a
week. President Levon Ter-Petrossyan suspended the activities of the HHD
in December 1994 on the grounds that Dro was affiliated with the party
and planned to overthrow the government. But according to RFE/RL, the
three-member panel of judges ruled that there is not enough evidence to
prove a connection between HHD and Dro. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
19 FORMER OPON MEMBERS ARRESTED IN AZERBAIJAN. Elchin Amiraslanov, the
former commander of the OPON special police sub-division in Kazakh
Raion, was arrested in Baku on 10 December along with 18 of his
associates, Turan and Western agencies reported. In March 1995, the OPON
unit occupied the local administrative building to protest a planned
crackdown on their involvement in the illegal export of strategic
metals; the incident precipitated a showdown between OPON commander
Rovshaan Djavadov and Azerbaijani army troops in which the former was
killed. Amiraslanov, who subsequently fled to Ukraine, will be charged
with treason and the murder of several high-ranking security officials
in October 1995. Azerbaijani parliament speaker Yagub Mamedov has denied
reports of Amiraslanov's arrest, according to Turan. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
RUSSIAN STATE DUMA SPEAKER IN TBILISI. Gennadii Seleznev met with
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Minister of State Niko
Lekishvili on 10 December to discuss bilateral relations and the Abkhaz
conflict, Russian and Western agencies reported. Shevardnadze and
Seleznev said they favor expediting the ratification of a handful of
bilateral treaties, including one on friendship and cooperation, and
Seleznev affirmed his support for Georgia's territorial integrity,
according to ORT. Also on 10 December, a UN human rights office opened
in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, ITAR-TASS reported. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
KAZAKSTAN FLOATS BONDS ON WORLD MARKET. Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Aleksandr Pavlov announced on 10 December that $200
million worth of "Kazak Euronotes" were launched in Amsterdam on 9
December, ITAR-TASS reported. Kazakstan is the second CIS country, after
Russia, to float its bonds on world markets. According to Pavlov, Kazak
Euronotes have a three-year term and will carry an interest rate of
9.3%. The proceeds will be used to pay wage and pension arrears. --
Bruce Pannier
<p>
UZBEKISTAN TO BUY RUSSIAN GRAIN. Due to a poor 1996 harvest, Uzbekistan
agreed to exchange 100,000 metric tons of grain from Russia in return
for 18,200 tons of cotton, the BBC reported on 9 December. The agreement
is backed by a $27 million guarantee from European bankers. Officials
noted that Uzbekistan will have to make further grain imports, as the
2.7 million ton harvest fell short of the 4.5 million tons the country
requires. -- Roger Kangas
<p>
TAJIK PRESIDENT, OPPOSITION LEADER MEET. Tajik President Imomali
Rakhmonov and United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri met in
Khosdekh, Afghanistan, on 10 December, international press reported. Few
details were available on the meeting, except that the two men agreed to
meet officially in Moscow on 19 December. The press speculated that a
new ceasefire agreement will be signed at that time as well as an
agreement on the establishment of a coalition council with
representation from both the government and opposition. Meanwhile, Red
Cross representatives were allowed to see 110 government soldiers being
held by opposition forces in Komsomolabad. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
TURKMENISTAN CELEBRATES NEUTRALITY. An article in the 11 December
edition of Nezavisimaya gazeta noted that Turkmenistan will celebrate
the first anniversary of its recognition as a "neutral country" on 12
December. On that day in 1995, the UN passed a resolution recognizing
Turkmenistan's status as a neutral country. To mark the occasion the
former Karl Marx Square is being renamed "Neutrality Square." The
article notes that "during the last year more than 60 international
conferences, symposiums, and summits" took place in Ashgabat, and that
three rounds of negotiations between the Tajik government and opposition
were also held there, going so far as to claim that "only thanks to
Turkmenistan" were the Tajik negotiations kept "alive." -- Bruce Pannier

CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
<p>
1997 NATO SUMMIT TO ISSUE MEMBERSHIP INVITATIONS. NATO foreign ministers
agreed on 10 December that an alliance summit meeting on 7-8 July in
Madrid will decide which of the 11 Eastern European applicants will be
invited to accession negotiations, international agencies reported. NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana refused to reveal which countries would
be selected, saying only that "one or more" would receive invitations.
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are still believed to be the
leading candidates, although Slovenia, Romania, and Slovakia are still
under consideration. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT FIRES HIS CHIEF OF STAFF. Leonid Kuchma has
dismissed presidential chief of staff Dmytro Tabachnyk and stripped him
of the military ranks acquired in the last three years as a reserve
officer, Ukrainian and international media reported on 10 December. The
official reason for Tabachnyk's removal is transfer to another job, but
the decree did not specify which. Tabachnyk--one of the country's most
influential politicians, whom the media describe as the president's
shadow--has faced sharp criticism in the parliament, and has been
accused of illegal dealings in real estate and abuse of his position. A
parliamentary anti-corruption commission is conducting an official
investigation into the allegations that Tabachnyk had illegally obtained
a second apartment in Kyiv. Tabachnyk, 33, played a key role in Kuchma's
victory in the 1994 presidential elections. -- Oleg Varfolomeyev
<p>
UKRAINE ON NATO, SEVASTOPOL. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennadii
Udovenko said at a North Atlantic Cooperation Council meeting in
Luxembourg that Ukraine would like to have a separate agreement with
NATO, Ukrainian radio reported on 10 December. He reiterated Ukraine's
opposition to the deployment of nuclear weapons on the territory of new
NATO member states. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said NATO
had no plans for such deployment. The same day, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yurii Serheyev said Ukraine would not enter into any
negotiations with Russia over the status of Sevastopol, because
Ukraine's territorial integrity was recognized internationally. On 11
December Ukraine's parliament began examining a law on the status of
foreign troops on Ukrainian territory. The previous day ITAR-TASS
reported the Justice Ministry finished drafting the law on the status of
Kyiv and Sevastopol. Under the new constitution, the two cities have a
special status. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
ANOTHER ANTI-PRESIDENT DEMONSTRATION IN BELARUSIAN CAPITAL. About 500
students demonstrated in Minsk on 10 December to mark the International
Human Rights Day, international agencies reported. The demonstrators
marched down the central avenue waving UN and EU flags, handing out
leaflets containing the UN Charter and other human rights documents.
They protested the government's numerous human rights violations, and
demanded the release of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka's opponents
arrested at recent demonstrations. The rally was peaceful, but police
arrested several students as the demonstrators were dispersing.
Meanwhile, at least 40 Supreme Soviet deputies, who refused to recognize
the new Belarusian parliament, assembled in the Minsk-based House of
Writers, Belapan reported. They also adopted a statement reaffirming
their loyalty to the 1994 Constitution, non-recognition of the results
of the 24 November referendum, and declaring the Supreme Soviet the only
legislature in Belarus. -- Sergei Solodovnikov
<p>
MCDONALD'S RIOT IN BELARUS. The opening of the first McDonald's in
Belarus on 10 December led to rioting at the restaurant in Minsk,
Reuters and AFP reported. A 4,000 strong crowd descended at the
McDonald's and tried to push their way in because of rumors that the
first customers would get free food or a prize. Riot police beat people
with truncheons to keep them from forcing their way in. In all,
McDonald's plans to open four restaurants in Minsk.. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
CONTROVERSIES OVER POLISH CONSTITUTION. The co-ruling Polish Peasant
Party (PSL) contested the proposed three-level local administration
scheme included in the constitution draft, Polish dailies reported on 11
December. The PSL demands a statement in the constitution that "the
family farm is the basis of the rural structure of the Polish state."
The PSL and the leftist Labor Union demand also that the constitution
establishes the so-called social rights: for housing, free health care
and education. The chances that Poland will have the new constitution
before the parliamentary election scheduled for 1997 are therefore slim.
-- Jakub Karpinski
<p>
SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE
<p>
STANDOFF IN BELGRADE. The opposition carried out its threat to boycott
the federal Yugoslav parliament session that took place on 10 December,
international media reported. Protests entered their fourth week and
continued in the streets with the demand that the authorities recognize
the opposition victories in the 17 November runoff local elections.
Meanwhile, the federal supreme court upheld the decisions of its Serbian
counterpart to cancel those poll results. Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic has now repeatedly failed to take advantage of opportunities
to end the confrontation in a peaceful and legal manner by having courts
uphold the opposition victories. Elsewhere. federal Interior Minister
Vukasin Jokanovic said that force will not be used against the
protesters unless they attack public property. Finally, the 400,000-
strong independent metal workers union Nezavisnost announced a strike
starting 11 December in Kragujevac and Nis, AFP reported.-- Patrick
Moore
<p>
CLINTON TELLS MILOSEVIC TO ACCEPT VOTE RESULTS . . . U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to respect the
outcome of the 17 November ballot. CNN on 10 December quoted him as
saying: "Elections should be respected and the voice of the people
should be heard... The United States has made its statement and its
position clear. Neither we nor anyone else would seek to interfere in
the internal events of Serbia but our sympathies are always with a free
people who are struggling to express their freedom and want to have the
integrity of their elections respected." The protesters have paid close
attention to reactions to their cause from abroad, and Clinton's
statement is likely to be regarded as the most important message in
their favor to date. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
. . . AS DOES NATO . . . The Atlantic alliance, after a meeting of its
foreign ministers, told Milosevic that NATO "strongly deplores" his
decision not to recognize the election results. The ministers urged him
"to respect the democratic will of the people by reversing [his]
decision," AFP reported on 10 December. The NATO statement praised the
opposition for remaining peaceful and warned the authorities against
using violence. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher added: "The
people of Serbia deserve what their neighbors in central Europe have:
clean elections, a free press, a normal market economy. If President
Milosevic respects their will, Serbia can enjoy the legitimacy and
assistance it needs. If he seeks to rule Serbia as an unreformed
dictatorship, it will only increase his isolation and the suffering of
his people." Washington called of a visit to Belgrade by envoy John
Kornblum as a message to Milosevic. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
. . . AND THE BOSNIAN SERB LEADERSHIP. Republika Srpska President
Biljana Plavsic told TV Pale that she supports the students, adding that
"the entry of students always means that freedom and democracy are
endangered," Reuters and Deutsche Welle reported on 10 December. Plavsic
stressed that this is the moment for Serbia to finally break with its
communist past, adding that "the Croats [long ago] resolved this problem
very quickly." She also said that Milosevic was not important to ensure
the implementation of the Dayton agreement, arguing that its success
depended on the directly affected people. -- Patrick Moore

MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS 11 Dec 1996 p 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Aleksandr Budberg:  "General Semenov's Secret Uncovered.  New<br>
Compromising Evidence Leak Expected This Week"<br>
<p>
   The scandal surrounding the dismissal of commander in chief of the Ground<br>
Forces Vladimir Semenov is gaining momentum.  Taking advantage of the<br>
non-too-clear stance of Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, the suspended<br>
general of the army began to gradually going on the offensive.<br>
   MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has come to learn from sufficiently informed<br>
sources in the Defense Ministry that Vladimir Magomedovich's [Semenov's]<br>
increased activity stirred the Defense Ministry leadership into more<br>
resolute actions.  One can expect the publication in a few next days of<br>
transcripts of Semenov's taped telephone conversations (which they did not<br>
want to leak before).<br>
   If one is to believe a source, it emerges from these conversations that<br>
General Semenov was rather effectively involved in business operations to<br>
buy food and grain for troops in his charge.  The source is also talking<br>
about $200,000 in commission money for lobbying the sale to a Turkish firm<br>
of two Russian helicopters.  The contract does not specify where these<br>
helicopters might get to from Turkey.  The source also alleges that the<br>
tapes deal with the reception of concrete money.<br>
   MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS cannot claim that all the reports are absolutely<br>
true.  Especially because the tapes have not been examined by experts.<br>
However, this version is explains convincingly enough both the tough wording<br>
of the commander in chief's dismissal order -- for actions discrediting the<br>
honor and dignity, and the long silence of the defense minister who ended up<br>
in an amazingly stupid position.  Indeed, the eavesdropping on, perhaps, all<br>
high-ranking officials (one may think not only of Chubays but also the<br>
scandal involving Grachev's "plot") can in theory be carried out only with<br>
the prosecutor's permission.  Therefore, the data which were put on<br>
Rodionov's desk cannot be official proof even if they contained correct<br>
information.<br>
   Therefore, the scandal surrounding Semenov's dismissal -- no matter how<br>
the case involving the general and his wife ends -- may put into even<br>
sharper focus the question of morals among the top leadership of Russia.<br>
   It is perhaps realizing this that Rodionov, regarded as a sufficiently<br>
punctilious person, was for so long trying to prevent the news leak.  Had<br>
not the scandal been used in order to put the minister "in his place" and<br>
show who is the master in the house, the source in the Defense Ministry<br>
would not have spoken.<br>
(end)<br>

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 11 Dec 1996 p 3<br>
<p>
   NEGA untitled report<br>
<p>
   A statement of Georgia's foreign ministry underlines that the republic<br>
will never renounce its rights to part of the Black Sea Fleet which it will<br>
be able to maintain.<br>
   Ukraine has supported Tbilisi's demand.  The Kiev officials think that<br>
all the naval ships which were based in the ports of Batumi and Poti until<br>
1992 should be restored to Georgia.<br>

HEADLINE:  Turkish Scandal Reveals Extent Of Violence And Coercion <br>
SOURCE:  New York Times, December 10, 1996 (LATE EDITION)<br>
<p>
Chavoush's Note:  The "Early Edition" of today's New York Times did not<br>
include the paragraph discussing how the late Abdullah Catli was targetting<br>
Armenians.  The paragraph (included below) was only provided in the late<br>
edition - which is the version provided below.<br>
<p>
When a speeding Mercedes crashed into a tractor-trailer on a highway 100<br>
miles southwest of Istanbul last month, killing three people and seriously<br>
injuring a fourth, it was at first viewed as nothing more than another<br>
accident like those that kill thousands of people on Turkey's rugged roads<br>
each year. <br>
<p>
But after the victims of the accident were identified as including a top<br>
police official, a member of Parliament and a well-known criminal, a scandal<br>
broke out that threatens to shake the foundations of Turkish politics. It<br>
involves allegations that successive Turkish governments have over the last<br>
decade sponsored death squads, harbored terrorists and turned a blind eye to<br>
heroin smuggling. <br>
<p>
For years, many Turks have suspected that government agencies were using<br>
gangs of killers to help suppress dissidents and Kurdish rebels waging a<br>
separatist war in southeastern Turkey. Now, with new information emerging<br>
almost daily and the press and the public talking of little else, evidence<br>
suggests that officially sanctioned criminality may have reached levels that<br>
few had imagined. <br>
<p>
The scandal has already led to the resignation of the Turkish interior<br>
minister and the suspension of several high-ranking officers from the<br>
Istanbul police force, including the chief. No one believes that they will be<br>
the last to lose their jobs or reputations. <br>
<p>
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamic-led government, which has been in<br>
power since June, has not been the target of direct accusations, although<br>
unsolved killings have continued here in recent months. <br>
<p>
Turkey's principal opposition leader, Mesut Yilmaz, who has demanded that the<br>
government pursue the crash investigation wherever it leads, was assaulted on<br>
Nov. 24 in the lobby of a Budapest hotel by a rightist Turk who nearly broke<br>
his nose. <br>
<p>
"Obviously the next message is going to be sent with a bullet," Yilmaz said<br>
later, "but we will not be scared into abandoning this crusade for clean<br>
government. If we do not fight today, we won't have anything to fight for<br>
tomorrow. If illegal money, coercion and political power come together to<br>
seize the state, it will be impossible to continue our struggle through<br>
democratic means." <br>
<p>
Since the attack, Yilmaz and other senior Turkish leaders, including the<br>
prime minister, have been guarded by unusually tight security details.  <br>
<p>
The victims of the crash on Nov. 3, all of them in the Mercedes, included<br>
Abdullah Catli, a convicted heroin smuggler and terror suspect; Sedat Bucak,<br>
head of a Kurdish clan that receives $1.3 million a month in government money<br>
for providing thousands of "village guards" who fight separatist Kurds in the<br>
southeast, and Husseyin Kocadag, a senior security officer who had commanded<br>
anti-guerrilla units and served as deputy police chief in Istanbul. <br>
<p>
Catli and Kocadag were killed in the crash, together with Gonca Us, a former<br>
beauty queen who had been the mistress of several prominent gangsters. Bucak,<br>
the member of Parliament, survived. Investigators discovered a trove of<br>
weapons, including pistols and silencers, in the wrecked car's trunk. <br>
<p>
Immediately after the accident, journalists and politicians demanded to know<br>
what a top police official was doing in the company of Catli, who has been<br>
hiding from Interpol since his escape in 1990 from a Swiss prison, where he<br>
was serving a sentence for heroin smuggling. Questions increased when it<br>
turned out that Catli held a Turkish diplomatic passport, a gun permit and<br>
six identity cards, each bearing a different name.  <br>
<p>
Catli was well known to those who follow far-right activities in Turkey.<br>
Police investigators have linked him to a number of crimes here, including a<br>
massacre of seven leftist students in Ankara in 1978 and the Istanbul<br>
jailbreak in 1979 that freed Mehmet Ali Agca, who was being tried for the<br>
killing of a leading journalist and who later shot Pope John Paul II in Rome.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Investigators also believe that Catli and his associates carried out<br>
terrorist attacks abroad, some of them aimed at Armenians who were gunning<br>
down Turkish diplomats in the United States and elsewhere. <br>
<p>
The driver of the truck into which the Mercedes crashed, Hasan Gokce, has<br>
become something of a cult figure. Many Turks feel that although the crash<br>
was accidental, Gokce deserves the nation's thanks for having been the<br>
instrument through which so many sordid secrets have begun to emerge. <br>
<p>
The routine traffic hearing at which he testified was overflowing, and at one<br>
point Gokce broke down in tears when spectators drowned out the proceedings<br>
with chants of "You are a hero!" <br>
<p>
The interior minister, Mehmet Agar, sought to dismiss questions about the car<br>
crash. He first said the odd combination of passengers in the Mercedes was<br>
merely coincidental, and later speculated that Kocadag might have arrested<br>
Catli and was bringing him into custody. <br>
<p>
But after it became clear that the two had a long working relationship,<br>
charges that Agar was involved in a cover-up became so strong that he was<br>
forced to resign. <br>
<p>
Several leading newspapers have published excerpts from what they say are<br>
police and military intelligence reports asserting that government security<br>
agencies began using death squads a decade ago, and that the squads were<br>
given a strengthened mandate around 1991. The reports say the squads operated<br>
against Kurds and others who they believed were supporting the rebel<br>
Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK. <br>
<p>
"Terrorists would be caught, or killed if necessary, before they actually<br>
staged attacks," Ismet Berkan, a columnist, wrote in the newspaper Radikal.<br>
"And the persons who provided the terrorists with material or moral support<br>
would be treated the same way as the terrorists." <br>
<p>
Politicians and commentators have asserted that such operations could not<br>
have been carried out without the knowledge and consent of the three prime<br>
ministers who have led Turkey in recent years, all of whom remain major<br>
political figures. <br>
<p>
They are Yilmaz, whose demands for an investigation may be motivated at least<br>
in part by his bitter antagonism to the current government; Suleyman Demirel,<br>
the country's elder statesman and now its president, and Foreign Minister<br>
Tansu Ciller. <br>
<p>
Mrs. Ciller, who was prime minister from 1993 until the beginning of this<br>
year, has been the object of especially harsh accusations. Eighty members of<br>
Parliament asked the federal prosecutor last week to bring charges of<br>
criminal misconduct against her. <br>
<p>
They said the fateful car crash presented Turkey with "a historic opportunity<br>
to expose unsolved murders and the drug and arms smuggling that have been<br>
going on in our country for years."   <br>
<p>
Mrs. Ciller has denied any wrongdoing, and asserted that charges against her<br>
were coming from political rivals and enemies in business and the press who<br>
practice "subversive policies based on a doctrine of hate." But she has<br>
pointedly refused to disassociate herself from the late Catli.  <br>
<p>
"I do not know whether he is guilty or not," Mrs. Ciller said, "but we will<br>
always respectfully remember those who fire bullets or suffer wounds in the<br>
name of this country, this nation and this state." <br>
<p>
What was seen as Mrs. Ciller's effort to defend the right of governments to<br>
hire death squads caused a furor, and Erbakan, who had remained silent for<br>
three weeks after the accident, felt compelled to speak. <br>
<p>
"You cannot have a gang within the state," Erbakan told Turkish journalists.<br>
"Nobody can be allowed to do anything illegal, with no exceptions. Nothing,<br>
including fighting the PKK, can be an excuse for crime. If such things<br>
happen, those gangs, whatever their makeup, must be disbanded." <br>
<p>
The longtime leader of Turkey's far-right political party, Alparslan Turkes,<br>
is among officials who have admitted knowing that Catli performed clandestine<br>
services for Turkey's police and military. <br>
<p>
"On the basis of my state experience, I admit that Catli has been used by the<br>
state," Turkes said. He said Catli and the other men traveling in the<br>
Mercedes that crashed had been cooperating "in the framework of a secret<br>
service working for the good of the state." <br>
<p>
One of Turkey's most prominent pro-Kurdish politicians, Guven Ozata, said the<br>
car crash and its aftermath had convinced him that state-sponsored death<br>
squads were behind many of the estimated 3,500 unsolved killings that have<br>
been committed in the southeastern part of the country in the last decade.<br>
Most of the victims had been suspected of sympathizing with separatist<br>
Kurdish causes. <br>
<p>
"These gangs have a direct link with mystery killings," Ozata said at a news<br>
conference. "This is no longer a hypothesis or a guess. It is a reality<br>
acknowledged by government officials."  <br>
<p>
Several politicians and others who are calling for investigations into the<br>
government's relationship with criminal gangs believe that the gangs used<br>
their official ties as cover for involvement in Turkey's lucrative<br>
heroin-smuggling trade. They suspect that senior officials were engaged in<br>
the trade or tolerated it as a way of repaying gangs that killed at their<br>
behest. <br>
<p>
"By now it is obvious that the state has from time to time engaged in secret<br>
operations to commit illegal acts," Can Atakli, a columnist, wrote in the<br>
Istanbul daily Sabah. "Undemocratic-minded people, concocting their own brand<br>
of 'patriotism,' decided to use gunmen to eliminate people they saw as a<br>
threat." <br>
<p>
"Most of the public believes that the truth about these gangs will never be<br>
fully exposed," Atakli wrote. "Is it really an insoluble problem? No. But<br>
unraveling the tangle would upset so many powerful individuals and<br>
organizations that one tends to think maybe it is better kept as it is." <br>

<p>
<p>
1. THREE SENTENCED TO DEATH, AS "DRO" CASE ENDS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Combined Sources)-Three defendants received death <br>
sentences, while others in the so-called "Dro" group trial were <br>
sentenced to three to 15-year prison terms, as the trial ended <br>
Tuesday with Armenias Supreme Court determining that the alleged <br>
clandestine terrorist group had no links to the Armenian <br>
Revolutionary Federation.<br>
	The court, presided over by Judge Eduard Manoukian, handed <br>
down death sentences to defendants Arsen Ardzrouni, Armen <br>
Grigorian and Armenak Munjoyan. The remaining defendants were <br>
sentenced in the following manner: Armen Zakarian, 15 years; Hovik <br>
Mkrtchian, 10 years; Ara Harmandarian, six years; Edik Simonian, <br>
five years; Tatul Gabrielian and Gevork Alahverdian three years <br>
each.<br>
	The court found that a group involved with so-called <br>
"banditism" engaged in drug trafficking and planned and executed <br>
the assassinations known as "Top 1" and "Kerop" operations, as <br>
result of which Gagik Sahakian, Ashot Nercissian and his wife were <br>
murdered.<br>
	The court also found that ARF leader and Karabakh liberation <br>
movement organizer Hrand Markarian was in no way tied to the so-<br>
called "Dro" group, and thus was cleared of those charges. <br>
However, Markarian was sentenced to five years in prison on <br>
illegal weapons possession and forged documentation charges.<br>
	Co-defendant Gegham Manoukian was sentenced to three years <br>
in jail as an accessory.<br>
	On December 28, 1994 then president Levon Ter-Petrosyan <br>
issued a decree suspending the ARF activities in Armenia, alleging <br>
that the party was involved in the operation of the so-called <br>
"Dro" group. The ARF has been suspended since that time, despite <br>
numerous appeals by the party to Armenias Justice Ministry. The <br>
government purge against the ARF was also extended in July 1995 <br>
when then ARF Bureau member Vahan Hovanessian and 31 others were <br>
arrested on charges of supporting the forcible overthrow of the <br>
government.<br>
	Several questions still remain. Markarian was found guilty <br>
of using forged documents, the same documents which he used to <br>
enter Karabakh which at that time was undergoing a self-<br>
determination war. Markarian was also found guilty of illegal arms <br>
possession, a license which was granted by commander of the <br>
Karabakh armed forces Samvel Babayan.<br>
	The court found no direct links between Markarian and the <br>
so-called "Dro" group, thus absolving any alleged ties between the <br>
ARF and the purported clandestine group, although, according to <br>
initial charges the ARF-"Dro" relations  were conducted solely by <br>
Markarian. <br>
	Defendants have 10 days to appeal the courts ruling.<br>
	Seven of the 12 defense attorneys were in the courtroom <br>
during the sentencing, coincidentally on the day that the world <br>
marks Human Rights Day.<br>
	Immediately following the sentencing, a number of the <br>
defendants relatives commented on the case and the sentences.<br>
	"This is unlawfulness, but the verdict is in. Here is the <br>
decision of the judge. The only positive thing is that certain <br>
realities were taken into consideration. Of course there were <br>
faults with the case, and those were connected with the <br>
preliminary investigation. This was an oversight on the part of <br>
the judge who failed to interpreted them correctly. According to <br>
the judge, those are also realities," said Azad Manoukian, the <br>
father of Gegham Manoukian.<br>
	Seryozha Mkrtchian, the father of Hovaness Mkrtchian said, <br>
"As a matter of fact, the verdict was a carbon copy of the <br>
December 28, 1994 televised address of Levon Ter-Petrosyan. <br>
Earlier this year, so-called Prosecutor-General [Ardavazt] <br>
Gevorkian made the same statement during an appearance on March 1. <br>
The Armenian leaderships order was basically realized."<br>
	Vehanoush Markarian, Hrand Markarians wife, said that the <br>
term of the sentence was unimportant, stating  that the crucial <br>
aspect was  at the end the judge ruled that neither her husband <br>
nor the ARF were linked with the so-called "Dro" group.<br>
	Marine Galabian, Hovaness Mkrtchians defense attorney said, <br>
"As far as the verdict, it was a verdict, but as far as the <br>
sentences are concerned, I believe the sentences were incoherent. <br>
My client was permitted to carry a weapon in Karabakh. Even if he <br>
had not received similar permission in Armenia, that does not <br>
merit such a harsh sentence. I, of course, presumed he would be <br>
found not guilty, but the prosecutor asked for a 15-year sentence, <br>
yet the judge reduced it to ten. In this regard, I have no <br>
complaints based on the evidence presented in the case. However, <br>
the judge should have explained his reasons for giving him the <br>
maximum sentence. A harsher sentence could have been handed down <br>
in the absence of special circumstances and other issues that <br>
otherwise called for a reduced sentence. In this regard, the judge <br>
did not provide any explanations and handed down the maximum <br>
sentence."<br>
	Responding to whether the verdict and sentence would have <br>
been different had his client been tried separately, Hrand <br>
Markarians defense attorney Rouben Sahakian said, "In that case <br>
the preliminary investigation and the trial would have been over <br>
in a month, and I do not believe my client would have received the <br>
maximum sentence for the crimes he is charged with. That [maximum <br>
sentence] simply escapes any logic, any the only explanation is <br>
that the authorities do not wish to see Hrand Markarian free. What <br>
is criminal is giving a person the maximum sentence when that <br>
person was charged with that crime for the first time. The reasons <br>
for giving Hrand Markarian the maximum sentence should have been <br>
explained."<br>
	Laura Munjoyan, mother of Armenak Munjoyan said, "They tried <br>
innocent people."<br>
	Judge Edward Manoukian said at the end of the sentencing <br>
phase that  the courts decision may be appealed within seven <br>
days. Defense attorney Marine Galabian said that only after <br>
reviewing the case with her client will she take the next step. <br>
	Rouben Sahakian said that he was planning to file an appeal <br>
on behalf of his client, Hrand Markarian.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. KAREKIN I ARRIVES IN ROME<br>
<p>
ROME-His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians arrived <br>
at the Vatican Tuesday for an official visit with Pope John Paul <br>
II.<br>
	Karekin I arrived in Rome aboard a private plane furnished <br>
by philanthropist Vatche Manougian and was accompanied by Bishop <br>
Barkev Mardirossian, Primate of the Artsakh Diocese; Archbishop <br>
Krikoris Buniatian, Primate of the Shirak Diocese and Archbishop <br>
Garegin Nercessian, Primate of the Araratian Diocese.<br>
	The pontiff was greeted at the Rome airport by the Patriarch <br>
of Istanbul Arch. Karekin Kazandjian and the Patriarch of <br>
Jerusalem Arch. Torkom Manougian, who were joined by Western <br>
Primate Arch. Vatche Hovsepian, Eastern US Primate Arch. Khajag <br>
Barsamian and the Paris Primate Bishop Kiut Nakkashian.<br>
	The Catholicos was scheduled to meet with the Pope at 6 p.m. <br>
local time.<br>
	Karekin I and his delegation will remain Rome and the <br>
Vatican until Friday, where they will visit several Catholic <br>
leaders. The visit will culminate with a private visit between the <br>
Catholicos and the Pope.<br>
	The purpose of the visit is to discuss developing relations <br>
between the Armenian and Catholic churches.<br>
	Karekin I is also scheduled to meet Italys president <br>
Saturday.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. ACTIVISTS SAY WEST ENCOURAGES ABUSES IN CIS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW (Reuter)-Human rights activists Tuesday accused the West of <br>
not doing enough to protect human rights in ex-Soviet states, <br>
saying Western countries should not support governments <br>
responsible for abuses.<br>
	"In 1996 human rights principles were subordinated to <br>
current political and economic interests," said Alexander Petrov, <br>
Moscow representative of the US-based rights monitor Human Rights <br>
Watch/Helsinki.<br>
	"This particularly concerned the United States and the <br>
countries of the European Union," he told a news conference to <br>
mark International Human Rights Day.<br>
	"An example of this kind of policy was provided by Russias <br>
accession to the Council of Europe despite the renewal and <br>
continuation of intense military activity in Chechnya involving <br>
colossal violations of humanitarian law," he said.<br>
	The Council of Europe, which sees itself as an arbiter of <br>
human rights, accepted Russia in February after months of delay <br>
due to concerns over Moscows campaign in the breakaway region. <br>
	Council members said at the time that having Russia on board <br>
would help it to push forward human rights, but critics charged <br>
that it did nothing to stop the Chechnya fighting, which killed <br>
tens of thousands before a peace deal was signed in August. <br>
	"Things were no better in other republics," Petrov said, <br>
citing aid given to Armenia and Georgia despite government <br>
crackdowns on opposition groups.<br>
	Azerbaijan had also conducted a campaign to crush dissent, <br>
he said, but nevertheless won observer status in the Council of <br>
Europe. Kazakhstan and Kirgizia also got Western support.<br>
	As far as the rights situation itself was concerned, Petrov <br>
said autocratic and arbitrary rule in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan <br>
made them the biggest causes for alarm.<br>
	In Russia, Petrov said the only significant improvement was <br>
the end to the conflict against separatist rebels in Chechnya, <br>
begun when President Boris Yeltsin sent in troops two years ago. <br>
	"If you set this aside human rights stayed on the same level <br>
and in some cases worsened," he said.<br>
	He said the situation in Russias regions was worse than in <br>
Moscow and other big towns, citing direct threats and financial <br>
sanctions which he said were used to gag the media. "There is no <br>
progress, but a regression here."<br>
	Petrov also pinpointed a growth in xenophobia in Russia, <br>
particularly against people of Caucasian origin beaten up and <br>
deported from big towns by the authorities.<br>
	Lyudmila Alekseyeva, president of the Moscow Helsinki Group, <br>
which fought for human rights under communism, said the group had <br>
previously been concerned mainly with political rights, but was <br>
now turning its attention to the economy.<br>
	"After the end of the war in Chechnya the biggest violations <br>
of human rights are delays in wage payments and pensions."<br>
	She said that despite repeated promises, the government had <br>
shown itself unable to guarantee wage payments and so should give <br>
people the power to claim their pay from the directors of their <br>
enterprises via the courts.<br>
	"We will fight until it is resolved," she said. "Im afraid <br>
it will take a long time."<br>
<p>
<p>
4. ULTRASENSITIVE SEISMIC STATIONS BEING INSTALLED IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenia, being one of the most seismically <br>
active regions, had built structures with very low seismic <br>
resistance, head of the National Seismic Protection Service, <br>
Sergey Balassanian, said at a news conference Saturday on the <br>
occasion of  the eighth anniversary of the earthquake in <br>
northeastern Armenia.<br>
	The establishment of the NSPS in 1991 was a serious step <br>
toward the formation of a seismic protection program in Armenia, <br>
Balassanian said.<br>
	The program, aimed at lowering seismic risks in Armenia, <br>
will enable the NSPS to outline seismic danger; to raise the <br>
seismic resistance of existing buildings and buildings which are <br>
still under construction; and to prepare the population for <br>
another major earthquake.<br>
	The NSPS has many international points of observations and <br>
Armenia possesses about 150 of these observation points.<br>
	New stations are being established, Balassanian said. The <br>
first one is a global geodesic satellite station (GPS)-the only <br>
one in the Middle East. It was installed a month ago through the <br>
assistance of NASA and the University of Massachusetts.<br>
	The other station, IRIS, is being installed by the US <br>
Seismic Service. It is very sensitive to micro-tremors and even to <br>
the smallest fluctuations of the earths crust under the influence <br>
of gravitational waves of the moon and sun.<br>
	Balassanian said that the NSPS has compiled a new map of <br>
seismic zones for Armenia.<br>
	Mikael Melkoumian, director of the Center for Seismic <br>
Resistance Construction, stressed the importance of raising the <br>
seismic resistance of buildings. A new method for the <br>
reinforcement of buildings was devised and successfully tested <br>
which does not require the evacuation of people and is much less <br>
expensive than the old methods.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. ARTUR KAZARIAN TESTIFIES AT "TRIAL OF 31"<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-At Mondays court session of the so-called <br>
"Trial of 31," the judicial board presented letters written by <br>
defendant Artur Kazarian to Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsian, <br>
Prosecutor-General Artavazd Gevorkian and National Security <br>
Minister Serge Sargssian.<br>
	In his letters to Armenias high-ranking officials, Kazarian <br>
reportedly wrote "the guilt should be laid on the Armenian <br>
Revolutionary Federation and its members" requesting that <br>
authorities "not let anybody involve the freedom fighters in the <br>
dirty party politics and to treat the disillusioned freedom <br>
fighters with kindness."<br>
	Kazarian said that evidence regarding the killing of the <br>
policemen was deliberately distorted. He reported that he had <br>
heard defendant Gagik Karapetian shout "Who are you shooting at?" <br>
and saw Tigran Avetissian fire a shot into the ground. He said he <br>
had heard three pistol shots (all the three shots were made by the <br>
policemen) and three or four shots fired from a machine-gun.<br>
	Kazarian highly doubted the experts findings which stated <br>
that no shots had been fired from the policemens guns. Kazarian <br>
said that he doesnt know who the killer or killers of the <br>
policemen were.<br>
	He also denied allegations that they had not followed the <br>
policemens orders, saying that they were willing to follow the <br>
policemen to the Internal Affairs office.<br>
	As for the murder of the police officers, Kazarian said he <br>
learned about it from a television news broadcast.<br>
	Kazarian also said that after they had escaped to the <br>
mountains in Sourenavan, "all the guys were surprised to learn the <br>
news about the policemens death," and Avetissian exclaimed: "I <br>
was shooting in another direction, I couldnt have hit them." <br>
Kazarian voiced hope that the questioning of the surviving <br>
policeman will shed light on these murders and there <br>
circumstances.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. LEONARD PETROSSIAN TO REMAIN KARABAKH PRIME MINISTER<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (Hayastani Hanrapetutyun)-Newly elected President <br>
Robert Kocharian re-appointed Leonard Petrossian as Prime Minister <br>
of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic by presidential decree last <br>
Saturday.<br>
	Petrossian was asked to develop and present the structure of <br>
the new government within ten days.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. NEW YEREVAN MAYOR TAKES BACK LAND ALLOCATED BY PREDECESSOR<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Hayastani Hanrapetutyun)-The new mayor of Yerevan, former <br>
Interior Minister Vano Siradeghian announced Monday that he will <br>
be taking back 7.5 hectares of land allocated by the former mayor <br>
for the construction of parks and gardens, according to Yerevan <br>
City Council secretary Sergey Poghossian.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. 500 CASES OF SYPHILIS REPORTED IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Azg)-Armenias chief expert on skin and venereal <br>
diseases, Dr. Karen Babayan, said that more than 500 cases of <br>
syphilis have been reported in Armenia.<br>
	He said that another 100 unreported cases should be added to <br>
the official figures because some of the patients do not seek <br>
medical care.<br>
	According to Babayan, the number of cases has been <br>
increasing during the recent years, and the average age of the <br>
patients is getting younger. Most of the patients are 21-30 years <br>
old.<br>
	The majority of the patients are people who are currently <br>
unemployed and homeless. He said that the disease, which in the <br>
past would be cured in a year or two, can now be cured in less <br>
than a month with a single injection.<br>
	Babayan said that the print and broadcast media should be <br>
involved in educating the public about this and other venereal <br>
diseases.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. NEW SAFETY PANEL DEVELOPED FOR NUCLEAR REACTORS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW (Itar-Tass)-Russian and French specialists have developed a <br>
new panel for better data control of nuclear reactors. <br>
	Armen Abagyan, director of Russias main research institute <br>
for nuclear power plants, told Itar-Tass that such a panel would <br>
be connected to the second reactor of the Kalinin station and <br>
other Russian nuclear power plants with VVER-1000-type reactors <br>
(on light water).<br>
	The safety panel is an automated computer system. In case of <br>
an accident, an operator can find the problem easily with the help <br>
of the system, assess the situation and take prompt action. The <br>
panel was developed especially for VVER-1000-type reactors, which <br>
have replaced the old ones.<br>
	The development of the new panel was financed within the <br>
"Tasis" European program in which nuclear safety is the main goal. <br>
A total of $400 million has been allocated for the project since <br>
1991.<br>

In short, regarding Armenians, Zhirinovsky says:<br>
1.  Russian Communists didn't know the difference between Armenians and Turks<br>
2.  The Soviet policy on nationalities was all-wrong<br>
3.  Stunned that Armenians in USA voted for Clinton<br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Speech by LDPR Leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky at the Monthly Luncheon<br>
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia December 09, 1996 <br>
SOURCE:  Official Kremlin Int'l News Broadcast, December 9, 1996<br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: Good afternoon, I apologize for being late. I had a meeting with<br>
television Channel II. I had to cut that meeting short out of respect for<br>
you. But I have a long running feud with the television people. I am glad to<br>
meet you and I know that you have previously met with Communist leaders. The<br>
main difference between us and them is that they are all former Communists. I<br>
am the only leader of a political party who has never been a member of the<br>
Communist Party. Perhaps, a mistake of the foreign policy of the United<br>
States and the embassy of the United States in Moscow that they took one part<br>
of the former CPSU for democrats, for new political forces. This accounts for<br>
many problems. <br>
<p>
Because you are in the business of trade I can put it this way, America has<br>
bought a false political commodity in Russia. That's why we now have problems<br>
of investments, trade and economics. The same mistake was made by Napoleon<br>
and Hitler in their time. Before they approached Russia they made no<br>
mistakes. And it seemed to them that Russia could be handled in the same way,<br>
that they could impose a French order or a German order. And the United<br>
States is making the same mistake today. <br>
<p>
A simple example. Havel in the Czech Republic is alive and he is President of<br>
the Czech Republic. He is the same democrat as Gamsakhurdia in Georgia whom<br>
the United States might as well have supported. He has been assassinated.<br>
Here is a difference between a democracy in the Czech Republic or Poland and<br>
a democracy further to the East. <br>
<p>
The political forces that we have here today are mainly the rump of the<br>
former Communist Party. They have immunity as it were, and a negative<br>
attitude to the private sector and to world trade and to the relations with<br>
the Western countries. <br>
Many years ago I proposed to American political leaders to place accents in<br>
their policy differently. If they heeded me five or six years ago not only<br>
Russia but America could have been spared their current problems. But as I<br>
said, you relaxed in your approach to Russia. You thought that it's the same<br>
model here. These are democrats and this is some other trend and you can move<br>
ahead in the country. But Russia turned out to be different. <br>
<p>
I want Russia to have the broadest links with the United States and with any<br>
Western country. I am for the broadest trade and for the creation of a real<br>
legal basis so that all business people could work comfortably in Russia.<br>
Judging from this hotel Penta, this is a Potyomkin village, a show-case for<br>
advanced capitalism and democracy. Beyond the Moscow ringroad you will find<br>
nothing like it. But in order to pursue business you need much larger space.<br>
The Communists used to think in the same way, they used to think that sitting<br>
in the Kremlin and at their dachas outside Moscow, in Sochi sanatoria, think<br>
that everything is alright with communism and with friendship of peoples, and<br>
we all saw how easy this way to break and degenerate. <br>
<p>
Perhaps, I could have been in the CPSU or with Zyuganov, or with Gaidar or<br>
Yavlinsky among the democrats, but I have a different life behind, that's why<br>
I have a different view, I have been through a different war. I come from a<br>
very poor family and I starved for many years at a time when everything<br>
seemed quite alright in our country. I started some petty business activity,<br>
raising and selling rabbits to buy a bicycle for myself, so I have passed<br>
this path of private enterprise. <br>
<p>
And the fact that private farming cannot get to its feet today, that private<br>
enterprise cannot work in the agricultural sector -- I felt myself how it<br>
feels. Khrushchov prohibited me to have a small rabbit-raising firm within<br>
city limits -- only outside the city. No one knew how it will work outside<br>
the city, and within the city it was forbidden, though it did not do harm to<br>
anybody. "Only in some other place" -- this is the abstract way it was put.<br>
The same is happening to us today. At that time there was no perestroika, we<br>
had a regime of a certain kind, but there has hardly been any improvement in<br>
the attitude towards producers over the 30 years, since 1966, the sixties. <br>
<p>
It's the wrong approach to the question of nationalities that has left the<br>
greatest imprint on business and life in general in Russia. On this issue, I<br>
also have my personal experience, since I have spent half of my life in<br>
non-Russian republics of Kazakhstan and Georgia. Present-day leaders cannot<br>
find these regions on the map, do not know the languages that are spoken<br>
there, the creed of those peoples. <br>
<p>
Yesterday we had the 8th anniversary of the earthquake in Armenia. At that<br>
time the leaders of our country travelled to Yerevan and discovered only<br>
there that Armenians are not Moslems, are Christians. How can one be the<br>
leader of a country not knowing that this is the main distinction and<br>
contradiction between Armenia and Turkey and present-day Azerbaijan.<br>
Therefore it was also during the communists that there was a wrong solution<br>
to the nationalities question. Just as at present under the democrats. There<br>
is no difference. But all this affects trade, business. <br>
<p>
Under the communists the private sector was in the shadow economy. That was<br>
the time when they worked at a state-owned enterprise during the day while<br>
underground production shops worked at night. They were located somewhere in<br>
the mountains. They used the raw materials that were supplied to the state<br>
enterprises. That was a good capitalism, but it was driven underground. But<br>
the same continues, in principle, today. Though in a somewhat different way.<br>
You are interested in the existence of a firm legal basis for any business<br>
activity. But this did not exist either in the past, under the old regime,<br>
or, regrettably, today. Former heads of communist parties continue to rule<br>
the former regions of the former USSR. Yeltsin is the former Party Secretary<br>
of Moscow, Nazarbayev in Alma- Ata is the former Secretary of the Communist<br>
Party of Kazakhstan, Karimov, Aliyev, Shevardnadze -- they are all members of<br>
the former Central Committee of the CPSU and some of them of the Politburo.<br>
They are not interested in the economy. They are concerned about staying in<br>
power, about avoiding being put on trial and about dying calmly and let<br>
others attend to the new economy and the new democracy. In other words, the<br>
party Mafia retains its positions in all the former Union republics. <br>
<p>
Therefore it is hard for you to engage in business activities in Russia<br>
because you are caught between the party Mafia above, redtape and bureaucracy<br>
and the criminal Mafia so that you don't feel safe. <br>
<p>
I am in favor of private initiative, of the private sector because when a<br>
person is his own master he works better, he feels better, he is free. But<br>
the others are like infants who are linked by an umbilical cord with the<br>
former regime. So they are not likely to introduce the changes that could<br>
create more favorable conditions.This is one of the reasons why they don't<br>
like me in your country and in my country. They don't like me in your country<br>
because they feel that I am one of those people who could make Russia more<br>
powerful which would again rival the United States. And they don't like me in<br>
my country because I have from birth adhered to an ideology which they can<br>
never understand, to an economy that they can never implement. And I indeed<br>
share to a greater extent than anyone on how to approach all the problems of<br>
the economy, the nationalities and foreign policy the way you do in your<br>
country. So, I cannot understand the alienation that political leaders of the<br>
United States feel toward me. If the US leadership wants further aggravation<br>
of the situation in our country, then they are right. All people they stake<br>
on will only deteriorate and weaken this country. They cannot do any good to<br>
it. But then your unhappiness over what has been going on in our country,<br>
including the lack of appropriate climate, for US business will remain as it<br>
is today. I stand for reforming the administrative system. There is no<br>
country in the world with internal administrative division along ethnic<br>
lines. This is exactly what causes ethnic hostility. <br>
<p>
And you can see that the democrats have not touched on this issue lying at<br>
the root. They have destroyed everything, but the root of Russia's weakness<br>
-- its territorial division system remain intact. We could have long ago<br>
launched joint projects, profitable both for us and you. We could have built<br>
a transcontinental road Hamburg-Berlin- Moscow-Vladivostok. Trucks with<br>
freight could have travelled this road spanning two continents, Europe and<br>
Asia, day and night. But there is no such road in existence and one will not<br>
appear in the coming 10-20 years. <br>
<p>
We have similar problems in the south. You may face dangers in the south and<br>
we have problems there. We could have come to each other's assistance but we<br>
are acting to the contrary so far. While struggling against Russia you have<br>
strengthened other regions of the world which are struggling against you,<br>
against the United States. This reminds me of the campaign that we had to<br>
exterminate wolves. The wolves were exterminated, but rodents appeared. A lot<br>
was spent on the extermination of wolves, but even more was required to cope<br>
with the rodents. Russia is a wolf and can be dealt with, but as a result,<br>
you will find yourself surrounded by a huge number of small rodents. You will<br>
find that this is a much more serious problem. You will find out that it<br>
would be better to have two wolves, America and Russia. It would be better<br>
for America to confront a weakened Russian wolf than to be at the receiving<br>
end of hundreds of rodents. <br>
<p>
So, at the front you are struggling with Russia, but in your rear your<br>
adversaries are stockpiling arms and this struggle against them will not be a<br>
successful one for you. I have no allergy, no negative attitude to Americans<br>
because we never were in face-to-face conflict. <br>
<p>
We fought with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Turks, the Germans, the Finns,<br>
with all our neighbors, and many times at that. The attitude to Americans<br>
should be the most well-wishing one. <br>
<p>
We have a fighter plane. The whole of Europe united and only with difficulty<br>
created an analogue. The whole of Europe, on the one hand, and Russia, on the<br>
other hand. Russia has its plane while they, having pooled their efforts,<br>
failed to create a plane of the same quality. Or take China. It has 1.5<br>
billion population, a lot of resources, but they don't have a plane like<br>
that. The Chinese engineer is incapable of building modern fighter plane.<br>
Russian can. We have achievements which we could share and we could help each<br>
other. The same is true of the United States. <br>
<p>
If Russia is destroyed in the south, the Muslim factor will be strengthen and<br>
it would threaten America too. Or the Chinese factor will strengthen which<br>
too will pose a greater threat to America than to Russia. So I think the US<br>
leadership today has lost a sense of expediency and profitability. It ceased<br>
to be beneficial for your country. <br>
Our own instincts too sometimes let us down. You invited me among the last.<br>
When you have run out of parties to invite. So, two or three years on you<br>
have decided to meet with me. And previously you mainly met with your<br>
enemies, who won't be able to help you in any way. And you have seen that in<br>
the last two or three years there has been no progress in business in our<br>
country. I can carry on, my record is speaking 12 hours non-stop. I believe a<br>
dialogue is better. I will answer your questions. I proposed more than once<br>
to seat all sorts of political leaders in front of millions of television<br>
viewers, in front of businessmen for a panel discussion, so that they could<br>
see who is healthier, who is more vigorous. They all would be carried away,<br>
while I would remain alone, but when I stand alone without any competitors, I<br>
feel bad. I need competition. <br>
<p>
I apologize again for being late. I wanted very much to be on time. <br>
<p>
Moderator: We will take questions now. <br>
<p>
Q: I represent the company Thompson. What is the role of foreign investments,<br>
in your opinion, in Russia's development? <br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: I would like to recall your businessman who was recently<br>
murdered. He was a co-owner of Hotel Slavyanskaya. He asked me for assistance<br>
in his dispute. I did not expect such a tragic outcome. Otherwise, we would<br>
have tried to give him at least some assistance. I was gratified that an<br>
American businessman approached us, our faction for assistance. Alas, time<br>
had run out. Of course, I believe that there should be no restrictions in<br>
this field. We have a huge territory, huge wealth, we could have found the<br>
necessary conditions for investments, for cooperation. That would be very<br>
much to our advantage. But you are interested only in profits and in the<br>
possibility to dispose of them freely. In this country you will see not a<br>
single new industrial enterprise, new production facility. Lots of<br>
enterprises are standing idle. On sale you will matryoshka dolls that we<br>
produce. If we set up a joint venture to produce such dolls, it will bring<br>
little profit to you or to us. <br>
<p>
I stand for giving as much freedom as possible, but the problem lies in the<br>
absence of a ruling party and an opposition party. The situation which is<br>
unthinkable in any democratic country, where the will of the majority cannot<br>
be determined within a political formula. So, laws that would help you in<br>
this sphere have virtually not been adopted or implemented so far. And the<br>
main obstacle here is that, as you can see in regions, as you can see from<br>
the results of the past elections, the communists are regaining power. They<br>
are in the center, since the entire government is made up of former<br>
communists, the president's team is fully made up of former communists, and<br>
they are in regions, even where initially democratic-oriented administrations<br>
ruled. All recent elections show that the orthodox communists are coming<br>
back. If the US foreign policies are aimed at further destroying Russia, this<br>
should be viewed as a positive development. Then they can register this as a<br>
good result: let them completely destroy -- this time a lop-sided capitalism.<br>
But if they need real business, which is a sine qua non for the development,<br>
security and stability of America, this is a bad sign. But it's your embassy<br>
who is to blame, for it's not always that it makes correct assessments of the<br>
political situation in our country. <br>
<p>
A simple example is offered by Afghanistan, the offensive of the Taliban and<br>
the actions of that political structure plays into the hands of Pakistan and<br>
the US and into our hands too. We could find common ground there and achieve<br>
joint success in Central Asia, both in the political and business spheres.<br>
But Moscow doesn't act in this way. Again, we are opposing each other where<br>
we could united. Clinton embraces Yeltsin and Christopher embraces Primakov<br>
-- and now of course you have a new Secretary of State. In short there is a<br>
lack of understanding. Russia is not what the United States believes it to<br>
be. It is different.  <br>
<p>
Or take two more examples. Transcaucasia. If you need Turkey, you should not<br>
be supportive of Shevardnadze, the Georgian President. Moscow too would stand<br>
to gain more by not supporting Shevardnadze. We would do better to support<br>
Abkhazia, Adjaria and Southern Ossetia. So we two powers are pursuing the<br>
wrong policy with regard to Georgia. This is another mistake. And then there<br>
is a problem of Armenia. Clinton gained very many Armenian-American votes,<br>
but the policy in the Caucasus is anti- Armenian and this worsens the Caspian<br>
oil situation. <br>
<p>
The same is true of the Kurds. We too occupy a wrong kind of position. This<br>
lack of coordination between American and Russian policy affects American<br>
business in Russia and even more Russian business in America, lack of<br>
coordination of our activities in the Middle East, in the Caucasus and<br>
Central Asia. The reason is that new regions of the former USSR, the Caucasus<br>
and Central Asia are new to you. You have yet to study them. For Moscow, they<br>
are old and familiar. But the pattern is based on the former party structures<br>
because these regions are led by Shevardnadze, Aliyev, Petrosyan or Karimov.<br>
They are former Communists. So, we have not yet been able to put these<br>
regions in order to as to provide a good business environment that would<br>
favor Russia and America. <br>
<p>
Q: Good afternoon. I wonder if you could, please, let me know what your views<br>
are with regard to the current negotiations for the expansion of NATO toward<br>
the Russian borders and how far do you feel that the recent events in<br>
Byelorussia could perhaps assist Russia in NATO negotiations with regard to a<br>
possible buffer state toward the Eastern expansion? <br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: The expansion of NATO? I do not see a military rationale for the<br>
expansion of NATO. If it expands then the future aim is to attack Russia. So,<br>
why do business in Russia, all this will burn up, will be looted and taken<br>
away. If this is a political act we have the Organization for Security and<br>
Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe. I don't see why the NATO<br>
military organization should come into it to intervene in the relations<br>
between this region and Western Europe. <br>
<p>
Byelorussia, should it so wish, and Russia could become even closer and find<br>
a form of setting up a united state. There is no danger to anybody in this.<br>
This is one and the same people. One people. If Wales were to secede from<br>
Britain for a number of years and then wish to restore closer relations with<br>
London, would this raise eyebrows, generate any contradictions? Britain has<br>
been a single state for many centuries already. To withdraw and then join<br>
again -- there is nothing dangerous in this. <br>
<p>
A wrong parallel is sometimes drawn, that of France and Algeria. Algeria was<br>
a colony that was conquered by France. But Russians came from Byelorussia. It<br>
is not that Byelorussia will be joining Russia, it will be Russia that will<br>
be returning to Kievan Rus. It will be Russia that will be rejoining<br>
Byelorussia and Ukraine. They are simply parts of a single Slavic state.<br>
Kievan Rus, we began with Kiev. It was from there that the princes advanced<br>
to the East, came to Moscow, went to the North, went to Minsk. That was the<br>
development of one and the same state. <br>
<p>
Q: Thank you for coming here. I would like to ask the following question.<br>
Your appearance here today in the American Chamber of Commerce means that you<br>
attach much importance to relations and cooperation between our two<br>
countries. What areas, in your opinion, are most promising for the<br>
development of bilateral relations in terms of technology, commerce, in the<br>
intellectual area, that would be most beneficial for the Russian Federation?<br>
What political changes, do you think, are necessary for creating the<br>
necessary basis for such a development of relations? <br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: We are interested in such directions as roads, considering that<br>
the United States has achieved much in this area, we are interested in<br>
transport, especially in automobiles. In such areas as ship-building and the<br>
defense industry we could pool our efforts, we could even jointly appear on<br>
the world market. We could cooperate on the huge armaments market.<br>
Communications is a promising area. We have our own good chemical industry.<br>
We could have our own priorities here. We do not have a huge requirement in<br>
Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, MacDonalds, in hamburgers. Russia has its Russian<br>
equivalents. Russians are irritated by this. Our national drinks -- the<br>
Russian vodka used to be the best in the world. So, piling goods on us which<br>
we had a lot before, this is irritating. We need the good and the new things<br>
that Americans have. But this we are not getting in our market. And there are<br>
very many such examples. We could cooperate in fighting AIDS. We have some<br>
powerful virusologists and cardiologists. Our doctors and American doctors<br>
got together and so far, as far as the President is concerned, this has been<br>
a success. And if he dies the American doctor will be to blame. <br>
<p>
So there are many different areas in which we could cooperate. But we have to<br>
see that we are getting real American products. But we do not see that. <br>
<p>
Q: Could you indicate your attitude to the fact that Mr. Clinton has been<br>
reelected President of the US and to how he is forming his government, in<br>
particular, the new appointment of Secretary of State? Will it contribute to<br>
Russian-American relations, and business? <br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: Russia and America are similar, we have become more similar when<br>
it comes to elections. Whether it is Clinton or whether Clinton would have<br>
been elected doesn't make much difference. <br>
<p>
Look what happened when Clinton replaced George Bush.  Over here, Yeltsin has<br>
been reelected and nothing has changed. Although we need change more than you<br>
do. As to forming the team, the President himself decides. But you are<br>
different from us because you find new people and our President keeps<br>
shuffling the same old stack of cards. This is his mistake. He has brought<br>
back Chubais and Shakhrai to the Constitutional Court and Mityukov to the<br>
Security Council. So, it's the same group of people. There is no dynamism<br>
here. It's the same old communist style. They make appointments from their<br>
own midst, from amongst the people who are close to them. Yeltsin today is<br>
forming the team which will surround him at his death. In other words, he is<br>
concerned about himself, so that he could die in peace or in any case calmly<br>
retire in the year 2000 so that he shouldn't be kicked. Your presidents by<br>
contrast, are looking for specialists who may make mistakes, but they bring<br>
new blood, new dynamism. I like it more.<br>
 <br>
Q: I think for the people in this room probably two of the most important<br>
issues are the question of tax reform in the Russian Federation and also the<br>
question on the remaining laws which could bring into effect the regime for<br>
production sharing agreements in the oil and gas sector. What will be the<br>
position of the LDPR of the question of tax reform and specifically the draft<br>
tax code which has been submitted by the government to the Duma? And will you<br>
be supporting the law on amendments which is necessary to bring the<br>
production sharing regime into effect as well as the law lists of subsoil<br>
resources? <br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: As regards taxes, we stand for fewer taxes, there should be no<br>
confusion, these taxes should necessarily be collected and used according to<br>
the purpose. And they should stimulate trade and production, rather than<br>
stifle them. <br>
Here again, there is one political point. The government has to raise some<br>
funds through taxation, but it is incapable to collect them in a normal way,<br>
because there exist non-Russian regions which pay nothing or pay lower taxes.<br>
Here again politics are put over economics. And this is not convenient for<br>
you, because you never know how great your taxes will be, where, at what<br>
point they will be charged, and whether you will be able to draw the profit<br>
you projected.  The same holds true for the production-sharing law. There is<br>
also one point related to the nationalities issue. It concerns those regions<br>
of Russia which are predominantly populated by non-Russian peoples or which<br>
administratively are within regions which are a non- Russian part of Russia.<br>
For example, Yakutia, which occupies vast spaces, it's communists who did it,<br>
for Yakutia had never before occupied them. They just drew a line on the map,<br>
and now it turns out that Yakutia occupies half of Siberia and controls all<br>
diamonds of Russia. Yakutia has seen no development, for there is a need for<br>
investments, there is a need for an international airport, railway. But the<br>
Yakuts, in order to keep Russians away, do nothing of that. They derive<br>
enough money from diamond sales through De Beers, but their region does not<br>
develop. So, here again we run into the nationalities issue. <br>
<p>
Here again, the blame must be on your embassy which looks only at the YABLOKO<br>
faction and tries to use that faction as a vehicle to lobby for the adoption<br>
of the law. It has not approached us and this is the trouble. This is the<br>
reason why the bill has not yet been passed. So, you should assess the<br>
political forces correctly. I can speak in parliament in such a way that the<br>
law will be passed and in a way that it will not be passed. Although we only<br>
have 11 percent of the seats in the Duma we can sway the vote. Including on<br>
the issue of production sharing. It is because of our faction that the law<br>
has not yet been passed. And those who wanted it passed did not reach us for<br>
some reason. This is your fault. <br>
<p>
Q: At least one region where the Communists were not elected again was I<br>
believe in the Pskov region where a member of your parliamentary faction was<br>
elected governor. What new or different initiatives can we perhaps expect<br>
<i>&gt;from the Pskov region, for instance, to attract foreign investment? What is</i><br>
going to be different? <br>
<p>
Zhirinovsky: The Kremlin's inability to correctly assess the situation leads<br>
it to defeat in local elections. They hate me so much -- I myself tried to<br>
save their candidates in five regions in Russia. But they refused television<br>
time and so even in the five regions where I have tried to help, the<br>
Communist candidate won by a small margin. <br>
<p>
And on the example of Pskov Gubernia, or Pskov State, which may sound more<br>
familiar to you, you will see that the greatest opportunities will be created<br>
for any investors and security climate, there will be no racketeering by<br>
officials; all issues will be solved promptly and in an effective manner.<br>
This is what the Kremlin is afraid of. Had my governors carried the day in 40<br>
gubernias, the LDPR would score a final victory in 1999, and I would become<br>
the nation's president. <br>
<p>
So, by fighting me, they fight you. They don't want me to be a counterbalance<br>
to Yeltsin, so they will go out of their way to impede your business<br>
throughout the country in order to avert a growth in my party's influence.<br>
They would rather agree to a communist comeback, and the communists are<br>
indeed coming back. So, this is a case of putting personal interests above<br>
Russia's national interests. They would rather agree to a comeback of their<br>
fellow party members, for they all used to be members of that party. I am a<br>
stranger for them. It's like your coming to America to create a new<br>
civilization. Like you, I am founding a new civilization on the vast lands of<br>
former Russia or the former Soviet Union. In this respect I may be closer to<br>
you. And today's meeting may be useful in this respect, it might help you<br>
assess the line-up of political forces before you embassy and your Secretary<br>
of State do this and better than they do. We are going to see another<br>
election race in the Volga region, there we also stand chances for a victory.<br>
And unless you had thwarted us -- in December 1993 your Vice-President Gore<br>
launched a crusade against me, declaring me a fascist. And for three years<br>
America has been maintaining this campaign. And for the three years Russia<br>
has lived fearing communism or fascism, though otherwise we could have long<br>
worked in a calm manner. So, this has to do with the leadership of your<br>
country. And the LDPR would long have become a ruling political party and the<br>
presidential election in June could have followed a different course but for<br>
the subjective mistakes. <br>
<p>
So, just another example. In June, when your vice president came over here,<br>
he prevailed over Yeltsin to have a comeback with Chubais into the<br>
government, so Chubais became the chief of staff. That was your doing.<br>
Chubais is hated throughout this country, he is hated by all. It is something<br>
that happens sometimes. This is psychological incompatibility. If you want to<br>
have a pro-American person somewhere high up, there is nothing wrong with<br>
that, but you should have chosen someone else. And Chubais should have been<br>
moved somewhere where he is not seen, because he is so much hated. This is<br>
something that is happening and that is working against your interests,<br>
against creating the appropriate climate for American business and investment<br>
in this country. <br>
<p>

cup of coffee before he leaves. Please join me in thanking him very much for<br>

<p>
Diamonds belonging to Russia are to be returned by Armenia in December this<br>
year, and gold and silver by the Republic of Kazakhstan in January 1997,<br>
Russia's minister for cooperation with CIS countries, Aman Tuleyev, said in<br>
an interview with ITAR-TASS. <br>
<p>
Two years ago the Russian state conglomerate Almazyuvelirexport [diamond<br>
jewellery export] dispatched rough diamonds to Armenia for cutting, but the<br>
cut diamonds - worth 6.5m dollars - produced from these by the Sapphire<br>
factory, have yet to reach Russia.   Moreover, almost a year has passed since<br>
a Siberian factory sent a consignment of complex ores to Chimkent plating<br>
works in Kazakhstan for processing. The ores yielded 380 kg of gold and 3.5 t<br>
of silver, which have also not been returned to Russia... <br>
<p>
We are not able to give such expensive presents at a time when strikes are<br>
taking place everywhere because of wage and pensions arrears. "We have an<br>
obligation to follow things through," the minister added. <br>

HEADLINE: Nobel laureates call for solution to East Timor conflict <br>
SOURCE:  Agence France, December 9, 1996<br>
<p>
The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureates on Monday reiterated appeals -- in<br>
separate press conferences -- for a solution to the conflict in East Timor on<br>
the eve of the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo. <br>
<p>
Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, bishop of the East Timor capital Dili, and Jose<br>
Ramos-Horta, spokesman in exile of the East Timorese resistance, held<br>
separate press conferences instead of a planned joint conference, following<br>
"obvious" pressure on Belo from Jakarta, according to Ramos-Horta. <br>
<p>
Jakarta has told Belo to limit his public appearances with Ramos-Horta, the<br>
latter said. <br>
<p>
The Norwegian Nobel Committee complied with the laureates' wishes, judging it<br>
wiser to hold two separate press conferences. <br>
<p>
"The two laureates are working for the same cause. They are on good personal<br>
terms, but Mr. Belo is a religious spiritual leader and Mr.  Ramos-Horta is a<br>
political leader," said the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Geir<br>
Lundestad. <br>
<p>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony until 1975, when Indonesian forces<br>
occupied the territory. The United Nations has never recognised Indonesia's<br>
annexation of East Timor in 1976. <br>
<p>
At his press conference, Belo refused to discuss his political beliefs,<br>
instead limiting himself to his role as spiritual leader. <br>
<p>
He stressed that he "recognised the efforts of the Indonesian government to<br>
develop East Timor" and the efforts of "many other friendly countries," and<br>
underlined that he was prepared to cooperate at "national and international"<br>
levels to find a "fair, peaceful and dignified" solution to the conflict. <br>
<p>
"But these efforts cannot be appreciated when they are not carried out with<br>
the responsible participation of the local people," the bishop said, calling<br>
for "a free and sincere dialogue" to overcome "the cultural barriers and<br>
psychological incomprehension" which are "the results of the past." <br>
<p>
Belo stressed that he had full freedom to travel and confirmed that he would<br>
visit Stockholm, Bonn and the Vatican as planned after the awards ceremony in<br>
Oslo. <br>
<p>
"I came here freely and I will return freely," he said, adding that "it is<br>
not totally correct" that he is under pressure from Jakarta. <br>
<p>
Ramos-Horta took a more political stance, criticising the Indonesian regime<br>
as well as western governments and reiterating his appeal for "a dialogue<br>
without preceding conditions to be opened within the framework of the United<br>
Nations." <br>
<p>
But any solution must "take into account the East Timorese people's right to<br>
self-determination," he added. <br>
<p>
Ramos-Horta said he was "prepared to be flexible, creative" and "to move step<br>
by step to find a solution to enable Indonesia to disengage gradually" from<br>
East Timor, so that Indonesia can "save face." <br>
<p>
Such a solution would include close cooperation with Indonesia across all<br>
existing regional organisations, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic<br>
Cooperation (APEC) forum, he said. <br>
<p>
The activist noted that the conflict, which has claimed the lives of some<br>
200,000 people, had been "largely ignored" by the international community,<br>
governments and non-governmental organisations, and compared it to "the<br>
Jewish and Armenian holocausts." <br>
<p>
Ramos-Horta was confident that the Nobel prize would "in the long run,<br>
perhaps even within two to three months, bring a change in the perception and<br>
attitude" of the Indonesian government. <br>

<p>
The Armenian Finance Ministry and the Central Bank have announced the issue<br>
of state coupon bonds. <br>
<p>
According to Ashot Salnazaryan, head of the Securities Market Department at<br>
the Finance Ministry, the funds raised from the issue should help the country<br>
cover its budget deficit and repay its external debt.   Through bond issues,<br>
the government hopes to draw in 500m drams from the population before the end<br>
of 1997. Bonds will be issued for terms of 3, 6 and 12 months and will be<br>
sold at 10,000 drams per share without any restrictions. Yields on the bonds<br>
are exempt from taxation and will be paid once a quarter at 50 to 55% annual<br>
interest rate. <br>
<p>
Both legal entities and individuals, residents and non-residents are entitled<br>
to acquire the bonds. The total issue will be placed as bearer bonds. No<br>
refund is envisaged in the event of the bonds being either lost or damaged. <br>

HEADLINE:  Russia Urges Armenia, Azerbaijan to Compromise on Karabakh <br>
SOURCE:  ITAR-TASS, December 9, 1996<br>
 <br>
"Russia is interested in stabilising the situation and resolving the problem<br>
of Nagorno-Karabakh on the basis of a compromise," Russian Foreign Minister<br>
Yevgeny Primakov said after talks with his Armenian counterpart Alexander<br>
Arzumanyan on Monday. <br>
<p>
"A solution should be found on the basis of recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's<br>
right to self-determination and self- government,while preserving the<br>
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.  Such a right can be laid down in a<br>
corresponding agreement," Primakov said. <br>
<p>
He also noted that further consultations on these issues should be<br>
accompanied by contacts with Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
<p>
The Russian and Armenian ministers reached understanding on all economic and<br>
political issues they discussed and agreed to invigorate consultations<br>
between the foreign ministries of the two countries anddevelop fraternal and<br>
friendly relations between Russia and Armenia. <br>
<p>
At the same time, the ministers gave differing assessments of the<br>
parliamentary elections in Nagorno-Karabakh held in November 1996. <br>
<p>
"The Russian side was against them because it believed that they should not<br>
be held before a mechanism for resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis is<br>
worked out," Primakov said. <br>
<p>
However, Arzumanyan noted that Armenia does not consider the polls as an<br>
"extraordinary event going beyond the logic of the negotiating process. " <br>
<p>
He recalled a decision reached within the framework of the OSCE Minsk group<br>
that the talks would involve Armenia, Azerbaijan and elected leaders of<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
<p>
"Therefore, elections do not break the harmony of the negotiating process and<br>
go in line with its spirit and principles," he added. <br>
<p>
On Russian troops in Armenia, Primakov said a corresponding document has<br>
already been considered by State Duma committees and been submitted to the<br>
parliament for ratification. <br>
<p>
Russia has also asked the Armenian parliament to accelerate thepassage of a<br>
similar document and received assurances from Armenian lawmakers that they<br>
are doing their best to synchronise the adoption of the document with their<br>
Russian counterparts. <br>
<p>
Speaking of oil production in the Caspian Sea, Primakov recalled that Russia,<br>
being one of the major oil exporters in the world, does not participate in<br>
the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which determines quotas<br>
for member countries. <br>
<p>
"At the same time, the expansion of oil production in the Caspian Sea creates<br>
a new situation which none of us can ignore," he said. <br>
<p>
This is Arzumanyan's first visit to Moscow since his appointment in November<br>
1996. <br>
<p>
Arzumanyan said he was pleased that he paid one of this first foreign visits<br>
to Russia which has "an exclusive place in Armenia's foreign policy. " <br>

HEADLINE: Azerbaijan's Answer To Armenia's Call <br>
SOURCE: Moskovsky Komsomolets (Russian Press Digest), December 7, 1996<br>
(Marina Vartanyan)<br>
<p>
Azerbaijan responds with heavy gunfire to Armenia's decision on presence of<br>
Russian troops on Armenian soil. <br>
<p>
A few days ago, Armenia's Constitutional Court ruled that the presence of<br>
Russia's military base and troops in Armenia was fully in line with the<br>
republic's Constitution. Baku responded to this with a massive shelling of<br>
Armenian territory, Moskovsky Komsomolets reports. <br>
<p>
On the day the relevant decision of the Armenian Constitutional Court came<br>
into force, Azeri artillery delivered heavy fire on three Armenian districts<br>
situated on the Armenian-Azeri border. In fact, there is nothing new in the<br>
shelling of Armenian soil -- this happens every day. "Normally," Azeri guns<br>
concentrate fire on an individual district or village, therefore the shelling<br>
of three targets at once was "very unusual," the paper notes. <br>
<p>
Turkey has increased its military capability seven-fold over the past three<br>
years, exclusively at the expense of and from the arsenals of NATO. The plans<br>
of NATO's eastward expansion include the scenario of approaching Russia's<br>
borders also from the southern direction, that is, by moving the idea of a<br>
"Greater Turan" -- Azerbaijan, Abkhazia, Chechnya and the like, farther and<br>
farther to the north-west and east.  Specifically, the objective is to oust<br>
Russia higher and higher to the North Pole by using the territory of these<br>
countries as a bridgehead. <br>
<p>
Perhaps it was for this reason that Russia's border guards chief, General<br>
Andrei Nikolayev, arrived in Yerevan with a fact-finding visit right after<br>
the Armenian Constitutional Court had made its decision on Russia's military<br>
base and the presence of Russian troops in Armenia, Moskovsky Komsomolets<br>
speculates. <br>

    YEREVAN (Reuter) - Armenia's Supreme Court on Tuesday<br>
sentenced three members of the outlawed Dashnaktsitun political<br>
party to death on terrorism charges.<br>
     Judge Eduard Manukyan said Armen Mndjoyan, Arsen Arsrune and<br>
Armen Grigoryan would be put to death for terrorist activities,<br>
drugs trafficking, and arms dealing.<br>
     Lawyers for the condemned immediately said they planned to<br>
appeal. Eight other members of the nationalist party got<br>
sentences of three to 15 years in prison.<br>
     Dashnaktsitun was outlawed in 1994 by President Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosyan who said its members were plotting terrorist acts<br>
and wanted to overthrow the government.<br>
     But Dashnaktsitun maintained it was the victim of a witchunt<br>
to crack down on dissent in the small Caucasus state of three<br>
and a half million.<br>
     Ter-Petrosyan closed several opposition parties earlier this<br>
year and sent tanks into the streets after he won a<br>
controversial second term in office. International observers<br>
said the vote was marred by major violations.<br>

        AZERI OPPOSITION DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE<br>
OSCE LISBON SUMMIT<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The results of the OSCE Lisbon Summit have created a wave of<br>
 dissatisfaction in Azerbaijan. It is stated in the statement of the<br>
 Popular Front (opposition party in Azerbaijan) that the Summit has<br>
 demonstrated the incompetence of the Azeri diplomacy.<br>
 According to the Popular Front, the OSCE is indifferent to the<br>
 internationally acknowledged principle of preservation of territorial<br>
 integrity.<br>
 "The hesitation of the Azeri government resulted in Azerbaijan's<br>
 backing up before pressure, and the aggressor kept its position to<br>
 the end,"- says the statement.<br>
 "In the conditions of corruption and protectionism, limitation of the<br>
 human rights and democratic norms, the foreign politics of a country<br>
 can not be successful," concluded the statement.<br>

        ARMENIA MAY BECOME A MEMBER OF THE WORLD TRADE<br>
ORGANIZATION<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 It is very likely that next year Armenia will become a full member of<br>

 countries.<br>
 However, according to the Deputy Minister of Economy of the Republic<br>
 of Armenia Vardan Movsissian, this membership is a necessary, but not<br>
 sufficient condition for entering the international market.<br>
 According to Mr. Movsissian, it is necessary to strengthen the<br>
 industry and raise the quality of production to international<br>
 standards before Armenia can enter international trade.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 237, Part I, 10 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
CHECHEN LEADERSHIP SPLIT OVER ELECTIONS? The chairman of Chechnya's
Central Electoral Commission, Mumadi Saidaev, told ITAR-TASS on 9
December that the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for
27 January might have to be postponed unless all Russian troops are
withdrawn from Chechen territory by that date. Also on 9 December,
Chechen parliament speaker Amin Osmaev said in Grozny that it free and
fair elections are impossible in Chechnya at the moment. Osmaev
characterized the present Chechen coalition government as "a coalition
of separatist field commanders who will manipulate elections to support
their policy of secession from Russia," and claimed that the majority of
the Chechen population is against secession and "does not have the
slightest idea of what sovereignty is and where it can lead Chechnya."
Speaking at a press conference in Moscow on 9 December, Aleksandr
Kazakov, deputy head of the Russian presidential administration, said
that the elections could be postponed "without detriment to the Chechen
people," ITAR-TASS reported. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS VICTORY IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS . . . The
presidential administration continued to explain away its losses in the
gubernatorial elections, following the defeat of several more incumbents
on 8 December. First Deputy Chief of Staff Aleksandr Kazakov said that
only newly-elected Bryansk Governor Yurii Lodkin was an actual
representative of the opposition, while the other five elected governors
are "normal, sensible people with solid managerial experience." He
claimed that there has always been some dissatisfaction with the federal
government but that more "emotion" might be added to the relationship
now. Izvestiya claimed that the score is now 22-8 in favor of the
administration since 1 September. All-Russia Coordinating Council leader
Sergei Filatov blamed the administration losses on the poor economic
conditions. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
. . . AND SO DOES OPPOSITION. The pro-Communist Sovetskaya Rossiya on 10
December scoffed at Kazakov's claims, asking why the administration
changes its attitude toward the opposition candidates as soon as they
are elected. According to the paper's (incomplete) count, the score is
14-13 in favor of the opposition. Spiritual Heritage leader Aleksei
Podberezkin claimed that the elections would change the face of the
Federation Council. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
INGUSH GOVERNMENT SACKED. Ingush President Ruslan Aushev dismissed his
government on 9 December for bad economic management, ORT and Russian TV
(RTR) reported. Additionally, Aushev claims to have information that
several government members were involved in corruption, according to
RTR. Valerii Fateev, the first deputy prime minister of Ingushetiya and
former executive head of Smolensk Oblast, is reportedly behind the
dismissal and is said to be the most probable candidate to head the new
government, according to Segodnya on 10 December. The health, education,
justice, and interior ministers are likely to retain their positions in
the new government. -- Anna Paretskaya in Moscow
<p>
RUTSKOI LOWERS BREAD PRICES IN KURSK. Bread prices in Kursk Oblast are
now among the lowest in Russia after Governor Aleksandr Rutskoi brought
down prices by about 70-100 rubles per loaf, RIA-Novosti and NTV
reported on 9 December. A loaf of bread in Kursk will now cost between
1,500 and 1,800 rubles ($0.27 to $0.33); the national average is 3,222
rubles. A representative of the gubernatorial administration said
bakeries had reduced their own production costs and some trade
surcharges were lowered by 5%, making the oblast-wide price decrease
possible. Bread prices in Kursk may be reduced further after 1 January
1997 if certain prerequisites are met, including decreased electricity
tariffs and lower transportation costs for flour and bread. After his
election in October, Rutskoi pledged to implement a social and economic
program to improve living conditions in the oblast. -- Laura Belin
<p>
MUSLIM UNION OF RUSSIA SEEKS BETTER RELATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES. The
congress of the Muslim Union of Russia which concluded on 7 December
called for an improvement in Muslim relations with the authorities and
countering increasingly anti-Muslim feeling in Russian society,
Kommersant-Daily reported on 10 December. The congress voted to seek
greater unity among Russia's estimated 20 million Muslims. It will also
seek state support for increasing public broadcasting about Islam and
including mullahs in the military along with Orthodox priests. The
Muslim Union has one deputy in the State Duma, Nadyrshakh Khachilaev. --
Robert Orttung
<p>
NATO FOREIGN MINISTERS REASSURE MOSCOW. U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, in Brussels for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers on 10
December, said that "NATO has no intention, no plan, and no need to
station nuclear weapons on the territory of any new members," Reuters
reported. In an 8 December interview with Welt am Sonntag, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that to reassure Russia, NATO should
propose creating a 17- member security consultative committee, on which
Russia would sit as an equal with the 16 NATO members. It remains
unclear exactly what powers the council would have, and whether Moscow
would have a veto over certain issues. Kommersant-daily on 7 December
criticized Russian Foreign Ministry officials for thus far rejecting
such proposals as insufficient, arguing that they might be Moscow's last
chance to bargain seriously over the enlargement issue. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
SOLANA: "RUSSIA IS A PARTNER, NOT A THREAT TO US." That was the title of
an interview with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana that ran in the
government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta on 10 December. Solana said that
since 1991, "Russia has always been regarded by us as a partner rather
than a threat," and stressed the importance of developing "global
frameworks for relations between NATO and Russia in parallel" to NATO's
"external adaptation," by which he meant the admission of new members.
The accompanying newspaper commentary complained that Solana "avoided
answering the question" of what concrete measures would be taken to
allay Russia's concerns over NATO expansion. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
MORE REACTIONS TO ALBRIGHT APPOINTMENT. Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma
Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the new nominee for U.S. secretary
of state, Madeleine Albright, will be "an active and energetic
supporter" of NATO expansion and will strengthen U.S. ties with Ukraine
and Azerbaijan, ITAR-TASS reported on 9 December. Lukin, a former
Russian ambassador to Washington, conceded that Albright is an
"energetic and persistent diplomat," while Pravda-5 on 7 December dubbed
her the "Steel Lady," a successor to "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher. --

TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS FOR COMPROMISE ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH.
Yevgenii Primakov said after a meeting in Moscow with his Armenian
counterpart, Aleksandr Arzumanyan, that Russia is interested in a
peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, ITAR-TASS reported
on 9 December. He added that a compromise solution should recognize
"Nagorno-Karabakh's right to self-determination and self-government
while preserving Azerbaijan's territorial integrity." Addressing the 24
November presidential election in the disputed enclave, Primakov
reiterated the official Russian position that such votes should not be
held until "a mechanism for settling the conflict is worked out," while
Arzumanyan said the election did not hamper the peace process. The two
ministers pledged to "develop fraternal and friendly relations," ITAR-
TASS reported. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
THREE ABKHAZ SOLDIERS KILLED. Three Abkhaz troops were killed and two
wounded on 8 December when their vehicles were fired on near the border
between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia, ITAR-TASS reported on 9
December, quoting Abkhaz security chief Astamur Tarba. Tarba blamed the
attack on the Georgian security services. Georgia has denied the
charges. In a 2 December letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros
Ghali, Abkhaz Foreign Minister Konstantin Ozgan accused the UN of "a
one-sided approach" to resolving the Abkhaz conflict and the Georgian
leadership of "subversion and terror," according to Iprinda on 3
December. Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka met with Abkhaz
presidential representative Anri Djergenia recently and proposed that
Abkhazia be incorporated into the Russian-Belarus sphere of integration,
Pravda-5 reported on 10 December. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER ARRIVES IN KUNDUZ. United Tajik Opposition
leader Said Abdullo Nuri flew to Kunduz on 9 December, arriving one day
late for a scheduled meeting with Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov,
international press reported. Details on Nuri's delay are conflicting,
with some reports claiming that Taliban aircraft forced the plane down
at Shindan then transferred it to Kandahar, while others claiming that
the plane had technical difficulties and requested a landing for
repairs. One thing is certain, Nuri did meet with Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
KAZAKSTANI PRESIDENT IN INDIA. Nursultan Nazarbayev arrived in New Delhi
on 9 December to discuss bilateral relations and the situation in
Afghanistan with his Indian counterpart, Shankar Dayal Sharma, Russian
and Western agencies reported. Nazarbayev said he is seeking "the
speediest resolution" to the Afghan conflict and welcomed "the active
and constructive role played by India." Agreements on import taxes,
investment protection, and cultural relations were signed and
cooperation in non-military nuclear research was discussed. -- Bruce

UKRAINIAN METROPOLITAN CALLS FOR UNITY OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. The
leader of the independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan
Filaret, called for unification of the country's splintered Orthodox
church, RFE/RL reported on 9 December. Filaret said a united Orthodox
church must be created in Ukraine to mark the anniversary of Christ's
birth in 2000. He also announced plans to meet for the first time with
the leader of Ukraine's Russian-based church, Patriarch Volodymyr
Sabodan. The Independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church was formed in 1992,
after Filaret broke away from the Russian Orthodox Church, which has
been traditionally dominant in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church
enjoyed the support of Ukrainian nationalists and former President
Leonid Kravchuk. About 35 million of Ukraine's 52 million people are
estimated to be Orthodox. -- Oleg Varfolomeyev
<p>
UKRAINE DENIES SELLING ARMS TO LIBYA. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yurii
Serheyev denied there was any truth to a 9 December Washington Times
story that accused Ukraine of selling SS-21 SCUD-B missiles to Libya,
AFP reported. The story claimed to be based on a top-secret CIA
document, and outlined two deals: a $510 million shipment of SS-21
missiles; and a second deal for providing maintenance and parts for
Libyan submarines and other vessels. Serheyev said the charges were an
effort to discredit Ukraine in front of the U.S. and internationally.
Another deputy foreign minister, Kostyantyn Hrishchenko, described the
report as "madness." He added that the newspaper had published similar
reports on the eve of important disarmament and arms control
conferences. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
BELARUSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER DETAINED. One of the main organizers of the
unauthorized rally on 8 December in Minsk, Social Democrat leader
Nikalai Statkevich, was arrested with 10 people, NTV reported on 9
December. The detainees are still being kept at a police station and it
is not clear when they may be released, as the court session to consider
their case has been postponed for a few days. It is suspected that
Statkevich's arrest was politically motivated, since, under Belarusian
law, the maximum punishment for disturbing public order in the city is a
fine. Meanwhile, protests against the recent referendum's results are to
continue today in the Belarusian capital. -- Sergei Solodovnikov
<p>
SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE
<p>
SERBIAN OPPOSITION VOWS BOYCOTT. Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic
Party (DS) and one of the leaders of the opposition Zajedno coalition,
told Radio B92 on 9 December that Zajedno will boycott the opening
session of the federal parliament, slated for today. This is the latest
opposition move to pressure the regime of Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to recognize the opposition victories in the 17 November
runoff municipal elections. For his part, Djindjic did not rule out the
possibility of negotiating an end to the mass political protests, but
added that Milosevic would have to acknowledge the opposition victories
as a precondition to any talks. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
DEMONSTRATIONS CONTINUE IN SERBIA. In the streets of Serbia's major
urban centers, mass demonstrations against Milosevic and demands for a
recognition of opposition victories in municipal balloting continue
unabated. Rallies in Belgrade are entering a fourth week. On 9 December,
demonstrators in the capital also vented against the arrests and
beatings of peaceful protesters. Dejan Bulatovic, a student demonstrator
aged 21, who on 6 December carried an effigy of Milosevic dressed in a
prison uniform, was reportedly beaten and tortured following his arrest.
He has been unable to see a lawyer. Meanwhile, international reports
also note that industrial workers, known for their opposition to
Milosevic, have not formally sided with the opposition in great numbers.

BRCKO ARBITRATION POSTPONED. Internationally mediated binding
arbitration to decide the fate of the strategic north Bosnian town of
Brcko, scheduled for 14 December, has been postponed for two months.
Carl Bildt's office announced on 9 December that the Serb side had
requested the delay and that the Muslims agreed to it, Oslobodjenje
noted, but the exact circumstances remain unclear. Brcko lies astride
the narrow supply corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the
Republika Srpska, and the future of this area was the only territorial
issue not settled in the Dayton agreement just over a year ago. On 1
December the Serbs announced they were leaving the talks because the
American mediator had made decisions without consulting them. The
following day the U.S. State Department said that the talks will go
ahead with or without the Serbs. -- Patrick Moore

	Proposal for funding of Noyan Tapan Acquisition.<br>
<p>
Dear Groong and Hayastan readers,<br>
<p>
We've been in touch with Noyan Tapan (NT) to acquire their news on a daily<br>
basis for Groong. As you may already know, NT is based in Armenia and<br>
sells its news service for a fee.<br>
<p>
NT came forward voluntarily during September's elections in Armenia and<br>
informed us with up-to-the-minute news and events for altruistic reasons.<br>
We appreciated their work; we think that their news service is very<br>
informative and timely, and we'd like to read more of it, and regularly.<br>
<p>
Noyan Tapan has requested a fee of $250/month for a specially prepared<br>
"Groong Edition" daily bulletin, and has sent us many days' worth of<br>
samples. I'm attaching one day's worth below for your perusal and<br>
judgement. I feel the fee is reasonable and well worth it.<br>
<p>
In addition to improving our quality of news here on Groong, and being<br>
better informed on Armenia and the Caucasus region in general, our<br>
subscription to Noyan Tapan will be an explicit statement of support<br>
and approval for free and independent media in Armenia.<br>
<p>
As the daily readers of Groong News, there's only you to turn to, to fund<br>
such a project. Therefore I'm asking all interested parties to come<br>
forward with any amount of donation to fund the next 12 months' worth of<br>
Noyan Tapan reception on Groong.<br>
<p>
We need to raise $3000 for this. Groong has 1100 members and Hayastan<br>
has 350. If 100 members come forward with $30 each, we're there! If<br>
more members come forward, then we will arrange to receive as many<br>
more months of daily Noyan Tapan as we have money for.  And if we<br>
don't come up with the required funds, then I will assume that we're<br>
not interested in receiving Noyan Tapan daily.<br>
<p>
I ask that you send me email, with your pledge amount, which I will<br>
tally. The deadline for this initial drive is December 25. If we're<br>
well on the way, I'll extend the deadline a bit and continue reminding<br>
very often, as I feel that this is a very worthy service and would<br>
enhance our news from Armenia greatly.  I will of course update the<br>
list very regularly of our progress. In fact, I can tell you that we<br>
already have $260 from just 4 Groong readers!<br>
<p>
My goal at the moment is to receive NT news daily for all of 1997.<br>
<p>
Send no money now. Once final amounts are tallied, I'll inform the lists<br>
where to send checks and who to write it out to. As far as trusting that<br>
your (our) funds will be well used, I assure you that every penny will<br>
be spent on this project, and there will be not a penny of administrative<br>
overheard (I'll deal with that).<br>
<p>
I hope to hear from you very soon. Please help if you can.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Asbed<br>

CC RESOLUTION REGARDING ELECTION RESULTS ADOPTED BY<br>
MAJORITY OF VOTES<br>
     YEREVAN, November  26   (Noyan  Tapan). "This was the first<br>
attempt  to  raise a  dispute   between  the  opposition and the<br>
authorities  onto  a   civilized   level,"   Chairman   of   the<br>
Constitutional Court (CC) of Armenia Gagik Haroutiunian  said at<br>
a Monday news conference.<br>
     Haroutiunian said that the Constitutional Court had  chosen<br>
the right way -- a search for a final decision  through thorough<br>
scritiny and analysis of all available documents.<br>
     Haroutiunian  reported  that the  Constitutional Court  had<br>
charged  lawenforcement    agencies   to   institute    criminal<br>
proceedings in connection with a number of violations and  carry<br>
out a probe into those cases. Haroutiunian was  astonished  over<br>
the fact   that  a  person who  had   stolen a ballot box from a<br>
polling station was sentenced to 10  days  in  jail.  Meanwhile,<br>
according to him, that was a serious crime.<br>
     CC Chairman said that the law on the  Constitutional  Court<br>
of the Republic  of Armenia bans publicising the results of  the<br>
discussions.  He only said  that  the resolution  was adopted by<br>
the majority of votes. Constitutional Court  Chairman noted that<br>
under  the  legislation in  effect, protocols of closed  meeting<br>
were immediately sealed and sent to  state  archives.  "Pethaps,<br>
in some years they will be accessible,  and everybody will  have<br>
an opportunity to know what had happened," he said.<br>
     Haroutiunian said  it   was  not right   to  form electoral<br>
commission by   party  representation principle, since, he said,<br>
the commissions should be made up  of professionals, whose  work<br>
must be supervised.<br>
     Haroutiunian highly appreciated a worthy  behavior  of  the<br>
aggrieved party representatives at  the Court.  He  said that it<br>
thanks to  them  that  the  proceedings  were held  on  a really<br>
civilized level. "Our  country  needs opposition as we have  the<br>
Parliament,  Government   and   the  Constitutional  Court,"  CC<br>
Chairman said.<br>
<p>
<p>
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN KARABAKH AROUSED AZERBAIJAN'S<br>
ANGER<br>
     YEREVAN,  November 26   (Noyan Tapan).  The   November   24<br>
presidential election  in  the   Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  were<br>
held, despite statements from  a  number of countries that  they<br>
will not recognize the election results.<br>
     On the   same  day   rallies,   protesting   the   Karabakh<br>
presidential   election  were    staged   in  Azerbaijan.    The<br>
Instanbul-based  Armenian  "Marmara"  daily  reports  that Azeri<br>
Culture Minister Polad Bul-Bul ogly said, addressing  a rally in<br>
Baku,  that  the  elections  in Karabakh  were   nothing but  "a<br>
politcal irritator". He said that  Azerbaijan  was  against  any<br>
bloodshed, but,  if   necessary, they were ready  to  shed their<br>
blood to liberate the occupied Azeri territories.<br>

<p>
ECONOMIC REVIEW (NOVEMBER 17-24)<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).<br>
<p>
     NATIONAL CURRENCY<br>
     Dollar rate did not practically  change for the  week.  The<br>
average cost of 1 USD decreased by 1 point and was equal to  434<br>
drams during   the week.  At   the  same  time, the  margin (the<br>
difference between sale and purchase prices) is still very  low.<br>
Maximal sale  price   (433 drams against 1  dollar) dropped by 2<br>
points, and minimal purchase price (436  drams) decreased by the<br>
same two points.<br>
     In principle, the  margin size is to  a certain  extent  an<br>
indicator of the health of the national currency. The higher  is<br>
the margin, the more alarming is  the  condition  of  the  given<br>
currency, and vice versa. In our case, drop of the  margin  from<br>
10 drams (2.5%  of the  dollar)  in  early November to  3  drams<br>
(0.7%)  is a sign  of  healthening,  though  its causes are  not<br>
clear.  The Government  did   not take  any efficient  steps  to<br>
protect dram from devaluation , and did  not even  make a formal<br>
statement on it. The Central Bank did only  one  thing:  for the<br>
first time during  two months it  took part  in  tradings at the<br>
Yerevan and Giumri Stock Exchange and purchased a rather  modest<br>
sum of 200,000 dollars.<br>
     But this   circumstance  could  never able  to  relax   the<br>
tension on currency market. Here, we  have  probably  the result<br>
of other factors: restraint from  emission, the  fact  that  the<br>
government used only those sums that are  in circulation, delays<br>
in pension and salary payments, and hence,  low consumer  demand<br>
and  relatively  stable consumer prices.  Anyway,  it should  be<br>
noted that it is not only the dollar rate that  affects consumer<br>
prices, but  also consumer  prices cause changes  in the  dollar<br>
rate.<br>
     Exchange  rate  at the Moscow  Interbank Currency  Exchange<br>
was 5,489 ruble on November 22.<br>
<p>
     CONSUMER BUDGET<br>
     By  the end   of  the  week the  cost  of   the living wage<br>
consumer budget   was  12,900  drams (29.6 dollars). The cost of<br>
the overalkl budget constituted 19,800 drams (45.5 dollars).<br>
     So, the cost of the consumer budget dropped by  200  drams,<br>
and 0.5 dollars.<br>
<p>
     CONSUMER PRICES<br>
     NT-16  index calculated   of  16 staple   food products was<br>
equal  to 1,000,  i.e.  general level of consumer prices  had no<br>
relation to changes in dollar rate and remained unchanged.<br>
<p>
     INVESTMENT ACTIVITY<br>
     Following the "Hrant"  index,  the investment  activity was<br>
9.55 during the week.<br>
<p>
     TREASURY BILLS MARKET<br>
     "Sed  Marced"  index of   profitability of   treasury bills<br>
constituted 0.3996, which is  456 points  lower  if  compared to<br>
the previous   week. The profitability  was 39.96%. According to<br>
President of   the Sed   Marced Firm  Tigran  Jerbashian,   such<br>
decrease  is  conditioned by  the fact that  2,000,000,000-worth<br>
treasury  bills were   used  up by  foreign  investors  two week<br>
before.<br>
<p>
<p>
            ------------- KARABAKH NEWS -----------<br>
<p>
<p>
KARABAKH DISAPPOINTED WITH HELSINKI NEGOTIATIONS, FM SAYS<br>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).  "We  are  disappointed<br>
with the results of this round of negotiations  on  the Karabakh<br>
conflict", Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady  Ghoukassian said at<br>
a Nov. 26 news conference.<br>
     He  noted that results  of  a  half-and-a-year  work of the<br>
OSCE  Minsk  group  and  principles  of  the conflict settlement<br>
worked out by the Armenian party were left out  of  the  account<br>
at  the   Helsinki    negotiations.   Ghoukassian  said    that,<br>
unfortunately, at the last moment  representatives of Azerbaijan<br>
refused  to participate  in   the work,   insisting   that   the<br>
negotiations  must be  held from the initial position,  i.e. the<br>
principle of territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.<br>
     Ghoukassian  said  that  the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic did<br>
not consider   itself to  be   a  part  of Azerbaijan,   and any<br>
decision must proceed from this position.  "We  are  against any<br>
attempts to   predetermine the  results   of  the  negotiations.<br>
Respecting the  territorial  integrity,   Karabakh is  ready  to<br>
discuss this issue only after both  contending sides  hold equal<br>
initial positions at the  negotiations  and the Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
Republic  is  viewed as   a subject  of the  international law,"<br>
Karabakh's FM said. He described  statements by  the Azeri  side<br>
as statements of the  lost party which  demands  capitulation of<br>
its enemy. "If Azerbaijan really viewed Nagorno Karabakh  as its<br>
integral part, it would have  decided this  problem  by  itself,<br>
without turning to international organizations," he noted.<br>
     According to Ghoukassian, Azerbaijan intends  to kick up  a<br>
row at   the  forthcoming  OSCE summit   in Lisbon.  He   voiced<br>
confidence  that if  Azerbaijan  insists  that  the  territorial<br>
integrity be a basic principle of the  conflict settlement, then<br>
Armenia will have to use its right to veto.<br>
     He stressed  that  the  issue of  territorial  integirty is<br>
directly connected with the problem of  Karabakh's  status. "The<br>
fact  that the  Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic  is   independent  is<br>
obvious  and the status of  Karabakh  must be  a  result  of the<br>
negotiations,  and not   a starting   point  for   the  latter,"<br>
Ghoukassian said.<br>
     He emphasized   that  the presidential  election in Nagorno<br>
Karabakh proved that the Karabakh people trusts its leadership.<br>
     Ghoukassian said that the internal political  situation  in<br>
Armenia had played a certain part in toughening of  position  of<br>
Azerbaijan. However, he voiced confidence that  this  would  not<br>
influence the positions of Karabakh and Armenia.<br>
<p>
CONFLICTING SIDES FAIL TO AGREE A COMMON DOCUMENT<br>
     YEREVAN, November  26  (Noyan   Tapan).  No document  to be<br>
submitted at   the forthcoming OSCE summit in  Lisbon  has  been<br>
adopted  at a recent  round of talks  over the Karabakh conflict<br>
held in Helsinki. The positions of the parties  to  the conflict<br>
remained unchanged,   President elect   of the  Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
Republic Robert   Kocharian  said   at  a  news   conference  in<br>
Stepanakert. He noted that no document had  been  adopted during<br>
Libaridian-Guluzade meeting as well.<br>
     Kocharian noted that there  is  still a  chance to  agree a<br>
common  document  in  Vienna, a   document,  which  will then be<br>
presented at   the  Lisbon summit.  But   he was skeptical about<br>
that. He  said Azerbaijan  would stick  to its  position  as  it<br>
hoped to   submit  its  own  document at   the   Lisbon  summit.<br>
According to   Kocharian, the   Azeri side   will be pushing for<br>
territorial integirty of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan counts  that the<br>
document will be supported by all countries-participants of  the<br>
cummit, and if Armenia  uses its rights to  veto  and  does  not<br>
vote for  that  document, it will have  to  confront with  other<br>
OSCE-member  countries.  Azerbaijan   believes  that  this  will<br>
seriously affect Armenia's international image.<br>
     "This is the major  position on  which  Azerbaijan  stakes.<br>
Taking  this    position  Azerbaijan  torpedoes  any  compromise<br>
decision which  might   be  achieved before the Lisbon  summit,"<br>
Kocharian said.<br>

MANVEL EGHIAZARIAN REFUSES TO ATTEND HEARINGS ON CASE OF 31<br>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan). At a  Nov.  25  hearing<br>
on the case of 31  Manvel  Eghiazarian's nephew Gagik Vanian did<br>
not plead guilty to committing an attempt on policeman's life.<br>
     Vanian  confirmed testimonies  that  he   had  given during<br>
preliminary  probe.   He   said  that  on  the  day  of   arrest<br>
Eghiazarian's house was encircled  by  armed people in masks and<br>
heavy  military  vehicles (Vanian said the house  was surrounded<br>
by tanks).  Armed  people burst  into the yard of the house  and<br>
opened  fire.  Eghiazarian was   crying out: "Don't shoot, there<br>
are small children at the house." Vanian said  he  was  not with<br>
Eghiazarian   and  could   not    remember   precisely   whether<br>
Eghiazarian returned fire or not. Vanian  said he  did not  know<br>
whether the  assailants   were agents   of  the   lawenforcement<br>
bodies.<br>
     Vanian said that out of the arms  seized at his  apartment,<br>
only 15 cartridges really belonged to him. He said he  kept them<br>
as a memory about the Karabakh war. He said he did not  know how<br>
the rest of the arms appeared at his apartment. As to arms  that<br>
had been found at Eghiazarian's, Vanian  said  that  "Manvel has<br>
always kept   arms at  home  and   even   much  more   than  the<br>
lawenforcement agents have found."<br>
     Manvel   Eghiazarian  said  that   he  refuses  to   attend<br>
hearings, whereas   his  wife Mariam Khzyrjian will not  come to<br>
the court as a witness.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 236, Part II, 9 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN TO MEET KOHL, CHIRAC. Presidential Press Secretary Sergei
Yastrzhembskii announced on 6 December that Yeltsin and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have agreed to meet on 4 January, Russian and
Western media reported. The one-day meeting will take place at Yeltsin's
country residence in Zavidovo, about 100 km north of Moscow. Kohl will
be the first Western leader to meet Yeltsin since his heart surgery. On
8 December, the presidential press service told ITAR-TASS that Yeltsin
and French President Jacques Chirac have also agreed to hold a brief
meeting in Moscow in early January, although no exact date has been set.
Like the recent announcement of a Yeltsin-Clinton summit in March, these
visits aim to show that Yeltsin is reassuming the leadership of Russian
foreign policy. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
CHECHEN ELECTION UPDATE. Nineteen candidates announced their intention
to contest the Chechen presidential election by the 7 December deadline,
AFP reported. That day, former Russian parliament Speaker Ruslan
Khasbulatov announced that he will not run, Ekho Moskvy reported.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are to be held on 27 January.
It is not yet clear whether Vakha Arsanov will agree to acting premier
Aslan Maskhadov's proposal to become his running mate; both men have
already collected the 10,000 signatures in their support which must be
submitted to the Central Electoral Commission by 27 December. Shamil
Beno, leader of the Daimokhk (Motherland) party, called on Chechen
voters to register as early as possible; Russian Security Council
secretary Ivan Rybkin had told journalists on 6 December after visiting
Grozny the previous day that lists of voters would be ready by the end
of this week. Polling stations will be established in Stavropol,
Ingushetiya, and Dagestan for refugees from Chechnya. Also on 7
December, Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev again called for
the postponement of the elections on the grounds that preparations had
run into "major difficulties," Reuters reported, quoting NTV. -- Liz
Fuller
<p>
RUSSIAN COMMENTATORS WARY OF ALBRIGHT APPOINTMENT. Foreign Minister
Yevgenii Primakov reacted positively to the 5 December appointment of
Madeleine Albright as U.S. Secretary of State, calling her a
"professional" and a "good partner for dialogue," Russian and Western
media reported on 6 December. But many Russian commentators were less
diplomatic, and expressed worry that her appointment signals that
Washington will take a harsher line with Moscow during Clinton's second
term. Segodnya on 7 December said the appointment of the Czech-born
diplomat "creates colossal problems" for the Russian Foreign Ministry,
citing her firm backing of NATO enlargement and her reputation for tough
bargaining. On the same day, Izvestiya speculated that Albright's
background makes her "inclined toward confrontation" with Moscow, while
NTV said her appointment signals the strengthening of "anti-Russian
forces" in Washington. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
BEREZOVSKII, CHUBAIS RESIGN FROM RUSSIAN PUBLIC TV (ORT) BOARD.
Presidential Chief of Staff Anatolii Chubais and Deputy Secretary of the
Security Council Boris Berezovskii gave up their positions on the ORT
Board of Directors at the 7 December shareholders' meeting, ITAR-TASS
reported. In their place, the board appointed four new members: State
Privatization Committee head Alfred Kokh, Presidential Business Manager
Pavel Borodin, First Deputy Finance Minister Aleksander Vavilov, and
Deputy Presidential Chief of Staff Maksim Boiko. The state holds a 51%
stake in ORT, and the largest private shareholders are Gazprom,
Stolichnyi Bank, and Berezovskii's LogoVAZ company. Berezovskii is
considered by many as the key person in defining the TV channel's
content and policies. -- Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN-ABKHAZ TALKS. Russian, Georgian, and Abkhaz
representatives agreed at talks in Moscow on 4-7 December to continue
work on a draft document on the foundations for regulating the conflict,
confidence-building, and the repatriation of ethnic Georgian refugees,
ITAR-TASS reported. Georgian Foreign Minister Irakli Menagharishvili met
in Moscow on 6 December with his Russian counterpart Yevgenii Primakov
to discuss various aspects of bilateral relations, including the
division of the Black Sea fleet, Russia's military bases in Georgia,
joint patrolling of the Georgian-Turkish frontier, and the Abkhaz
conflict, Russian media reported. At a subsequent press conference
Primakov announced that ethnic Georgian refugees from Abkhazia will
begin returning to their homes in January. During several days of
simultaneous talks in Moscow, Georgian Interior Minister Shota Kviraya
solicited the assistance of his Russian counterpart Anatolii Kulikov in
preventing the creation of an Islamic Republic in the Caucasus that
would include Abkhazia, according to NTV. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
RUSSIAN BORDER TROOP COMMANDER IN ARMENIA. Gen. Andrei Nikolaev
completed a one-day visit to Armenia after holding a long private
meeting with President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL
reported on 8 December. Nikolaev said that the Armenian leadership
supports the presence of Russian troops on its borders with Turkey and
Iran, and that he is satisfied with the results of the visit. According
to Nikolaev, Ter-Petrossyan called for "additional measures" to
strengthen the CIS's external borders. Nikolaev ruled out the
possibility of a withdrawal of the Russian border troops from Georgia,
arguing that all the problems with the latter "have been settled" during
his recent visit to that country, Noyan Tapan reported on 6 December. --

TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER'S PLANE FORCED DOWN. A plane taking United Tajik
Opposition (UTO) leader Said Abdullo Nuri to his scheduled 9 December
meeting with Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov in northern Afghanistan
was forced down by aircraft of the Taliban movement, Russian and Western
sources reported. Taliban sources say Nuri is a "guest" and they will
allow him to continue on to the meeting point in Kunduz. Rakhmonov, in
Dushanbe, is waiting for word of Nuri's arrival at Kunduz before leaving
for the meeting. Fighting inside Tajikistan is at its worst since the
civil war of 1992. Government forces are reported to be assaulting
Komsomolabad (135 km east of Dushanbe), which fell to the opposition in
October. Fighting is also reported in the Tavil-Dara area (200 km east
of Dushanbe) and in the village of Chinor (60 km east of Dushanbe) near
the Nurek hydro-electric plant. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
DEMONSTRATION IN KAZAKSTAN. Over 3,000 people gathered in front of the
Academy of Sciences in Almaty on 8 December to protest living
conditions, international media reported. Signs with the words
"Salaries," "Pensions," "Free Press," and " Democracy" were burned and
symbolically placed in small caskets. People shouted slogans such as
"Nazarbayev (the Kazakstani president), you are our Hitler," "President
Nazarbayev's credit with the people is finished" and most alarmingly,
"Remember what happened to Najibullah" alluding to the former Afghan
leader who was dragged from the UN compound in Kabul, killed, and hung
in public. There are chronic energy shortages in the country and wage
and pension arrears, by some accounts, stand at $500 million. -- Bruce
Pannier
<p>
TENGIZ PIPELINE DEAL FINALIZED. Meeting in Moscow on 6 December,
participants in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium signed an agreement
finalizing their respective stakes in the project, AFP reported. Fifty
per cent of the project will be divided between the governments of
Russia (24%), Kazakstan (19%), and Oman (7%); the remaining 50% will be
divided between Lukoil (12.5%), Rosneft (7.5%), Chevron (15%), Mobil
(7.5%), Italy's Agip (2%) British Gas (2%), Kazakstan's Munaigas (1.75%)
and the U.S. firm Oryx (1.75%). Construction of the pipeline, which will
initially transport 28 million tons of oil annually from Kazakstan's
Tengiz field to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, will begin in 1997
and take an estimated two years at a cost of $1,500 million, according
to Russia's deputy minister for oil and energy, Anatolii Shatalov. The
pipeline will be operated by Russia's Transneft. -- Liz Fuller

CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
<p>
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT DENIES CONFLICT WITH PREMIER; WANTS NEW LANGUAGE
LAW. Leonid Kuchma said he doesn't disagree with Premier Pavlo Lazarenko
on major issues but only on tactical matters, UNIAN reported on 5
December. The night before, Kuchma had accused the government of
inefficiency and lack of responsibility (see OMRI Daily Digest, 5
December 1996). The differences concerned governmental proposals to ease
tax pressure on producers and to cut social benefits to war veterans and
the disabled. Kuchma said such measures would only aggravate the
situation and cannot lead to increased budget revenue. In other news,
Kuchma instructed his government to draw up a new version of the
language law to increase the use of Ukrainian, Ukrainian radio reported
on 6 December. -- Oleg Varfolomeyev
<p>
NEW PARTY ESTABLISHED IN UKRAINE. The Agrarian Party of Ukraine held its
founding congress in Kyiv on 5 December, Ukrainian radio reported. The
congress approved the party program and elected Deputy Prime Minister
Mykhailo Zubets as chairman. A co-founder, the deputy head of the
Ukrainian Collective State Farms Council, Ivan Yemets, said the party
will defend the interests of the entire agrarian sector. -- Oleg
Varfolomeyev
<p>
MORE QUARRELS OVER THE BLACK SEA FLEET. As a result of the Russian
=46ederation Council's resolution saying Kyiv had no right to govern
Sevastopol, Ukraine's parliament decided to consider adopting a law on
the withdrawal of foreign troops from Ukraine's territory, Russian
Public Television and UNIAN reported on 6 and 7 December. Ukrainian
Defense Minister Oleksander Kuzmuk said joint command of the fleet was
impossible, and the Ukrainian navy was capable of functioning without
help from Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Radio Rossii reported. Ukrainian
parliamentary Speaker Oleksandr Moroz warned that the adoption of a law
forcing foreign troops to withdraw from Ukraine could have serious
consequences, and he doubted it could be implemented. Ukrainian National
Security Secretary Volodymyr Horbulin was highly critical of the Russian
=46ederation Council's resolution, and denied that Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma had agreed to set up a joint command of the fleet. --

<p>
LUKASHENKA'S NEW BATCH OF DECREES. President Alyaksandr Lukashenka
signed five decrees on the Constitutional Court, including one
appointing Ryhor Vasilevich acting chief justice, Belapan reported on 7
December. Vasilevich had been noted for being more partial to Lukashenka
than other court judges. Another decree accepted the resignations of
four Constitutional Court justices, not counting the former chief
justice. Only six of eleven justices from the pre-referendum
Constitutional Court remain. Lukashenka also signed a decree moving
Mikalai Damashkevich from the post of head of the Presidential Control
Service to head the Committee of State Control of Belarus (successor to
the Presidential Control service). On 5 December, Belarusian radio
reported Lukashenka signed a decree ruling out further by-elections to
parliament and a decree on elections to the new upper house of
parliament, Belapan reported on 8 December. Regional and Minsk city
deputies are to be elected by 26 December. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
OPPOSITION PROTESTS IN MINSK. The Belarusian opposition held its first
protest rally in the capital since the 24 November referendum on 8
December, ITAR-TASS reported. Some 3,000 protesters marched downtown
carrying Belarus's traditional flags and banners "Shame on Russia" and
"Hands Off Belarus." They proceeded to the Russian Embassy to express
their discontent with Russia's position of passive observer of President
Lukashenka's quest for unlimited power. The demonstrators' main demand
was Lukashenka's immediate resignation. Speaking at the rally together
with other former parliament deputies, former Chairman Syamyon Sharetsky
called the recent plebiscite "an act of violence against people." The
protesters called on the democratic forces to unite in their opposition
to Lukashenka. Between 10 and 20 protesters were reportedly detained for
disturbing public order. -- Sergei Solodovnikov
<p>
SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE
<p>
SERBIAN COURT BACKS MILOSEVIC. Amid continuing daily mass protests
across Serbia, the Serbian Supreme Court rejected an appeal by
Belgrade's electoral commission to have the 17 November local election
results -- in which the Zajedno opposition coalition won a majority --
recognized, Beta reported on 8 December. The court ruling has
effectively upheld a third round of balloting that awarded the ruling
Socialists 66 of 110 seats in the Belgrade municipal assembly. Electoral
commission head Radovan Lazarevic has taken up a further appeal with the
federal supreme court, the federal public prosecutor and the republic's
public prosecutor. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
PROTESTS CONTINUE THROUGHOUT SERBIA. On 8 December the demonstration in
Nis attracted some 50,000 participants, many of whom smashed television
sets in protest of the regime's biased media coverage, Reuters reported.
Opposition leaders have also told the international press that police
harassment and arrest of peaceful demonstrators continues, with at least
40 persons having been apprehended so far. For his part, Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic, in the face of growing demands for both a
recognition of opposition victories in local polling and calls for his
own resignation, tore up a draft memorandum on press freedom presented
by a member of the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Finally,
Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Tijanic formally tendered his
resignation on 6 December, Tanjug reported. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
KRAJISNIK SAYS BOSNIAN SERBS CANNOT ACCEPT LOSS OF BRCKO. The Serb
representative of Bosnia's three-member presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik,
said the key Bosnian town of Brcko must be made an integral part of the
Bosnian-Serb entity, AFP reported on 7 December. Krajisnik said he is
opposed to any move that would put the town under international
administration. Brcko is claimed by both Muslims and Serbs. The town had
a Muslim majority before the war. Today, Brcko is the only link between
the eastern an western parts of Serb-held territory in northern Bosnia.
Under the Dayton peace accord, control of Brcko should be decided by an
arbitration commission by 14 December, but Serb Prime Minister Gojko
Klickovic said the Serbs would pull out and ignore the ruling of the
commission because they distrust its chairman, Roberts Owen. -- Daria
Sito Sucic
<p>
CROATIA'S TUDJMAN BLASTS ENEMIES . . . President Franjo Tudjman again
warned that those who complain about human rights and media freedom in
Croatia are really seeking to subvert the Croatian state, Slobodna
Dalmacija reported on 8 December. He said these critics are enemies of
Croatian independence or "communist remnants." In a tirade to the
governing Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ), he especially blasted the
Open Society Institute, which supports independent media like the Feral
Tribune and some NGOs; prominent critics like Ivo Banac, Chris Cviic,
Slavko Goldstein, and Vlado Gotovac; and the BBC, VOA, and Radio 101, as
well as the only independent daily, Novi List. Tudjman warned that these
enemies "have spread their tentacles throughout our society." -- Patrick
Moore
<p>
=2E . . AND DECORATES INDICTED WAR CRIMINAL. The next day, Tudjman
presented a number of military medals, including one to Gen. Tihomir
Blaskic for his role in retaking the Knin region in 1995, Reuters said.
Blaskic's wife accepted the award, since he is voluntarily appearing
before the Hague-based war crimes tribunal on charges of having
committed atrocities against Muslims. Tudjman's statement and
presentation of the medal are classic examples of his insensitivity to
foreign and domestic public opinion, which has long earned him the
nickname "Mr. Own-goal." They also reflect his understanding of
democracy and the uneasiness of the regime amid recent unrest and
reports that Tudjman has cancer. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
BULGARIAN OPPOSITION LEADER CALLS FOR NATIONAL CONSENSUS. Union of
Democratic Forces (SDS) Chairman Ivan Kostov said on 8 December that the
opposition will support the establishment of a currency board if an
agreement with the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party for calling early
elections and changing the Bulgarian National Bank's Executive Board can
be reached, Pari and Duma reported. However, Kostov's proposal must
first receive the backing of the extraordinary SDS National Coordinating
Council meeting on 9 December. The council must also decide on Kostov's
other idea -- to turn the SDS into a single party before early
elections. Over the weekend, 3 parties already backed him, while 6
others rejected the idea, albeit "ambiguously." -- Maria Koinova
<p>
MOSQUE IN BULGARIA DAMAGED IN EXPLOSION. An explosive device went off in
the Great Mosque in Kazanlak on 6 December, causing damage but no
injuries, Duma and Novinar reported. Motives and perpetrators remain
unknown. A bomb had been discovered and defused in the same mosque
earlier this year, while mosques in Varna and Shumen were targets of
arsonists in 1996. In other news, the EU said Bulgaria can restart the
controversial reactor No. 1 at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant but
should close the whole plant down as soon as it finds alternative forms
of energy, Reuters reported. EU and Bulgarian experts said tests showed
that "the material of the pressure vessel =8A allows the [reactor's] safe
operation." -- Stefan Krause
<p>
ALBANIA BACKS SERBIAN OPPOSITION. The daily Rilindja Demokratike, a
mouthpiece for the governing Democratic Party, praised the opposition
protests in Belgrade, news agencies noted on 8 December. The editorial
said it is to be hoped that the demonstrations bring down what it called
the hated Milosevic dictatorship, which has opressed the Kosovo
Albanians. Meanwhile, President Sali Berisha urged Kosovars to support
the Serbian opposition, Deutsche Welle's Albanian Service reported. The
Kosovars have taken the attitude that they want no part of Serbia and
that Serbian politics hence do not concern them. Berisha's words may be
seen as a clear, if gentle message to them that their future indeed lies
with Serbia, and that they must help the opposition if they want to help
themselves. -- Patrick Moore

Here is the text of the New York Times article mentioned in the above<br>
referenced posting on Hayastan.<br>
<p>
HEADLINE:  Universities Find Foreign Donations Sometimes Carry<br>
Price<br>
SOURCE:  New York Times News Service, December 9, 1996<br>
<p>
To the needy scholars of East Asia at the University of California campus<br>
here, the unexpected offer of a few million dollars for a new center to study<br>
ancient Chinese cultures sounded at first like a godsend.<br>
<p>
Then they paused at the fine print: The Taiwan foundation proposing to<br>
finance the center insisted that it commemorate the foundation and its<br>
namesake, Chiang Ching-kuo, the late president of Taiwan who, long before he<br>
helped lead the island toward democracy in the 1980s, was among the Chinese<br>
Nationalist leaders who have been blamed for the repression of thousands of<br>
political dissidents. <br>
<p>
The university's initial bid for the money has set off an uproar among some<br>
scholars and students who fear damage to the school's reputation, undue<br>
influence from the government-financed foundation, even a loss of access to<br>
the People's Republic of China for research and exchange programs. <br>
<p>
The dispute, however, is of a sort that is growing painfully familiar as many<br>
of the nation's best colleges and universities turn to new sources of support<br>
in the developing world to replace the dwindling money for foreign<br>
area-studies programs that were a greater priority of the federal government<br>
and big American foundations during the cold war. <br>
<p>
"There's a scramble now to find new means of support for these programs,"<br>
said Daniel Okimoto, the director of the Asia/Pacific Research Center at<br>
Stanford University, which, along with Columbia University, is also<br>
considering the Taiwan foundation's offer. "You can't raise it through<br>
tuition, so it's either private like a windfall foundation or business. In<br>
that context, the availability of funds from something like the Chiang<br>
Ching-kuo Foundation looks like a windfall." <br>
<p>
At Princeton University, the controversy this year was over the endowment of<br>
a chair in Turkish studies that some scholars feared could be used by the<br>
government of Turkey to whitewash its role in the massacre of a million<br>
Armenians in World War I. At the University of Michigan, the furor followed<br>
another Taiwan institute's sudden withdrawal of a $450,000 grant after one of<br>
the university's scholars endorsed a document calling on the United States to<br>
give priority to Beijing in its policies in the region. <br>
<p>
For scholars of Latin America, the problem is not so much one of taking money<br>
<i>&gt;from government agencies or politically minded foundations, but of finding</i><br>
appropriate donors in a business elite that has become increasingly involved<br>
in that region's turbulent politics. <br>
<p>
Some associates of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at<br>
Harvard University have squirmed in private as a few of the powerful Latin<br>
American personages on the center's advisory committee have become enmeshed<br>
in controversy in their native countries. At some other institutes for Latin<br>
American research, professors said they have had to conduct informal<br>
background checks before even approaching foreign alumni and other potential<br>
donors abroad. <br>
<p>
"Everybody feels their programs at risk," said Gilbert Merkx, who directs the<br>
Latin American Research Institute at the University of New Mexico. <br>
<p>
"The gods are no longer smiling on us in Washington and New York, and along<br>
comes some foreign businessman who says he'll drop $1 million on a center or<br>
an endowed chair," Merkx added. "The money doesn't have to come with strings,<br>
but there is always a natural inclination to be grateful to the donor." <br>
<p>
Polemics over the sources of foreign support for American higher education<br>
are by no means new. After World War II, the perceived villains were powerful<br>
patrons of European-studies programs who had been on or associated with the<br>
Axis side. In 1978, a furor erupted at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of<br>
Government over a $1 million gift in the name of an American businessman who<br>
made a fortune in mining in South Africa under the country's apartheid<br>
regime. And over the last two decades, governmental and private agencies in<br>
Japan have been especially aggressive about using grants to American colleges<br>
and universities to improve the perceptions and understanding of their<br>
country in the United States. <br>
<p>
Part of what has shifted of late has been the areas of the world that are the<br>
hottest subjects of international studies in the United States; Asia and<br>
Latin America, in particular, are riding a new boom in popularity fueled by<br>
both their importance in the global economy and the rising number of American<br>
students who trace their roots to those regions. <br>
<p>
As the economic ties of those areas to the United States have deepened,<br>
academic experts said, businessmen and others from countries like South<br>
Korea, Singapore and Mexico have also had a greater ability and incentive to<br>
turn to American educational institutions in order to extend their influence<br>
here.  <br>
<p>
The universities, for their part, have looked to the same sort of upwardly<br>
mobile alumni, government agencies and influential foundations that have<br>
dotted their campuses with shiny new buildings and plush endowed<br>
professorships in the past. But now, university officials said, a growing<br>
number of those alumni might be prominent business and political figures<br>
abroad. And they, like the governments and foundations, have often found<br>
themselves coming under greater political scrutiny in the United States.  <br>
<p>
Programs in Korean studies have been a notable case in point.    After<br>
struggling for years in relative penury, such programs found an important new<br>
source of help in the early 1990s. The Korea Foundation, a creation of the<br>
South Korean government, began spending millions of dollars to expand<br>
academic programs, endow professorships and sponsor conferences in the United<br>
States. But what the Koreans who dole out the grants might be seeking in<br>
return has become a question of growing controversy.  <br>
<p>
"These are not academic organizations," said Chalmers Johnson, an emeritus<br>
professor of political science at Berkeley who formerly headed the<br>
university's Center for Chinese Studies. "They are out to get over a point of<br>
view. They are paying to win support for their government." <br>
<p>
The Korea Foundation has drawn American criticism, among other reasons,<br>
because of its steadfast refusal to follow the Japan Foundation's lead and<br>
establish a process by which grant requests are reviewed by a panel of<br>
scholars in the United States. Instead, decisions are made by a board<br>
controlled by South Korean businessmen tied to the government, and the new<br>
head of the foundation, Joung won Kim, is a former senior official of the<br>
government's intelligence agency. <br>
<p>
Academic experts trace the struggle to finance area-studies programs and<br>
centers to cuts and changes that both the government and private foundations<br>
have made over the last decade or so. While the overall contribution of major<br>
foundations to international studies may not have fallen, foundation<br>
officials said much of that money has been channeled away from traditional<br>
area-studies programs to research that is more thematically oriented,<br>
examines problems in a comparative perspective, or emphasizes issues of<br>
American policy. <br>
<p>
"We are still concerned with the study of foreign cultures, but we are doing<br>
it in a different way than we did before," said Richard Ekman, secretary of<br>
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in New York. "We made a judgment in the late<br>
1980s that it was no longer possible to fund every area-studies program.<br>
Relative to other areas, there are more foreign sources available to East<br>
Asian studies programs, and our funding can be more effective elsewhere." <br>
<p>
Although the Mellon Foundation and some others have placed a greater emphasis<br>
on Latin America since the 1980s, administrators of some of the most<br>
prestigious academic programs on the region said their competition for<br>
resources has grown steadily more intense. And even Harvard's Rockefeller<br>
Center, with its relatively spectacular success in trying to build a $30<br>
million endowment, has highlighted the delicacy of looking abroad for help.  <br>
<p>
One of the 34 members of the center's advisory committee, a powerful<br>
industrialist from Colombia, has been in the news lately as a pillar of<br>
support for that country's embattled president, Ernesto Samper, following<br>
accusations by Colombian and American officials that Samper took millions of<br>
dollars from the Cali cocaine cartel. Other committee members are politically<br>
connected Mexican businessmen who have been criticized at home for their ties<br>
to that country's widely attacked former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.<br>
<p>
<p>
Just as Harvard and Yale and other American universities have for the most<br>
part relished their ties to the political and business elite in Latin<br>
America, the Middle East and Asia, the University of California at Berkeley<br>
has cherished the strength of ties to Taiwan's ruling class. <br>
<p>
The island's first elected governor, James Soong, who is on the board of the<br>
Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange, won the<br>
university's highest award for foreign alumni last year. But as the commotion<br>
continued this week over the foundation's offer, the university's Taiwan-<br>
educated chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, was back in Taipei on what several<br>
faculty members described as something of a damage-control mission. Through<br>
an assistant, Tien declined to comment. <br>
<p>
The director of the foundation's North American office in McLean, Va.,<br>
Hsingwei Lee, said that while it was founded in 1989 with government as well<br>
as private money, it has never applied political criteria in dispensing the<br>
roughly $23 million it has spent on American scholarship. <br>
<p>
The head of the University of California's Center for Chinese Studies, Wen-<br>
hsin Yeh, said faculty members had put aside their draft proposal for the<br>
Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation's money while they discussed the question more<br>
fully. But like her counterparts at Columbia and Stanford, she also argued<br>
that the uproar over the offer had little to do with how the foundation had<br>
spent its money, and seemed to have been stoked as much as anything by the<br>
controversy over Asian fund raising for the Democratic Party. <br>
<p>
The director of the East Asian Institute at Columbia, Madeline Zelin, said<br>
the university would in principle have no problem naming a center or program<br>
after the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation. But that issue may be more sensitive<br>
in the San Francisco Bay area, where a Chinese-American journalist, Henry Yi<br>
Liu, was murdered in 1984 on orders from Chiang's military intelligence<br>
chief. <br>
<p>
"It seems to me that it's very simple and very straightforward," Yeh said.<br>
 "We have our own ideas about the kind of research we want to do. We write up<br>
the proposal in ways that make us happy and we submit it." <br>

HEADLINE:  Russian Border Service Chief Completes Trip to Armenia <br>
SOURCE:  ITAR-TASS, December 8, 1996 (Dicran Liloian)<br>
<p>
"The Armenian leadership backs Russia's presence on the republican borders,"<br>
said here on saturday Director of the Russian Federal Border Service (FBS)<br>
Andrei  Nikolayev, describing the level of Russian-Armenian cooperation in<br>
border protection. <br>
<p>
On completing his one-day working visit to Yerevan, the General expressed<br>
satisfaction with the results of talks with republican president Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosyan as well as meetings with the Armenian Foreign, Interior and<br>
National Security Ministers and the commander of republican border troops. <br>
<p>
"We discussed issues concerning security of Russia and Armenia," he added. <br>
<p>
The Armenian leadership traditionally abides by approaches connected with the<br>
collective system of ensuring security, Nikolayev continued.  Hestated that<br>
collective security for Yerevan is based on bilateralrelations with Russia<br>
and also between Russia and other Caucasian states. <br>
<p>
The Armenian president expressed satisfaction with the work done by Russian<br>
border guards, the FBS director reported.   <br>
<p>
"Ter-Petrosyan expresseda desire for additional measures to ensure our common<br>
security and to protect outside borders of the Commonwealth of Independent<br>
States," Nikolayev noted. <br>
<p>
According to the Russian border service chief, the Armenian leader believes<br>
it possible to take additional measures to improve material supplies and to<br>
reinforce personnel of Russian border troops. <br>
<p>
"Our side outlined questions which we are tackling in the interests of our<br>
common tasks, and they were met with approval by the Armenian side," the<br>
General  emphasised. <br>
<p>
Generals and officers who accompanied Nikolayev, worked at border detachments<br>
of the "Armenia" army group which protects the state border between Armenia<br>
and Turkey and Iran. <br>
<p>
In compliance with treaties and agreements, signed by the leaders of the two<br>
nations, Armenian citizens have an opportunity to service in Russian border<br>
troops, deployed in the republic. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE:  Outside Interests Winning Battle for Kasparov's Attention, Time<br>
SOURCE:  Chicago Tribune, December 8, 1996<br>
<p>
The good news is that Garry Kasparov hopes to play a world title match with<br>
Anatoly Karpov next autumn. The disappointing news is--with that one<br>
exception--he does not plan to otherwise compete against his fellow humans<br>
during the next 12 months. <br>
<p>
Hailed as the strongest player in history, Kasparov brings to the board a<br>
creative flair and warrior mentality unmatched by any other player today. The<br>
insightful logic and beauty of his play have an irresistable effect on fellow<br>
grandmasters and audiences alike. <br>
<p>
After the VSB Tournament in Amsterdam last May, co-winner Veselin Topalov<br>
paid a deserved tribute:  <br>
<p>
"We have the world champion to thank for the small number of draws in the<br>
 tournament. Kasparov's brilliant fighting chess set an example for all of<br>
us."  <br>
<p>
Ineluctably, Kasparov has been turning away from chess to business and<br>
politics. During Russia's presidential elections, he energetically stumped<br>
for Boris Yeltsin. He also found time to campaign for the re-election of the<br>
Armenian President Levon Petrosian while playing in the World Chess Olympics<br>
in Yerevan.  After the Armenian elections, thousands took to the streets of<br>
Yerevan to challenge the legitimacy of Petrosian's victory.  <br>
<p>
The political ambitions of the world champion of chess are apparently without<br>
bounds, but most chess players would probably prefer to see him remain the<br>
Russian king of chess than reincarnated as the president or king of Russia. <br>

HEADLINE: Where Are They Now? Korky still hangs out in the buff now?<br>

<p>
If you're talking about nudism in Vancouver, you're talking about Korky Day.<br>
He was the guy who arranged the "Nude-in" at Wreck Beach in 1970 that helped<br>
establish Wreck as the premier nude beach in Canada. He was the guy who<br>
wanted to turn the giant 1983 peace march into a "nude walk for peace," until<br>
police detained him. He is the guy you see marching bare-chested alongside<br>
topless women in the "top free" marches of the '90s.<br>
<p>
Day is still a nude activist -- when the weather gets a little chilly to go<br>
to Wreck, he helps organize twice-a-month nude swimming parties at indoor<br>
pools (for details, call him at 877-1631).<br>
<p>
But he's got other irons in the fire. The 48-year-old native of Pasadena,<br>
Calif., who was born Kirk Reynold Stone and arrived in Canada as a war<br>
resister in 1968, is very active in the Green Party. He worked hard to get<br>
the proportional representation clause on Vancouver's referendum about wards<br>
and the at-large system. <br>
<p>
"It's a fair, neutral system," he says of proportional representation. "All<br>
the other systems are weighted in favor of some or another group, or in favor<br>
of forcing everybody into central parties." <br>
<p>
Day has been co-hosting the Armenian Variety Show on Co-Op Radio since 1984<br>
(his family name was Tashjian before it was anglicized). <br>
<p>
He publishes his own newspaper, Allies ("it's an alternative newspaper --<br>
what the Georgia Straight should have been, and would have been, had it not<br>
been taken over by the liberal Bolsheviks"). <br>
<p>
Most recently, the national Green Party adopted his resolution to take nudity<br>
out of the Criminal Code. "Nudity is not a crime," he says. "It may be<br>
annoying at times, or produce frostbite, but it's not a crime."  <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Increase in sexual exploitation of children attributed to growth in<br>
tourism<br>
SOURCE:  M2 Presswire, November 15, 1996<br>
<p>
Fikret M. Pashayev (Azerbaijan), said the report of the Secretary-General's<br>
expert had indicated that millions of children were caught up in armed<br>
conflict in which they were not merely bystanders but also victims of armed<br>
aggression and genocide. However, he could not agree with the report's<br>
statement that all major armed conflicts around the world in 1995 were<br>
internal and took place within States. Unfortunately, the report did not<br>
reflect the conditions of hundreds of thousands of children, refugees and<br>
displaced persons in Azerbaijan. As a result of the armed aggression by<br>
Armenia and its continuing occupation of 20 per cent of Azerbaijan's<br>
territory, there were one million refugees and displaced persons, many of<br>
them women and children. The Armenian army had destroyed 900 human<br>
settlements, as well homes, schools, mosques, social and cultural facilities,<br>
libraries and nurseries, all of which had a negative impact on children. <br>
<p>
He said when millions of children, including thousands in his country lived<br>
in refugee camps, suffering from starvation and malnutrition, and lack of<br>
medical services, the international community must take effective action to<br>
protect their rights. International humanitarian organizations played a<br>
leading role in that task. Taking into account their limited resources, there<br>
must be a more effective process of post-conflict settlement, which included<br>
speedy repatriation of refugees and displaced persons, as well as<br>
reconciliation, recovery and development. The Convention on the Rights of the<br>
Child must be ratified by all Governments, but more importantly, it must be<br>
implemented. The welfare of children depended on the welfare of their<br>
mothers, strong economies and good neighbourly relations. His Government<br>
supported the recommendations in the report.  <br>

HEADLINE:  Once Enemies, Russians and American Troops New Partners in Bosnia<br>
SOURCE: The Associated Press, October 12, 1996<br>
<p>
Russian Capt. Stanislav Mazurin studied the leaves turning to autumn red on<br>
the mountainside before him, and reckoned he'd learned a thing or two about<br>
Americans since coming to Bosnia last winter.<br>
<p>
"The devil is not so dangerous as we previously thought," Mazurin<br>
acknowledged, as he inspected his company's position on a winding road in a<br>
zone separating Bosnian Serbs from Muslims in northeast Bosnia. <br>
<p>
Many eyes are watching this experiment in Russia-NATO cooperation -  the<br>
first Russian-American military collaboration  -  in hopes it may lead to<br>
closer East-West security ties.  <br>
<p>
The 1,500-man Russian brigade, part of a force commanded by U.S. Army Maj.<br>
Gen. William Nash, has played a vital role in separating former combatants<br>
here.  <br>
<p>
Nash has nothing but the highest praise for the Russians  - although it would<br>
be surprising if he didn't, given the political sensitivity of the<br>
partnership. <br>
<p>
"The forces that they have provided here are extremely proficient," said<br>
Nash, proudly showing a photograph of himself and the Russian commander.<br>
"They are dedicated. They are disciplined. They have reacted quickly to<br>
incidents that required quick movement of forces."<br>
<p>
Lt. Col. Gevork Isahanian, chief of staff of the Russian brigade, is no less<br>
enthusiastic. <br>
<p>
"After so many strained years between East and West, we've got a real chance<br>
to see each other in a military operation, a chance to study each other," he<br>
said during a talk at brigade headquarters. <br>
<p>
"All these countries have had a chance to see the Russians are not so rude,<br>
not so strange, not so dangerous," Isahanian said. "We are normal people." <br>
<p>
Added Col. Vladimir Nakhoun, chief of the brigade's civil affairs unit: "Now,<br>
the image of a potential enemy has changed to a potential partner." <br>
<p>
Relations with the local people is another matter. While the Russians get<br>
along well with Serbs, Muslims suspect they are here only to protect their<br>
"Serbian brothers." <br>
<p>
Isahanian insisted the Russians were impartial, but admitted there had been<br>
problems with the Muslims. <br>
<p>
Among them is the village of Jusici, a smashed tumble of houses at the end of<br>
a twisting, muddy road in Serb-controlled territory east of Tuzla, site of<br>
the U.S. headquarters. Muslims driven from it during the 3 1/2-year war have<br>
come back to reclaim their homes. <br>
<p>
The return has been tense. A villager claimed he was beaten by Russians. The<br>
Russians claim villagers set a small explosive charge in one of their<br>
generators. Accusations still fly back and forth. <br>
<p>
Isahanian  -  an ornamental ashtray made from a Coke can decorating his desk<br>
 -  said there was no reason for Jusici Muslims to believe that the Russians<br>
favored the Serbs.  <br>
<p>
For his part, Nash believes the Russians have been treated badly by the<br>
Muslim side. <br>
<p>
"The biggest problem we've faced together is the attempt by the (Muslims) to<br>
split us," the American general said. <br>
<p>
"It has been unsuccessful," he said. "The Russian brigade is a member of my<br>
division, and an insult to them is an insult to me."  <br>
The only problems he has had with the Russian troops have been the usual ones<br>
that arise between commanders of divisions and their subordinates, he said.<br>
"The relationship has been amazingly normal." <br>
<p>
A year ago, NATO and Russian officials haggled at length over the command<br>
structure, working out a complicated chart of who would report to whom  -  in<br>
large part a face-saving document to avoid the impression that Russians were<br>
serving under NATO.  <br>
<p>
The arrangement also provided a mechanism allowing the Russians to go<br>
directly to their own hierarchy. <br>
<p>
Nash said neither he nor the Russian commander have ever even mentioned this<br>
chart. It simply hasn't been necessary. That is even more true at the bottom<br>
end of the scale where soldiers are soldiers -  and mud is mud. <br>
<p>
In Jusici, Russian and American enlisted men cook rations over the same fire<br>
 -  and when language isn't a barrier, grumble about the same things. <br>
<p>
The American troops have less to complain about, Mazurin said, marveling at<br>
the "luxury" with which U.S. forces are equipped.    Better the Russian way,<br>
he said, where equipment and supplies are simpler and easier to maintain. <br>
<p>
The Russian captain has been studying American military troops from afar<br>
since beginning his career in Cold War days. But seeing Americans up close in<br>
a real operation just once, he said, beats reading about them 100 times in<br>
training manuals. <br>

	+&gt; Kazakhstan oil pipeline deal signed  <br>
	+&gt; Police chief's sacking sparks Turkey row  <br>
	+&gt; Conference on Afganistan to be held  <br>
	+&gt; Turkey lifts veto on Israeli deal  <br>
	+&gt; Turkey fires Istanbul police chief  <br>
	+&gt; Armenia to discuss Karabakh issue  <br>
                               ======	 <br>
 Kazakhstan oil pipeline deal signed<br>
	Kazakhstan has signed agreements with Russia, Oman and a<br>
group of major oil companies to build a $2 billion pipeline<br>
transporting Kazakh crude oil to Europe through a Russian port<br>
on the Black Sea, the Interfax news agency said Saturday. The<br>
900-mile (1,500 km) pipeline would deliver oil from the Caspian<br>
Sea Tengiz field to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk,<br>
the agency said in a dispatch monitored in London. Construction<br>
s expected to begin early next year and scheduled to be<br>
completed by 1999. The new accords, which were signed Friday in<br>
Moscow, revise the structure of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium,<br>
originally formed in 1992 between the governments of Kazakhstan,<br>
Russia and Oman. The Financial Times newspaper said the nine oil<br>
companies would finance construction in exchange for 50 percent<br>
of the equity. U.  S. multinational Chevron's Senior<br>
Vice-President, Jeet Bindra, said the new accords meant earnings<br>
of about $40 billion over 40 years for Russian central and local<br>
government institutions. ``In addition, a considerable part of<br>
the pipeline capacity will be used for Russian exports,<br>
stimulating the development of Russian oilfields,'' said<br>
Bindra. The pipeline initially would carry each year about 28<br>
million tonnes of Kazakh crude oil, increasing the throughput to<br>
67 million tonnes at a later stage.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Police chief's sacking sparks Turkey row<br>
	Turkish opposition leaders cried cover-up Friday in<br>
reaction to the government's suspension of Istanbul's police<br>
chief and five officers.  Interior Minister Meral Aksener<br>
announced late Thursday that Chief Kemal Yazicioglu, his deputy,<br>
the head of the special operations department and three officers<br>
had been suspended and removed from an investigation into<br>
allegations of official links to drug killings. Yasar Dedelek,<br>
speaking for the opposition Motherland Party, called the<br>
decision ``a very serious attempt on the part of the government<br>
to try to cover up dirt. The government should review its<br>
decision.'' But Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan promised<br>
President Suleyman Demirel in a letter Friday that the<br>
government would do everything it could to investigate the<br>
allegations. Newspapers and Mesut Yilmaz, Motherland's leader,<br>
had accused the suspended men of involvement in the July killing<br>
of Omer Lutfu Topal, a drug lord and casino owner, over division<br>
of gambling and smuggling profits. Yilmaz said he had documents<br>
proving such ties and proof that prominent politicians had<br>
underworld links. Yilmaz appealed to Demirel to intervene. The<br>
president responded by urging the prime minister to<br>
investigate. That was followed by Thursday night's<br>
suspensions. ``The state cannot be dirty. It is some of the<br>
people in the authoritative positions who are not clean,'' said<br>
Onur Kumbaracibasi, spokesman for the leftist opposition<br>
Republican People's Party. Former Interior Minister Ismet<br>
Sezgin, now an independent parliamentarian, accused Interior<br>
Minister Aksener of being an inexperienced functionary of the<br>
rightist True Path Party, the junior partner in the government<br>
coalition with Erbakan's arch-Muslim Welfare Party.<br>

 Conference on Afganistan to be held<br>
	An international conference on Afghanistan will be held<br>
in Ashkhabad from Jan. 21 to 22, Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris<br>
Shikhmuradov told the Russian Itar-Tass news agency<br>
Friday. Shikhmuradov said the decision had been adopted by the<br>
United Nations in New York. The U.N. has manifested its<br>
intention to use the political and international potential of<br>
Turkmenistan as a neutral state which has proved its adherence<br>
to the aims and targets of the U.N. Foreign ministers of<br>
Australia, Austria, Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia,<br>
Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South<br>
Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the U.  S. and other states are<br>
expected to participate. Political and Social leaders, as well<br>
as representatives of various international organizations, will<br>
also attend. They will held an exchange of opinions on the<br>
situation in Afghanistan in an attempt to provide the war-torn<br>
country with tangible humanitarian assistance. The political,<br>
economic, social and military issues will also be discussed, the<br>
agency said.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey lifts veto on Israeli deal<br>
	Turkey's Prime Minister has reversed his opposition to<br>
an Israeli aircraft contract and given the go-ahead to the deal,<br>
a senior official said Friday. Prime Minister Necmettin<br>
Erbakan's defense advisor, Sedat Celikdogan, told United Press<br>
International that the contract would now go to President<br>
Suleyman Demirel for signing -- expected to be a formality. Last<br>
week Erbakan blocked the deal for Israel to modernise 54 Turkish<br>
Airforce F-4 Phantom fighters, saying that the interest payments<br>
on the $600 million contract were too high. In a move which<br>
threatened to provoke a showdown with the Turkish military,<br>
Erbakan said the interest rates had to be<br>
renegotiated. Celikdogan declined to explain why Erbakan had<br>
finally approved the deal. Analysts speculated that Erbakan had<br>
bowed to the military's insistence that the deal was vital to<br>
Turkey's armed forces. A senior member of the Turkish general<br>
staff said Friday he was pleased with Erbakan's decision. The<br>
Turkish military has overthrown unpopular governments three<br>
times since 1960 and Erbakan's coalition is currently weathering<br>
a storm of protests over alleged corruption.<br>
	Under the contract, Israeli Aircraft Industries is to<br>
fit the planes with advanced avionic systems.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey fires Istanbul police chief<br>
	The Turkish government has fired Istanbul's police chief<br>
and five members of an elite police unit over allegations of<br>
links with drug killings, a London newspaper said Friday. Police<br>
Chief Kemal Yazicioglu, his deputy, the head of the special<br>
operations department and three officers were suspended<br>
Thursday, the Financial Times said. Opposition figures and media<br>
reports have accused the six of involvement in the July murder<br>
of Omer Lutfu Topal, a drug lord and casino owner, the newspaper<br>
said. Topal was killed in a dispute over dividing gambling and<br>
smuggling profits. The latest police-crime scandal came to light<br>
as Turkey continued to simmer over an unexplained episode in<br>
November, when a car carrying parliamentarian Sedat Bucak, a<br>
high-ranking police officer and a criminal wanted by Interpol<br>
crashed, killing all except Bucak. Bucak is a member of the<br>
rightist True Path Party, the junior partner in Turkey's<br>
government coalition. He has been recovering from crash injuries<br>
and was repeatedly interrogated this week by<br>
investigators. Bucak admitted that weapons found in the car were<br>
his and threatened to name top officials tied to the crash,<br>
raising the specter of government involvement in corruption and<br>
ties with organized crime.  The parliamentarian is a leader in a<br>
Kurdish tribe allied to the government and fighting Kurdish<br>
separatists in southeastern Turkey.  Then-Interior Minister<br>
Mehmet Agar of the True Path Party resigned after being accused<br>
of covering up facts about the crash.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Armenia to discuss Karabakh issue<br>
	Armenia is ready to continue negotiations on all aspects<br>
of the Karabakh settlement, Armenian Foreign Minister Alexander<br>
Arzumanyan told foreign ambassadors in Yerevan, the Russian<br>
Itar-Tass news agency said Friday. He said, ``There is the<br>
impression Azerbaijan is not ready to continue the<br>
negotiations. The OSCE leader's proposals on the Karabakh<br>
settlement principles are actually proposals of the Azerbaijani<br>
delegation and cannot be accepted by Armenia,'' he added.<br>

1. "DRO" GROUP NOT LINKED WITH ARF, REITERATES BUREAU MEMBER<br>
<p>
MONTREAL-The 106th anniversary of the Armenian Revolutionary <br>
Federation was celebrated at the Montreal Armenian Center, during <br>
which ARF Bureau member Vicken Hovsepian once again unequivocally <br>
rejected any and all party ties with the so-called "Dro" group.<br>
	Given a recent announcement that the longwinded "Dro" trial <br>
was scheduled to conclude Tuesday, with the announcement of the <br>
verdicts, the Bureau member reiterated the partys position on the <br>
matter.<br>
	"The trial proceedings clearly showed that individual <br>
criminal wrongdoing were attempted to be tied to the ARF, solely <br>
for political purposes," stated Hovsepian adding that "the <br>
Armenian people saw that those attempts were futile and that there <br>
was no evidence, whatsoever, to legitimize those claims."<br>
	The ARF leader stated that the trial deviated from all <br>
judicial and human rights norms.<br>
	"As we have officially announced immediately following the <br>
arrests, and as the ARF 26th World Congress and the subsequent <br>
July Armenias Supreme Assembly announced, we also reiterate to <br>
the Armenian people that no ARF assembly or executive body has had <br>
links with the creation and activities of the `Dro group. In the <br>
event that criminal evidence is presented against individual <br>
members, the ARF, as always, will take necessary actions against <br>
those individuals who have violated the moral and ideological <br>
values and principles of  our organization," declared Hovsepian.<br>
	"Based on the aforementioned provisions, we, once again, <br>
announce from this podium that if criminal allegations are tied to <br>
the ARF through the verdicts, it would be proven  that the trial <br>
was staged based on political interests, and aimed at prohibiting <br>
the normal operations of the ARF in Armenia," concluded  <br>
Hovsepian.<br>
	At the beginning of his remarks, Hovsepian discussed the <br>
ARFs posturing toward the current political situation in Armenia, <br>
as well as the socio-economic conditions in the homeland.<br>
	Hovsepian specifically highlighted the plan presented to <br>
Armenias National Assembly by newly appointed Prime Minister <br>
Armen Sarkissian, discussing its positive aspects, and expressed <br>
hope that in coming months, through the realization of the plan, <br>
conditions in Armenia, as well as Armenia-Diaspora relations would <br>
improve.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. ARF 106TH ANNIVERSARY MARKED IN KARABAKH<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (ANIS)-The Armenian Revolutionary Federations 106th <br>
anniversary celebrations were held on Sunday at the "Nigol Douman" <br>
Center in Stepanakert.<br>
	The event was organized by the ARF "Artur Mkrtchian" <br>
Gomideh.<br>
	Central Committee chairperson Armen Sargssian delivered the <br>
keynote address, highlighting the 106-year-old organizations <br>
achievements and its work in Nagorno-Karabakh, which resulted in <br>
the free and independent Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
	ARF Bureau representative to Nagorno-Karabakh, Serge <br>
Amirkhanian, also addressed Sundays gathering. "Marking the 106th <br>
anniversary of the ARF in Artsakh marks a rebirth of sorts. We <br>
consider today to be a day of accountability, as we look back at <br>
the past year and evaluate what we have given to the nation in <br>
terms of the ARFs general goals," Amirkhanian said.<br>
	"Today, each ARF member renews his pledge, which is an <br>
annual tradition. We are a lucky generation to be able to <br>
celebrate this anniversary in the free and independent Artsakh," <br>
he said.<br>
	The evenings celebration concluded with a dinner and <br>
patriotic songs. Throughout the night event organizers recalled <br>
episodes in the lives and activities of fallen heroes martyred in <br>
the defense of Karabakh.<br>
	Four new members joined the ARF ranks that evening.<br>
	"By becoming a member of this party, I will continue the <br>
work of my ancestors that was left undone. This party [the ARF] <br>
was considered to be sacred in my family," said Anna Assatrian, <br>
chairperson of the "Armenian Woman" organization of the Armenian <br>
Relief Society in Artsakh.<br>
	Emil Abrahamian, Executive Director of the Artsakh Fund, <br>
told an ANIS reporter, "We celebrate this day like a holiday, but <br>
this day is symbolically and spiritually different from other <br>
holidays. And that spirit is what strengthens us. That strength <br>
which encompasses the nation is called Dashnaktsutiun [Armenian <br>
Revolutionary Federation]."<br>
	"The ARF is not a prescription to be given to a patient. The <br>
ARF is a national way of thinking. I am convinced that the time <br>
will come when the ARF will be able to freely, and anywhere it <br>
chooses, serve the Armenian nation."<br>
<p>
<p>
3. PRIMAKOV CALLS FOR AUTONOMY FOR KARABAKH WITHIN AZERBAIJAN<br>
<p>
MOSCOW (Itar-Tass)-"Russia is interested in stabilizing the <br>
situation and resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict," Russian <br>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said after talks with Armenian <br>
Foreign Minister Alexander Arzoumanian on Monday.<br>
	"A solution should be found on the basis of recognition of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakhs right to self-determination and self-government <br>
while preserving the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan," <br>
Primakov said. <br>
	The Russian and Armenian ministers reached an understanding <br>
on all economic and political issues. They also agreed to <br>
invigorate consultations between the foreign ministries of the two <br>
countries and develop fraternal and friendly relations between <br>
Russia and Armenia.<br>
	This was Arzoumanians first visit to Moscow since his <br>
appointment in  November 1996.<br>
	At a meeting with Armenias foreign diplomatic corps <br>
Saturday, Arzoumanian he presented the Armenian governments <br>
viewpoint regarding the results of the OSCE Lisbon summit and <br>
voiced regret over the OSCE Chairmans proposal on the Karabakh <br>
conflict settlement being unacceptable for Armenia.<br>
	Arzoumanian said that Azerbaijans proposal was illogical, <br>
adding that Azerbaijans attempt to exert pressure on Armenia by <br>
blocking the entire declaration could create a very dangerous <br>
precedent in the future.<br>
	He assured that Armenia was ready to continue negotiations <br>
although Azerbaijan did not seem to be ready to proceed with the <br>
negotiations. <br>
<p>
<p>
4. ARMENIA'S DEBT TO WORLD BANK COULD REACH $500 MILLION<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenia's debt to the World Bank could reach <br>
$500 million, stated Vahram Nercisissian the World Bank's <br>
plenipotentiary representative to Armenia during a recent seminar <br>
at the American University of Armenia.<br>
	Nercissian reported that Armenia currently owes the World <br>
Bank approximately $280 million and if more projects were <br>
undertaken through World Bank loans and credits that debt could <br>
reach more than $500 million.<br>
	The World Bank reportedly is planning a $16.75 million <br>
credit program to banks in Armenia which correspond to <br>
international norms.	<br>
	The World Bank announced that its has allocated $1,818,000 <br>
for the construction of homes and dwellings in Shirak.<br>
	According to Albert Markarian, Deputy Chief of Shiraks <br>
City-Planning Department, the money will be used for the <br>
construction of more than 300 apartments in the regions capital <br>
of Gumri, and 100 apartments in other areas of the region.<br>
	The construction of the dwellings and other facilities has <br>
been financed both through the budget funds and credits allocated <br>
by the World Bank.<br>
	The first stage of one of the World Bank projects on <br>
restoration of the earthquake area has been completed. This <br>
project included construction and reconstruction of residential <br>
buildings and communications. The World Bank agreed to provide an <br>
advance of $2 million for the implementation of the second stage <br>
of the project.<br>
	Another World Bank project reportedly aims at restoring <br>
social institutions, including schools, water pipelines, <br>
irrigation systems and telephone communications. <br>
	This project is being implemented by the Armenian Fund for <br>
Social Investments, which provided $1,500,000 worth of contracts <br>
to the Shirak region.<br>
	The Armenia Fund also plans to implement a $3.5 million in <br>
construction in the Shirak region in 1997. The Funds project <br>
includes reconstruction of schools and residential buildings. <br>
	Markarian noted that one of the largest schools in Gumri <br>
would begin operation in the near future. Its construction is <br>
being sponsored by the governments of France and Armenia, which <br>
have allocated  $1.7 million.<br>
	Among other projects Markarian also discussed the <br>
construction of schools, which are being conducted by the Armenian <br>
Assistance Fund and the Armenian Education Foundation.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. RUSSIA, ARMENIA COOPERATE IN SECURITY REALM<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-"I am satisfied with the results of the <br>
meetings I had with both Levon Ter-Petrosyan and National Security <br>
and Interior Minister Serge Sargsyan," Director of the Russian <br>
Federal Border Service, Andrey Nikolayev said upon his arrival in <br>
Yerevan.<br>
	Nikolayev said a wide range of problems concerning Russias <br>
and Armenias security had been discussed. <br>
	He said that the Armenian leadership traditionally adheres <br>
to a collective assurance of security.<br>
	According to Nikolayev, Ter-Petrosyan expressed his <br>
satisfaction with the work done by the frontier guards. Nikolayev <br>
pointed out that Ter-Petrosyan wants additional measures to be <br>
taken to help strengthen their material supplies and staff. <br>
	"In short, Ter-Petrosyan will back the presence of Russian <br>
troops on the Armenian borders," he said.<br>
	Nikolayev also pointed out that he has repeatedly told <br>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin about the necessity of helping in <br>
the settlement of regional conflicts.<br>
	In compliance with treaties and agreements signed by the <br>
leaders of the two nations, Armenian citizens have an opportunity <br>
to serve as Russian border troops on the Armenia, Turkey and Iran <br>
border. <br>
<p>
<p>
6. ARMENIA TO RETURN RUSSIAN DIAMONDS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW (Itar-Tass)-Russian Minister for Commonwealth of <br>
Independent States relations, Aman Tuleyev said that Russia will <br>
be getting its diamonds, gold and silver back from Armenia by <br>
January 1997.<br>
	The Russian state-run Almazyuvelir export company shipped a <br>
consignment of rough diamonds to Armenia two years ago to be cut <br>
and polished at the Sapfir diamond factory. The diamonds, worth <br>
$6,500,000, were never returned to Russia.<br>
	In addition, Siberian enterprises shipped a consignment of <br>
polymetallic ore for processing to the Chimkent lead plant in <br>
Kazakhstan almost a year ago.<br>
	Approximately 172 pounds of gold and 3.5 tons of silver were <br>
extracted from the ore. Russia has yet to retrieve the gold and <br>
silver.<br>
	Tuleyev said  Russia must get its property back. "We cannot <br>
afford to give presents at a time when strikes are breaking out <br>
throughout the country because of the governments failure to pay <br>
wages and pensions," he said.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. ARMENIA INTRODUCES COMPUTERIZED CUSTOMS SYSTEM<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenia is the first Commonwealth of <br>
Independent States member to implement a computerized customs <br>
registration program, head of the Customs Department, Yerjanik <br>
Abgarian, said at a Friday news conference.<br>
	He said that some 70 countries started installing the <br>
program, but only one third of them, among them Armenia, completed <br>
it.<br>
	According to Abgarian, the program, known as "Asicuda," was <br>
fully operational by May 1996 in the Ararat region, and later in <br>
Shirak, Lori and Siunik regions.<br>
	Although the program is far from perfect, Abgarian said that <br>
it can be improved, with the help of a $1.3 million World Bank <br>
credit.<br>
	Abgarian said that two customs offices connecting Armenia <br>
with Turkey are also ready. However, we cannot say the same about <br>
those connecting Armenia and Georgia, where there was a lack of <br>
facilities and customs officers, he said.<br>
	There are plans to build customs offices in Gougark and <br>
Siunik regions, and three offices on the border with Georgia <br>
during the next year.<br>
	Responding to a question on international drug trafficking <br>
via Armenia, Abgarian said there is no danger for Armenia to <br>
become a transition zone for drug trafficking. Abgarian did not <br>
share the opinions expressed in a recent United Nations report, <br>
saying that Armenia can turn into a transition zone for the drugs <br>
going from Iran to Russia and to Europe.<br>
	Head of the Service for Efficiency in Trade and Development <br>
of Infrastructures, Jean Gurunlian said that Armenia will <br>
introduce a new system to prevent smuggling. Gurunlian noted that <br>
customs offices of the former Soviet Union are far from being <br>
perfect, which creates obstacles in realizing these programs.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. NATIONAL PROGRESS PARTY LEADER SOUGHT BY AUTHORITIES<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Last Thursday at about 4:30 p.m. a group of <br>
ten armed National Security and Interior Ministry forces entered <br>
the home of Albert Bagdassarian, vice-chairman of the National <br>
Progress party, with the intention to take him to their <br>
headquarters, the National Progress party said in a statement <br>
Friday.<br>
	Bagdassarian, a former National Assembly member, was not <br>
home at the time, and the group told his wife that they wanted to <br>
take her husband for "a conversation with National Security and <br>
Interior Minister Serge Sargsyan." They also told Bagdassarians <br>
wife that Prosecutor-General Artavazd Gevorgian also wanted to see <br>
him, the statement said.<br>
	Two of the officers, ordered to stay at the apartment, <br>
waited until 11:30 p.m. not allowing anyone to leave or use the <br>
telephone, the statement said. Bagdassarians mother-in-law, <br>
sister-in-law and her baby were detained along with Bagdassarians <br>
wife and two children. In addition, the Interior Ministry officers <br>
also detained National Progress party chairman Vardan Zournachian <br>
and an administrative member, Ashot Ounanian, who had come to <br>
visit the Bagdassarians, according to the statement.<br>
	The party has filed a complaint with Armenias Prosecutor-<br>
General, demanding to know "who will be taking responsibility for <br>
violating the sanctity of Albert Bagdassarians home and the <br>
rights of his family;" and on what grounds and based on which laws <br>
did Sargsyan send ten armed officers to bring Bagdassarian to <br>
headquarters?"<br>
	The National Progress party called on Armenian authorities <br>
to "stop political persecutions in the republic and take relevant <br>
measures to restore legal power, order and democracy."<br>
<p>
<p>
9. OSKANIAN ASSESSES LISBON SUMMITT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-"Armenia was pressured from the very first <br>
day of the Lisbon Summit to adopt paragraph 20 of the final <br>
declaration of the summit. At the last moment  Levon Ter-Petrosyan <br>
had to use his right to veto," Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia <br>
Vardan Oskanian said at a recent news conference in Yerevan.<br>
	Oskanian said that the international community had always <br>
proposed three principles which were inadmissible for Armenia-the <br>
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, international guarantees of <br>
wider autonomy and security for Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
	Oskanian said Azerbaijan was pressured only after it had <br>
threatened to block the entire declaration. "I believe this will <br>
have negative consequences for Azerbaijan in the future."<br>
	Prior to the OSCE Lisbon Summit, Ter-Petrosyan said there <br>
would be no surprises at the summit, however, Oskanian explained <br>
that the talks were stable prior to the summit, and Armenia had <br>
succeeded in removing the passage referring to the aforementioned <br>
principles and replaced them with a more neutral paragraph.<br>
	Oskanian said that the OSCE clearly agreed with Armenias <br>
position on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. He <br>
characterized as negative the discussion on the Karabakh conflict <br>
as a collective opinion. <br>
	The principle of national self-determination was clearly <br>
stated in a final Helsinki statement, which says that a nation has <br>
the right to determine its foreign and domestic political status. <br>
	"I see some positive signs in the fact that this principle <br>
is now accepted, although with several reservations. It seems to <br>
me that we must emphasize this very principle," he said.<br>
	Oskanian said that there is a distinct difference between <br>
the Karabakh conflict and the other regional disputes, explaining <br>
that the international community treats the Karabakh problem very <br>
cautiously. "They understand that the Karabakh conflict differs <br>
from the other conflicts and the approaches used with the other <br>
conflicts will not work here." <br>
	Oskanian said that Armenia would strongly oppose the Minsk <br>
Group negotiations if they were held within the limits of <br>
territorial integrity for Azerbaijan and wider autonomy for <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
	"The Minsk Group must tackle a very clear-cut position-to <br>
coordinate a comprehensive political accord," Oskanian said, <br>
adding that the draft proposal does not include a reference to <br>
Karabakhs political status. "It seems to me that Azerbaijan will <br>
make such attempts, however, I think well be able to reject their <br>
discussion and emphasize the political accord," he stressed.<br>
	"These questions should have been specified during the <br>
bilateral negotiations which Nagorno-Karabakh should have also <br>
joined later. However, this never happened. Well continue <br>
negotiations on the political accord and political status, but we <br>
are not going to take these three principles as grounds for the <br>
negotiations," Oskanian said.<br>
	Oskanian also made a statement about the rotation of the <br>
OSCE co-chairmen. The present co-chairmen are likely to be <br>
replaced by the United States and France, he said. "We are <br>
entering a new phase. The process is taking on a new nature and <br>
our diplomacy will have to deal with a difficult task," he said.<br>
	He also noted that the position of Nagorno-Karabakh and its <br>
commentary and assessments would be of great significance and will <br>
depend on the course of further negotiations.<br>
	Oskanian said that Madeleine Albrights appointment as US <br>
Secretary of State would not influence the position held by the US <br>
on the Karabakh issue. Albright knows the problem very well. <br>
	She was the US Ambassador to the UN so she had constant <br>
contacts with Armenias Ambassador to the UN, Alexander <br>
Arzoumanian, who is currently Armenias Foreign Minister.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION CELEBRATES FIRST YEAR<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The UN Office in Armenia presented two <br>
books, "Human Rights and Legal Procedure" and "Human Rights and <br>
Elections" during the celebration of the first anniversary of the <br>
Armenian Center for Democracy and Human Rights.<br>
	The first book was published on the eve of the presidential <br>
election in Armenia and is a handbook of the UN Human Rights <br>
Center. The second book is a collection of all international <br>
documents on human rights and elections. The publication of the <br>
books was sponsored by the US Embassy in Armenia, the US <br>
Information Service office in Yerevan and the UN.<br>
<p>
<p>
11. TURKEY SIGNS WARPLANE ACCORD WITH ISRAEL<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-Turkeys Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan <br>
has signed a $600 million agreement with Israel for the <br>
modernization of Turkish F-4 fighter-bombers, the state-run <br>
Anatolian news agency reported Friday.<br>
	Erbakan, who reportedly signed the accord Thursday, had <br>
pledged to scrap an earlier military cooperation agreement between <br>
Turkey and Israel before taking office in June. He has not since <br>
acted on the pledge.<br>
	Turkish President Suleyman Demirel approved the deal Friday, <br>
the presidents office said in a statement.<br>
	Turkish officials were not available to comment on the <br>
signing of the latest accord, which was welcomed by Israels <br>
embassy in Ankara.<br>
	"We feel very pleased that the project in question has been <br>
signed by Prime Minister Erbakan after a long period of talks," an <br>
embassy spokesman was quoted as telling Anatolian.<br>
	"We want the project to be put into effect as soon as <br>
possible," the spokesman said.<br>
	The five-year modernization project covers 54 US-made F-4 <br>
planes and will be financed with Israeli credit.<br>
	Twenty-six of the Turkish Air Force planes will be <br>
modernized in Israel and 28 in the western Turkish town of <br>
Eskisehir.<br>
	Israeli commercial banks approved the $600 million credit <br>
package by Israel Aircraft Industries in October.<br>
	The five-year deal will involve the installation of advanced <br>
avionic systems including radar and electronic warfare and <br>
navigation systems.<br>
	Israeli officials said last weekend that they had renewed <br>
the military cooperation agreement with Turkey, which had drawn <br>
the ire of Syria, Iran and Islamists.<br>
<p>
<p>
12. EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION DENOUNCES TORTURE BY TURKISH POLICE<br>
<p>
STRASBOURG (Reuter)-The European Committee for the Prevention of <br>
Torture, in a rare public statement, Friday denounced Turkish <br>
police for physically torturing prison inmates.<br>
	The Committee, part of the Strasbourg-based Council of <br>
Europe which safeguards democracy and human rights, issued the <br>
statement after visiting police-run institutions in Adana, Bursa <br>
and Istanbul in September. The committee also met former inmates <br>
who were examined by police doctors.<br>
	"A considerable number of those examined had lesions or <br>
other medical signs compatible with their allegations of bad <br>
treatment...and in particular with blows on the soles of their <br>
feet, blows on the palms of their hands and with being suspended <br>
by their arms," the Committee said.<br>
	"Two of the people examined had lost the use of their two <br>
arms. These effects could prove irreversible," it said.<br>
	The team reported that it had found equipment for electric <br>
shocks and for suspending people by their arms in the offices of <br>
police headquarters in Istanbul.<br>
	According to the Committee, the Turkish government was <br>
informed of its findings and "failed to recognize the gravity of <br>
the situation." Notes and circulars issued by the Turkish <br>
authorities to improve the human rights situation were not <br>
enforced.<br>
	"It is up to the state to make sure it is obeyed," the <br>
Committee said, adding that in no circumstances could the fight <br>
against guerrilla violence justify torture or other ill-treatment <br>
by security forces.<br>
	The Committee issued a similar report four years ago. Turkey <br>
is the only member of the Council of Europe which has never <br>
published findings by the Committee. It decided to publish the <br>
latest report as the only way of putting pressure on Ankara.<br>
<p>

13. KERIANS, CAROLANS DONATE $25,000 TO PRELACY<br>
<p>
LOS ANGELES-Benefactors Tina Carolan and Mr. and Mrs. Vartan and <br>
Clara Kerian visited the Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic <br>
Church and presented Prelate Right Rev. Moushegh Mardirossian with <br>
a generous holiday donation of $25,000.<br>
	Mr. and Mrs. Richard and Tina Carolan and the Kerians have <br>
been ardent supporters of the Prelacys religious, national and <br>
educational programs.<br>
	At the request of the benefactors, this recent donation will <br>
be earmarked for the Prelacys traditional New Years and <br>
Christmas dinner and the publishing house of the Holy See of <br>
Cilicia.<br>
	Earlier this year, the Carolans and the Kerians made a <br>
magnanimous donation of $100,000 to the Holy See of Cilicia <br>
monastery and the Western Prelacy building fund upon Catholicos <br>
Aram Is first pontifical visit to the Western Prelacy.<br>

 By Valery Sevryukov  <br>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Itar-Tass) - "Russia is <br>
interested in stabilising the situation and resolving the problem of <br>
Nagorno- Karabakh on the basis of a compromise," Russian Foreign <br>
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said after talks with his Armenian counterpart <br>
Alexander Arzumanyan on Monday. <br>
   "A solution should be found on the basis of recognition of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh's right to self-determination and self- government, <br>
while preserving the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. Such a right <br>
can be laid down in a corresponding agreement," Primakov said. <br>
   He also noted that further consultations on these issues should be <br>
accompanied by contacts with Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
   The Russian and Armenian ministers reached understanding on all economic <br>
and political issues they discussed and agreed to invigorate <br>
consultations between the foreign ministries of the two countries and <br>
develop fraternal and friendly relations between Russia and Armenia. <br>
   At the same time, the ministers gave differing assessments of the <br>
parliamentary elections in Nagorno-Karabakh held in November 1996. <br>
   "The Russian side was against them because it believed that they should <br>
not be held before a mechanism for resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis <br>
is worked out," Primakov said. <br>
   However, Arzumanyan noted that Armenia does not consider the polls as an <br>
"extraordinary event going beyond the logic of the negotiating <br>
process." <br>
   He recalled a decision reached within the framework of the OSCE Minsk <br>
Group that the talks would involve Armenia, Azerbaijan and elected <br>
leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
   "Therefore, elections do not break the harmony of the negotiating <br>
process and go in line with its spirit and principles," he added. <br>
   On Russian troops in Armenia, Primakov said a corresponding document has <br>
already been considered by State Duma committees and been submitted to <br>
the parliament for ratification. <br>
   Russia has also asked the Armenian parliament to accelerate the passage <br>
of a similar document and received assurances from Armenian lawmakers <br>
that they are doing their best to synchronise the adoption of the <br>
document with their Russian counterparts. <br>
   Speaking of oil production in the Caspian sea, Primakov recalled that <br>
Russia, being one of the major oil exporters in the world, does not <br>
participate in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries <br>
which determines quotas for member countries. <br>
   "At the same time, the expansion of oil production in the Caspian Sea <br>
creates a new situation which none of us can ignore," he said. <br>
   This is Arzumanyan's first visit to Moscow since his appointment in <br>
November 1996. <br>
   Arzumanyan said he was pleased that he paid one of this first foreign <br>
visits to Russia which has "an exclusive place in Armenia's foreign <br>
policy." <br>

        PRESIDENT TER-PETROSSIAN MEETS WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE<br>
        RUSSIAN BORDER GUARDING TROOPS<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 6, the President of the Republic of Armenia Levon<br>
 Ter-Petrossian received the Director of the Russian Federal Border<br>
 Guarding Troops, General Andrey Nikolaev.<br>
 During the meeting the sides discussed the material and technical<br>
 aspects of Armenian-Russian cooperation in the area of<br>
 border-guarding.<br>
 Immediately after the meeting, Mr. Nikolaev had a brief meeting with<br>
 journalists, during which he expressed his satisfaction with the<br>
 results of his meeting with the President, and the earlier meetings<br>
 with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Internal<br>
 Affairs and National Security of the Republic of Armenia.<br>
 Mr. Nikolaev said that the President and the Ministers consider the<br>
 effective Armenian-Russian cooperation, as well as Russia's<br>
 cooperation with other Transcaucasian countries, as a key for<br>
 effective security system.<br>
 According to Mr. Nikolaev, President Ter-Petrossian expressed his<br>
 satisfaction with the work of the border guards and supported the<br>
 presence of the Russian border guards on Armenian borders.<br>
<p>
        PRESIDENT TER-PETROSSIAN MEETS WITH A UN REPRESENTATIVE<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 6, the President of the Republic of Armenia Levon<br>
 Ter-Petrossian met with the Chairman of the UN International Trade<br>
 Symposium and the Head of the Trade Development and Efficiency<br>
 Services Jean Gurunlian.<br>
 During the meeting the sides discussed issues related to the<br>
 cooperation between this organization and the Republic of Armenia, in<br>
 particular, in the area of modernization of the Armenian customs<br>
 system.<br>
<p>
        STATEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE<br>
        NAGORNO-KARABAGH REPUBLIC<br>
<p>
 STEPANAKERT, DECEMBER 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 6, 1996, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the<br>
 Nagorno-Karabagh Republic issued a statement, in which it expressed<br>
 the bewilderment with the statement of the OSCE Acting Chairman<br>
 during the Lisbon Summit.<br>
 According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that statement defies the<br>
 international legal and historical aspects of the Karabagh conflict.<br>
 The OSCE's Chairman's statement is considered as a defeat of justice<br>
 and common sense by the blackmail on the part of Azerbaijan, which is<br>
 abusing the oil interests of some countries.<br>
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabagh Republic<br>
 pointed out that throughout the 20th century the Armenian people have<br>
 been the victim of geographic interests of the world's superpowers.<br>
 The Ministry classified the efforts to keep Karabagh within a<br>
 criminal country, who has been steadily conducting anti-Armenian<br>
 politics, as the continuation of the already familiar policies.<br>
 The Ministry once again voiced the preparedeness of Karabagh to keep<br>
 the ceasefire and to resolve the conflict in a peaceful manner.<br>
 It stated that the Karabagh should be represented in the<br>
 negotiations, because the proposals of the mediators are often based<br>
 on partial interpretations of internationally accepted rights and<br>
 reflect the interests of only one out of three sides of the conflict.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 November: The Armenian Constitutional Court begins consideration <br>
of the appeal filed by the opposition presidential candidates <br>
Vazgen Manukian and Ashot Manoucharian over alleged irregularities <br>
and fraud during the country's September 22nd presidential <br>
election.  The appeal seeks to have the election results <br>
invalidated due to the allegations of widespread, organized and <br>
systematic fraud by the government resulting in the president's <br>
reelection.  The contest has led to mass demonstrations in the <br>
capital, protests by the country's opposition parties and a <br>
crackdown by the state authorities introducing a temporary <br>
suspension of civil liberties and a ban on all public gatherings.  <br>
The Constitutional Court is comprised of nine members, four of whom <br>
are appointed by the President and the other five by the majority <br>
pro-government parliament.<br>
<p>
2 November: President Levon Ter Petrosian meets with a visiting <br>
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <br>
(OSCE) to review the situation regarding the Nagorno Karabagh <br>
conflict.  The OSCE official, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja <br>
Halonen, reviews his plans for the mediation process of the OSCE's <br>
working group on the conflict, the so-called "Minsk Group," now <br>
chaired jointly by Finland and Russia.  During the visit to <br>
Armenia, the Finnish foreign minister also discusses the issue of <br>
bilateral relations between Finland and Armenia.  The OSCE is <br>
engaged in a renewed flurry of activity in preparation for its <br>
upcoming 54-nation, two-day summit to be held in Lisbon in early <br>
December. <br>
<p>
4 November: Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian resigns his <br>
post and is replaced by the Armenian Ambassador to the United <br>
Kingdom, Armen Sarkissian.  The appointment of the new prime <br>
minister, the fifth in the five years of the Ter Petrosian <br>
government, is interpreted as an attempt to ease the political <br>
tension overwhelming the country since the controversial reelection <br>
of Ter Petrosian.  The outgoing prime minister was initially <br>
appointed in February 1993 and had previously held the posts of <br>
deputy prime minister and economics minister.  Bagratian enjoyed <br>
the support and confidence of the international lending <br>
organizations engaged in supporting the economic market reforms in <br>
Armenia throughout his tenure in the government. <br>
<p>
5 November: Shavarsh Kocharian, who is representing Vazgen Manukian <br>
in his appeal to annul the presidential election results due to the <br>
voting fraud and irregularities, criticizes the court for <br>
"violating the principles of equality and transparency."<br>
<p>
5 November: In a show of solidarity with the jailed opposition <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) leader Vahan Hovanessian, <br>
eight protesters begin a hunger strike in Yerevan's Liberty Square.  <br>
The hunger strikers demand an immediate end to the government-run <br>
political trials of the country's leading opposition political <br>
figures, the release of all political prisoners, and the lifting of <br>
the government's ban on the activities of the country's largest <br>
opposition party, the ARF.<br>
<p>
6 November: Newly appointed Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian issues <br>
a statement promising his commitment to continue the economic <br>
reforms of his predecessor with "a new impetus and to uphold the <br>
country's independence." The new prime minister further adds that <br>
his economic plan will endow Armenia with a truly competitive and <br>
modernized economy in order to prevent the country from being <br>
overtaken by "regional economic and political forces."  The <br>
statements are aimed at easing the internal political tension <br>
afflicting the country since the recent tainted presidential <br>
election and the external worries over the state of the economic <br>
reforms marshaled by former Prime Minister Bagratian.<br>
<p>
7 November: More changes in the new Ter Petrosian government are <br>
announced with the resignation of the interior and foreign affairs <br>
ministers.  Interior Minister Vano Siradeghian, notorious for his <br>
connections to organized crime in Armenia, is appointed mayor of <br>
Yerevan by presidential order and Foreign Affairs Minister Vahan <br>
Papazian is dismissed from his post.  Both figures are prominent <br>
members of the ruling Armenian National Movement (ANM) and are <br>
personally close to the president.  Defense Minister Vazgen <br>
Sarkisian is reportedly retaining his post in the new government.<br>
<p>
8 November: President Ter Petrosian announces the final changes in <br>
the new governmental structure.  The powerful interior and national <br>
security ministries are consolidated into one power ministry to be <br>
headed by security minister Serge Sarkisian.  While the influential <br>
defense minister, Vazgen Sarkisian, retains his post, three <br>
newcomers enter the cabinet.  The former Ambassador to the United <br>
Nations, Alexander Arzoumanian, is appointed foreign minister, <br>
former communist party leader Vladimir Movsisian is named minister <br>
of agriculture, and former communist youth official Hranush <br>
Hakobian becomes social welfare minister.<br>
<p>
8 November: A jailed leader of the banned opposition party the <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), Vahan Hovanessian, ends <br>
his hunger strike that he initiated on October 29th to protest the <br>
continuous delays in the government's trial targeting him and other <br>
opposition figures.  The Hovanessian trial involves a group of 31 <br>
opposition members charged with treason, terrorism and assorted <br>
crimes against the state.  Since their arrest in July 1995, state <br>
authorities have violated the defendants' civil rights and rights <br>
to trial and have been accused of inhumane treatment and denying <br>
the prisoners the right to medical attention resulting into the <br>
mysterious death of one detainee from excessive blood loss.<br>
<p>
10 November: Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosian is formally <br>
inaugurated and his newly reconstituted government is officially <br>
installed.  The ceremony proceeds, marking the start of the <br>
president's second five-year term, despite the pending <br>
Constitutional Court's review of the opposition's appeal claiming <br>
fraud in the presidential election.  Of the country's main <br>
opposition parties, nearly all of whose activities are restricted <br>
or banned, the Communist Party is the only one in attendance.<br>
<p>
14 November: The European Parliament adopts a resolution condemning <br>
the election violations, the government's undemocratic treatment of <br>
the country's opposition parties and its leaders, and the state <br>
repression of the media.  The resolution calls on the Armenian <br>
government to hold new elections in the districts where the results <br>
were seriously questionable and to return to the international <br>
norms of democracy and freedom by guaranteeing the civil liberties <br>
of free speech, free press and assembly.<br>
<p>
17 November: Angrily denouncing the arbitrary decision of the <br>
Armenian Constitutional Court regarding the opposition's petition <br>
alleging voting fraud in the recent presidential election, <br>
opposition representatives hold a press conference in Yerevan.  The <br>
Constitutional Court announced that it will examine the documents <br>
and returns from several questionable electoral precincts for <br>
suspected fraud but will hear from only one of more sixty witnesses <br>
offered by the opposition.  Moreover, the Court ruled that it will <br>
continue to deny access to voting records and tabulations in <br>
military units and supported the actions of the government-<br>
controlled Central Election Commission in sealing all of its <br>
documents.  The Central Election Commission, in its explanation to <br>
the Court, also rejected a report by the international election <br>
observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in <br>
Europe (OSCE) critical of the election and documenting cases of <br>
fraud and voting irregularities as being "ill-informed" and a <br>
"reflection of private opinions only."<br>
<p>
22 November: The Armenian Constitutional Court formally rejects the <br>
opposition's appeal alleging voting fraud in the presidential <br>
election and certifies the election's results as valid and binding.  <br>
The Court decision, effective immediately, is final and without any <br>
avenue for appeal.  The country's opposition political parties <br>
respond with a uniform condemnation stressing that they have <br>
followed the legal avenues available for contesting the election <br>
and asserting that the court's verdict in no way legitimizes the <br>
election.<br>
<p>
25 November: Speaking at a press conference in Yerevan, Armenian <br>
presidential advisor Jirair Libaridian warns that Armenia will veto <br>
any document regarding Nagorno Karabagh submitted to the upcoming <br>
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <br>
(OSCE) that has not been approved by Yerevan.  The Armenian <br>
official stresses that the summit is the only effective avenue for <br>
negotiating a draft document on the political status of Nagorno <br>
Karabagh and any draft plan must include a definitive diplomatic <br>
and legal status for Karabagh with firm security guarantees for the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh population.<br>

<p>
MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2-3 November: Abkhazian government officials report that armed <br>
Georgian groups have attacked Russian peacekeepers along the <br>
Abkhazian-Georgian border.  Artillery bombardments are also <br>
reported in the Abkhazian town of Gali.  Tensions are reportedly <br>
increasing as Abkhazia November 23 parliamentary elections near.<br>
<p>
4 November: The Georgian government denounces the Abkhazian <br>
elections as illegal and appeals to Russia to state their official <br>
position on the elections in an attempt to stop them through <br>
diplomatic intervention and pressure.  The United Nations, fearful <br>
of the election's effect on the stalled mediation talks over the <br>
conflict, has called on Abkhazia to postpone the elections pending <br>
the return of the several hundred thousand Georgian refugees.<br>
<p>
4-5 November: Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko meets with <br>
Shevardnadze and other Georgian officials in Tbilisi.  A series of <br>
bilateral agreements are signed including an important accord <br>
stipulating military cooperation between the two countries.  The <br>
Ukrainian delegation also discusses the strategic issue of the <br>
planned transport of oil from Azerbaijan to Georgia's Black Sea <br>
port facilities.  Given Kiev's significant dependence on energy <br>
imports from Russia, Ukraine is interested in importing Azerbaijani <br>
oil from Georgia and is seeking the possible creation of a regional <br>
transit network consisting of inter-state highways, railway lines <br>
and pipelines.<br>
<p>
5 November: A new committee comprising representatives of eighteen <br>
opposition parties is formed to advocate the complete withdrawal of <br>
all Russian military troops from Georgia.  These include troops <br>
deployed along the Abkhazian-Georgian border as peacekeepers and <br>
those stationed at the four military bases Russia leases from <br>
Georgia.  This new committee is similar to an earlier group, the <br>
"National Liberation Movement of Georgia," founded several months <br>
ago by members of fourteen opposition parties not represented in <br>
the current parliament.<br>
<p>
8 November: The deputy secretary of the newly reconstituted Russian <br>
Security Council, Boris Berezovsky, meets with Shevardnadze to <br>
discuss the latest situation in nearby Chechenya and to review <br>
bilateral relations between Moscow and Tbilisi.  Shevardnadze also <br>
reiterates his appeal for increased Russian pressure on the <br>
Abkhazian leadership as the negotiations between Sukhumi and <br>
Tbilisi have stalled in recent months.<br>
<p>
10 November: Results from presidential elections in the former <br>
Georgian autonomous "oblast," or region, of South Ossetia, show <br>
parliamentary chairman Lyudvig Chibirov winning with 65 percent of <br>
the vote.  Former Prime Minister Vladislav Gabarayev is second with <br>
a mere 20 percent.  Georgian officials, though characterizing the <br>
election as "unlawful," are pleased by the outcome due to <br>
Gabarayev's platform advocating secession from Georgia and <br>
unification with adjoining North Ossetia within the Russian <br>
Federation.  The low turnout for Gabarayev indicates a significant <br>
lessening of support for outright unification with North Ossetia <br>
and a favoring of the more gradualist position advanced by <br>
Chibirov. South Ossetia adopted two referendums advocating <br>
secession from Georgia in 1991 and 1992 and is currently engaged in <br>
negotiations with Tbilisi over its political status.  The Georgian <br>
government is offering greater autonomy for the independence-<br>
seeking region. <br>
<p>
11 November: Georgian Defense Minister Lt. General Vardiko <br>
Nadibaidze meets with his Russian counterpart, General Igor <br>
Rodionov, in Moscow to finalize the bilateral agreement providing <br>
for Russian military assistance to Georgia.  The agreement calls <br>
for the transfer of Russian armored personnel carriers, artillery <br>
and naval vessels to Georgia.  The Russian Defense Council has <br>
heralded this agreement as an important element in Russia's <br>
strategy to build a series of bilateral military and security <br>
accords throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).<br>
<p>
24 November: Abkhazian officials announce that the first round of <br>
parliamentary elections have decided 30 of 35 seats and begin <br>
preparations for runoff elections for the five remaining seats.  <br>
Several hundred thousand Georgian refugees from the Abkhazian <br>
region are not able to participate in the elections, however.  This <br>
election represents a significant advance in the Abkhazian <br>
leadership's bid for independence, as it effectively replaces the <br>
previous Soviet-style legislature which split in 1993 into two <br>
rival camps, one favoring Abkhazian independence and the other <br>
supporting Tbilisi.  Georgian officials conduct a referendum for <br>
the Georgian refugees from Abkhazia resulting in a predictable <br>
majority voting to disregard any Abkhazian election held without <br>
their participation.<br>

2 November: The Canadian A &amp; B Geoscience Corporation (ABGV) <br>
announces that its subsidiary Commonwealth Oil and Gas has signed <br>
an agreement with the Azerbaijani State Oil Company (SOCAR) for the <br>
joint development of an offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea.  The <br>
project is set to begin exploratory work on an offshore field <br>
estimated to hold 151 million barrels of oil equivalent (with a <br>
ratio of roughly 66 percent oil to 34 percent natural gas).  The <br>
Canadian firm has signed a production-sharing agreement with SOCAR <br>
and is expected to launch the first stages of the exploration by <br>
the end of the year.  This is the first significant Canadian <br>
involvement in the promising energy sector of Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
4 November: Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev meets with Finnish <br>
Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, visiting the region as part of a <br>
mediation mission under the auspices of the Organization for <br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  The OSCE officials <br>
reports that President Aliyev has offered a status of the "highest <br>
autonomy" for Nagorno Karabagh and pledges that Azerbaijan is ready <br>
to formally reach a political agreement with Armenia and is seeking <br>
to resolve the long-standing Nagorno Karabagh conflict.<br>
<p>
4 November: Azerbaijani presidential advisor Vafa Guluzade departs <br>
for an undisclosed European city for secret talks with his Armenian <br>
counterpart Jirair Libaridian.  The two officials have been <br>
conducting secret diplomacy through these types of meetings over <br>
the past few years.  The talks center on the latest developments in <br>
the international mediation efforts underway for the Nagorno <br>
Karabagh conflict.<br>
<p>
5 November: The chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE, <br>
Xavier Ruperes, holds a series of meetings with Azerbaijani <br>
officials during a visit to Baku.  The OSCE official meets with the <br>
Azerbaijani president and foreign minister, and with <br>
representatives of the main opposition parties, the Azeri Popular <br>
Front and the National Independence Party.  Ruperes is briefed on <br>
the Azerbaijani government's position regarding the upcoming <br>
presidential elections in Nagorno Karabagh which it condemns as <br>
illegitimate and a provocation threatening the mediation process.<br>
<p>
8 November: Russia announces a shift in its official position on <br>
the Caspian Sea to allow for a communal agreement among the <br>
littoral states.  Specifically, the Russian government is <br>
advocating the formation of a new exclusive zone forty miles from <br>
each country's shore with resources beyond that limit being legally <br>
shared by all five countries bordering the Caspian.  Iran, <br>
Turkmenistan and Russia are seeking this interpretation while <br>
Azerbaijan, whose extensive offshore reserves are well beyond the <br>
forty mile limit, strongly opposes it and Kazakhstan, with reserves <br>
within the exclusive zone, wavering in its position.  This new <br>
Russian position was first revealed last month but Russian <br>
officials have now intensified their bid to legalize this position.<br>
<p>
9-10 November: Officials of the French oil company Elf-Equitaine <br>
hold talks with officials of the Azerbaijani State Oil Company <br>
SOCAR in Baku.  The meeting seeks to accelerate the negotiations <br>
over the development of the offshore Lenkoran-Deniz oil field along <br>
the Caspian Sea shelf.  The project, for the development of an <br>
estimated 50-60 million tons of oil, is expected to be formalized <br>
with the signing of an official production-sharing agreement during <br>
the visit of President Aliyev to France in the next few months.  <br>
The French company is already active in the development of <br>
Azerbaijan's offshore reserves with a substantial stake in the <br>
exploration of the Shah-Deniz oil and natural gas fields.  Another <br>
deal between SOCAR and a consortium of international oil companies <br>
is finalized for the development of the offshore Dan-Ulduzu and <br>
Ashrafi oil fields, said to hold some 100-120 million tons of oil <br>
and 30-50 billion cubic meters of natural gas to be extracted over <br>
a 25-30 year period.  This deal consists of a thirty percent share <br>
for the U.S. companies AMOCO and UNOCAL and for the Saudi Arabian <br>
Delta company.  The Japanese Itochu company and SOCAR each hold <br>
another twenty percent in the project, with the consortium <br>
reportedly providing the financing for the SOCAR share. <br>
<p>
11-13 November: The Commander of the Turkish ground forces, General <br>
Hikmet Heksal, holds a series of meetings and briefings with <br>
Azerbaijani military personnel in Baku.  During the meetings, the <br>
Turkish military official states that Turkey is committed to <br>
defending Azerbaijan militarily in the event of any outside attack <br>
or aggression posed against Azerbaijan, as stipulated in the <br>
bilateral military cooperation and security in effect between the <br>
two countries.  The Turkish military is planning to provide <br>
assistance through joint training exercises and drills.  This visit <br>
follows a meeting between a delegation from the Turkish military <br>
general staff with Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev late <br>
last month.<br>
<p>
12 November: Convening a summit in Turkmenistan to discuss the <br>
legal status and definition of the Caspian Sea, the foreign <br>
ministers of Azerbaijan, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan <br>
reach a consensus whereby all five states bordering the Caspian <br>
resolve to sign an international convention on the Caspian shortly.  <br>
The meeting decides to form a special task force empowered to <br>
negotiate the final details and will meet in the Kazakh capital <br>
Almati next month.  During the meeting, the Russian, Iranian and <br>
Turkmen officials agree to expand cooperation in the exploration of <br>
the mineral and fishery resources of the Caspian.<br>
<p>
15 November: Azerbaijani opposition leader Nemat Panahov, the head <br>
of the National Statehood Party, is detained by security forces <br>
just prior to the start of a press conference in Baku.  The <br>
opposition leader is a former advisor and confidant of President <br>
Aliyev but resigned his post several months ago in protest of the <br>
government's "widespread corruption." <br>
<p>
17 November: According to Azerbaijani officials, Russian Security <br>
Council deputy secretary Boris Berezovsky has assured them that <br>
Russia will guarantee the safe passage of the early oil expected <br>
<i>&gt;from the multi-billion dollar offshore energy project..  The oil is </i><br>
to be transported by pipeline through Chechenya to the Russian port <br>
facility at Novorossiisk on the Black Sea.  The security of this <br>
Baku-Novorossiisk pipeline has been a primary concern to Azerbaijan <br>
and the consortium of Western oil companies.  The need to secure an <br>
effective and reliable route for the transport of the oil from <br>
Azerbaijan remains a fundamental challenge to the long term <br>
viability of all energy projects underway.  Russian first deputy <br>
minister for oil and power, Anatoly Shatalov, has also promised <br>
that this pipeline route would be readied for the shipments of <br>
Azerbaijani oil by next year.  The pipeline through Chechenya, in <br>
need of an estimated (pre-conflict) $55 million in repair and <br>
modernization, is to transport 32 million tons of initial oil over <br>
a seven-year period starting in August 1997. <br>
<p>
20 November: U.S. State Department official James Collins meets <br>
with officials of the Azerbaijani foreign ministry during a visit <br>
to Baku.  Ambassador Collins states that the U.S. regards the <br>
development of Azerbaijan's economy and its energy sector, with <br>
significant U.S. investment, as a strategic concern for Washington.  <br>
The settlement of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict is also seen by the <br>
U.S. as a prerequisite for the establishment of Azerbaijan's <br>
security, according to Ambassador Collins. <br>
<p>
22 November: Speaking to reporters following a visit to Iran and <br>
Azerbaijan, President Mintimer Shaimiyev of Tartarstan, an <br>
autonomous region within the Russian Federation, reviews the recent <br>
bilateral accords reached calling for cooperation in the <br>
development of industry and trade with Tartarstan.  Both Iranian <br>
and Azerbaijani officials are interested in establishing new <br>
commercial ventures with Tartarstan, prominent for the production <br>
of Kamaz cargo planes and heavy trucks.  Tartarstan also has a <br>
growing petrochemical sector which is attracting significant <br>
foreign investment.<br>
<p>
23 November: Demonstrators gather in Baku to protest the <br>
presidential election in Nagorno Karabagh. The demonstration, <br>
seemingly organized and encouraged by the Azerbaijani government, <br>
consists of several thousand Azerbaijani refugees forced from their <br>
homes due to the fighting in Nagorno Karabagh.  The refugees <br>
denounce the election as illegal and as "disrespectful of <br>
Azerbaijani sovereignty and territorial integrity."<br>
<p>
24 November: An opposition demonstration is held in Baku to protest <br>
corruption within the Aliyev government. During the demonstration, <br>
plain clothes Azerbaijani security forces break up the rally and <br>
forcibly disperse the protesters from Baku's Freedom Square.  An <br>
Azerbaijani reporter is beaten by the police units after <br>
interviewing an opposition organizer of the demonstration.  <br>
Witnesses also report that the security forces assaulted several <br>
dozen participants and questioned some of the organizers.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 November: The Nagorno Karabagh Central Electoral Committee <br>
announces that three candidates have been formally registered for <br>
the upcoming presidential election.  The three candidates, the <br>
current President Robert Kocharian, communist party leader Hrant <br>
Melkoumian, and parliamentarian Boris Aroushanian, have met the <br>
requirement for signed petitions supporting their candidacy.  The <br>
Central Electoral Committee chairman, Moushegh Ohanjanian, also <br>
announces that potential candidate Albert Ghazarian has been <br>
disqualified due to discrepancies in his petitions.<br>
<p>
4 November: President Robert Kocharian initiates his campaign for <br>
reelection with a tour of the Askeran, Marduni and Mardakert <br>
districts.  The president also meets with various units of the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh military and the faculty of Stepanakert <br>
University.  During the tour, Kocharian stresses his government's <br>
achievements, including the development of Karabagh's energy and <br>
communications sectors and the expansion of agriculture from six <br>
hectares of harvesting to the current level of over 40,000 <br>
cultivated hectares.  Kocharian promises to continue the policies <br>
of providing tax and credit benefits to collective and private <br>
farms in order to foster agricultural self-sufficiency, and to <br>
expand small- and medium-sized enterprises to provide more <br>
employment.<br>
<p>
11 November: International representatives of non-governmental <br>
organizations attend a conference on conflict settlement and <br>
preventive diplomacy in Stepanakert.  Participants include <br>
delegates from the Helsinki Citizen Assemblies of Ukraine, Georgia, <br>
Armenia, and the Netherlands, the International Committee of the <br>
Red Cross, and other European non-governmental organizations.  <br>
<p>
15 November: Articulating last month's reports of possible Central <br>
Asian participation in a settlement of the Nagorno Karabagh <br>
conflict, Kyrgyzstan's Foreign Minister Roza Obumbayeva states that <br>
troops from the Central Asian states may participate in the <br>
deployment of international peacekeepers, but only on the <br>
precondition that a peace treaty is signed between Armenia and <br>
Azerbaijan first.<br>
<p>
16 November: Negotiations over the exchange of prisoners of war <br>
held by Azerbaijani and Karabagh forces break down after failing to <br>
reach an agreement on details of the exchange.  The head of the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh State Committee for War Prisoners and Hostages, <br>
Alexander Agasarian, accuses the Azerbaijani side of delaying the <br>
talks until the conclusion of the recent mediation talks brokered <br>
by the international mediators of the Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).<br>
<p>
17 November: The non-governmental organization Helsinki Initiative-<br>
92 announces its official endorsement for the candidacy of <br>
President Robert Kocharian in his bid for reelection.  Helsinki <br>
Initiative-92 coordinator Karen Ohanjanian cites Kocharian's <br>
contribution to state-building and the strengthening of democracy <br>
and the rule of law in Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
<p>
18 November: A new round of mediation talks are held in Helsinki <br>
under the auspices of the Finnish co-chair of the Organization for <br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) working group on <br>
Karabagh.  The talks attempt to build on the initial progress made <br>
during the visit to Armenia and Azerbaijan by the Finnish foreign <br>
minister, Tarja Halonen.<br>
<p>
19 November: The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), the <br>
largest opposition party in Armenia and long active in the defense <br>
of Nagorno Karabagh, issues an endorsement of President Robert <br>
Kocharian calling on its members and supporters to vote for him in <br>
the upcoming presidential election.<br>
<p>
20 November: Nagorno Karabagh officials begin preparing their <br>
diplomatic and political position for the upcoming 54-nation summit <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  <br>
Azerbaijan has announced that it will work toward a solution to the <br>
conflict through the OSCE mediation process but only from a <br>
position based on the international recognition of Azerbaijan's <br>
territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Baku seems determined to <br>
limit its concessions to greater autonomy for Nagorno Karabagh and <br>
resolutely dismisses Stepanakert's concerns for the security of its <br>
population and its defense of its right to self-determination. <br>
<p>
24 November: Nagorno Karabagh President Robert Kocharian is <br>
reelected to a five-year presidential term, garnering 86 percent of <br>
the vote while defeating two other candidates.  Parliamentarian <br>
Boris Aroushanian came in second with just under seven percent of <br>
the vote and Communist Party figure Hrant Melkoumian received 3.7 <br>
percent. The election enjoyed voter turnout of 78 percent of the <br>
electorate.  International election observers from the European <br>
Parliament, the Russian State Duma (the lower house of parliament) <br>
and other European countries report that the election was free and <br>
fair and was without any violations in election procedure.  <br>
President Kocharian was first elected to a two-year term in 1994 <br>
during Nagorno Karabagh's transition from a Soviet-style <br>
governmental structure to a presidential system.  The presidential <br>
election has been criticized by international organizations and <br>
countries attempting to mediate the Nagorno Karabagh conflict and <br>
has been sharply condemned by Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
25 November: Armenian Minister of Justice Marat Alexanian meets <br>
with President Kocharian in Stepanakert.  The justice minister <br>
reviews a plan to provide Nagorno Karabagh with assistance in the <br>
development of the republic's legislation and criminal code.<br>
<p>
26 November: Speaking at a press conference in Stepanakert, <br>
Kocharian reports that the latest round of talks with Azerbaijan on <br>
the Karabagh conflict have ended in a stalemate.  The talks, <br>
serving as a preliminary round prior to next month's major summit <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), <br>
comprised Armenian presidential advisor Jirair Libaridian and his <br>
Azerbaijani counterpart Vafa Guluzade.<br>

     SIMON OSBORN SPEAKS AT ZORYAN INSTITUTE EVENT<br>
     <br>
     LONDON (7/12/96)--Organized by the Zoryan Institute, on December 6, a <br>
     public presentation on "Armenia: Transition to Democracy" was held at <br>
     the London School of Economics.  Simon Osborn, OSCE on site <br>
     coordinator of the International Election Observation Mission for the <br>
     Armenian Presidential Elections, and Razmik Panossian, a Ph.D. <br>
     Candidate at the London School of Economics, spoke about the recent <br>
     presidential elections in Armenia and the subsequent controversies <br>
     that followed. <br>
     <br>
     In her introduction, the moderator and member of the Board of <br>
     Directors of the Zoryan Institute, Dr. Susan Pattie said, "The new CIS <br>
     and former Eastern Block countries face problems particular to their <br>
     histories and current geo-political relationships. Developing <br>
     democracies there are better understood in this context rather than in <br>
     a rough shod comparison with how they measure up to those established <br>
     on other continents in other centuries.  However, if we are to use the <br>
     word `democracy' for all these cases, we need to have some basic point <br>
     of comparison.  Is democracy an ideal which will never be truly <br>
     achieved on earth, as a sort of political utopia, or have we in the <br>
     West accepted the version we know best as the true democracy? <br>
     Democracy is most powerful as an idea. However, it exists in our <br>
     world, not as concept, but as a living process, one which we should <br>
     all be striving to improve in the countries in which we live as well <br>
     as those farther away." <br>
     <br>
     The first speaker, Razmik Panossian spent four months in Armenia doing <br>
     research on Armenian nationalism and politics.  He presented an <br>
     overview of the election issues and provided an analysis of the <br>
     election campaign before September 22, using a video clip and other <br>
     visual material. He pointed out that the Armenian National Movement <br>
     (ANM) was taken by surprise by the sudden popularity of  the <br>
     opposition after several parties formed the `National Accord' block." <br>
     In his conclusion, reflecting on the direction Armenia is going as a <br>
     state, Panossian said,  "Neither authoritarian nor democratic, Armenia <br>
     is caught in the twilight zone. Armenia is an open society, people <br>
     could speak their mind, organize rallies, and publish anti-government <br>
     editorials in newspapers, etc. But when the government sees any <br>
     organized opposition as a  serious concern then it employs indirect <br>
     pressures to suppress the threat." Commenting on the opposition's <br>
     role, Panossian concluded, "I certainly do not expect the opposition <br>
     to remain quiet for the sake of national interest. Political stability <br>
     is very important, but is also a very dangerous slogan."<br>
     <br>
     Following Panossian's presentation, Simon Osborn explained the role of <br>
     the OSCE observers, who were invited by the Central Election <br>
     Commission of Armenia, and gave details about what the observers did <br>
     before, during, and after the election.  He then presented statistics <br>
     collected by the observers and pointed out that, generally, the voting <br>
     process was conducted "correctly and according to the election laws." <br>
     He noted that there were candidates' proxies at 93.3% of the precincts <br>
     and added that "The only questionable issue in the voting process was <br>
     the military vote".  However, "things went wrong during the counting <br>
     of the ballots", Osborn said. <br>
     <br>
     Reflecting on the final results, Osborn commented: "The real problem <br>
     for me came when I saw the official results of the elections that came <br>
     from the Central Election Commission. When I looked at these results <br>
     something was very striking: there was a discrepancy of 22,013 <br>
     coupons_  What happened?  I do not know the answer to this question. I <br>
     do not think anyone else knows either." He also questioned the numbers <br>
     cited by the opposition. "I must say that the opposition tends to <br>
     exaggerate too much."<br>
     <br>
     Osborn then went over the recommendations made by the OSCE team and <br>
     commented on the decision of the Constitutional Court. He said, <br>
     "Although many people in Yerevan and elsewhere in the world will not <br>
     be happy with what the Constitutional Court said, I do recognize that <br>
     the Court and, officially, the government who responded to my report <br>
     very positively, said they would look into the recommendation that <br>
     were made and that they would do a review of the process, particularly <br>
     in Yerevan."<br>
     <br>
     Osborn concluded his presentation commenting on the democratic process <br>
     in Armenia. "I think", he said,  "Armenia is on a transition to <br>
     democracy and it is going to take a long, long time. I know this does <br>
     not make everyone particularly happy. I know Armenians' real desire to <br>
     have democracy and the desire to have a say in the way their country <br>
     is growing.  Every little step that is made to improve the situation, <br>
     to try to make improvements to the law, within the administration and <br>
     the election process are important steps on the way to building <br>
     democratic structures in the country.  The Constitutional Court's <br>
     decision to address some of the problems is a positive step. This is <br>
     very important."<br>
     <br>
     The presentations were followed by questions from the audience and <br>
     responses from the two speakers.<br>
     <br>
     The Zoryan Institute is a non-profit, independent research center <br>
     based in Cambridge, Mass., devoted to the study of contemporary <br>
     Armenian issues in the context of regional and global changes. <br>

     ISTANBUL ("Lraper" 6 December 1996)-- Last Thursday afternoon, a large <br>
     fire in the Kumkapi district of Istanbul destroyed three ancient <br>
     buildings, all dating  back to the 1880s, and caused damage to the <br>
     property of Holy Astvadzadzin Armenian Church.<br>
      <br>
     As there was shortage of electric power in the Kumkapi district, where <br>
     the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul is located, at sunset, an <br>
     Armenian elderly woman lit a candle in her apartment, which then set <br>
     the curtains on fire. The fire quickly spread and, within a short <br>
     period of time, caused irreparable damages to the buildings.<br>
     <br>
     All three buildings were inhabited by the elderly widows of the <br>
     Armenian community in Istanbul.  So far there are no estimates as to <br>
     the cost of the damages caused by the fire. <br>

tons of goods with railways to Armenia. <br>

<p>
Restoration of the Banusha bridge in Georgia would allow to resume delivery<br>
of goods with railways to Armenia. The bridge is a part of the railroad<br>
connecting Turkey with Iran. Realization of the project was made possible due<br>
to assistance provided by governments of several 6 countries including Great<br>
Britain ($0.3 mil of aid), Switzerland ($0.17 mil), Georgia ($0.15 mil), and<br>
USAID ($0.2 mil). Restoration works were accomplished by Mostostroj<br>
(Georgia). Last year near 13,900 railway trucks were delivered to Armenia<br>
with use of the bridge before reconstruction was started. Capacity of the<br>
railroad after bridge restoration would allow delivery of up to 20 K tons of<br>
cargo daily. A significant attention is provided by international<br>
organizations to development of transport infrastructure in the region. World<br>
Bank is expected to spend $50 mil for reconstruction of automobile roads<br>
connecting sea ports in Georgia with Erevan, Armenia. <br>

<p>
Sapfir (Sapphire) (Armenia) continues to support business relations with<br>
Russian partners in spite of certain problems created by customs regulation<br>
and payment problem. Russian diamonds were polished by Sapfir with a total<br>
value of $16 mil over the 1993-1994 period. Jewelry diamonds were sent back<br>
to Almazyuvelireksport (Moscow, Russia), a jewelry export/import enterprise,<br>
for a total sum of $11 mil. Diamonds for $5.1 mil are kept in Armenia because<br>
Sapfir still has not received $1.2 mil as a payment for polishing the<br>
diamonds. A delay with payment for delivered products is a common problem<br>
making financial situation at Sapfir very difficult. Debts of Russian<br>
consumers increased now to near $400 K. Nevertheless Sapfir continues to<br>
supply the Vtoroj Moskovskij Chasovoj Zavod (Moscow, Russia), a watch making<br>
enterprise in Moscow and the Zavod Tochmasha (Vladimir, Russia), a precise<br>
machinery enterprise. <br>

HEADLINE:  Armenian-USA company was created to determine presence of oil<br>
fields in Armenia. <br>
SOURCE:  Delovoi Mir, November 5, 1996<br>
<p>
Armenian-USA geological and prospecting company was created to determine<br>
presence of oil fields in Armenia. The company has intention to drill 3 wells<br>
in areas close to Erevan and to accomplish seismic studies of the region over<br>
the next 5 years. Near $10 mil will be spent for this purpose by the US side<br>
at the first stage. Future of the project depends on results to be obtained.<br>
If oil is found then the project will be continued. The previous study of the<br>
region was accomplished by the SPT consortium (UK) in cooperation with<br>
Parteko (Portugal). According to some experts, near 35 mil tons of oil and 80<br>
bil cubic meters of gas could be produced in Armenia.<br>

3. Vardan Oskanian: Armenia Won't Accept Any Pressure<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
   Deputy Foreign Minister's Comments About The OSCE Lisbon Summit<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN  ("Azg"  daily),  12/07/96  --  ROA  Deputy  Foreign <br>
Minister Vardan Oskanian, who actively participated in the  whole <br>
course  of  negotiations,  declared  in  a   meeting   with   the <br>
journalists yesterday that it is hard to predict whether the OSCE <br>
Lisbon Summit will have positive or negative consequences. <br>
     Oskanian believes that it is not clear yet what  conclusions <br>
will Azerbaijan and other OSCE  member-countries  make,  or  what <br>
positions will they accept now. Only then we'll be able to  speak <br>
about the possible developments of the next few months. <br>
     Deputy Foreign Minister stressed that  pressing  has  always <br>
existed, and this line will probably continue, but  Armenia  will <br>
not accept forced actions. One of the important  results  of  the <br>
Lisbon Summit was that Armenia clearly  defined  once  again  the <br>
limits, when no further concessions are possible. <br>
     Oskanian added that a new stage of  negotiations  will  only <br>
start after the problem of the new co-chairmen of Minsk group  is <br>
resolved, but the mediators may be  visiting  the  sides  of  the <br>
conflict during this period. <br>

        PRESS SECRETARY OF THE ARMENIAN PRESIDENT ON THE OSCE SUMMIT<br>
        IN LISBON<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 6, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Yesterday, the Acting Press Secretary of the President of the<br>
 Republic of Armenia Levon Zurabian held a press conference to<br>
 announce the official Armenian position on the Nagorno-Karabagh issue<br>
 after the Lisbon Summit of OSCE.<br>
 No decision was passed in Lisbon due to Azerbaijan's behavior, and<br>
 that only complicated the course of negotiations.<br>
 As was reported earlier, Azerbaijan tried to force its point of view,<br>
 according to which the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict should be resolved<br>
 based on the principle of preservation of Azerbaijan's territorial<br>
 integrity. If this point of view was not accepted, Azerbaijan<br>
 threatened to veto the entire final document of the Summit in Lisbon.<br>
 Mr. Zurabian condemned such behavior, and said that it set a<br>
 dangerous precedent, when one country can practically take hostage<br>
 the entire results of work of so many different countries.<br>
 Mr. Zurabian stated the reasons why the Armenian side did not allow<br>
 to accept the suggestion of the Minsk Croup Co-Chairmen, which was<br>
 put forward to reach a concensus, despite the fact that this<br>
 suggestion contained the principle of self-determination and the need<br>
 for guaranteeing the security of people of Nagorny Karabagh.<br>
 They are as follows:<br>
 1. The Minsk Group was authorized to negotiate the elements of the<br>
 political agreement, but in reality discussed neither the Karabagh's<br>
 status, nor its elements.<br>
 2. The 1994 OSCE Summit in Budapest passed a decision, according to<br>
 which the direct dialogue is pointed out as the forum, where the<br>
 status and its elements must be discussed. However, this dialogue is<br>
 not over yet.<br>
 3. Such a wording preconditions the outcome of the Minsk conference.<br>
 But according to the 1992 decision of the Meeting of the OSCE<br>
 Ministers, the status of Nagorny Karabagh must be defined by the<br>
 Minsk conference.<br>
 Mr. Zurabian said that it will be more difficult to find compromises<br>
 in the negotiations, since the mutual trust atmosphere has been<br>
 broken. However, Mr. Zurabian said that he does not think that the<br>
 negotiations have not reached the deadlock.<br>
 Mr. Zurabian refuted the statements published in Turkish and Azeri<br>
 press that the Armenian diplomacy was defeated in Lisbon.<br>

        DELEGATION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA<br>
        VISITS INDIA<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 6, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 4 the delegation of the National Assembly of the Republic<br>
 of Armenia headed by the President of the National Assembly Babken<br>
 Ararktsian arrived in Delhi.<br>
 The Armenian delegation was received by the Prime Minister of India<br>
 Devi Gouda. The Prime Minister said that India is interested in<br>
 developing political, economic, and cultural ties with Armenia.<br>
 During the meeting the sides also discussed the issue of opening<br>
 Embassies of the two countries.<br>
 Then, the delegation met with the Minister of Tourism Srikant Jenai.<br>
 During the meeting the sides discussed the further development of<br>
 trade and tourism between Armenia and India.<br>
 Later on the Armenian delegation was received by the Vice President<br>
 of India Mr. Narayana. During the meeting the sides discussed various<br>
 issues of mutual interest, in particular, the possibilities of the<br>
 Armenia-Iran_India economic cooperation.<br>
 At the end of the visit the Armenian delegation was received by the<br>
 President of India Shankar Dajal Sharma. The President expressed his<br>
 preparedness to continue the implementation of the cooperation<br>
 agreement signed last year by the Presidents of Armenia and India.<br>
<p>
        THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT REESTABLISHES THE CONFIDENCE IN THE<br>
        PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, WHILE THE OPPOSITION IS DEFEATED<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 6, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On November 22, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Armenia<br>
 completed the hearing of the case about the results of the September<br>
 22 presidential elections in Armenia.<br>
 The Constitutional Court carefully studied all the materials in the<br>
 case. It checked 162 polling stations, including all the voting boxes<br>
 and the documents of all the polling stations pointed out by the<br>
 opposition. In fact, all the polling stations about which the<br>
 opposition had any doubts and complaints were checked.<br>
 An insiginficant discrepancy with the data of the Central Electoral<br>
 Commission, CEC, has been found. In 110 cases the numbers found fully<br>
 coincided with the numbers of the CEC, in 41 cases there was 3-5<br>
 votes difference, and in other cases there were some irregularities,<br>
 which were reflected in the Constitutional Court's decision.<br>
 During the hearing in the Constitutional Court, all the reports from<br>
 precincts, submitted by the opposition (1035 in total) were<br>
 compared with the reports of the CEC. During the comparison, it<br>
 became clear that there are some partial discrepancy in the reports<br>
 of only 9 precincts.<br>
 The CEC was asked to submit its data based on the reports of all the<br>
 930 districts and 1155 precincts (including 303 precincts in<br>
 Yerevan). Taking into consideration the fact that most districts<br>
 consist of one precinct, it turns out that out of 1598 precincts, the<br>
 Constitutional Court didn't check about 70 precincts, about which the<br>
 opposition didn't submit any complaints.<br>
 When checking the Yerevan marz and precinct reports, it turned out<br>
 that in reality the big numbers 21701 (difference between the<br>
 participants and the counterfoils) and 21128 (difference between the<br>
 number of participants and the bulletins), which were reflected in<br>
 the OSCE report, were a mere mistake made by the Yerevan marz<br>
 commission. The recalculation showed that these numbers in reality<br>
 are 919 and 1114.<br>
 During the hearing it turned out that the opposition has never<br>
 applied to any courts with any complaints about the elections, and<br>
 out of the 15 thousand people who worked as proxies of the opposition<br>
 candidate, only about 3 percent submited complaints about the process<br>
 of elections.<br>
<p>
        VISIT OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA ARMEN<br>
        SARGISSIAN TO GREAT BRITAIN<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 6, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Armen Sargissian is now<br>
 on an official visit to Great Britain.<br>
 Yesterday, Mr. Sargissian met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of<br>
 Great Britain Sir Nicolas Bonser. During the meeting the Armenian<br>
 Prime Minister breifly described the present socio-political<br>
 situation in Armenia, and talked about the future plans of the<br>
 Armenian Government. The sides also discussed the results of the<br>
 Lisbon Summit of the OSCE, and the present state of Armenian-British<br>
 relations.<br>
 On the same day, Prime Minister Sargissian met with the British<br>
 Minister of Trade and Manufacturing Anthony Nelson. Mr. Sargissian<br>
 briefly described the privatization process in Armenia, the reforms<br>
 in the banking system of the country, and other economic reforms.<br>
 During the meeting the sides discussed the possibilities of<br>
 Armenian-British economic cooperation.<br>
 Today, the Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with the President of<br>
 the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development.<br>
 Mr. Sargissian will also be received by Her Majesty Elizabeth II.<br>
<p>
        "HAYASTAN" ALL ARMENIAN FUND URGES ARMENIANS AROUND THE WORLD<br>
        TO HELP FINISH THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EARTHQUAKE ZONE<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 6, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The Administration of the "Hayastan" All-Armenian Fund has sent an<br>
 open letter to the Armenian Diaspora on the occasion of the 8th<br>
 anniversary of the Spitak earthquake. In this letter it is written,<br>
 in particular, that according to some information, in the United<br>
 States alone about 40 million US dollars have been raised as<br>
 for the earthquake zone reconstruction. However, most of this sum has<br>
 not reached its destination yet. The Administration of the Fund urged<br>
 the Armenians abroad to continue their humanitarian efforts to help<br>
 overcome the tragic consequences of the earthquake.<br>
 It is also mentioned that since 1992 the Fund has allocated 3 million<br>
 815 thousand US dollars for the reconstruction of the earthquake<br>
 zone. This money was used to built 43 apartment buildings, 24 houses,<br>
 9 schools and other educational institutions, and 1 medical<br>
 institution. However, there is still a lot to be done in this area,<br>
 and the help of Armenians around the world would be greatly<br>
 appreciated.<br>

<p>
The third session of Armenia's National Assembly has wound up in Yerevan with<br>
the passing of a government report on the performance of the 1996 budget -<br>
its deficit amounts to 31m drams. <br>
<p>
Hearings on the 1997 draft budget have been postponed until next January<br>
because of a new government being in the making and the need to amend the<br>
budget draft. The parliamentary vacations will last until early February<br>
1997. <br>

HEADLINE: Constitutional Court recommends adoption of Russian military<br>
agreement <br>
SOURCE: Russian Public TV, Moscow, in Russian 0600 gmt 6 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
[Presenter] The Armenian Constitutional Court has considered the presence of<br>
the Russian military base on its territory in light of the requirements of<br>
the country's constitution. <br>
<p>
[Correspondent] Armenia was one of the first members of the CIS to support<br>
the presence of the Russian armed forces on its territory.   In March 1995,<br>
the bilateral agreement on this issue acquired the status of an interstate<br>
treaty with a 25-year life span and the possibility of further extension. <br>
<p>
The Russian military base in Armenia is a reality. Men are serving there,<br>
exercises are taking place, including joint exercises with the republic's<br>
national army. However, all of this is not quite legal. Both the Armenian<br>
parliament and the Russian State Duma have yet to ratify the treaty signed in<br>
Moscow 18 months ago by the presidents of the two countries. This was the<br>
reason for [Armenian President] Levon Ter-Petrosyan's application to the<br>
republic's Constitutional Court. <br>
<p>
After considering all six intergovernmental treaties connected with the<br>
presence of Russian troops in Armenia, the court declared that they did not<br>
contravene the constitution and recommended that the Armenian National<br>
Assembly ratify the treaty. <br>

HEADLINE:  Armenia Ready to Discuss Karabakh Settlement - Minister <br>
SOURCE:  TASS December 6, 1996 (by Dicran Liloian, Yerevan)<br>
<p>
"Armenia is ready to continue negotiations on all aspects of the karabakh<br>
settlement," Armenian Foreign Minister Alexander Arzumanyan told foreign<br>
ambassadors in Yerevan on Friday. <br>
<p>
The minister told the ambassadors about Armenia's opinion of results of the<br>
OSCE Lisbon summit.  "There is the impression Azerbaijan is not ready to<br>
continue the negotiations" on Karabakh settlement, he said. <br>
<p>
The Minister lamented that the OSCE leader's proposals on the Karabakh<br>
settlement principles are actually proposals of the Azerbaijani delegation<br>
and cannot be accepted by Armenia. <br>
 <br>
HEADLINE: Foreign Ministry Press Briefing<br>
SOURCE: Official Kremlin Int'l News Broadcast, December 5, 1996<br>
 <br>
Andreyev: Good day, to preempt questions I will introduce myself. The more so<br>
that I appear here quite rarely. I am Vladimir Vadimovich Andreyev, I am head<br>
of the department of prompt information at the Information and Press<br>
Directorate of the Foreign Ministry. I am appearing here as an official<br>
spokesman of the Ministry. <br>
<p>
I will begin, as always, with materials that we have prepared for you on our<br>
own initiative. The first, naturally, concerns the Lisbon meeting of heads of<br>
state and government of OSCE member countries. <br>
<p>
The meeting of heads of state and government of OSCE member countries was<br>
held in Lisbon on December 2 and 3. The message of greetings sent by<br>
President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin to the leaders of more than 50 countries<br>
of Europe, Asia and North America who took part in the meeting stresses that<br>
Europe is on the threshold of crucial decisions. We should not allow a new<br>
division of our continent, the message says, the role of the OSCE in this<br>
context is invaluable. The assets of the OSCE include the detailed discussion<br>
of the model of European security in the 21st century, the universally<br>
recognized contribution to Bosnian affairs, to the settlement of a number of<br>
other regional conflicts. The OSCE also has a big field of activity in<br>
ensuring human rights and the rights of minorities, in particular, the<br>
Russian-speaking population. These ideas were spelled out in greater detail<br>
in the speech by Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, who headed the Russian<br>
delegation in Lisbon.  The main result of the summit is that our ideas of<br>
creating a new model of European security are getting growing support. The<br>
summit adopted as its main document a detailed declaration on the model of a<br>
general and comprehensive security for Europe of the 21st century. The<br>
provisions that are of great importance to us include the provisions on the<br>
impermissibility of attempts to strengthen one's own security at the expense<br>
of the security of others, on the cooperation of various international<br>
organizations and institutions in the strengthening of the OSCE. <br>
<p>
The declaration singles out the agreement on the working out in the future of<br>
a European security charter of comparable importance with the Helsinki Final<br>
Act. Another important result of the Lisbon meeting is the adoption of a<br>
document on the renewal of the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe.<br>
Talks on this subject will begin already in January 1997. This makes it<br>
possible to press for material guarantees of ensuring our security, including<br>
by way of further limitations on the military possibilities of NATO. <br>
<p>
It is of fundamental importance that along with the decision on the<br>
adjustment of the treaty we secured an obligation of member states to show<br>
restraint in respect of their military efforts, including the present levels<br>
of armaments and deployment. <br>
<p>
Other documents were also adopted. They strengthened the role of arms control<br>
as an important instrument of ensuring stability in Europe. They make it<br>
possible to use the all-Europe format to identify and consider future<br>
confidence-building measures and military security that cause concern here. <br>
<p>
Given the important role played by the OSCE in the settlement of a number of<br>
regional conflicts, this was one of the main topics at the summit. On the<br>
whole, the preparation of the summit and its work showed that the fight for<br>
advancing the European idea is growing more fierce. Further implementation of<br>
this idea will encounter considerable difficulties connected with the desire<br>
of a number of countries to transform NATO into the axis of a future security<br>
system. <br>
<p>
The results of the Lisbon meeting are controversial, however, their general<br>
balance, including with regard to disarmament, is in favor of Russia. Despite<br>
everything, our vision of Europe of the 21st century -- at the core of which<br>
is a charter -- is making its way and we believe that the best instrument to<br>
continue this work would be the OSCE, where all countries have the same<br>
status and where the rule of consensus applies. This allows Russia to<br>
adequately reflect our interests in relevant documents and decisions. The<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh issue at the Lisbon summit. Unfortunately, the Lisbon summit<br>
revealed a serious gap in positions between Armenia and Azerbaijan on the<br>
provision concerning Nagorno-Karabakh in the summit final declaration. This<br>
endangered the adoption of the declaration itself. <br>
<p>
However, a consensus was reached and the declaration was approved after the<br>
issue had been discussed at the plenary meeting of the heads of state and<br>
government. <br>
<p>
Provision 20 on Nagorno-Karabakh was left outside the document. It was<br>
replaced with a statement by the OSCE chairman in office, Swiss Foreign<br>
Minister Flavio Cotti, which outlined the main principles of conflict<br>
settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The statement will be included in the Lisbon<br>
summit documents. Russia agrees with the statement as was confirmed by Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, who represented Russia at the<br>
Lisbon summit. We believe that these principles will make it possible to<br>
continue to work for the settlement of the conflict. <br>
<p>
This crisis is of special importance to Russia. We are not indifferent to it,<br>
considering our interest in stability in the Transcaucasus and the<br>
peacekeeping efforts that we have been taking there through shuttle<br>
diplomacy, as well as within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group. <br>
<p>
Practically all delegations of the OSCE called for a speedy settlement of the<br>
situation and we hope that the leadership of both Armenia and Azerbaijan will<br>
use this opportunity to continue talks on the settlement of the conflict<br>
based on the views of the OSCE leaders. <br>

[REMAINING PORTION OF ARTICLE REMOVED]<br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Yeltsin urges closer CIS integration <br>
SOURCE: 'Trud' newspaper, Moscow, in Russian 6-13 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
President Yeltsin has called for speedier and closer integration of CIS<br>
member states. Interviewed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the CIS, he<br>
said that the community of Russia and Belarus was an example of "the real<br>
results" of such integration. Yeltsin praised military cooperation within the<br>
CIS, saying that it was aimed at stability and conflict prevention. He<br>
reaffirmed his opposition to NATO enlargement and said that it would "harm<br>
Europe" . The following is the text of Yeltsin's interview published in the<br>
'Trud' newspaper; subheadings have been inserted editorially: <br>
<p>
No alternative to CIS <br>
<p>
[Interviewer] Boris Nikolayevich, the opposition continues to accuse you of<br>
breaking up the USSR. This is one of its main themes. What would you reply to<br>
your opponents today, five years after the creation of the CIS? <br>
<p>
[Yeltsin] It would not be out of place to ask this question too: what would<br>
have happened if we had all remained in the state in which we were during the<br>
last months of the union's existence? You will recall how things stood in the<br>
economy and in other spheres of life. <br>
<p>
By December 1991, the break-up of the former union had assumed the nature of<br>
a landslide. This was very dangerous. However hard it might be to admit it,<br>
the union had outlived itself. We had to save what could still be saved. The<br>
Commonwealth of Independent States - sovereign countries enjoying equal<br>
rights - was created. Each one assumed responsibility for its own affairs. <br>
<p>
At that time, the idea of the CIS was the only one on whose basis it was<br>
possible to reach agreement among the former republics, with the exception of<br>
the Baltic republics. I will repeat: five years ago no-one proposed a<br>
different model of our cooperation. <br>
<p>
Of course, there are quite a few problems in the commonwealth. There was a<br>
lot of criticism, frequently fair criticism. I too believe that integration<br>
within our commonwealth could have proceeded more quickly and effectively. I<br>
want to be understood correctly - I never advocated dragging anyone towards<br>
unification by force. No. I am speaking about something quite different - the<br>
development of mutually advantageous relations and joint work, above all in<br>
production, trade, and so forth. There is a tremendous field of activity<br>
here. <br>
<p>
The chief resource is here. But not everything here depends on Russia alone.<br>
We are patiently seeking a balance of interests. <br>
<p>
The CIS has withstood the tests of the most difficult period - that of its<br>
formation. <br>
<p>
The CIS countries took the decision to come closer together freely, of their<br>
own will, without pressure or coercion, because they realized that this was<br>
in their interests. <br>
<p>
I will emphasize that I am talking of cooperation among our countries on an<br>
equal and mutually advantageous basis. There is no alternative to this today,<br>
nor will there be one tomorrow. <br>
<p>
Therefore, I will say this: the CIS is not a return to the past and is not a<br>
truncated version of the former union. This will not be the case. Relations<br>
among our countries will be the way the peoples of the commonwealth want to<br>
see them. We will take into the future everything that has proved valuable<br>
and useful. <br>
<p>
Prospects for closer CIS integration <br>
<p>
[Q] How do you rate the effectiveness of the integration processes within the<br>
CIS? Do you agree with the claim that they are in many ways inferior to the<br>
similar processes in the European Union? What do you see as the reasons for<br>
this lag? <br>
<p>
[A] It is hardly possible to compare the progress of integration in the CIS<br>
and the EU. Our states and the peoples'destinies are too different.<br>
Integration in the EU began several decades ago, virtually from a blank<br>
sheet. The CIS has arisen in the place of a former centralized state. In some<br>
respects integration is proceeding more simply in our case, while in others -<br>
in a more complex way. <br>
<p>
Our cooperation has developed in the course of negotiations, and we have<br>
found the correct tone for relations. At first, even this was not easy.<br>
Solutions have been found to quite a large number of economic and social<br>
problems. The legal treaty base of the CIS has been created, and the<br>
commonwealth's structures are functioning. But today, all of this is no<br>
longer enough. <br>
<p>
I well know the mood of people in our states. They assess integration not by<br>
the number of agreements or joint organizations. The main thing for our<br>
citizens is how integration affects their everyday life and changes it for<br>
the better. I believe that this link can be seen most clearly in the example<br>
of Russia and Belarus. Borders and customs barriers have been removed within<br>
the community of our countries, and people have been afforded equal<br>
opportunities in finding employment, in education, in obtaining medical<br>
services and in acquiring property. Russia and Belarus will have a single<br>
fuel and energy balance. These are the real results of integration. <br>
<p>
Although it cannot be said that our customs officers and border guards do not<br>
have a number of serious questions to put to their Belarusian colleagues.<br>
They must be resolved as quickly as possible. <br>
<p>
On the whole, I look to the future of our commonwealth with optimism. It took<br>
Europe decades to achieve the present level of unification. It will<br>
undoubtedly take us less time. I am convinced of this. <br>
<p>
[Q] Do you think it possible that a closer integration process will spread<br>
within the CIS and that other CIS members will join the treaty of "the four"<br>
before the year 2000? <br>
<p>
[A] Let us not be in a hurry. The treaties of "the two" (between Russia and<br>
Belarus) and "the four" (between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan)<br>
were signed this year. I have already spoken of the community of Russia and<br>
Belarus. I would now like to point to the special significance of the treaty<br>
of "the four." Interesting cooperation projects are being drawn up among "the<br>
four." These too will soon manifest themselves in practice. If we work well<br>
and the specific benefit of integration becomes obvious, the states and<br>
peoples will draw their own conclusions. Both treaties are open to other CIS<br>
members to join them. <br>
<p>
CIS military cooperation aimed at peace, NATO enlargement to harm Europe <br>
<p>
[Q] Many fears are being expressed in the West in connection with the now<br>
apparent coordination of efforts among the CIS member states in the military<br>
sphere. Is so much really being done here, and is this not affecting the<br>
resolution of the question of NATO's eastward advance? <br>
<p>
[A] As is known, the majority of the commonwealth states joined the<br>
collective security treaty and the collective security concept, and a number<br>
of other documents on deepening military cooperation have been signed. Our<br>
border guards, air-defence services and others cooperate. <br>
<p>
Does the commonwealth need this? I believe that this is necessary and vital.<br>
Above all, in order to ensure the stability and security of the commonwealth<br>
states, to settle conflicts and to prevent new ones. Progress has been made<br>
here, appreciable progress. The armed confrontation in Nagornyy Karabakh, the<br>
Dnestr region, South Osetia and Abkhazia has been halted. The situation in<br>
Tajikistan remains complex, but here too, I am convinced, a peaceful solution<br>
will be found through joint efforts. <br>
<p>
Of course, the development of military cooperation within the CIS has nothing<br>
to do with the plans for NATO expansion. In the commonwealth, everything in<br>
this sphere is organized differently from NATO. I disapprove to the plans for<br>
NATO expansion. I believe that it will harm Europe. I hope that common sense<br>
will still prevail. <br>
<p>
I wish to emphasize that integration for us is a matter of life. We want<br>
closer ties and the restoration of mutually advantageous ties on a new basis<br>
so that a person in Russia or in any other CIS state leads a life that is<br>
calm and well-provided for, and so that contacts among people are as simple<br>
and natural as they have been for centuries. For our countries and peoples<br>
this is normal and necessary . I am sure that our commonwealth will only<br>
benefit from this. <br>

Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 7 Dec 96 p 3<br>
<p>
<p>
   [Report by Mekhman Gafarly:  "Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Spotlight on<br>
Abkhaz Problem"]<br>
<p>
   A meeting was held in the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br>
yesterday of Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeniy Primakov and the head of the<br>
Georgian foreign political department Irakliy Menagarishvili.  As transpires<br>
from yesterday's press conference of the two ministers held upon the<br>
completion of their behind-closed-doors conversation, this meeting aroused<br>
great interests of journalists.  The Russia-Georgia relations have piled up<br>
many problems the solution of which would require painstaking work.  Among<br>
the questions which arose media interest are those of the Georgia-Abkhazia<br>
conflict, Russia's mediatory role in its settlement, and the Black Sea Fleet<br>
division dispute.  The Georgian and Russian delegations also focussed, of<br>
course, on the questions of settlement of conflicts in the Caucasus region,<br>
including Chechnya, and the presence of Russian military bases in Georgia.<br>
However, both diplomats were reserved in their statements which is rather<br>
natural when discussing the solution of questions which prove to be a<br>
stumbling block in relations between two neighboring states.<br>
   The narrowing of the gap between the positions of Moscow and Tbilisi on<br>
the Abkhaz question is causing clear irritation in Sukhumi.  Sukhumi does<br>
not like of late many things about Russia's stance on the settlement of the<br>
Georgia-Abkhazia conflict, which is primarily attributed to the fact that<br>
Moscow already firmly speaks from the position of preserving the territorial<br>
integrity of states.  Therefore, the Abkhaz authorities have decided to rely<br>
on help from international organizations, including the UN.  For example,<br>
shortly before the Russian-Georgian meeting, the self-proclaimed Republic of<br>
Abkhazia demanded that the UN Security Council should "use its influence<br>
with the Georgian side and take the necessary measures to prevent the<br>
expansion and spread of terrorism."  The statement notes that the Abkhaz<br>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has facts confirming that Georgia's special<br>
services train bandit groups, infiltrates them into the territory of<br>
Abkhazia and plans wrecking and terrorist operations.<br>
    The fact that the Abkhaz authorities turned, on the eve of the meeting,<br>
to the UN Security Council rather than to the participants in the Moscow<br>
meeting indicates that Sukhumi has actually lost an ally in the shape of<br>
Moscow in solving the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict.  However, such a move may<br>
harm relations between Abkhazia and Russia.  Especially because Tbilisi has<br>
a means to pressure Moscow -- the existence of Russian military bases on the<br>
territory of Georgia categorically objected to by the local opposition.  One<br>
can therefore confidently say that henceforth all compromises reached<br>
between diplomats of Russia and Georgia will not be in favor of Abkhazia.<br>

 Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 7 Dec 96 p 1<br>
<p>
<p>
 [Report by Vladimir Abarinov:  "All the President's Men"]<br>
<p>
      The appointment of Madeleine Albright as U.S. secretary of state<br>
creates colossal problems for Moscow which the Russian Foreign Ministry is<br>
simply not ready to handle.  In the Carter administration, Albright was<br>
schooled by Zbegniew Brzezinski, a convinced and consistent fighter against<br>
Communist expansion and Soviet imperialism.  Naturalized Americans,<br>
especially from Eastern Europe, stand out in their rare intolerance of the<br>
slightest manifestations of anti-Americanism, and are extremely sensitive to<br>
any attempts at dictate by Moscow with respect to its former satellites.<br>
Madeleine Albright's unstoppable political temperament, her uncompromising<br>
nature, and her ability to get things done on her terms are widely known.<br>
She never retreats from the positions gained, moving toward her goal firmly,<br>
ingeniously, and assertively.   =20<br>
 There are plenty of examples. =FF20It is enough to recall the sad fate of<br>
Boutros-Ghali.  Moscow for some reason hoped that the United States would<br>
not exercise its power of veto out of the fear of finding itself in<br>
isolation.  The result is well-known:  Washington's lone but decisive vote<br>
forced the general secretary to withdraw his candidacy.  Now Russia should<br>
live up to its promise and block any other aspirant.  Quite obviously it<br>
will not do this -- out of the same fear of isolation that it ascribes the<br>
Americans.  Clinton has warned more than just once:  America will act<br>
together with other countries when this is possible, and will go it alone<br>
when this is necessary for it.=20<br>
 Albright stopped, just as firmly, the attempts to lift the oil embargo on<br>
Iraq, not at all afraid of pitting Washington against Moscow or Paris<br>
against Beijing.  True, there was a moment when the United States was<br>
clearly faced with the danger of not getting enough votes on Iraq.  Albright<br>
made a hasty tour of the countries non-permanent members of the Security<br>
Council, stating at every opportunity that the United States will not let<br>
pass the resolution under any circumstances.  The sanctions remained in<br>
force:  The non-permanent members did not dare to be isolated from America.=<br>
=20<br>
 It noteworthy that under U.S. laws, the secretary of state comes fourth on<br>
the list of officials replacing the president in the event of his<br>
incapacitation, i.e., is the third ranking figure in the administration<br>
after the president and vice president.=20<br>
 Through the appointment of Albright, William Cohen (defense secretary),<br>
Anthony Lake (director of the CIA), and Samuel Berger (national security<br>
adviser) Clinton has forcefully demonstrated how America envisions its place<br>
in the modern world.  These are not simply professionals who have risen to<br>
the upper echelons of power, and not even simply like-minded persons.  This<br>
is indeed a single team in which there is not even a hint at the notorious<br>
"system of checks and balances" for which our internal politics commentators<br>
give Yeltsin a special credit.  Lake served in the Nixon administration<br>
under Henry Kissinger and in the Carter administration under Syrus Vans.<br>
Berger also worked in the Vans' department.  It was Berger who recommended<br>
Lake to Clinton for the post of national security adviser.  Albright, as<br>
said earlier, worked under Carter in the National Security Council.  Cohen,<br>
as congressman and senator, has gained a reputation as an independent,<br>
although he was formally a Republican.  He was one of those Republican<br>
congressmen who voted, in 1974, for the impeachment of the Republican<br>
president.  Under Reagan, as one of the influential members of the armed<br>
forces and intelligence committees, he consistently advocated the building<br>
up of the U.S. might, strongly arguing that this was vital for America at<br>
the end of the Cold War.  In 1970 Lake resigned in protest against the U.S.<br>
invasion of Cambodia.  He threatened resignation to Clinton after the death<br>
of 18 U.S. military servicemen in Somalia -- as is known, in the end the<br>
U.S. troops were pulled out of there.=20<br>
 Such is the team: tough customers.  All this is a direct opposite to the<br>
deplorable Russian circumstances.  Our Foreign Ministry with its euphoria<br>
over the apparent successes in Lisbon will find it not simply difficult:  It<br>
will end up sidelined in international politics.  This inexorable trend is<br>
demonstrated by the absence at the OSCE summit not only of Clinton but also<br>
Christopher.  Next summer will see a real European security summit: a NATO<br>
summit, after which any talk about a multi-polar world will turn into a bad<br>
joke.=20<br>

<p>
<p>
   [Unattributed 'field reports by the DEN =AEMDBO=AF=AEMDNM=AFsecurity=<br>
 service']<br>
According to sources in Washington, there are sharpening debates in the<br>
White House and in the Clinton entourage as a whole over Russia's politics<br>
as well as about what line to take in the growing confrontation within the<br>
Russian establishment.  A large number of representatives of special<br>
agencies proposes distancing from the Chernomyrdin group and switching to<br>
full support of the Chubays-Berezovskiy group, which presupposes<br>
recommendations for Yeltsin to issue an edict on Chernomyrdin's resignation<br>
and the dissolution of the State Duma. Meanwhile, groups in the State<br>
Department and other foreign policy departments believe that Chernomyrdin's<br>
line organically fits into the goals of the Chubays group, while Berezovskiy<br>
is a bridge between them -- as Chernomyrdin himself, promoting informal<br>
relations with the CPRF, [Communist Party of the Russian Federation]<br>
effectively nullifies all actions by the opposition.=20<br>
 In the Republican-controlled Congress, an alternative point of view is<br>
spreading whereby the bet should be placed on the tandem of Lebed and<br>
Korzhakov, who, according to military intelligence analysts, are<br>
increasingly articulating the broad socially discontented sections in the<br>
Russian hinterland, gradually squeezing Zyuganov from the opposition.<br>
 These debates sharpened this December when preparations for the adoption of<br>
the 1997 budget by the U.S. Congress entered the final stage.  It is<br>
indicative that the Yeltsin factor is almost fully absent in these<br>
discussions....<br>
 The failure of the State Duma to give an appropriate assessment of the<br>
Chernomyrdin-Maskhadov agreement and its inability to make realistic and<br>
carefully calculated political decisions are seen in analytical circles in<br>
Ankara as a demonstration of the lack of will in the Russian Federation and<br>
a possibility for Turkey to actively expand its zone of influence in the<br>
North Caucasus....<br>
 According to sources at Radio Liberty and Russian TV companies (NTV, ORT,<br>
and others) they received negative comments from centers overseeing these<br>
media organizations in connection with Lukashenka's victory.  These comments<br>
point out their inability to reveal -- in a timely and adequate way -- the<br>
role of Chernomyrdin, who in effect covered Lukashenka by his visit,<br>
preventing the use of force on the part of the nationalist opposition and<br>
the Sharetskiy group (bloodshed in the streets).  In light of this,<br>
according to these sources, Washington directed these media outlets to<br>
continue the "informational onslaught" on Lukashenka, playing him off<br>
against Yeltsin, based on Lukashenka's alleged far-reaching ambitions to<br>
"seize" the Kremlin....<br>
 The events in Belgrade and the U.S.-initiated mass protest against<br>
President Milosevic, according to experts in Russian special departments,<br>
show that concessions over Bosnia and the surrendering of the Krajina Serbs<br>
resulted in the breakoff between the Belgrade authorities and the patriotic<br>
forces, weakening their internal base; as concerns the "weak" opponents, the<br>
United States takes adequate action against them:  They are destroyed.  A<br>
similar situation apparently awaits Russia in the Caucasus, where<br>
concessions to the separatists will in the end bring NATO forces to the<br>
Caucasus region...(end)<br>

Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati in his talks here today with<br>
Armenia's deputy foreign minister, Sergey Manasaryan, hoped that the two<br>
Caucasus neighbours of Armenia and Azerbaijan, would peacefully resolve their<br>
differences and disputes. <br>

<p>
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev has described the outcome of the Lisbon<br>
summit of the OSCE, which ended on 3rd December, as positive, Turkish TV<br>
reported. <br>
<p>
In an interview to the television late on the 3rd, Aliyev said that the<br>
summit had served to confirm Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. " The<br>
outcome of the summit is positive. In other words, even though the Lisbon<br>
declaration contains no written statement regarding the Nagornyy Karabakh<br>
problem and the Armenian-Azeri conflict, the OSCE president issued a<br>
declaration on behalf of all the OSCE member countries. <br>
<p>
"This declaration stated that the Armenian-Azeri conflict, the Nagornyy<br>
Karabakh conflict, should be resolved along the lines of the three principles<br>
supported by all the OSCE countries. Armenia is the only country that did not<br>
support these principles," the Azerbaijani president said. <br>
<p>
He also thanked Turkey for its support throughout the summit, the television<br>
added. <br>
<p>
Aliyev, however, did not express the same sentiments towards Russia,<br>
believing that Moscow could have done more in resolving the<br>
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Speaking to journalists after the summit, as<br>
broadcast on Moscow's NTV television, Aliyev said: "Many link Russia to<br>
Armenia very actively so of course Russia could have averted this conflict<br>
and prevented this bloodshed." <br>
<p>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, for his part, appealed to the two<br>
sides to continue working towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict,<br>
ITAR-TASS news agency reported. <br>
<p>
"I hope that Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders will use the Lisbon summit and<br>
continue settlement talks with due account of the opinion of leaders of the<br>
OSCE member-countries," the agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying before<br>
leaving Lisbon late on the 3rd. <br>
<p>
"Unfortunately, not all the document were adopted at the Lisbon summit as we<br>
would have liked them to because of the different stands of Armenia and<br>
Azerbaijan on Nagornyy Karabakh. But there was a consensus even on that<br>
situation," he added. <br>
<p>
According to the agency, the international mediators agreed to drop all<br>
references to the dispute from the closing document and issued a separate<br>
statement instead which recommended three settlement principles: <br>
<p>
"The territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the Republic of<br>
Armenia; a legal status for Nagornyy Karabakh, outlined in an agreement on<br>
the basis of self-determination, which would give Nagornyy Karabakh the<br>
highest decree of self-government within Azerbaijan; guaranteed security for<br>
Nagornyy Karabakh and its whole population, including mutual obligations to<br>
abide by settlement provisions," the agency reported. <br>
<p>
Turkish television quoted "diplomatic sources" as saying that the document<br>
had been "a serious defeat for Armenia" . <br>

<p>
Chinese Vice President Rong Yiren told a visiting Armenian delegation led by<br>
parliament speaker Babken Ararktsyan that parliamentary exchanges would be of<br>
great benefit to the development of Beijing-Yerevan ties, the official<br>
Chinese news agency Xinhua reported on 3rd December. <br>
<p>
"China holds that all countries in the world should treat each other on the<br>
basis of equality and friendship," Rong said, adding that since the<br>
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1992,<br>
high-level visits had greatly promoted bilateral cooperation in the fields of<br>
politics, science and technology, and culture. <br>
<p>
Having briefed the Armenian delegation on China's reform policies and its<br>
long-range development plan to the year 2010, Rong said that the sharing of<br>
experiences would be "conducive to the development of both countries, since<br>
they have many things in common" , the agency reported. <br>
<p>
Ararktsyan said that his delegation was very glad to have an opportunity to<br>
become acquainted with China's reform progress. "Both China and Armenia are<br>
carrying out reform and have potential for cooperation," the speaker said,<br>
adding that it was important for Armenia to learn more about China's<br>
development plans. <br>

<p>
The United Nations has earmarked a total of 15m dollars for Armenia since a<br>
UN mission opened in the country in December 1992. The money has chiefly been<br>
spent on housing construction and social support for refugees, elderly and<br>
disabled people, a UN representative in charge of refugee problems told a<br>
news conference in Yerevan Tuesday [3rd December].   Armenia is now home to<br>
300,000 refugees from Azerbaijan, the UN representative said, adding that<br>
150,000 of them were living in desperate conditions. <br>
<p>
The majority of refugees are living in dormitories, basements, old unrepaired<br>
buildings and homes based in railway cars. Early reports say the United<br>
Nations will give Armenia 5m dollars for handling social problems in 1997. <br>

HEADLINE: Photographer's Key: Right Place and Time <br>
SOURCE:  The Moscow Times December 4, 1996 (by Bronwyn McLaren)<br>
<p>
British photographer James Hill claims that he ended up in the cutthroat<br>
business of photojournalism by accident. "I was desperate," he laughs, in an<br>
interview over lunch near the Moscow bureau of The New York Times, where he<br>
is the paper's full-time photographer. "I couldn't decide what I wanted to<br>
do." <br>
<p>
After graduating with a history degree from Oxford University in 1988, Hill<br>
made a half-hearted attempt to become a merchant banker in London before<br>
enrolling in a photojournalism course at the London College of Printing. His<br>
father, although fully supportive, viewed the move as a one-way trip to<br>
complete poverty. <br>
<p>
But in 1991, Hill had an inkling that something momentous was about to happen<br>
in the Soviet Union. When he completed his course, he jumped on a plane to<br>
Kiev, despite the fact he didn't speak a word of Russian. His timing was<br>
perfect. "As a freelancer, you need to be in the right place at the right<br>
time," says Hill, now 30. "That place was the Soviet Union in 1991 and '92". <br>
<p>
According to Hill, who has now spent the last five years in the former Soviet<br>
Union, journalists could travel for next to nothing, and there was an<br>
insatiable demand from the West for stories. They could also take advantage<br>
of the artificially low international phone rates to chat to editors for<br>
hours. "Kiev was a really fun place then," he said. "It was a very close-knit<br>
community. The British Ambassador would take my film back to London for me." <br>
<p>
It was a particularly favorable climate for Hill who claims he ended up being<br>
the only Western photographer in Kiev. "I was the only fish in the pond," he<br>
said modestly. "And I wasn't even a particularly good photographer. I would<br>
just take photos and hope for the best." <br>
<p>
Conflicts in the Caucasus after the collapse of the Soviet Union also<br>
provided Hill with the opportunity to test his photographic skills in the<br>
context of war. In 1992, he found himself lying in a trench in Nagorny<br>
Karabakh while Armenian soldiers calmly tossed mortars at a nearby village.<br>
"When the Azeris arrived with their machine guns I remember lying there in<br>
the trench thinking that this had probably been a bad idea," he said. <br>
<p>
He is therefore relieved that he hasn't had to spend a vast amount of time<br>
covering Chechnya. "I'm a coward," he said. "I only go down there in the off<br>
-season." <br>
<p>
Since relocating to Moscow in Oct. 1995, Hill has worked full-time for The<br>
New York Times as a photographer. Such positions exist in only two other New<br>
York Times bureaus in the world. The tendency of the paper to "invest time<br>
and resources in in-depth feature work" suits Hill down to the ground. "I<br>
like people-based stories" he said. "People wear their souls on their sleeves<br>
here. You can get very close to people like you can't in other societies. It<br>
makes for a good photo." <br>
<p>
At the same time, Hill is continuing to work on a photo feature that takes a<br>
look behind the scenes of a Russian circus. He wants to capture an image of<br>
the circus quite distinct from the bright lights and gaudy costumes. "The<br>
circus is in a bad way" he mused. "The only people left are those who<br>
couldn't get a foreign contract." <br>
<p>
Hill is also quick to dispel the glamourous myth associated with<br>
photojournalism. "Everyone thinks this is a really sexy job, but there are<br>
some incredibly boring points too," he said. One recent feature and<br>
particular low point saw Hill photographing the cyrillic writing on an<br>
uninspiring shampoo bottle for a story on a Western company's arrival in the<br>
Russian market. <br>
<p>
Hill thinks he would like to spend some time in Asia next, probably China,<br>
but adds that he doubts he will remain a photographer all his life. <br>
<p>
"On the whole, I think photojournalism is in bad shape" he said.<br>
"Paradoxically, the quality of the work has never been higher, but the regard<br>
in which it is held has never been lower." <br>
<p>
Television, due to the speed of its publication, is usurping much of the<br>
power of the photograph according to Hill. He describes the now-famous photo<br>
taken by Eddie Adams in 1968: The chief of the Saigon police is holding a<br>
pistol to the head of the Viet Cong's leader. "It shocked the world," he<br>
said. "I wonder if a photograph will ever change history again." <br>

1. HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH SAYS GOVERNMENT INTOLERENT OF OPPOSITION<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON-Human Rights Watch/Helsinki recently issued its 1997 <br>
World Report in which it severely criticized the authorities in <br>
Armenia for their intolerance toward opposition forces, and <br>
condemned the election irregularities and post-election arrests of <br>
opposition leaders.<br>
	Amnesty International last week also published a report <br>
regarding ill-treatment and torture in Armenian prisons [see <br>
Asbarez 11/29-30/96].<br>
	These two reports are but a few telling examples of <br>
international concern over recent deviation from human rights <br>
practices and should sound an alarm regarding continuing abuses in <br>
Armenia.<br>
	Below is the entire text of the Human Rights Watch World <br>
Report chapter on Armenia:<br>
<p>
Human Rights Developments<br>
	The government crackdown on the political opposition in <br>
September 1996 cast a pall on human rights. Given the 1995 ban on <br>
the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Armenias largest <br>
opposition party, and fraudulent 1995 parliamentary elections, the <br>
1996 crackdown accentuated the governments intolerance of any <br>
real political opposition. The crackdown followed massive <br>
demonstrations on September 25 protesting election fraud in the <br>
September 22 presidential elections, in which incumbent Levon Ter-<br>
Petrosyan defeated Vazgen Manoukian by nine percentage points. <br>
Demonstrators marched to the Parliament, where the Central <br>
Election Commission (CEC) was housed, and broke through gates to <br>
demand a recount. In the process, they beat Speaker Babken <br>
Ararktsian and Deputy Speaker Ara Sahakian. In response, police <br>
brutally beat demonstrators and later arrested at least twenty-<br>
eight opposition leaders and supporters and CEC staffers. Among <br>
them, according to credible reports, Aghassi Arshakian, Kim <br>
Balayan, David Vartanian, Gagik Mgrtchian, and Aramazd Zakaryan, <br>
were brutally beaten; the latter required hospitalization for a <br>
fractured skull and broken nose and ribs. Attorneys for some of <br>
the detained, notably ARF leader Ruben Hakopian, were not <br>
permitted access to their clients. <br>
	In the wake of these events, police detained about 200 more <br>
individuals believed to have participated in the demonstration, <br>
President Ter-Petrosyan banned public demonstrations and called in <br>
army troops to patrol Yerevan, and the Procurator General <br>
announced his intention to press charges of attempting violently <br>
to overthrow the government against Vazgen Manoukian and seven <br>
other opposition leaders. Police closed the offices of the <br>
National Democratic Union (Vazgen Manoukians party), the National <br>
Self-Determination Union (a tiny opposition party), the Union of <br>
Constitutional Rights (a nationalist party)  and Artsakh-Hayastan <br>
(an organization for the promotion of Karabakh issues). This <br>
crushing of opposition forces bore out Defense Minister Vazgen <br>
Sargsyans September 25 warning that "After [the September 25] <br>
events, even if they win 100 percent of the votes, neither the <br>
Army nor the National Security and Interior Ministry would <br>
recognize such political leaders."<br>
	Credible reports indicate that electoral violations did not <br>
occur in those precincts monitored by international observers; <br>
however, in the majority of districts without international <br>
observers, no local observers were allowed, dead people and minors <br>
miraculously appeared on lists of voters, soldiers were bused in <br>
with orders to vote for Ter-Petrosyan and ballot boxes were <br>
reportedly stuffed. The elections failed to win the approval of <br>
the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observer Mission, which concluded that <br>
"very serious breaches" in the voting raised concern "for the <br>
overall integrity of the election process."<br>
	The ARF remained banned throughout 1996, while the Ministry <br>
of Justice reviewed its request for reinstatement. At the latest <br>
hearing (September 12), the Ministry of Justice rejected the ARFs <br>
registration papers, claiming that they lacked the requisite <br>
minutes of the ARFs founding Congress. As of this writing the <br>
process has not been completed.<br>
	The trial of Vahan Hovanessian, the ARF chair, and thirty <br>
other ARF members (also known as the "Dro" trial, after the name <br>
of an alleged secret armed section within the ARF that is charged <br>
with planning to overthrow the Armenian government) dragged on <br>
and, as of this writing, more than a year after its opening, has <br>
reached no conclusion. In a stunning display of bias, the Supreme <br>
Court judge presiding over the case accused two of the defense <br>
attorneys who had participated in a USAID trip to the US of having <br>
been funded for the trip by the defendants families.<br>
	The Armenian Ministry of Defense continued illegally to <br>
draft refugees from Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh into the army <br>
and refused to give draft-aged boys obligatory travel passes until <br>
they registered with their local draft board. Local draft boards <br>
on several occasions held hostage the parents of missing soldiers <br>
until the latter returned. In April, the Ministry of Justice <br>
attempted to close Azg, the Ramkavar party daily, claiming that it <br>
needed to re-register under the auspices of the Diaspora Ramkavar <br>
party, which is pro-Ter-Petrosyan. The effort was unsuccessful.<br>
<p>
The Right to Monitor<br>
	The Ministry of Justice refused to register the Committee <br>
for the Defense of Political Prisoners, basing its decision on its <br>
view that since there were no political prisoners in Armenia, such <br>
an organization was unnecessary.<br>
<p>
The Role of the <br>
International Community<br>
<p>
Europe<br>
	In 1996 European institutions sought to include Armenia as <br>
part of an all-Caucasus strategy. In May the Council of Europes <br>
committee of ministers voted in favor of having the Parliamentary <br>
Assembly consider Armenias application for membership. In <br>
response to the September events, the council dispatched a mission <br>
to Armenia in early October. The European Union had been scheduled <br>
to sign an interim agreement underlying a broad trade and <br>
cooperation agreement. It postponed a trip to Yerevan, where the <br>
signature ceremony was to take place, citing "security reasons."<br>
<p>
United States<br>
	The second largest per-capita recipient of US aid, Armenia <br>
received US $95 million for FY 1996 under the Freedom Support Act, <br>
a 100 percent increase in assistance since 1995. The Clinton <br>
Administrations reaction to the September events marked an <br>
abdication of its responsibility towards human rights in a country <br>
in which it has a significant investment. The State Departments <br>
initial weak statement in response to the crackdown, which merely <br>
called on both sides to exercise restraint, demonstrated a feigned <br>
ignorance of government practices, exercised throughout the past <br>
two years, aimed at cutting the opposition out of mainstream <br>
politics. A later statement expressed "concern for the future of <br>
those arrested."<br>
	The Clinton administrations response is even more <br>
inexcusable, given the scrupulous work of the US Embassy staff in <br>
Yerevan, which monitored the "Dro" trial, met with the relatives <br>
of opposition leaders arrested in the wake of the crackdown, and <br>
generally is extremely well informed on human rights violations. <br>
	Two high-level State Department visits were devoted to <br>
regional security and Nagorno Karabakh, and neither had a domestic <br>
politics or human rights component. <br>
	The State Department did, however, acknowledge obvious <br>
cracks in Armenias democracy in its Country Reports on Human <br>
Rights Practices for 1995 and in a July 30 congressional hearing <br>
on the Caucasus. Additionally, on October 22, the Department of <br>
State called on the Armenian government to adhere to OSCE <br>
recommendations concerning the election law, but again failed to <br>
take the government to task for the brutal crackdown.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. ANCA ISSUES STATEMENT ON LISBON SUMMIT<br>
<p>
We welcome the stand in defense of Nagorno-Karabakh adopted by the <br>
Republic of Armenia during the recently concluded Lisbon summit of <br>
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.<br>
	Exercising its right to veto language in the final summit <br>
declaration, the Armenian government prevented the ratification, <br>
by the OSCE, of the Azerbaijani position that the Republic of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh would be subordinate to Azerbaijani sovereignty. <br>
This action was fully consistent with previous decisions adopted <br>
by the Armenian Parliament.<br>
	We share the Armenian governments view that the only <br>
guarantee for the security of Nagorno-Karabakh is its right to <br>
self-determination. Any resolution to the conflict which does not <br>
fully respect this right will lead to increased regional <br>
instability and will place the Armenian population of Karabakh <br>
under the constant threat of genocide.<br>
	In remaining committed to Karabakhs right to self-<br>
determination, the Republic of Armenia resisted heavy pressures <br>
from Western states and the countries of the region. In the wake <br>
of this summit, these pressures will surely increase, fueled by <br>
the short-sighted efforts of the Caspian oil lobby. This fact was <br>
evident in the decidedly unbalanced statement of the Swiss OSCE <br>
Chairman-in-Office, which called for Nagorno-Karabakh to be placed <br>
under Azerbaijani rule.<br>
	We are confident that the collective leadership of the <br>
Armenian nation will rise to meet and overcome these challenges. <br>
Working together, the Armenian government, the government of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh and the Diaspora are capable of countering the <br>
powerful interests arrayed against the Armenian nation. We, <br>
therefore, call on all Armenian-American organizations to join <br>
together in constructive partnership to advance the commonly held <br>
concerns of all Armenians, and to stand in solidarity with the <br>
people of Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>

3. KARABAKH FOREIGN MINISTRY CRITICIZES OSCE CHAIRMAN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The Foreign Ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
Republic issued a statement Friday on this weeks two-day Lisbon <br>
Summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.<br>
	Below is the full text of the statement:<br>
	"The Foreign Ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh was puzzled to <br>
hear the OSCE chairmans statement at the Lisbon Summit concerning <br>
the principles of settlement of the Karabakh conflict, based on <br>
the proposals by the OSCE Minsk Groups co-chairmanship.<br>
	By its content, the statement fully ignores international <br>
legal and historical aspects of the problem, by its form it <br>
contradicts the spirit and letter of the Minsk process, and  by <br>
the way it was adopted it is unacceptable for forums of such <br>
scale. That is why we view it as a defeat of the right, justice <br>
and common sense and a victory of the rude blackmail of <br>
Azerbaijan, which manipulates oil and other interests of some <br>
states.<br>
	In the course of the 20th century, the Armenian people, on <br>
several occasions, became the victim of geopolitical interests of <br>
world powers and experienced the horrors of genocide and <br>
deportation. We view the efforts, aimed at keeping Karabakhs <br>
people within a criminal state, which has been methodically <br>
annihilating this people as the continuation of an already <br>
familiar policy.<br>
	The people of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is consistently <br>
and persistently realizing its right to self-determination and <br>
rejects any attempts of arbitrary establishment of a hierarchy <br>
between equal international principles as a base for political and <br>
legal manipulations.<br>
	With this mind, the Foreign Ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh, <br>
confirming Karabakhs resoluteness to maintain the cease-fire and <br>
willingness to settle all disputes peacefully, expresses serious <br>
doubts in the sense of its participation in the process of <br>
negotiation, in which the proposals by the mediating side are <br>
based on an optional attitude toward  international norms and <br>
reflect the stance of only one of three sides to the conflict."<br>

	The week-long seminar, which began on Nov. 18, discussed <br>
ways of developing and expanding youth relations.<br>
	During his presentation, Khacherian acquainted participants <br>
with the ARF-YOs structure and activities, focusing on the <br>

6. KROUZIAN-ZEKARIAN SCHOOLS RAISES $100,000<br>
<p>
SAN FRANCISCO-Declaring "it always makes me feel so good when I <br>
write a check out to KZV Armenian School," Hank Torian, along with <br>
his wife Rita and their children, presented a check for $25,000 to <br>
Serpoug Sarkissian of the Krouzian-Zekarian Vasbouragan School <br>
Finance Committee. The occasion was the 16th Annual KZV Banquet <br>
held on the evening of Saturday, November 9. The Colonial Room of <br>
the St. Francis Hotel on Union Square was the elegant setting for <br>
this years banquet and silent auction which raised over $100,000 <br>
for the school, the only Armenian-American day school in Northern <br>
California.<br>
	Currently on a sabbatical in Armenia, retired Pastor of St. <br>
Gregory Armenian Apostolic Church, Rev. Datev Kaloustian, came <br>
especially for the banquet at the request of the Torians. Rev. <br>
Kaloustian praised the Torians for their commitment and unending <br>
generosity to KZV School. A prominent car dealer and Armenian <br>
philanthropist, Hank Torian was hailed as a classic American <br>
success story. A special letter of congratulations to the Torians <br>
was sent by US Representative Anna  G. Eshoo, the only member of <br>
Congress of Armenian descent.<br>
	Speakers for the evening included a member of the first <br>
graduating class of KZV, Garen Nazarian, who since graduating in <br>
1988, attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory, and graduated <br>
last May from the University of California at Berkeley with a BA <br>
in English. The son of Mr. and Mrs. Shahen and Anahid Nazarian, <br>
Garen attributed his academic success to those early years at KZV. <br>
KZV also proudly welcomed the esteemed educator Dr. Dikran <br>
Kouymjian as the honored guest speaker. Presently the William <br>
Saroyan and Krouzian Visiting Professor of Armenian Studies for <br>
the fall semester at UC Berkeley, Dr. Kouymjian is also the Haig <br>
and Isabel Berberian Professor of Armenian Studies and Director of <br>
the Kalfayan Center at Cal State Fresno. He is a well-known <br>
authority on Armenian history, art and literature.<br>
	The annual Banquet was co-chaired by Hildy Sarkissian and <br>
Cindy Krikorian. Hilda Basmajian chaired the Silent Auction which <br>
netted $13,000 and represented the generosity of many individuals <br>
and businesses in the community. Auction items ranged from fine <br>
jewelry, travel, sports memorabilia, fine art, home furnishings <br>
and personal services. Other committee members were Serpoug <br>
Sarkissian and Jack Koujakian of the KZV Finance Committee, Hasmig <br>
Boudaghian, Jeanne Hartunian, Marie Kilijian, Vergine Misserlian <br>
and Talin Kaloustian. Assadour Kevranian served as the Master of <br>
Ceremonies.<br>

DFAT RESPONDS TO ANC-Australia CONCERNS REGARDING THE 1996 ARMENIAN<br>
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION<br>
<p>
CANBERRA - The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has<br>
responded to the concerns voiced by the ANCA regarding developments<br>
surrounding recent presidential elections in the Republic of Armenia.<br>
<p>
In a letter addressed to the Australian Foreign Minister, the Honourable<br>
Alexander Downer, the ANCA expressed its "profound disquiet" both at the<br>
widespread ballot manipulation which had taken place during the Presidential<br>
election as well as the actions of the current government leadership in<br>
response to the widespread protests by the general populace in the aftermath<br>
of the election.<br>
<p>
Mr J.A. Benson, Assistant Secretary of the Europe and Eurasia Branch,<br>
replying on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, indicated to the<br>
ANCA that:<br>
<p>
"The (Australian) Government views the conclusions of the OSCE in regard to<br>
the recent election in Armenia with some concern, and is also disquieted by<br>
reports of heavy handed actions by the Armenian authorities in quelling<br>
popular protests in Yerevan in the aftermath of the elections."<br>
<p>
The Assistant Secretary went on further to state:<br>
<p>
"Against this background, we will be monitoring the situation in Armenia,<br>
and will look to opportunities to voice our concerns to the Armenian<br>
Government, and encourage it to ensure that the commitment to the democratic<br>
process in Armenia will be safeguarded."<br>

ANCA ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE OSCE LISBON SUMMIT<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC - The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) <br>
today released the following statement regarding the position on <br>
Nagorno Karabagh adopted by the Republic of Armenia during the <br>
recently concluded summit of the Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe in Lisbon, Portugal.  The final summit <br>
document did not mention Karabagh after Armenia threatened to veto <br>
language which indicated that the Karabagh should be subordinate to <br>
Azerbaijani sovereignty.<br>
__________________________________________________________________<br>
<p>
ANCA STATEMENT ON OSCE LISBON SUMMIT<br>
<p>
We welcome the stand in defense of Nagorno Karabagh adopted by the <br>
Republic of Armenia during the recently concluded Lisbon summit of <br>
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.<br>
<p>
Exercising its right to veto language in the final summit <br>
declaration, the Armenian government prevented the ratification, by <br>
the OSCE, of the Azerbaijani position that the Republic of Nagorno <br>
Karabagh would be subordinate to Azerbaijani sovereignty.  This <br>
action was fully consistent with previous decisions adopted by the <br>
Armenian Parliament.<br>
<p>
We share the Armenian government's view that the only guarantee for <br>
the security of Nagorno Karabagh is its right to self-<br>
determination.  Any resolution to the conflict which does not fully <br>
respect this right will lead to increased regional instability and <br>
will place the Armenian population of Karabagh under the constant <br>
threat of genocide.<br>
<p>
In remaining committed to Karabagh's right to self-determination, <br>
the Republic of Armenia resisted heavy pressures from Western <br>
states and the countries of the region.  In the wake of this <br>
summit, these pressures will surely increase, fueled by the short-<br>
sighted efforts of the Caspian oil lobby.  This fact was evident in <br>
the decidedly unbalanced statement of the Swiss OSCE Chairman-in-<br>
Office, which called for Nagorno Karabagh to be placed under <br>
Azerbaijani rule.<br>
<p>
We are confident that the collective leadership of the Armenian <br>
nation will rise to meet and overcome these challenges.  Working <br>
together, the Armenian government, the government of Nagorno <br>
Karabagh, and the Diaspora are capable of countering the powerful <br>
interests arrayed against the Armenian nation.  We, therefore, call <br>
on all Armenian American organizations to join together, in <br>
constructive partnership, to advance the commonly held concerns of <br>
all Armenians, and to stand in solidarity with the people of <br>
Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
<p>

Recently, the July 1996 California Bar Examination pass list was released<br>
by the State Bar of California. The statistics released indicate that six<br>
alumni of Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School were among those admitted<br>
to the State Bar. All were taking the Bar Examination for the first time.<br>
Anahid Gerovian, Raffi Shahinian, Karine Tebelekian, Taleen Simon, and<br>
Arsen Shaghig, all from the class of 1988 (representing 100 percent of<br>
students from that class who went to law school) and Harout Balian, a 1987<br>
graduate, were admitted to the Bar. <br>
<p>
"The sound academic base acquired by these students at Pilibos has<br>
undoubtedly served as a propelling force for their impressive achievement<br>
on the Bar," said Mr. Viken Yacoubian, principal of Rose and and Alex<br>
Pilibos Armenian School. "This group of our alumni represents approximately<br>
20% of the total number of Armenians who passed the July 1996 California<br>
Bar Examination. Of course, we are extremely  proud of them" added Mr.<br>
Yacoubian.<br>

ISTANBUL ("Lraper" 5 December 1996) - A Vatican delegation headed by<br>
Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council<br>
for the Unity of Christians, visited His Beatitude Karekin II,<br>

          THE ARMENIAN CHURCH IN KAYSERI (GESARIA), TURKEY REOPENED <br>
          FOR WORSHIP  <br>
                <br>
          ISTANBUL ("LRAper" 2/12/96)--Last weekend St. Gregory <br>
          Armenian Church of Kayseri (Gesaria) was officially reopened <br>
          by formal ceremonies presided by Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan, <br>
          Chairman of the Religious Council of the Armenian <br>
          Patriarchate of Constantinople. For a long time, the church <br>
          was closed due to renovations.<br>
           <br>
          Currently, the St. Gregory Armenian Church serves the <br>
          religious needs of the small Armenian communities spread in <br>
          central and Eastern Anatolia and on the banks of the Black <br>
          Sea. It is the only functioning Armenian Church in the area. <br>
          The church in Kayseri (Cappadocian Ceasarea) already existed <br>
          in 1191. Since the early centuries of Christianity, <br>
          Armenians have been active in this city which was an       <br>
          important commercial center in Asia Minor.<br>
           <br>
          According to Turkish encyclopedias, in 1890 there were <br>
          43,318 Apostolic Armenians in the province of Kayseri, 1,800 <br>
          Armenian Protestants and 1,575 Armenian Catholics.  Today <br>
          only 10 Armenians live in Kayseri. However, St. Gregory <br>
          Church serves as the religious center for about 3,000 <br>
          Armenians living in central Anatolia and the Eastern <br>
          provinces.<br>
           <br>
          On the Way to Kayseri<br>
           <br>
          Renovated in memory of Gesaria-native Hagop Tokerian, the <br>
          reopening of St. Gregory Church was decreed by the Armenian <br>
          Patriarch of Turkey, Archbishop Karekin II Kazanjian.  <br>
                <br>
          On Thursday, November 30, over 400 Armenian pilgrims from <br>
          Istanbul headed to Gesaria on nine buses; they  were later <br>
          joined by another 30 pilgrims who traveled to the region by <br>
          plane. Others came from Ankara, Sepastia, Malatya, Tokat and <br>
          the villages of Yozgat to participate in the opening <br>
          ceremonies. Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan and his entourage    <br>
          of priests and lay representative arrived on Friday and were <br>
          greeted by the representative of St. Gregory Church, <br>
          Antranik Erkouyoumjian and other officials.<br>
           <br>
          Upon their arrival, the delegation from the Patriarchate <br>
          visited the church and inspected the results of the <br>
          renovations that were carried out and discussed the schedule <br>
          of weekend activities.<br>
           <br>
          On Saturday morning, the delegation, headed by Archbishop <br>
          Mesrob, visited the historic sites of Goreme, Urgupi and the <br>
          famous churches of the region. In the afternoon, an <br>
          elaborate ceremony of "Opening the Doors of the Church" <br>
          (T'rnpatzek) was held in St. Gregory Church in the presence <br>
          of more than 500 Armenian faithful.  Archbishop Mesrob       <br>
          consecrated the three altars of the church and the baptismal <br>
          font. The wood-carved altars and the delicate frescos inside <br>
          the church, which were carefully restored to their original <br>
          brilliance, testify to the fine artistry of Armenian <br>
          masters.<br>
           <br>
          On this occasion, Archbishop Mesrob delivered a sermon <br>
          highlighting the importance of the reopening of the St. <br>
          Gregory Church.  He recounted the historic event when St. <br>
          Gregory the Illuminator, the patron saint of the Armenian <br>
          Church, was consecrated the Head of the Armenian Apostolic <br>
          Church, here in Gesaria in the 4th century, by Leontius, the <br>
          Archbishop of Ceasarea.  As such, Gesaria has a significant <br>
          role in the history of the Armenian Church, especially as    <br>
          we prepare for the celebrations of the 1700th anniversary of<br>
          acceptance of Christianity as state religion in Armenia. <br>
          Based on a passage from the Book of Psalms, Archbishop <br>
          Mesrob then explained the importance of temples build for <br>
          the glory of God and how the faithful, collectively, <br>
          contribute to the edification of a `holy place' where <br>
          pilgrims experience the presence of God.  <br>
          <br>
          The reopening of the church in Kayseri coincided with the <br>
          535th anniversary of the founding of the Armenian <br>
          Patriarchate of Constantinople.  In 1461, Sultan Mehmet II, <br>
          eight years after conquering Constantinople, established the <br>
          Armenian Patriarchate with equal rights and privileges as <br>
          that of the Greek Patriarchate.  The mayor of Kayseri, <br>
          acting in the same spirit as Mehmet II, has not only <br>
          permitted the renovation of the Armenian church, but has <br>
          also allocated financial resources to build a high       <br>
          stone-fence around the Armenian cemetery of Kayseri.<br>
           <br>
          The mayor of Kayseri, Dr. ShukrU Karatepe, was present <br>
          during the consecration ceremonies of the church. After the <br>
          religious services, in the courtyard of the church, the <br>
          mayor welcomed Archbishop Mesrob and greeted the opening of <br>
          the Armenian Church in Kayseri with warm words.  He <br>
          emphasized that it would be wrong to look at this event<br>
          from a "touristic point of view", but rather the importance <br>
          of this event rests in the peaceful coexistence of Christian <br>
          and Moslem peoples. "In the past, we have passed through sad <br>
          events together, but today, the time has come to build <br>
          strong bridges between various communities", said the mayor.<br>
           <br>
          In his response, Archbishop Mesrob, after thanking the <br>
          mayor, said: "There is no formal inter-religious dialogue in <br>
          Turkey between the leaders of various religions, however, we <br>
          notice that there is a dialogue of life among our peoples in <br>
          their day to day relations with each other, which is very<br>
          important for mutual understanding and for future steps <br>
          toward formal dialogue".<br>
           <br>
          Visit to the Armenian Cemetery  <br>
          <br>
          At 3:00 p.m. on the same day, Archbishop Mesrob, in the <br>
          company of the mayor and several hundred Armenian pilgrims, <br>
          visited the Armenian cemetery in Kayseri.  A requiem service <br>
          was conducted for the departed souls of the Armenians of the <br>
          city.  Archbishop Mesrob said that the cemetery looked in <br>
          better condition. Recently, the municipality of Kayseri has <br>
          appointed a full-time custodian for the cemetery.  Mayor<br>
          Karatepe expressed his willingness to enhance the efforts of <br>
          Armenians if they wish to renovate the cemetery and the old <br>
          graves.  After the cemetery visit, Archbishop Mesrob <br>
          returned to Istanbul.  <br>
          <br>
          Divine Liturgy and Blessing of Madagh  <br>
          <br>
          On Sunday, December 1, Divine Liturgy was celebrated in St. <br>
          Gregory Church, presided by Fr. Aram Vartabed Ateshian.  The <br>
          Blessing of Madagh and requiem services followed the <br>
          Liturgy.  <br>
                <br>
          Henceforth, the Armenian Patriarchate will send visiting <br>
          priests to Kayseri on a regular basis to conduct religious <br>
          services and to minister to the needs of the Armenian <br>
          communities in the region.  <br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 235, Part I, 6 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN-CLINTON SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR MARCH. During a 20-minute phone
conversation on 5 December, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
American counterpart Bill Clinton agreed to hold a summit meeting next
March, Russian and Western agencies reported. Russian presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembskii did not give an exact date or location,
although he said Washington, D.C. was the most likely site for the
meeting. The White House also confirmed the March summit, but gave no
further details. Yeltsin and Clinton last met in April 1996 during the
Moscow nuclear safety summit. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RYBKIN IN GROZNY. Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin,
together with his deputies Boris Berezovskii and Leonid Mayorov,
traveled to Grozny on 5 December to attend sessions of various
commissions, ITAR-TASS and Reuters reported. Rybkin termed the
parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 27 January
Chechnya's internal affair, but said that the Russian leadership had
contacted various international organizations that would monitor the
voting. Rybkin also gave the Chechen leadership various draft documents
on power sharing between Moscow and Grozny. Also on 5 December, Russian
Television (Channel 2) reported that Adam Deneyev, chairman of the
social-political movement For the National Rebirth of the Chechen People
and Chechnya, has stated his intention of running for the Chechen
presidency, raising the number of candidates to seven. Field commander
Salman Raduev will run for vice president, but it is not clear as whose
deputy, according to NTV. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
LEBED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR IN TULA? The Tula Oblast Duma has decided that
gubernatorial elections in the oblast will be held on 23 March, ITAR-
TASS reported on 5 December. The agency claimed that former Security
Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed intends to contest the office,
although Lebed has been coy about whether he will stand for the
position. The oblast duma rejected a proposal by some deputies to
postpone setting an election date until the Russian Constitutional Court
rules on a Federation Council appeal which challenges the oblast
legislature's legitimacy. It was elected earlier this year on the basis
of a gubernatorial directive, which the Federation Council claims
violated federal legislation. In the December 1995 Duma elections, Lebed
won a seat in Tula which he gave up after becoming Security Council
Secretary. -- Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
IMBROGLIO OVER GROUND FORCES COMMANDER CONTINUES. The scandal
surrounding Defense Minister Igor Rodionov's still unresolved attempt to
dismiss Army Gen. Vladimir Semenov intensified on 5 December, Russian
media reported. A meeting of the presidential commission on top military
ranks the previous day failed to make any final decision on Semenov's
sacking, and it still remains unclear if Semenov will be removed or on
what grounds. After a meeting with Presidential Deputy Chief of Staff
Evgenii Savostyanov to discuss the charges against him on 5 December,
Semenov said he was now being blamed for the failure of the Russian
military in Chechnya. He rejected this charge, and dismissed as "absurd"
continuing allegations that he was involved in illegal sales of military
helicopters. Semenov told NTV that the atmosphere surrounding his
dismissal resembled that of the 1930s Stalinist purges, when people were
repressed on the basis of unsubstantiated denunciations. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
FEDERATION COUNCIL CLAIMS SEVASTOPOL. At its 5 December session, the
Federation Council passed by 110-14 (with seven abstentions) a
resolution authored by Moscow Mayor Yurii Luzhkov claiming the Crimean
port of Sevastopol as Russian territory, Russian and Western media
reported. The resolution condemned what it termed "unilateral" attempts
by Ukraine to "tear away" Sevastopol from Russia, and called for
bilateral negotiations to settle the city's status. Luzhkov has for
months been publicly contending that Sevastopol was not legally
transferred to Ukraine in 1954 along with the rest of Crimea. Evgenii
Savchenko, the governor of Belgorod oblast, which borders on Ukraine,
unsuccessfully opposed the resolution, NTV reported. He argued that
claiming Sevastopol would set a "bad precedent," and encourage other
states to challenge Russia's 1991 borders. The Russian government, which
has repeatedly insisted that it has no claims on Sevastopol, will
probably ignore the non-binding resolution. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
PRIMAKOV ON BOSNIA, YUGOSLAVIA. Speaking at the London conference on
Bosnia on 5 December, Foreign Minister Yevgenii Primakov said that the
peace process was "moving in the right direction," ITAR-TASS reported.
Taking Moscow's traditional pro-Serb stance, and implicitly accusing the
West of favoring the Bosnian and Croat factions, however, Primakov said
the peace process was threatened by "the unbalanced attitude of the
international community," saying that all sides in the conflict should
receive equal treatment "in terms of getting economic support ... and in
terms of punishment." Primakov also condemned as "clumsy threats,"
Western warnings that economic sanctions might be re-imposed if the
Serbian government of Slobodan Milosevic cracks down on demonstrators
protesting the recent annulment of opposition victories in local
elections. He claimed that Milosevic's role in the peace process is "a
very important factor." -- Scott Parrish
<p>
YELTSIN ON CIS FIFTH ANNIVERSARY. In an interview marking the fifth
anniversary of the 8 December 1991 creation of the CIS, President
Yeltsin said it had been the only way "to save what could be saved" from
the collapse of the USSR, Russian and Western agencies reported on 5
December. While admitting that the CIS has many faults, Yeltsin called
for faster and more effective CIS integration. He held up Russian
cooperation with Belarus as a "vivid" example of integration's benefits,
although he conceded that problems have plagued the Russo-Belarusian
customs union. Yeltsin insisted that the CIS integration process is
voluntary, and would not lead to the resurrection of the USSR. He also
reiterated his opposition to NATO expansion, but said that CIS military
cooperation is not intended as a counterweight to the alliance. -- Scott
Parrish

MEDIA CRACKDOWN IN AZERBAIJAN. The speaker of Azerbaijan's Milli Mejlis
(parliament), Murtuz Alesqerov, on 3 December gave instructions that the
accreditation of Azadlyg journalist Azer Huseynbala be revoked, and
warned other opposition journalists that their accreditation will also
be revoked if they publish materials "that show parliament in a bad
light," Turan reported on 5 December. Parliamentary correspondents for
opposition papers decided on 5 December to take turns in supplying
coverage of the proceedings of the Milli Mejlis for publication in
Azadlyg, the newspaper of the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front. --

<p>
GEORGIA TO CREATE ITS OWN NAVY? Speaking at a press conference in
Tbilisi on 5 December, Georgian Foreign Minister Irakli Menagharishvili
said the country's present level of economic development is adequate to
finance a navy, which he said would be used exclusively to protect
Georgia's maritime borders, ITAR-TASS reported. Visiting Kyiv in
September, Menagharishvili had submitted to the Ukrainian government an
official claim by the Georgian leadership to part of the Black Sea
Fleet, and Ukraine's ambassador in Tbilisi, Anatolii Kasyanenko,
recently told Svobodnaya Gruziya that Ukraine supports this request. --

KAZAKSTAN WILL DEVELOP CASPIAN DEPOSITS IN 1997. Despite lack of
agreement between the five littoral states, Kazakstani Oil and Gas
Minister Nurlan Balginbayev announced his country would begin oil
production in the Caspian Sea in 1997, RFE/RL reported on 5 December.
Balginbayev said the organizations involved in the international
consortium will sign a production-sharing agreement in the near future
and work will start shortly after that. Companies with shares in the
project are Agip, British Gas, British Petroleum, Statoil, Mobil and
Total. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
TROUBLES FOR UN OBSERVERS IN TAJIKISTAN. The UN Mission of Observers in
Tajikistan (UNMOT) issued a press release on 3 December, condemning the
treatment of its people by members of the Tajik government's military,
Nezavisimaya Gazeta and RFE/RL reported. According to UNMOT, three of
its officials sent to the Garm area to report on the fighting there were
stopped by government troops at the Chorsada post where they were
physically abused and threatened with their lives. In order to return to
the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, the three had to travel first to
Kyrgyzstan. The United Tajik Opposition is cited by UN Special Envoy to
Tajikistan Gerd Merrem as being instrumental in procuring safe passage
through opposition-held territory en route to Kyrgyzstan. The Tajik
government apologized and claimed the incident was the action of
individuals and promised to investigate the matter. UNMOT has reportedly
recalled all its representatives to Dushanbe. -- Bruce Pannier

MASS PROTESTS CONTINUE IN SERBIA . . . For the 17th consecutive day,
protesters gathered in Belgrade and other cities throughout Serbia on 5
December to protest the government decision to nullify the 17 November
local election results, local independent media reported. The opposition
Zajedno coalition had scored significant victories in those elections.
Nasa Borba estimated that 150,000 people were out in the Serbian capital
on 5 December. Some demonstrators threw paper planes at landmarks such
as the RTS broadcasting facility and the Politika publishing house.
Others lit candles to the memory of truth and freedom, which, they said,
were extinguished by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's regime. --

<p>
. . . AND BEGIN TO HAVE IMPACT. In one of several developments signaling
that the government is succumbing to public pressure, Belgrade's
election commission has requested that the Supreme Court ruling
validating the annulment of the 17 November returns be re-examined, Nasa
Borba reported on 6 December. The regime has also lifted its crackdown
on the independent media covering the demonstrations. Belgrade's Radio B
92 is back on the air after being taken off for two days. Finally,
Reuters on 6 December reported that one prominent member of the ruling
Socialist Party of Serbia who did not wish to be named said the
authorities were preparing to "ease tensions" and recognize opposition
victories in Nis, the second-largest city in Serbia. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
LONDON CONFERENCE ON BOSNIA ENDS . . . The two-day international meeting
to take stock of the implementation of the Dayton agreement ended on 5
December, international and regional media reported. Commentators noted
that one of the gathering's main accomplishments was that the Serbs sat
down with the Muslims and Croats as one delegation, but it is unclear
whether the inter-entity cooperation will go much beyond that. British
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned the three parties that they are
responsible for their own future and that the international community
has neither the will nor the intent to provide open-ended military or
economic support. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said that he
expects military assistance to last up to another two years and economic
help at least another ten. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
. . . FOLLOWING ADOPTION OF NEW AGENDA. The conference heard much tough
talk about the need to catch war criminals, but Judge Louise Arbour of
the Hague-based tribunal noted that cooperation on the ground is
"severely lacking." Additional responsibilities will be given to the
international community's High Representative, Carl Bildt, but catching
war criminals will still be dependent on the cooperation of the local
authorities. The conference also adopted a new timetable to implement
concrete provisions of the Dayton agreement, many of which are overdue.
Local elections must now be completed in summer 1997 and the arms
reduction program by 31 October. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
BOSNIA, CROATIA GRANTED LOANS FOR RECONSTRUCTION. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development on 5 December signed a $32.7 million loan
with Bosnia-Herzegovina to improve the war-damaged Sarajevo airport and
roads and bridges throughout the country, Reuters reported. Officials
said it was the first loan to be signed by both Bosnia's Serb and
Muslim-Croat entities. But the international community warned that they
would not support the country's economy forever. They also stressed
future aid would depend on how the Bosnian sides comply with the Dayton
peace agreement. Meanwhile, Croatia and the World Bank on 4 December
signed a $102 million loan agreement on the reconstruction of road
networks and mine clearance in Croatia, Hina reported. -- Daria Sito

CROATIAN JOURNALISTS' ASSOCIATION CRITICIZES UN. The Croatian
Journalists' Association on 5 December accused the UN of doing nothing
to protect Croatian journalists at a Serb-led demonstration the previous
day in the town of Vukovar, in eastern Slavonia (see OMRI Daily Digest,
5 December 1996), AFP reported. The journalists have sent a protest
letter to UN administrator for eastern Slavonia Jacques Klein saying
that "if the UN invites us to cover an event, their officials should
guarantee the security of journalists." In other news, the Croatian
Journalists' Union has said that pressure on and threats to journalists
have increased since Croatia was admitted to the Council of Europe,
Vecernji List reported on 6 December. Also, the Croatian official media
have begun a campaign against journalists who work for the foreign
media, accusing them of being communist agents paid to create "a poor
image of Croatia in Europe," AFP reported on 5 December. -- Daria Sito

<p>
ENVER HOXHA'S SON-IN-LAW TO REMAIN IN PRISON. Klement Kolaneci, son-in-
law of late communist dictator Enver Hoxha, is to remain in prison
pending trial for alleged membership in the Revenge for Justice
terrorist group, Koha Jone reported on 6 December. A Tirana court the
previous day upheld an earlier ruling. Kolaneci's lawyers said that
Prosecutor Isa Jata did not present any evidence against Kolaneci and
argued that Kolaneci should continue to be detained on charges of
"forming an armed gang." Meanwhile, the court has ruled that Robert
Kallanxhi, who is also a suspected Revenge for Justice member, is to
remain in prison pending trial for forging car documents. Lawyers claim
that the prosecutors neither questioned Kallanxhi nor produced any
evidence. -- Fabian Schmidt

HEADLINE: Turkey cancels SuperCobra deal over U.S. delay<br>
SOURCE: The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, December 4, 1996<br>
<p>
The government of Turkey has withdrawn an order for 10 AH-1W SuperCobra<br>
attack helicopters from Bell Helicopter because of a 19-month delay in<br>
getting approval for the sale from the U.S. State Department.<br>
<p>
The State Department has expressed concern about Turkey's treatment of its<br>
Kurdish population, and has not sent the agreement, worth up to $150 million<br>
in sales to Bell, to Congress as required by law.<br>
<p>
State Department spokesman Christopher Bush declined to comment on the<br>
matter, saying "We haven't been given guidance on this matter except to say<br>
that the decision to cancel the sale was by the Turkish military."<br>
<p>
The Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., while acknowledging that the country<br>
has some human rights problems, suggested that lobbying by Greek interests<br>
had scuttled the sale. <br>
<p>
"There are always complaints from the Greek interests when the Turkish armed<br>
forces want to make a purchase, and their voices are quite strong in American<br>
politics," said Mehmet Gucuk, politcal counsel in the Turkish Embassy.<br>
<p>
Gucuk noted that Turkey is a member of NATO. It has made several purchases of<br>
American military hardware over the years, including helicopters from Bell.<br>
It has also bought 150 F-16s from Lockheed Martin Corp. The Turkish F-16s are<br>
assembled at a plant in Ankara, and some have been sold to Egypt.<br>
<p>
Bell expressed disappointment with the loss of the sale. Vice President Fred<br>
Hubbard said the decision was "hard to take." <br>
<p>
Hubbard said the lost sale was the result of "U.S. government inaction," and<br>
that it would give Bell's competitors in France and Russia a foothold for<br>
sales to the Turkish army.<br>
<p>
"Bell has enjoyed its long-term relationship with the Turkish Land Command,"<br>
Hubbard said. "The Turkish military operates a preponderance of Bell<br>
helicopters."<br>
<p>
Bell spokesman Terry Arnold said the company doesn't release specific sales<br>
or volume figures to foreign countries. <br>
<p>
Arnold added that because of the present strong backlog of orders, Bell's<br>
6,000-person work force will not be reduced because of the loss of the sale.<br>
Bell recently received an order from the U.S. Marines for the upgrade of 180<br>
SuperCobras, a deal that will be worth around $1 billion and keep Bell's<br>
production lines busy through 2012.<br>
<p>
Bell was unable to proceed with the Turkish sale because the matter was never<br>
referred to Congress by the State Department. Under law, foreign sales must<br>
be referred to Congress, which may turn down a sale by a two-thirds vote of<br>
both houses. No congressional action on a request constitutes approval.<br>
<p>
"Usually, if there has been no disapproval within two weeks, then the sale is<br>
final," said Gucuk. "But it has to be sent to Congress, which never<br>
happened."<br>
<p>
Gucuk said the State Department has expressed concern to Turkey about its<br>
treatment of the Kurds, an ethnic minority in several southeast European and<br>
Middle Eastern states.<br>
<p>
"Every country has human rights problems, and we are trying to resolve our<br>
difficulties through our Parliament and the proper channels," said Gucuk.<br>
"But the issue shouldn't be connected with the purchase of military<br>
equipment. We have the second-largest army in NATO, and we are a member of<br>
several regional security<br>
alliances."<br>
<p>
Gucuk noted that Turkey is within range of missiles from potentially hostile<br>
states, such as Syria, Greece and Armenia. He added that "our military<br>
strategy is based entirely on defense."<br>
<p>
Gucuk left open the question about whether Turkey would be interested in<br>
future purchases from Bell.<br>
<p>
"The problem with the SuperCobra purchase was that we already had waited<br>
almost two years, and would have to wait another two years while the<br>
helicopters were in production," he said. "Meanwhile, the next generation of<br>
Cobras will become available after the turn of the century. So the matter<br>
became a decision about whether the purchase of the 10 SuperCobras would<br>
still be wise."<br>

<p>
HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH WORLD REPORT, 1997: ARMENIA (pages 198-199)<br>
<p>
Human Rights Developments<br>
	The government crackdown on the political opposition in <br>
September 1996 cast a pall on human rights.  Given the 1995 ban on <br>
the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), Armenia's largest <br>
opposition party, and fraudulent 1995 parliamentary elections, the <br>
1996 crackdown accentuated the government's intolerance of any real <br>
political opposition.  The crackdown followed massive <br>
demonstrations on September 25 protesting election fraud in the <br>
September 22 presidential elections, in which incumbent Levon Ter-<br>
Petrossian defeated Vazgen Manukyan by nine percentage points.  <br>
Demonstrators marched to the Parliament, where the Central Election <br>
Commission (CEC) was housed, and broke through gates to demand a <br>
recount.  In the process, they beat Speaker Babken Ararktsian and <br>
Deputy Speaker Ara Sahakian.  In response, police brutally beat <br>
demonstrators and later arrested at least twenty-eight opposition <br>
leaders and supporters and CEC staffers.  Among them, according to <br>
credible reports, Aghassi Arshakian, Kim Balayan, David Vartanian, <br>
Gagik Mgerchian, and Aramad Zarkaryan, were brutally beaten; the <br>
latter required hospitalization for a fractured skull and broken <br>
nose and ribs.  Attorneys for some of the detained, notably ARF <br>
leader Ruben Akopyan, were not permitted access to their clients.<br>
	In the wake of these events, police detained about 200 more <br>
individuals believed to have participated in the demonstration, <br>
President Ter-Petrossian banned public demonstrations and called in <br>
army troops to patrol Yerevan, and the Procurator General announced <br>
his intention to press charges of attempting violently to overthrow <br>
the government against Vazgen Manukyan and seven other opposition <br>
leaders.  Police closed the offices of the National Democratic <br>
Union (Vazgen Manukyan's party), the National Self-Determination <br>
Union (a tiny opposition party), the Union of Constitutional Rights <br>
(a nationalist party), and Artsakh-Hayastan (an organization for <br>
the promotion of Karabakh issues).  This crushing of opposition <br>
forces bore out Defense Minister Vazgen Sarkissian's September 25 <br>
warning that "After [the September 25] events, even if they win 100 <br>
percent of the votes, neither the Army nor the National Security <br>
and Interior Ministry would recognize such political leaders."<br>
	Credible reports indicate that electoral violations did not <br>
occur in those precincts monitored by international observers; <br>
however, in the majority of districts without international <br>
observers, no local observers were allowed, dead people and minors <br>
miraculously appeared on lists of voters, soldiers were bused in <br>
with orders to vote for Ter-Petrossian, and ballot boxes were <br>
reportedly stuffed.  The elections failed to win the approval of <br>
the OSCE ODIHR Election Observer Mission, which concluded that <br>
"very serious breaches" in the voting raised concern "for the <br>
overall integrity of the election process."<br>
	The ARF remained banned throughout 1996, while the Ministry <br>
of Justice reviewed its request for reinstatement.  At the latest <br>
hearing (September 12), the Ministry of Justice rejected the ARF's <br>
registration papers, claiming that they lacked the requisite <br>
minutes of the ARF's founding Congress.  As of this writing the <br>
process has not been completed.<br>
	The trial of Vahan Hohvannisian, the ARF chair, and thirty <br>
other ARF members (also known as the "DRO" trial, after the name of <br>
an alleged secret armed section within the ARF that is charged with <br>
planning to overthrow the Armenian government) dragged on and, as <br>
of this writing, more than a year after its opening, has reached no <br>
conclusion.  In a stunning display of bias, the Supreme Court judge <br>
presiding over the case accused two of the defense attorneys who <br>
had participated in a USAID trip to the U.S. of having been funded <br>
for the trip by the defendants' families.<br>
	The Armenian Ministry of Defense continued illegally to <br>
draft refugees from Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabagh into the army <br>
and refused to give draft-aged boys obligatory travel passes until <br>
they registered with their local draft board.  Local draft boards <br>
on several occasions held hostage the parents of missing soldiers <br>
until the latter returned.  In April, the Ministry of Justice <br>
attempted to close Azg, the Ramkavar party daily, claiming that it <br>
needed to re-register under the auspices of the diaspora Ramkavar <br>
party, which is pro-Ter-Petrossian.  The effort was unsuccessful.<br>
<p>
The Right to Monitor<br>
	The Ministry of Justice refused to register the Committee <br>
for the Defense of Political Prisoners, basing its decision on its <br>
view that since there were no political prisoners in Armenia, such <br>
an organization was unnecessary.<br>
<p>
The Role of the International Community<br>
<p>
Europe<br>
	In 1996 European institutions sought to include Armenia as <br>
part of an all-Caucasus strategy.  In May the Council of Europe's <br>
committee of ministers voted in favor of having the Parliamentary <br>
Assembly consider Armenia's application for membership.  In <br>
response to the September events, the council dispatched a mission <br>
to Armenia in early October.  The European Union had been scheduled <br>
to sign an interim agreement underlying a broad trade and <br>
cooperation agreement.  It postponed a trip to Yerevan, where the <br>
signature ceremony was to take place, citing "security reasons."<br>
<p>
United States<br>
	The second largest per-capita recipient of U.S. aid, Armenia <br>
received U.S. $95 million for FY 1996 under the Freedom Support <br>
Act, a 100 percent increase in assistance since 1995.  The Clinton <br>
Administration's reaction to the September events marked an <br>
abdication of its responsibility towards human rights in a country <br>
in which it has a significant investment.  The State Department's <br>
initial weak statement in response to the crackdown, which merely <br>
called on both sides to exercise restraint, demonstrated a feigned <br>
ignorance of government practices, exercised throughout the past <br>
two years, aimed at cutting the opposition out of mainstream <br>
politics.  A later statement expressed "concern for the future of <br>
those arrested."<br>
	The Clinton administration's response is even more <br>
inexcusable, given the scrupulous work of the U.S. embassy staff in <br>
Yerevan, which monitored the Dro trial, met with the relatives of <br>
opposition leaders arrested in the wake of the crackdown, and <br>
generally is extremely well informed on human rights violations.<br>
	Two high-level State Department visits were devoted to <br>
regional security and Nagorno Karabakh, and neither had a domestic <br>
politics or human rights component.  The State Department did, <br>
however, acknowledge obvious cracks in Armenia's democracy in its <br>
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995 and in a July 30 <br>
congressional hearing on the Caucasus.  Additionally, on October <br>
22, the Department of State called on the Armenian government to <br>
adhere to OSCE recommendations concerning the election law, but <br>
again failed to take the government to task for the brutal <br>
crackdown.<br>

<p>
<p>
2. LAWYER, EDITOR DISCUSS VIOLATIONS IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
PARIS-At the invitation of the France-based International <br>
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), attorney Rouben Sahakian, <br>
founder of Armenias "Avangard" Human Rights Organization, Edward <br>
Mamikonian, also an attorney affiliated with "Avangard," and Golos <br>
Armenii semi-weekly editor Flora Nakhshkarian were in Paris from <br>
Nov. 28 to Dec. 5, where they held meetings with governmental and <br>
non-governmental human rights groups, attorneys and the Armenian <br>
community.<br>
	During their week-long visit, the group met with members of <br>
the French Senate committee on French-Armenian relations, French <br>
Supreme Court representatives, French and Armenian attorneys, <br>
representatives of the European Parliaments Human Rights <br>
Organization, as well as the media.<br>
	Throughout their meetings the group focused attention to <br>
Armenias human rights record of the past five years, particularly <br>
the recent violations of human rights, political persecutions, <br>
obstacles to freedom of expression and the authoritarian regime <br>
currently in place in Armenia.<br>
	The grave human rights violations were also discussed during <br>
a gathering of the Armenian community in Paris on Dec. 4. The <br>
media and representatives of French public-political organizations <br>
also attended the gathering.<br>
	Historian Claire Mouradian presented a brief, yet <br>
comprehensive history of the Armenian people, highlighting the <br>
Armenian Genocide of 1915, the independent Republic of Armenia, <br>
1918-1920, the Karabakh Movement of 1988, and the re-establishment <br>
of Armenias independence in 1991 as a result of the collapse of <br>
the Soviet Union.<br>
	Mouradian also presented the gradual move toward <br>
authoritarian rule in Armenia, pointing to the suspension of the <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federations activities in Armenia, the <br>
shut down of nearly a dozen newspapers and other publications, and <br>
the crackdown following the Sept. 22 presidential elections, <br>
following which thousands of Armenians demanded the nullification <br>
of the controversial polls and pointed to the OSCE reports casting <br>
doubt on its legitimacy.<br>
	Following Mouradians presentation, attorney Michel <br>
Toubiana, vice-chairperson of the Human Rights League, recalled <br>
his 1995 visit to Armenia where he witnessed prisoners being <br>
denied access to their attorneys and trials that did not meet <br>
international legal standards.<br>
	Toubiana told the gathering that democracy is non-existent <br>
in Armenia and it is not possible to have  rule of law through an <br>
authoritarian regime which suspends political parties, shuts down <br>
newspapers and suppresses freedom of expression through the use of <br>
force.<br>
	Attorney Edward Mamikonian provided a brief background of <br>
the "Avangard" Human Rights Organization, which was established in <br>
1993, but was officially registered by the Armenian government in <br>
1994.<br>
	Mamikonian said that in Armenian today, even the most basic <br>
individual rights are being ignored. "The majority of the <br>
population wants to leave the country, not just for the desperate <br>
economic and social conditions, but because it is difficult to <br>
consider oneself a citizen protected by law," he said.<br>
	"The governing principles in Armenia today are guns and the <br>
use of force," Mamikonian said, pointing to similarities between <br>
events in September 1996 to those of 1993-1994 when armed groups <br>
broke in to homes, conscripting young men into the army without <br>
official draft papers or physical exams. "It happens today and it <br>
happened on Sept. 26.," he added. "Reminiscent of the Stalin era, <br>
the "Yergrabah" armed units [pro-government groups] stormed <br>
private residences, ransacked , beat, kidnapped and pillaged <br>
without sparing even the elderly," Mamikonian told the gathering.<br>
	He concluded by saying "today Armenias Constitution is <br>
under suspicion, there is virtually no parliamentary opposition, <br>
only an oppressed population and an illegitimate president."<br>
	Flora Nakhshkarian, the editor of the semi-weekly, <br>
independent Russian-language newspaper, spoke of the obstacles <br>
faced by Golos Armenii throughout its six-year history and said <br>
that Armenias leadership has attempted to thwart publication by <br>
every means, including shutting off the electricity in the <br>
building for extended periods and harassing and kidnapping several <br>
of its reporters and editors. "But with a clear conscious we <br>
struggled and survived and continue to tell the truth," she said.<br>
	Referring to the harassment and illegal detention of <br>
correspondent Gagik Mkrtchian, Nakhshkarian said that he was <br>
forced out of his apartment by two high-ranking military <br>
personnel, one of whom was the head of Levon Ter-Petrosyans <br>
security team and the other an Interior Ministry official. <br>
"Mkrtchians only wrongdoing was being a Golos Armenii <br>
correspondent," she said.<br>
	Rouben Sahakian, defense attorney in the so-called "Dro" and <br>
"31" cases began his presentation by pointing to a blatant <br>
contradiction between the Armenian Constitution and the status <br>
quo.<br>
	"The very first article of the Constitution declares that <br>
the government of Armenia will be based on democracy and the rule <br>
of law. However, the opposite is true of Armenia today. Not only <br>
is there an absence of democracy and an independent judiciary, the <br>
judicial system is packed with incompetent and inexperienced <br>
judges and personnel that are not familiar with basic judicial <br>
tenets," Sahakian said.<br>
	Sahakian pointed to the massive violations of judicial <br>
procedures in the infamous "Trial of 31" and "Dro" cases, whose <br>
defendants have been baselessly charged with crimes and are <br>
subjected to inhumane prison conditions. "Most of them are the <br>
heads of households and have several children each, which are in <br>
dire financial straits," Sahakian said. "For example, Armen <br>
Shahinian and two others have been in jail for the past two years, <br>
accused of taking part in a gang without informing the <br>
authorities. Their trial is expected to begin in March 1997 and <br>
will last about six months. Based on the charges and according to <br>
the law, they should have been released to await trial a long time <br>
ago. If this is not authoritarian rule, then what would you call <br>
it?" he said.<br>
	Sahakian then detailed the reasons for the death of Ardavazd <br>
Manoukian, who died while in an Interior Ministry detention <br>
facility. "The Prosecutor-General of Armenia is responsible for <br>
Manoukians death, but he has gone unpunished and continues to <br>
occupy himself with the fate of others as long as he remains in <br>
his high and untouchable post," Sahakian said.<br>
	Sahakian pointed to the biased and often distorted reports <br>
of the political trials in Armenia by the state-run media. "The <br>
current leadership is in the hands of Neo-Communists" Sahakian <br>
said, "and nothing has changed from those days."<br>

4. KARABAKH CEC ANNOUNCES FINAL ELECTION RESULTS<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (Noyan Tapan)-The Central Electoral Commission of the <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic announced on Tuesday the final results <br>
of the Nov. 24 presidential elections in the mountainous republic.<br>
	According to the official data, 70,058 (80 percent) eligible <br>
voters participated turned out for Karabakhs first-ever <br>
presidential polls. Robert Kocharian was declared the official <br>
winner of the polls with 88.9 percent of the votes, ahead of Boris <br>
Aroushanians 7.05 percent and Hrand Melkoumians four percent.<br>

5. GEORGIAN CENTRAL BANK DELEGATION ARRIVES IN YEREVAN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Chief of the Georgian Central Banks <br>
Department for Control, Levan Kistauri, and his deputy, Gotcha <br>
Toutberidze arrived in Yerevan Sunday for a one-day visit.<br>
	They had a number of meetings in Armenias Central Bank to <br>
outline the terms of cooperation between the central financial <br>
institutions of the two countries.<br>
	The Georgian delegation left for Turkmenistans capital of <br>
Ashkhabad Monday.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. WORLD BANK FLAGSHIP PROJECT  IMPLEMENTED IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The World Bank will help in the restoration <br>
of socially important establishments in Armenia.<br>
	This project is one of the twelve World Bank flagship <br>
projects in the world.<br>
	Reconstruction of Russias coal sector and restoration of <br>
Turkeys irrigation system are some of the other World Bank <br>
projects, Director of the Armenian Fund for Social Investments <br>
Gagik Khachatrian said.<br>
	He noted that one of the main tasks is the development of a <br>
partnership on a communal level. Communities cooperate with state <br>
and private sectors, which result in the development of small <br>
businesses and construction of schools and highways. "We should <br>
join this movement and prepare the communities for solving their <br>
problems independently," Khachatrian said.<br>
	Social investment funds, each of which has its own priority <br>
directions, act in different countries. They are mainly working on <br>
projects aimed at solving water supply problems. However, these <br>
kind of projects are of less importance in Armenia. Armenian <br>
citizens first of all wish to solve the educational problems so <br>
the reconstruction of schools is very important to them.<br>
	Presently the construction of socially important <br>
establishments is being made possible by a $2.5 million grant by <br>
the Holland government and $12 million credit by the WB.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. UNHCR OUTLINES ACTIVITIES IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-United Nations High Commissioner for <br>
Refugees mission director in Yerevan, Viviane Dawalibi, held a <br>
news conference Tuesday outlining the UNHCRs activities in <br>
Armenia.<br>
	Dawalibi said that $15 million has been spent on the <br>
implementation of programs in Armenia since 1992.<br>
	Dawalibi said that according to the official data, 300,000 <br>
refugees are currently living in the republic, 150,000 of which <br>
need urgent assistance. In addition, 65 percent of the refugees <br>
are women, she noted. The number of unemployed refugees is also <br>
great.<br>
	She also said that the majority of the refugees are still <br>
living in communal centers, damaged buildings, basements and <br>
trailers. The issue of citizenship of the refugees has not been <br>
solved because mechanisms of citizenship acquisition have not been <br>
put in order.<br>
	Dawalibi underlined the necessity of cooperation with <br>
Armenian public organizations dealing with problems of refugees.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. TESTIMONY ELEVATES INCONCISTANCIES<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Mondays testimony in the so-called "Trial <br>
of 31" raised questions between the official version of the <br>
alleged coup attempt and one defendants testimony of the events <br>
leading up to the death of two police officers in Yerevan.<br>
	All accusations charged against co-defendant Leva Sargssian <br>
are said to be connected to Vardan Manoukian, who is wanted by <br>
police, Judge Davit Avetissian stated after questioning Sargssian <br>
at Mondays court session.<br>
	Avetissian pointed to inconsistencies in the indictment and <br>
testimony. According to the indictment, alleged meetings between <br>
Vahan Hovanessian, Garnik Issagulian, Ashot Avetissian, Gagik <br>
Karapetian and Vardan Manoukian took place at an apartment rented <br>
by a female acquaintance of Sargssian, Ginarpi Simonian, who was <br>
called to the court as a witness.<br>
	Avetissian also pointed to the alleged transportation of <br>
guns in Sargssians car. The weapons were reportedly kept in <br>
Sargssians house, then transferred to Karapet Gazarians home and <br>
later to Ofik Assikians garage-all of whom are defendants in the <br>
case. When the arms were taken to Sourenavan, an incident took <br>
place on the Leningrad highway in Yerevan and two police officers <br>
were killed, according to the court documents.<br>
	Sargssian said that Manoukian called the meetings in <br>
Simonians apartment, and that neither he nor Simonian were <br>
present.<br>
	With regard to the alleged shipment of guns, Sargssian <br>
insisted that he went to a casual meeting in a village near <br>
Hrazdan at the invitation of Manoukian. However, returning from <br>
the village, Manoukian asked him to take the guns to Yerevan <br>
saying that it was perfectly legal because the guns were <br>
designated for Karabakh. Manoukian insisted that the guns remain <br>
at Sargssians house. Several days later, according to Sargssians <br>
testimony, Manoukian took the guns without checking to see if all <br>
the weapons were accounted for.<br>
	According to Sargssian, the majority of his testimony <br>
coincides with those given by other defendants. However, he noted <br>
that the investigators did not take exact notes and based their <br>
investigation on the coup detat version.<br>
	Sargssian stated that he had not heard anything about the <br>
coup from his co-defendants. He also said he could not understand <br>
how his testimony could be used for the confirmation of that <br>
version.<br>
	He said the investigators threatened to arrest his brother, <br>
Edward Sargssian, who was jailed for three days and later <br>
released.<br>
	Leva Sargssian is currently suffering from a heart <br>
condition.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. IRAN, ARMENIA, GEORGIA, GREECE SIGN AGREEMENT<br>
<p>
TEHRAN (Xinhua)-Iran, Armenia, Georgia and Greece set guidelines <br>
for quadrilateral cooperation by setting up five working <br>
committees.<br>
	The four countries finalized three memoranda which will be <br>
signed by foreign ministers of the four countries in Athens in <br>
January.<br>
	The five working committees will include government <br>
officials and experts of the four countries and will explore ways <br>
of cooperation in the fields of transportation, <br>
telecommunications, energy, trade, industry and tourism.<br>
	The representatives of the four countries ruled out the <br>
possibility of launching a military cooperation program among the <br>
four countries, declaring that their cooperation is a purely <br>
economic one and is not against any other countries, clearly <br>
referring to Turkey and Azerbaijan.<br>
	Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said, "This <br>
economic cooperation serves to bring regional countries closer <br>
together but it is not against any other country."<br>
	Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Malkhaz Kakabadzadeh said <br>
at a press conference that the intent of this cooperation is quite <br>
peaceful. "We never talked about machine-guns and tanks in this <br>
gathering," he said.<br>
	"We are here to talk about economy and economic cooperation. <br>
Economic cooperation is much better than military cooperation," <br>
Konstantin Gorio of the Greek Foreign Ministry said.<br>
	Observers noted that the close cooperation of the four <br>
countries is politically important.<br>
	The Iranian government, unhappy and worried about the close <br>
ties between Turkey and Israel, is trying to have close relations <br>
with the four countries in a bid to find an alternative route to <br>
Europe.<br>

                               ======	 <br>
 315 Iraqi Kurds evacuated to Turkey<br>
	A first 315 Iraqi Kurds in a new U.S.-planned evacuation<br>
arrived Wednesday in Turkey from northern Iraq, Turkey's Foreign<br>
Ministry said.  The operation was the third evacuation of Kurds<br>
who worked for U.S.- funded aid agencies in northern Iraq, the<br>
ministry said. The refugees were bused across the southeast<br>
Turkish border, near the border town of Silopi, and will be<br>
flown later in the week to the Pacific island of Guam, a<br>
ministry spokesman told United Press International. U.S. and<br>
Turkish officials plan to evacuate altogether 4,500 Kurdish men,<br>
women and children. The breadwinners in the families had worked<br>
for U.S.- funded humanitarian programs in the Kurdish autonomous<br>
zone of northern Iraq. They have feared for their lives since<br>
Aug. 31, when Iraqi government forces intervened on the side of<br>
one Kurdish faction against another vying for control of the<br>
region. The ministry spokesman said that the United States is<br>
scheduled Friday to start flying the Kurds to Guam and that the<br>
entire evacuation was likely to last 15 days.<br>
	The United States evacuated about 2,000 U.S.-employed<br>
Kurds in mid- September and 700 more a month later. They were<br>
eventually flown to Anderson Air Force Base on Guam.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey boycotts IMO meeting on safety<br>
	LONDON, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- Turkey has walked out of a<br>
meeting of the International Maritime Organization, IMO, because<br>
the agenda included two papers proposing scrutiny of vessel<br>
navigation along the Bosporos, the shipping daily Lloyd's List<br>
reported Thursday. The IMO maritime safety committee's meeting<br>
was held in London Wednesday. The daily said Russia had called<br>
on the London-based IMO to send an international mission to the<br>
Bosporus to assess whether the organization's rules and<br>
regulations on navigation in the waterway were being<br>
observed. However, the Turkish delegation to IMO warned it would<br>
not participate in the meeting if the issue remained as part of<br>
the debate. The Turkish delegation said that proposals by both<br>
the Russian Federation and the Oil Companies' International<br>
Marine Forum were political maneuvering.  The latter had called<br>
for amended rules governing the safety of navigation in the<br>
straits of Istanbul and Canakkale. Turkey said it was IMO's job<br>
to concentrate on purely technical and safety issues.<br>
	The daily said the committee's chairman Giulino<br>
Pattofatto said the committee was obliged to consider operation<br>
of the IMO rules and regulations covering the straits. The<br>
issues would be discussed and a report drawn up by the end of<br>
the week, he said.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkish report slams prison forces<br>
	An inquiry has found that 68 security officers who<br>
intervened in a prison riot used excessive force and should be<br>
tried in the deaths of 10 prisoners, a Turkish parliamentarian<br>
said Wednesday. Musa Okcu said the National Assembly's rights<br>
committee said the inquiry found that some of the prisoners in<br>
the Sept. 24 riot at Diyarbakir prison had even been assaulted<br>
on their way to a hospital. The case should be referred to a<br>
civil court away from Diyarbakir, the virtual capital of<br>
southeastern Turkey, to ``unveil the truth, satisfy public<br>
opinion and deter other human rights violators,'' Okcu told<br>
United Press International. Okcu, a parliamentarian from the<br>
ruling Welfare Party, said the four-person inquiry panel pinned<br>
the blame for the 10 prisoners' deaths Tuesday on 30<br>
paramilitary officers and 38 policemen who put down the<br>
riot. The report accused them of ``exceeding the limits set by<br>
the law and killing and injuring inmates,'' Okcu said. It<br>
recommended they be charged with murder, attempted murder and<br>
causing injuries.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Armenian premier visits London<br>
	Armenian Prime Minister Armen Sarkisyan started his<br>
seven-days visit to London, the Russian news agency reported<br>
Thursday. Sarkisyan explained the aim of the visit as presenting<br>
letters of recall of the Armenian ambassador to Britain. He<br>
noted that during his visit he will meet with top officials of<br>
the British Government and hold talks with the leadership of the<br>
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development.  During the<br>
talks the sides will consider a number issues of granting<br>
credits to Armenia, the agency said.<br>
	Sarkisyan occupied this post from 1992 to 1996 when he<br>
headed the Armenian government.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey to ship spare to Iraq<br>
	The United Nations diplomats, in a meeting of sanction<br>
committee on Dec.3, allowed Turkey to ship spare parts and<br>
equipment to Iraq to repair of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline,<br>
the Turkish officials reported Thursday. The spare parts and<br>
equipments are to be used to ensure that the pipe line will be<br>
operable to carry Iraqi oil during the first phase of the<br>
UN-Iraq oil -for-food sale. Within the frame work on UN Security<br>
Council Resolution No. 986, the implementation which enables<br>
Iraq to sell oil worth 2 million over a period of six months,<br>
will be underway this month.<br>

 Iran envoy blasts Israel-Turkey accord<br>
	Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati concluded<br>
his visit to Syria with fresh criticism of a renewed military<br>
accord between Israel and Turkey, a government-run Syrian<br>
newspaper said Wednesday. ``We strongly oppose any accord<br>
concluded between Muslim countries and the Zionist entity,''<br>
Velayati told the Ath-Thawra daily before leaving Damascus after<br>
a two-day visit. He was referring to a renewal, signed last<br>
week, of a military training accord that had sparked protests<br>
from Turkey's Muslim neighbors, particularly Syria, Iraq and<br>
Iran. ``It is clear that such an accord is not in the interest<br>
of the Muslim world,'' Velayati said. ``We have announced our<br>
protest and rejection of such an accord.'' Velayati met<br>
President Hafez Assad, Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa and other<br>
high officials during his visit. The talks focused on the Middle<br>
East peace process, growing Syrian-Israeli military tension and<br>
the Kurdish cease-fire in northern Iraq, officials said.<br>

 Russia, Iran to boost quake cooperation<br>
	Russia was taking steps Wednesday to improve cooperation<br>
with Iran over earthquake warnings and disaster control, the<br>
government-run news agency Itar-Tass said. Russian Energy<br>
Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu was in Tehran for talks with<br>
Iranian Interior Ministry officials on enhanced cooperation, the<br>
agency said. His talks ran parallel to four days of meetings in<br>
Moscow by the Russian-Iran trade and economic cooperation<br>
commission. It was the first time the commission had met since<br>
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Shoigu plans to fly<br>
from Tehran, Iran's capital, on Friday to Baghdad, for talks<br>
with Iraqi leaders, the agency said. Also Friday, a Russian<br>
plane is scheduled to deliver 15 tons of medicine and 10 tons of<br>
other humanitarian supplies to the Iraqi capital.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turks said to kill 105 separatist Kurds<br>
	Turkish troops have killed 105 Kurdish rebels in the<br>
southeast in the last four days, the Anatolian News Agency said<br>
Tuesday. The Emergency Law Governor's Office told the agency<br>
that the clashes had occurred in Diyarbakir and Batman<br>
provinces, about 450 miles (720 km) southeast of Ankara, the<br>
capital. Five soldiers were reported wounded in the clashes, the<br>
agency said. There was no independent confirmation of the<br>
tolls. At least 21,000 people have been killed and many more<br>
wounded since insurgents began their campaign to carve a<br>
separate Kurdistan out of southeastern Turkey in 1984.<br>
                               ======<br>

	+&gt; Heavy fighting flares in Tajikistan  <br>
	+&gt; Libya, Azerbaijan sign education accord  <br>
	+&gt; Aliyev: Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan  <br>
                               ======	 <br>
 Heavy fighting flares in Tajikistan<br>
	Fierce fighting between Tajik government and opposition<br>
forces flared for a second straight day Monday in a region east<br>
of the capital Dushanbe, military sources said. Interior<br>
Ministry troops battled about 200 opposition fighters about 90<br>
miles (150 km) east of Dushanbe on the outskirts of the<br>
administrative district seat of Garm, which the Islamic rebels<br>
seized Sunday after a day of fighting. Casualty figures were not<br>
available Monday, but a governmet official said at least eight<br>
troops were killed Sunday in what the U.N. envoy to Tajikistan,<br>
Gert Dietrich Merrem, called the heaviest fighting in recent<br>
months. The U.N. mission issued a statement condemning the<br>
hostilities as the latest violation of cease-fire agreements and<br>
stating that ``according to unconfirmed reports, there are<br>
numerous victims and serious damage to houses.'' The opposition<br>
representative to a joint commission charged with oversight of<br>
the shattered cease-fire and peace agreement signed in Tehran<br>
last year said opposition forces had taken 100 government troops<br>
hostage.  Tajik Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov said the<br>
opposition attacked government posts in Garm as part of a<br>
continuing effort to seize key towns along the road from<br>
Dushanbe east to the Kyrgyz border. In September, opposition<br>
forces took control of the nearby Dhiagatal and Tajikabad<br>
districts and their seats, east of Garm, and last month they<br>
seized Komsomolabad, west of Garm on the road to<br>
Dushanbe. Azimov condemned the opposition offensive as<br>
``genocide against their own people'' and said the<br>
Afghanistan-based opposition leader, Said Abdullo Nuri, should<br>
be held personally responsible.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Libya, Azerbaijan sign education accord<br>
	Libya and Azerbaijan have signed an agreement in Tripoli<br>
on cooperation in the fields of education and scientific<br>
research, the Libyan news agency Jana said Tuesday. The accord<br>
was signed by a senior official in the Libyan General People's<br>
Committee for Education and Scientific Research and a visiting<br>
Azerbaijani deputy education minister. It provides for an<br>
exchange of expertise and visits and meetings in the areas of<br>
education, scientific research and professional training, the<br>
agency said.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Aliyev: Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan<br>
	Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev said, in his speech<br>
to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,<br>
OSCE, summit meeting in Lisbon Monday, that independence for the<br>
disputed region of Nagornyy Karabakh is ``unacceptable to<br>
Azerbaijan,'' the Russian Itar- tass news agency said<br>
Tuesday. ``We cannot allow a second Armenian state to be formed<br>
on the territory of Azerbaijan. The Armenian side should finally<br>
recognize that the conflict which it has unleashed,'' Aliyev<br>
said in remarks broadcast on television. Aliyev told Russian<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that he was concerned about<br>
Baku and Yerevan's failure to agree the contents of a political<br>
declaration on the status of Nagornyy Karabakh to be adopted by<br>
the Lisbon summit meeting, According to some information<br>
received by ITAR-TASS on the sidelines of the meeting,<br>
Azerbaijan warned that it may block the adoption of the<br>
declaration if no consensus is reached on the Karabakh issue.<br>

1. Azerbaijan Lost The War Of Vetoes<br>
------------------------------------<br>
   Lisbon Summit Accepted No Resolution On Gharabagh<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN ("Hayastani Hanrapetutyun" daily), 12/04/96  --  The <br>
Lisbon Summit of OSCE finished yesterday. The  negotiations  were <br>
in an extremely tense atmosphere. <br>
     One of the possible causes of the  failure  of  negotiations <br>
was  Azerbaijan's  position  on  putting  a  veto  on  the  final <br>
declaration of the Lisbon summit. This eight page declaration was <br>
a conclusion of OSCE's two years work. No  coordinated  work  has <br>
been done in preparations  to  the  summit  in  regard  with  the <br>
Gharabagh  conflict,  and  Azerbaijan  unilaterally  stopped  the <br>
negotiation with Armenia. <br>
     In addition to this, Azerbaijan was pressing on OSCE, trying <br>
to  enforce  a  document   affirming   Azerbaijan's   territorial <br>
integrity and mentioning Gharabagh as a part of Azerbaijan.  Note <br>
that the other parts  of  the  declaration  affirmed  territorial <br>
integrity of Russia, Georgia, and Moldova,  therefore  Azerbaijan <br>
has put an enormous effort to  reach  a  similar  result  in  its <br>
regard. <br>
     Chairman of OSCE tried to find a consensus  between  Armenia <br>
and Azerbaijan, stressing that the conflict  should  be  resolved <br>
based on the  guarantees  of  self-determination  of  Mountainous <br>
Gharabagh and the security of its population,  affirming  at  the <br>
same time territorial integrity of Armenia  and  Azerbaijan,  and <br>
stressing that Mountainous Gharabagh should have highest possible <br>
sovereign status as a part of Azerbaijan. <br>
     As long as such formula was not acceptable for Armenia,  our <br>
delegation vetoed the 20th paragraph of the declaration,  whereas <br>
Azerbaijan, in response to  this,  has  put  veto  on  the  whole <br>
declaration. In fact, it failed the  whole  declaration,  reached <br>
through negotiations of the leaders of 55 countries. As a result, <br>
this caused a response pressure  against  the  Azeri  delegation. <br>
Finally, Azerbaijan has lost this war of  vetoes  as  it  had  to <br>
remove its veto, whereas Armenia's veto persisted. <br>
     Chairman, European Union, Russia, and Turkey tried to soften <br>
Azerbaijan's failure, by including  the  vetoed  topic  in  their <br>
declarations. In response  to  this,  Armenia's  President  Levon <br>
Ter-Petrossian made a declaration, stressing the right of nations <br>
for  self-determination  as  the  basic  principle  for  conflict <br>
resolution. <br>
     Finally spoke  Finnish  co-chairman  of  OSCE  Minsk  group, <br>
stressing equality of the principles of the territorial integrity <br>
and the right of nations for self-determination,  and  said  that <br>
the solution should consider all vital interests of the sides  of <br>
conflict. <br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 234, Part I, 5 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
FEDERATION COUNCIL DISCUSSES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE IN GOVERNMENT. Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin failed to make a scheduled speech in the
Federation Council on 4 December, claiming he was too sick to appear,
NTV reported. When Speaker Yegor Stroev announced that Chernomyrdin was
not coming, the hall exploded and Vladimir Varnavskii proposed that the
Federation Council recommend that the Duma pass a vote of no-confidence
in the government. Only Stroev's efforts to calm his colleagues managed
to postpone the vote until 5 December. Many council members were angry
that Chernomyrdin has not paid back wages and pensions or solved the
non-payments crisis. This session marks the first time the upper house
has challenged the government so forcefully, and may be a precursor of
future disputes now that all the regional executives, who make up half
of the house, will be elected rather than appointed by the president. --
Robert Orttung
<p>
GOVERNMENT LASHES OUT AT PARLIAMENT. The government staff released an
official statement late on 4 December denouncing both houses of the
legislature. The statement blasted the "constant striving of some Duma
members to earn cheap popularity by irresponsibly speculating on urgent
and important problems." It also attacked attempts by some Federation
Council members to transfer their responsibility for resolving the most
serious social problems in the regions exclusively onto the federal
executive branch, ITAR-TASS reported. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
YELTSIN, CHERNOMYRDIN DISCUSS OSCE SUMMIT. Chernomyrdin met with
President Boris Yeltsin at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow on 4
December to discuss the Lisbon OSCE summit, Russian and Western agencies
reported. Echoing a foreign ministry statement which downplayed Moscow's
isolation at the summit, presidential press spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembskii said the two men concluded that "Moscow's position on a
new European security architecture was heard in Lisbon." Yastrzhembskii
said the two leaders agreed that preparations for a planned 1997 U.S.-
Russian summit should begin, and that Chernomyrdin should travel to Kyiv
in the near future to discuss the intractable Black Sea Fleet dispute,
which Moscow insists be resolved before the signing of a bilateral
friendship and cooperation treaty with Ukraine. Later that day, Yeltsin
moved from the sanatorium to continue his convalescence at his nearby
country residence. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
CHECHEN ELECTION COMMITTEE MEETS. The 33 members of the Chechen
Elections Committee convened for the first time on 4 December in Grozny
to discuss preparations for the 27 January parliamentary and
presidential elections, Radio Rossii reported. Implicitly contradicting
statements made by OSCE Chechnya mission head Tim Guldimann, chairman
Mumadi Saidayev said the committee is adequately financed by the interim
Chechen government. To date six candidates have announced their
intention to contest the presidency, although none has been formally
registered as a candidate. According to Nezavisimaya gazeta of 5
December, the six are acting President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, interim
Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov, former presidential press spokesman (now
first Deputy Prime Minister) Movladi Udugov, field commanders Shamil
Basaev and Vakha Arsanov, and the chairman of the Confederation of
Peoples of the Caucasus, Yusup Soslambekov. Also on 4 December, a group
of unidentified armed men abducted five Russian officers and their
driver in Grozny, ITAR-TASS reported. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
DUMA DENOUNCES CHECHEN TROOP WITHDRAWAL, GIVES UP IDEA OF IMPEACHMENT.
The State Duma passed a non-binding resolution on 4 December advising
Yeltsin to "consider once again the expediency of a complete withdrawal
of troops" from Chechnya, ITAR-TASS reported. Though the resolution
criticizes the Chernomyrdin - Maskhadov accord and Yeltsin's decree
ordering the troop withdrawal, saying these decisions continue one-sided
concessions to Chechen nationalists, it has a generally conciliatory
tone. It omits earlier attempts to impeach the president and vote no-
confidence in the government. The resolution orders Procurator General
Yurii Skuratov to open an investigation into who started the war. --
Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
FEDERATION COUNCIL REJECTS LAW ON COURTS. The parliament's upper house
failed on 4 December to muster the two-thirds majority needed to pass
the constitutional law "on the judicial system of the Russian
Federation," Izvestiya reported the following day. At the second
attempt, 132 deputies voted for the draft, two short of the number
needed. The bill provides for the introduction of the institution of
arbitrators to handle civil cases and some petty crimes and gives the
president the right to appoint all federal judges, Rossiiskaya gazeta
reported on 3 December. It was opposed by deputies from Tatarstan,
Bashkortostan, and Kareliya, who argued that it reduces the role of
local legislative organs in appointing judges. Tatar President Mintimer
Shaimiev said Russia's republics will never vote in favor of a judicial
system that makes them highly dependent on Moscow. -- Penny Morvant
<p>
DUMA APPEALS TO YELTSIN ON MILITARY REFORM. With the support of 308
deputies, the Duma passed a resolution appealing to Yeltsin to
accelerate the process of military reform, ITAR-TASS reported. The
resolution called the current financial crisis in the military
"inadmissible," and said officers must be paid on time if they are to
carry out their normal duties. The same day, however, the Duma agreed to
postpone a planned presentation to the chamber on military reform by
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov. Rodionov had requested the postponement,
saying he could not discuss reform plans with legislators without the
approval of Yeltsin. He also complained that the military could not be
reformed during the current financial crisis, when it was "struggling
for survival," adding, "there is no finance for the reform effort." --
Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIAN-IRANIAN ECONOMIC TALKS. First Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei
Bolshakov met with visiting Iranian Economics and Finance Minister
Morteza Mohammad-Khan in Moscow on 4 December to discuss bilateral
economic ties, particularly cooperation in the oil and gas sector, ITAR-
TASS reported. The Iranian minister is in Moscow for the first meeting
of the Russo-Iranian economic cooperation commission since the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union. At the session, Minister of Foreign Trade
Oleg Davydov confirmed that Russia was moving ahead with the
controversial deal to complete the unfinished nuclear power station at
Bushehr in Southern Iran, which the U.S. opposes, citing nuclear
proliferation concerns. During his visit, Mohammad-Khan deplored the
current "stagnation" in bilateral trade, which dropped from $1.4 billion
in 1991 to about $200 million in 1995 and is expected to reach $350
million this year. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
TAX DEBTORS PAY UP. The head of the Federal Bankruptcy Administration,
Petr Mostovoi, told a press conference on 4 December that of 1,025
businesses threatened with bankruptcy at the start of the year, 500 have
paid their tax debts and 200 others were placed in liquidation, ITAR-
TASS, AFP, and Kommersant Daily reported. Tax collection in November
reached 20.1 trillion rubles ($3.6 billion), 40% up on the previous
month, although total federal tax debts still stand at 61 trillion
rubles (of which 30 trillion date back to 1995). Mostovoi said
bankruptcy proceedings had begun against seven major firms, including
the Moskvich auto plant, Krasnodar oil refinery, Achinsk Aluminum
Combine, and West Siberian Metal Combine. Mostovoi noted that 1,600
firms still owe more than 3 billion rubles each. His agency seems to be
stepping up its activity, not least because in two weeks the IMF will
reconsider the suspension of its Russian loan. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
DUMA APPROVES TAX MEASURES. The State Duma on 4 December passed on first
reading a package of tax measures requested by the government, ITAR-TASS
reported. They include an alcohol excise duty of 12,000 rubles ($2.2)
per liter of spirits and 700 rubles per liter of beer, a 15% tax on
profits from trades in T-bills, a tax on interest income, and
preservation of tax credits for manufacturers. They also approved a tax
on the purchase of foreign currency, at a rate to be decided later -
probably 1.5%. The government has tried to reassure the Duma that the
1997 budget will help stimulate investment and revive production. The
draft budget includes planned investment spending of 28.4 trillion
rubles, up from 10 trillion this year, Rossiiskaya gazeta reported on 4
December. In addition the government will issue investment guarantees
for industrial bonds worth 65 trillion rubles. -- Peter Rutland

ENERGY TARIFFS TO RISE IN ARMENIA. Prime Minister Armen Sarkisyan on 4
December said the government will raise energy tariffs by 40% starting
in January, Noyan Tapan reported the same day. Sarkisyan said the
decision was taken in accordance with the 4 March agreement with the
World Bank which made its loans to Armenia contingent on bringing energy
prices closer to world ones. Armenia has undergone severe energy
shortages and winter rationing since the war in Nagorno-Karabakh broke
out in 1992. The crisis has been substantially alleviated by the
reopening of the Medzamor nuclear plant in summer 1995. -- Emil
Danielyan
<p>
HELSINKI WATCH PROTESTS TO ALIEV. The Helsinki Watch human rights
organization has sent a letter to President Heydar Aliev protesting the
handling by the Azerbaijani authorities of the criminal case against
former Defense Minister Rahim Ghaziev, Turan reported on 4 December. The
letter said that Gaziev was repeatedly not allowed to meet with his
relatives or his lawyer, who so far has only had one meeting with his
client. Gaziev was Azerbaijan's defense minister in the government of
former President Abulfaz Elchibey, and fled to Russia after Aliev came
to power in June 1993. Gaziev was charged with the "surrender" of the
Shusha and Lachin towns to Armenian forces in May 1992 and sentenced to
death in absentia. He was extradited by Russia in April 1996 at
Azerbaijan's request. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
TAJIK FIGHTING CONTINUES, MOVES CLOSER TO CAPITAL. An attempt by Tajik
government forces to retake the city of Garm has been repelled by
opposition forces who captured the city last week, Russian sources
report. Opposition forces used artillery and tanks to drive back
government troops. Attacks have also been reported as close as 13
kilometers from the capital Dushanbe. A Russian helicopter came under
gun and grenade fire at Dushanbe airport on 4 December. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH BLASTS TAJIKISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN. In its seventh annual
human rights survey, the organization Human Rights Watch notes a
dramatic deterioration of democratic principles in Tajikistan and
Kyrgyzstan, RFE/RL reported on 5 December. On Kyrgyzstan, HRW pointed to
government repression of the media, suspension of freedom of speech and
association, the continued existence of residence permits and internal
passports, and the "alarming" consolidation of power by President Askar
Akayev. HRW also questioned the constitutionality of the rescheduled
presidential elections of December 1995. Tajikistan, which has been
criticized for the last five years for its record on human rights, was
described as having its "worst year" in 1996. The report also condemned
decisions by the IMF and World Bank to lend money to Tajikistan despite
the country's disregard for human rights. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
RUSSIAN STATION PULLED FROM AIR IN KAZAKSTAN. The Kazakstani National
Agency for Press and Mass Media decided to stop airing the Russian
Television (RTR) station, according to 4 December reports from ITAR-TASS
and Radio Mayak. The reason given was lack of funding. The Russian
Public Television station (ORT) will continue to have its programing
shown in Kazakstan. -- Bruce Pannier

SERBIAN PROTESTS CONTINUE TO GROW . . . With mass demonstrations in
Belgrade well into their third consecutive week, local media report that
the largest number of people so far took to the streets on 4 December.
Nasa Borba estimates that 150,000 people gathered in the capital city,
while other estimates put the number at more than 200,000. Students held
a peaceful demonstration outside the presidential residence to demand
that the state-run media give coverage to the protest actions. At a mass
rally downtown, student protesters demanded that independent media be
allowed to cover the demonstrations. They distributed pamphlets saying
that "Enough is enough: You have closed [Radios] B-92 and Index,
shameless in your arrogance, but in fact you are afraid that you won't
be able to steal any more or send other peoples' children to war." --
Stan Markotich
<p>
...WHILE MILOSEVIC TAKES SOME MEASURES. In what may be a move to appease
the demonstrators, Milosevic has fired the hard-line head of the
Socialist Party of Serbia branch in Nis, state radio and TV reported on
4 December. Beta and Nasa Borba reported that Milosevic intends to sack
other officials, including the Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar
Tijanic, following the closure of independent Radio B 92. According to
some reports, Tijanic has already resigned. There are also reports that
the government has closed down another independent radio station--BOOM
93, based in Milosevic's hometown of Pozarevac. Meanwhile, CNN on 4
December reported that police are arresting  protesters, at least in
Belgrade, and sentencing them to 25 days in prison. Finally, 90 Serbian
justices are formally protesting the nullification of the results of 17
November elections. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
LONDON CONFERENCE ON BOSNIA OPENS . . . The latest international
gathering to assess implementation of the Dayton peace agreement began
in London on 4 December. Speakers made the usual admonitions to the
former Yugoslavs to keep their promises, and they stressed that more
attention must be paid to enabling refugees to go home and to catching
war criminals, international media noted. But enforcement of these
provisions in 1996 has been lax to say the least, and it is difficult to
see how matters can improve next year with a much smaller peacekeeping
force present. Some speakers reminded the former Yugoslavs that
donations of reconstruction aid will be contingent on good behavior, but
so far this carrot has failed to produce the desired results. -- Patrick
Moore
<p>
. . . BUT DELEGATES THINK MAINLY OF SERBIA. Most attention at the 4
December meeting seemed to be directed toward the dramatic events in
Belgrade rather than Bosnia, with speakers warning the Serbian
government not to use force. U.S. envoy John Kornblum went further,
saying that Serbia's "internal structure and its internal order [are]
unacceptable to us." The international community's High Representative
Carl Bildt noted that "peace can never be stable in Bosnia if we don't
have stability throughout the region. That stability can never be built
on repression." NATO's Secretary General Javier Solana, who comes from
Spain, said his message for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was
"Adios, amigo," international media reported. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
DEMONSTRATION IN VUKOVAR AFTER TUDJMAN'S VISIT. Angry Serbian
demonstrators on 4 December forced UN spokesman for eastern Slavonia
Philip Arnold and a group of Croatian journalists to cut short their
visit to Vukovar, international and local media reported. The incident
occurred one day after Croatian President Franjo Tudjman visited the
town, which is located in the last Serb-held enclave in Croatia (see
OMRI Daily Digest, 4 December 1996). Arnold said some 150-200 Serbs
gathered in front of the town's cultural center to protest Tudjman's
visit. They prevented Arnold and the Croatian journalists from entering
the building. Meanwhile, the Croatian rail unions on 4 December
announced that passenger traffic will resume but not commercial traffic,
Vecernji List reported the next day. Union head Zlatko Pavletic said the
decision was made to help ordinary citizens, but he added that the
strike will continue. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
NEW MOLDOVAN PRESIDENT URGES WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN TROOPS. Petru
Lucinschi on 4 December called for the speedy withdrawal of all Russian
troops from Moldova, Interfax and international news agencies reported.
He urged the Russian side to respect the deadlines set in the October
1994 bilateral accord. That document, however, has not yet been ratified
by the Russian State Duma. Lucinschi, who was a high-ranking official
during the Soviet era, said he would insist that a Russian-Moldovan
basic treaty be signed as soon as possible. Meanwhile, outgoing
President Mircea Snegur, speaking at the OSCE summit in Lisbon, also
called for the Russian troops to pull out of eastern Moldova. The 6,500-
strong contingent in the breakaway Dniester region is the last Russian
military unit to be based on foreign territory against the host
country's will. -- Zsolt Mato
<p>
MOLDOVAN PARLIAMENT RATIFIES TREATY WITH UKRAINE. The parliament on 3
December ratified a friendship and cooperation treaty with Ukraine,
Infotag reported. Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and his Ukrainian
counterpart, Leonid Kravchuk, signed the treaty in October 1992. The
Ukrainian parliament ratified the document last month, after having
insisted that border questions between the two countries be settled
before ratification. According to Moldovan Deputy Foreign Minister
Aurelian Danila, only a few sections of the border continue to be
disputed, including areas near Basarabeasca and Giurgiulesti. -- Dan
Ionescu
<p>
BULGARIAN ARMY FACES FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. Defense Minister Dimitar Pavlov
on 3 December acknowledged that the Bulgarian army owes suppliers some 4
billion leva ($10 million), mostly for food and uniforms, Reuters
reported. Pavlov said the army cannot rely on government funds to feed
the troops over the winter and has to make its own arrangements. Many
army units have their own farms and are able to produce most of the meat
eaten by their troops. Pavlov said the army needs at least $20 billion
over the next 10 years to modernize its equipment, but he added that the
state will probably be unable to provide those funds. -- Stefan Krause

5 December 1996 Monitor - Vol.II, No.227<br>
<p>
MONITOR - A DAILY BRIEFING ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
<p>
SOME CHECHEN LEADERS PUSH FOR ISLAMIC STATE. "We will form state bodies<br>
based on Islamic law. So-called Roman law is unnatural to Chechens. Many do<br>
not accept it and therefore it is often broken. We must base legislation on<br>
something people will accept. Islam is a suitable basis for the Chechen<br>
people. Otherwise, we will have an ungovernable armed mass," says Movladi<br>
Udugov, deputy premier and chief ideologist of the Chechen resistance.<br>
Udugov says he does not yet know which model of Islamic society Chechnya<br>
will adopt. In his opinion, any choice must be preceded by a thorough study<br>
of the experience of other countries. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 30) <br>
<p>
"Secular courts will be gradually replaced in Chechnya by Shariat courts.<br>
The fact that canings are taking place behind closed doors instead of in the<br>
public squares is a temporary concession to Moscow and Western countries. We<br>
will soon be living in a classical Islamic state," Shamsuddin Batukaev,<br>
chairman of Chechnya's Supreme Shariat Court, told the Monitor. Islamic law<br>
and Arabic have been made required subjects in Chechnya's schools by<br>
presidential decree. Religious authorities are already visiting Chechen<br>
schools and warning students that if a girl above the age of ten goes<br>
outdoors in a short skirt, or without covering her hair with a scarf, she<br>
will be punished by the ten strokes provided for in the Shariat. (Groznensky<br>
rabochy, November 15)<br>
<p>
Rapid transition to a religious state may be resisted by a significant<br>
portion of the Chechen population, now quite secularized after years of<br>
Soviet rule. "It is President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev who is helping us most in<br>
building an Islamic state. Unfortunately, some influential Chechen<br>
politicians are not helping us very much," Batukaev told the Monitor,<br>
perhaps referring to Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov.<br>

<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN GUERRILLAS OPERATE IN ABKHAZIA. In a spate of press interviews in<br>
recent days, Georgian state security minister Shota Kviraya, his first<br>
deputy, Avtandil Ioseliani, and refugee leader Tamaz Nadareishvili have<br>
acknowledged that Georgian guerrilla groups have begun operating in<br>
Abkhazia. All three officials stated that the groups are comprised of ethnic<br>
Georgians who were forcibly expelled or otherwise persecuted by the<br>
Abkhazian authorities, or who seek to avenge the loss of home and kin during<br>
the 1992-93 war. Nadareishvili, who chairs the ethnically Georgian rump of<br>
Abkhazia's parliament, operating in Tbilisi, said that the Georgian<br>
government's reliance on negotiations alone to settle the conflict has<br>
increased frustration among the refugees and motivated them to take up arms.<br>
Approximately a dozen guerrilla groups, comprised of five to ten members<br>
each, are operating mainly in Gali, Ochamchira, and Sukhumi districts, the<br>
officials said. They disclaimed any involvement by Tbilisi in equipping or<br>
directing the groups. (Iberia, Iprinda, November 30, December 2; Svobodnaya<br>
Gruziya, December 3, as cited by Itar-Tass)<br>
<p>
A series of attacks on isolated Abkhaz military posts or patrols and on<br>
buildings used by Abkhaz authorities took place in the runup to last month's<br>
illegitimate legislative elections in Abkhazia. As a rule the unidentified<br>
attackers used explosives and light arms, causing few casualties but<br>
substantial material damage. Abkhaz authorities blame the attacks on<br>
Tbilisi, which initially attributed them to rivalries among Abkhaz clans.<br>
The latest statements in Tbilisi, however, would seem to reflect a decision<br>
to generate a degree of military pressure on Abkhazia that will parallel the<br>
negotiating process.<br>

OSCE peacekeeping: A useful 'harder'option <br>
<p>
edited by Rob Zaagman [1] <br>
<p>
Introduction <br>
<p>
Osce conflict prevention can be considered a `soft' field of activity, since<br>
almost exclusively non-coercive means are employed. Cooperative<br>
implementation of commitments, programmes and measures is the key to the<br>
osce way of doing things. Furthermore, the osce does not make use of military<br>
instruments to achieve its goals. However, the Helsinki Document 1992 does<br>
provide the organisation with the option of fielding peacekeeping operations<br>
(pkos). They are `hard', not in the sense that they are used for coercion<br>
(osce enforcement action is explicitly ruled out in the Helsinki Document),<br>
but in the sense that military forces may be used as an osce instrument. <br>
<p>
The history of the csce/osce shows that the Helsinki process has always been<br>
able to work with only softer options. Nevertheless, there are various<br>
reasons for the osce states to consider exercising `harder' options, in the<br>
first place pkos. <br>
<p>
For one thing, conflict prevention can be necessary at higher levels of the<br>
escalation ladder. Crisis management is also part of the osce's tasks. It is<br>
not defined in osce documents, but can be considered as conflict prevention<br>
in the very last phases of escalation towards violence, i.e. conflict<br>
prevention in a crisis situation. The means to be employed will have to<br>
answer to requirements of urgency and high political investments, perhaps<br>
even more substantial input is needed like emergency aid programmes,<br>
preventive deployment or peacekeeping operations. Osce options for conflict<br>
prevention/peace preservation should therefore encompass the entire range<br>
short of coercive measures to provide the osce with the necessary flexibility. <br>
<p>
For another thing, osce peacekeeping may offer a much more preferable<br>
alternative to bilateral peacekeeping. In general, multilateral peacekeeping<br>
in Europe would be based on osce decisions or undertaken by the osce. (These<br>
remarks are without prejudice to the possible establishment of un<br>
peacekeeping operations in the osce area.) <br>
<p>
A secondary reason is that it will give the osce a higher visibility and<br>
credibility in the eyes of the public which so far perceives the osce as a<br>
weak-bodied talking-shop. <br>
<p>
OSCE PKOs, conflict prevention and crisis management <br>
<p>
In which kinds of pkos should the osce become involved? Proceeding from its<br>
conflict-prevention role, there would seem to be two types of military peace<br>
operations which fit in: preventive deployment like in Macedonia and<br>
post-conflict pkos like (possibly) in Nagorny-Karabakh. (These can be<br>
contrasted with unprofor in Bosnia, which was an example of a pko by the<br>
un taking place during a conflict.) It may be useful to distinguish between<br>
preventive deployment and pre-emptive deployment. Preventive deployment<br>
may take place when there is no acute threat and the situation does not<br>
require quick decisiontaking. Pre-emptive deployment, on the contrary, will<br>
take place when a crisis is imminent and will require speedy decisiontaking. <br>
<p>
For these types of operations, the criteria laid down in the 1992 Helsinki<br>
Document seem useful. The Helsinki Document and the 1993 Rome<br>
Ministerial Council Decisions devote substantial sections to the subject of the<br>
osce and peacekeeping. According to these documents, nato, the Western<br>
European Union (weu) or the Commonwealth of Independent States (cis) may<br>
be requested to provide operational assistance in this field. The principles<br>
and norms elaborated there are, inter alia, the necessary consent of the<br>
parties concerned, impartiality, and the use of force only in self-defence -<br>
the same principles which apply to United Nations pkos with a mandate based<br>
on Chapter vi of the un Charter. <br>
<p>
A move towards more regular osce pkos or a substantial pko capability would<br>
give rise to inter alia the following questions and considerations: <br>
<p>
1) Should the OSCE undertake PKOs itself or should it make use of <br>
<p>
`subcontractors' and if so, which ones? <br>
<p>
To be sure, the osce does not as yet dispose of a regular contingency planning<br>
capability and organisational apparatus to field pkos. The High-Level<br>
Planning Group (hlpg) preparing the Nagorny-Karabakh operation was/is<br>
an ad hoc affair. Osce documents do not offer guidance on these<br>
organisational questions which we think should nevertheless be addressed.<br>
We think that osce peacekeeping is certainly preferable to `bilateral<br>
peacekeeping' (see below). We would have liked to see the Budapest Review<br>
Conference express this preference in a general way. However, the implicit<br>
recognition in the case of Nagorny-Karabakh is also helpful, i.e. the decision,<br>
in principle, on the organisation of a multinational osce peacekeeping force<br>
on the basis of Chapter iii of the Helsinki Document 1992 (Budapest<br>
Document, chapter ii, paragraph 4). <br>
<p>
Conversely, in certain instances the osce could also act as a mandating or<br>
legitimising institution, e.g. on peacekeeping to be implemented by nato, weu<br>
or the Commonwealth of Independent States (cis). Thus, it could cover such<br>
organisations politically with its consensual cloak of impartiality and<br>
legitimacy. This would be one way of dealing with the question of which<br>
international organisation could operate where, i.e. in which region and in<br>
which region not. The osce is impartial (or all-partial) whereas the cis and<br>
nato (or weu or the European Union) are not or are not perceived as such. <br>
<p>
However, such osce blessing would have to be accompanied by certain<br>
preconditions and measures. Note for example that so far Russian so-called<br>
pkos do not answer to the three requirements, in particular consent from the<br>
parties involved. Furthermore, they do not have a formal basis in a cis<br>
decision. Experience shows that such `bilateral peacekeeping' tends to be<br>
coercive, `green' military action more than anything else. As an alternative to<br>
peacekeeping under osce auspices, it cannot be prohibited; perhaps it can be<br>
forestalled, in particular if other states undertake the commitment to<br>
participate in pko operations on the territory of the former Soviet Union. <br>
<p>
At any rate, the osce should insist that in such `bilateral' cases, but also<br>
in multilateral cases under the osce banner, peacekeeping should take place<br>
on the basis of generally accepted principles, including those mentioned<br>
above. In addition, the osce should as a matter of course be permitted to<br>
monitor such operations to check whether they are conducted in accordance<br>
with osce principles and commitments, not just those concerning peacekeeping<br>
but also those pertaining to the human dimension and the politico-military<br>
code of conduct. <br>
<p>
The Rome Council Decisions (chapter ii, paragraph 2) have the following to<br>
say on such monitoring: `The Ministers agreed that the csce could consider,<br>
on a case-by-case basis and under specific conditions, the setting up of csce<br>
co-operative arrangements in order to ensure that the role and functions of a<br>
third party military force in a conflict area are consistent with csce<br>
principles<br>
and objectives' (emphasis added). Paragraph 3 continues the subject: `The<br>
Ministers mandated the cso and the Permanent Committee to further<br>
elaborate conditions and necessary provisions for possible csce arrangements<br>
of this nature. In carrying out this task they will bear in mind the proposals<br>
examined by the cso and be guided inter alia by the following principles and<br>
considerations essential to the csce arrangements as well as the activities<br>
of a third party military force: Respect for sovereignty and territorial<br>
integrity; consent of the parties; impartiality; multinational character;<br>
clear mandate; transparency; integral link to a political process for<br>
conflict resolution; plan for orderly withdrawal'. So far, it has not been<br>
possible to achieve consensus on such arrangements. <br>
<p>
2. Does the OSCE itself need additional legitimacy if it establishes or<br>
mandates a PKO? <br>
<p>
Obviously, if so this blessing would have to come from the un Security<br>
Council (unsc). Formally, no un consent is needed if no enforcement action is<br>
to be undertaken (e.g. the Multilateral Force of Observers (mfo) in Sinai).<br>
Is it then desirable to become dependent on an unsc resolution, like in the<br>
case of the Nagorny-Karabakh pko? An unsc resolution would certainly enhance<br>
the political legitimacy of such an operation, which is an issue separate<br>
from the legal question. Equally, as noted above an osce cloak or umbrella or<br>
legitimisation may politically be necessary, even if formally speaking e.g.<br>
the cis would not need an osce mandate. <br>
<p>
However, there would seem to be a qualitative difference between the osce and<br>
regional organisations or arrangements like the cis (and nato), which we do<br>
not find if we compare the osce with the un, and that is the difference<br>
mentioned under point 1: broad multinationality and (perceived) impartiality.<br>
A un blessing for the osce is therefore politically speaking much less needed,<br>
if at all, than an osce blessing for the cis (or Russia). Therefore, in view<br>
of the<br>
additional obstacles thrown up if the unsc would become involved, in most<br>
cases no un resolution should be sought for an osce pko. (An open question is<br>
whether there are other ways to involve the unsc without the osce and its<br>
operations possibly being hampered or even held hostage by developments in<br>
New York.) <br>
<p>
3. The issue of the composition of a PKO force is in part <br>
<p>
closely connected to the former questions <br>
<p>
The classic un rule is not to have the troops of interested parties included<br>
in a<br>
pko force. Within the osce there is a habit of not including subjects of<br>
neighbouring states in long-term missions in a particular state. One could<br>
even ask whether troops from a state in the same broader region should be<br>
included in a pko in another state in that region. (Specifically, these issues<br>
are acute with regard to the Russian Federation and the `near abroad'.)<br>
However, the converse question arises whether there will be enough states<br>
from outside the region, i.e. without vested interests, willing to<br>
participate in a pko. <br>
<p>
Perhaps the Combined Joint Task Force (cjtf) concept of nato offers a useful<br>
model. In each case of a cjtf mission, the task force will be composed of the<br>
able and willing, who could be nato member-states, states participating in<br>
the Partnership for Peace (including Russia), and neutral states. The Task<br>
Force will make use of elements of nato's integrated structure to which<br>
troops will be attached. Command, logistical and communications procedures<br>
used will be nato's existing ones, which have been tested over decades. <br>
<p>
4. Once the decision to field an operation has been taken, <br>
<p>
the following (and perhaps other) questions arise: <br>
<p>
a) which criteria are needed to determine that the operation will actually go<br>
ahead? <br>
<p>
b) how are military management and control to be organised? <br>
<p>
c) how should political guidance be organised and guaranteed? <br>
<p>
d) could a pko combine military, humanitarian and perhaps other elements? <br>
<p>
With regard to point a, the Helsinki Decisions (chapter iii, paragraph 30)<br>
have the following to offer: `Before the decision to dispatch a mission is<br>
taken,<br>
the following conditions must be fulfilled: - establishment of an effective and<br>
durable cease-fire; - agreement on the necessary Memoranda of<br>
Understanding with the parties concerned, and - provision of guarantees for<br>
the safety at all times of personnel involved'. Paragraph 31 states: `Missions<br>
will be dispatched as soon as possible following such a decision'. In other<br>
words, the criteria of paragraph 30 must be fulfilled before a decision is<br>
taken. Obviously, if the cease-fire would break down (i.e. would prove not to<br>
be durably effective) the mission would not go ahead. <br>
<p>
Point b is answered in paragraphs 39-45 concerning the `Chain of<br>
Command' and the `Head of Mission'. (Of course, the parties concerned could<br>
make their consent dependent on the fulfilment of certain additional criteria.)<br>
In view of recent `lessons learned' in un operations, particular attention will<br>
be devoted to the clarity of the mandate, the unambiguity and unity of<br>
command, the attainability of the objectives and the `robust' quality of the<br>
rules of engagement. <br>
<p>
Political guidance, as mentioned in point c, is dealt with in paragraph 38:<br>
`The Council/cso will regularly review an operation and make any necessary<br>
decision related to its conduct, taking into account political developments and<br>
developments in the field'. <br>
<p>
Helsinki-ii contains a pko model, which so far has not been put into<br>
operational practice. (Planning for an osce-model pko in Nagorny-Karabakh<br>
has been going on for quite some time.) The model could be amended in the<br>
light of future experience; perhaps the lessons which the un is drawing from<br>
its recent experiences could already now be useful. In some instances the<br>
model could certainly do with some elaboration, e.g. with regard to the<br>
financing of operations. <br>
<p>
With regard to the mandate, as raised in point d, the Helsinki Document<br>
states in chapter iii, paragraph 13: `Peacekeeping activities could be used,<br>
inter alia, to supervise and help maintain cease-fires, to monitor troop<br>
withdrawals, to support the maintenance of law and order, to provide<br>
humanitarian and medical aid and to assist refugees." The word `and' in the<br>
last line notwithstanding, the formulation of this paragraph does not make it<br>
entirely clear whether the various elements could be combined in one and the<br>
same mandate. (The words `inter alia' show that this list is non-exhaustive.) <br>
<p>
5. More in general, how can PKOs fit in the overall, <br>
<p>
comprehensive OSCE approach to a certain problem? <br>
<p>
The osce documents do not offer explicit guidance on this issue. Nevertheless,<br>
it is of crucial importance that this question be answered by the participating<br>
states in each and every concrete case in which a peacekeeping operation is<br>
considered. As un experience teaches us, in most cases a pko by itself is an<br>
insufficient response to a problematic situation. The basic assumption<br>
underlying the osce's comprehensive approach, i.e. that a problem has to be<br>
tackled in a coordinated way on many different levels and fields of activity,<br>
reinforces this point. <br>
<p>
The rule of consensus and PKOs <br>
<p>
The question arises whether the osce has the capability to act and to act<br>
quickly enough, in view of the fact that it decides almost all issues by<br>
consensus. One or a few states could effectively block decision-taking. Is there<br>
a way to avoid this? For example, why should a state be allowed to block a<br>
decision on fielding a pko if the parties directly concerned all agree to such<br>
an (osce) operation and if sufficient states are `able and willing' to<br>
contribute<br>
to such an operation? <br>
<p>
Entering into the realm of `hard' options like pkos, we are moving on to<br>
situations in which the consensus rule may stand in the way of timely and<br>
effective decision-making. We do not approach this issue light-heartedly. The<br>
rule of consensus and the principle of sovereign equality of the participating<br>
states guarantee broad political support for decisions taken by the osce. It<br>
avoids a situation in which the osce would be only an instrument of the great<br>
powers, although the Budapest meeting has also shown that without those<br>
powers `nothing goes'. <br>
<p>
At the same time, the rule of consensus turns osce decision-making into a<br>
laborious and slow affair, often leading to watered-down compromises. Except<br>
for the rarest of situations, no sanction other than persuasion and political<br>
pressure is available. The consensus-minus-one rule applies only in<br>
extraordinary cases and so far has been used in only one case. <br>
<p>
In the end, the question is what one would wish to achieve with the osce, and<br>
whether in the light of that ambition the rule of consensus is an advantage or<br>
a drawback. Conflict prevention would not require a change, since in most<br>
cases the cooperation of the states concerned is essential to its success.<br>
(However, sometimes measures can be taken which do not require the<br>
cooperation of the party concerned.) <br>
<p>
One possible nuance, however, could be advantageous, namely the<br>
introduction of the principle of interested states or, better termed perhaps, of<br>
the non-interested states. States which declare themselves to have no interest<br>
in a certain situation or measure or programme would not be bound by the<br>
decisions thus taken and would not participate in the decision-making on<br>
that issue. The risk is that states will withdraw from many osce activities, in<br>
particular when the financial implications are considerable (e.g. in the case<br>
of a pko!). Nevertheless, the possibility of establishing ad hoc groups of<br>
states<br>
as foreseen in the 1992 Helsinki Document points in the same direction. <br>
<p>
It is only if the osce should be able to apply measures against the will of the<br>
state(s) concerned that other decision-making rules could be needed. As far<br>
as decision-taking on pkos is concerned, the following considerations deserve<br>
attention. In the first place, a pko presupposes consent by the parties. The<br>
possibility of a decision on a pko by a qualified majority opens the option for<br>
states to dissociate themselves from a decision without blocking it. States<br>
would then not have to be involved, politically or militarily, in implementing<br>
the pko which would lose credibility and stamina, certainly if it were major<br>
states which would withdraw. <br>
<p>
Furthermore, if `hard options' like pkos could be decided by majority voting,<br>
there would be no reason not to introduce such a procedure in all softer<br>
options as well. Such a development could very well undermine the very<br>
consensual foundations of the osce. Osce decisions would run the risk of not<br>
being implemented at all. (At this point it is useful to realise that such<br>
options<br>
do already exist, e.g. in the framework of the Moscow Mechanism which<br>
provides for the despatch of fact-finding missions even against the will of the<br>
state concerned. However, the existence of this option has never led to the<br>
conclusion or even the argument that such a possibility ought to apply in<br>
other, softer procedures as well.) <br>
<p>
Perhaps the approach through the use of the `able and willing' would be<br>
more fruitful. Before a decision is taken, states would declare their<br>
willingness to participate, a `leading state' being one of them. (These<br>
preconditions apply to every pko.) One example is the Multilateral Force of<br>
Observers (mfo), an ad hoc coalition which was established outside the un<br>
framework because the Soviet Union blocked the formation of a un force for<br>
the purpose of monitoring the post-1967 cease-fire in the Middle East. <br>

Agence France Presse<br>
December 03, 1996<br>
<p>
LISBON, Dec 3 (AFP) - Negotiators at a summit of the pan-European <br>
security body the OSCE failed Tuesday to break a deadlock between <br>
Armenia and Azerbaijan blocking accord on a summit declaration, a <br>
diplomat said. <br>
<p>
Their conclusions were to be presented to the heads of state and <br>
government for their consideration, but it was "unlikely" that they <br>
could agree a final declaration, the source said. <br>
<p>
"It is unlikely we will have this document, the diplomat said, referring <br>
to the final political document of the two-day summit of the <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). <br>
<p>
Because unanimity is required for the final declaration, the dispute <br>
jeopardizes the overall accord due to be announced at a closing press <br>
conference at 1330 GMT. <br>
<p>
The last OSCE summit in Budapest two years ago collapsed in chaos after <br>
delegates failed to agree a resolution on Bosnia-Hercegovina, in <br>
particular because of Russian disagreement. <br>
<p>
Armenia and Azerbaijan are locked in a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a <br>
predominantly Armenian-populated enclave inside Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
More than 20,000 people have been killed since inter-ethnic fighting <br>
erupted in 1988. <br>
<p>
US envoy to the summit John Kornblum said shortly before that he still <br>
held out hope for an agreement. <br>
<p>
"As happened in the past in OSCE meetings individual countries with <br>
individual concerns are continuing to want their concerns met before <br>
they approve the documents and this is the situation now," he said. <br>
<p>
"I go into these things presuming success," he said, but added: "It's <br>
impossible to predict what will happen ... great efforts are being <br>
made." <br>

ITAR-TASS News Agency<br>
December 03, 1996<br>
<p>
  LISBON, December 3 (Itar-Tass) - "I hope that Armenian and Azerbaijani <br>
leaders will use the Lisbon summit and continue settlement talks with <br>
due account of the opinion of leaders of the OSCE member-countries," <br>
Russian Prime Minister and head of the Russian delegation to the OSCE <br>
Lisbon summit meeting told correspondents before his departure on <br>
Tuesday evening. <br>
<p>
"Unfortunately, not all the documents were adopted at the Lisbon summit <br>
as we would like them to" because of different stands of Armenia and <br>
Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh, said the prime minister. "But there was <br>
a consensus even in that situation." <br>
<p>
Item 20 of the summit's final declaration was put outside the document <br>
limits, and a statement of the OSCE executive chairman was circulated <br>
instead of this item to outline fundamental settlement principles. "We <br>
agree with this statement, which would supplement basic documents of the <br>
summit, and are sure these principles will enable further work," the <br>
Russian prime minister said. <br>
<p>
The statement laments that efforts of the Minsk Conference co-chairmen <br>
to coordinate the sides' opinions on Karabakh settlement principles were <br>
fruitless. <br>
<p>
The Minsk Conference co-chairmen recommended three settlement principles, <br>
which were supported by all members of the Minsk Group, says the <br>
statement. These are: <br>
<p>
-- territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the Republic of <br>
Armenia; <br>
<p>
-- a legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh, outlined in an agreement on the <br>
basis of self-determination, which would give Nagorno-Karabakh the <br>
highest decree of self-government within Azerbaijan; <br>
<p>
-- guaranteed security for Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole population, <br>
including mutual obligations to abide by settlement provisions. (end)<br>

<p>
1. OSCE CHAIRMAN SIDES WITH AZERBAIJAN AFTER SUMMIT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The final declaration of the Lisbon Summit <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe does <br>
not include the paragraph which deals with the status of Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh.<br>
	"It is widely known that no advance has been registered over <br>
the last two years in the Karabakh problem. I express my regret <br>
that efforts by the Minsk Group co-chairmen to reconcile the <br>
conflicting sides have not been successful," OSCE chairman Flavio <br>
Cotti said in a statement following the two-day summit this week.<br>
	"The territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and Armenia, the <br>
status of autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh on the territory of <br>
Azerbaijan and guarantees of security of Nagorno-Karabakh should <br>
lie on the basis of the settlement of the Karabakh conflict and <br>
all member states of the Minsk Group believe it so," Molorak <br>
[Planet] newspaper quoted Cotti as saying.<br>
	The proposed paragraph on Nagorno-Karabakh was not accepted <br>
by the Armenian delegation.<br>
	"We achieved what we wanted to, and the final document <br>
adopted at the Lisbon Summit lacked the decision Azerbaijan was <br>
seeking for the past three months," said Deputy Foreign Minister <br>
of Armenia Vartan Oskanian.<br>
	Oskanian noted that the opinion of the international <br>
community on the territorial integrity issue to a certain extent <br>
coincides with that of Azerbaijan. Co-chairmen and members of the <br>
Minsk Group, as well as member states of the OSCE advocated that <br>
viewpoint, but its one thing to express that viewpoint and <br>
another to adopt a resolution during negotiations, Oskanian said.<br>
	The European Union spoke out in support of Azerbaijan. The <br>
EU representative at the summit said his group fully supported the <br>
20th paragraph mentioning the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. <br>
The Turkish representative voiced support for Azerbaijan as well.<br>
	Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, standing in for <br>
President Boris Yeltsin, said that the 20th paragraph served as a <br>
solid base for further negotiations.<br>
	Negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh hit a brick wall with no hint of a breakthrough in sight.<br>
	Forced into action by the threat of Azerbaijan vetoing the <br>
entire final summit declaration, international mediators agreed to <br>
drop all reference to the dispute from the closing document and <br>
issued a separate statement on it instead.<br>
	Levon Ter-Petrosyan sat stony-faced at the final session of <br>
the OSCE meeting. Azeri President Gaidar Aliyev, who dropped his <br>
veto threat, hailed his success.<br>
	"I am very satisfied," Aliyev told a news conference.<br>
	Ter-Petrosyan, by contrast, canceled a planned news <br>
conference.<br>
	Azerbaijan wanted its territorial integrity reaffirmed in <br>
the final summit statement. It also sought support for demands to <br>
define Nagorno-Karabakhs legal status clearly, based on the right <br>
to self-determination and guarantees over its security. Armenia <br>
blocked Azerbaijans demands, earning the wrath of other states at <br>
the closing session, including Russia.<br>
	Azerbaijans demands were included in the separate statement <br>
drawn up to the indignation of Ter-Petrosyan.<br>
	He has said "unilateral solutions" must not be imposed over <br>
Karabakh. <br>
	"I would like to express concern in connection with this <br>
statement. In our view it does not reflect the spirit and the <br>
letter of the Minsk Group," Ter-Petrosyan said.<br>
	His comments made clear the leaders left Lisbon as far apart <br>
on Nagorno-Karabakh as when they arrived.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. KIVIRIAN ENDS HUNGER STRIKE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Late Tuesday evening, Argishti Kivirian, an <br>
Abkhazian citizen arrested during the post-presidential election <br>
crackdown in Yerevan, ended his 15-day hunger strike.<br>
	According to Vladimir [Vova] Hakhverdian of the National <br>
Democratic Union, Kivirian ended his hunger strike after learning <br>
about his sisters solidarity hunger strike.<br>
	Kivirians health has seriously deteriorated and Armenias <br>
Prosecutor General Artavazd Gevorkian has assured that all <br>
necessary measures to restore his health will be taken, <br>
Hakhverdian said.<br>
	Armenika Kivirian stopped her 6-day-long hunger strike as <br>
well.<br>
	Hakhverdian said the preliminary investigation into the <br>
Sept. 25 events has been delayed by two months.<br>
	Kivirian began  the hunger strike on Nov. 19 from his cell <br>
in the Noubarashen prison.<br>
	His sister who joined the solidarity hunger strike called by <br>
relatives of other detainees, was ordered to be hospitalized after <br>
eight days.<br>
	Armenias Health Minister Ara Babloyan ordered the immediate <br>
hospitalization of Kivirians sister, also a citizen of Abkhazia, <br>
Hakhverdian said.<br>
	Chief warden of the Noubarashen prison falsly reported to <br>
the prosecutor that Kivirian had ended the strike since he was <br>
smoking, Hakhverdian said.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. SICU APPLAUDS EUROPARLIAMENT RESOLUTION<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)- "The presidential and local elections of <br>
1996 marked the end of the formation of illegitimate power in <br>
Armenia which started during the parliamentary elections and the <br>
referendum on the Constitution last year," the Scientific-<br>
Industrial and Civil Union said Tuesday in a statement addressed <br>
to the European Parliament, Council of Europe and member states of <br>
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and its <br>
Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.<br>
	The statement criticized the Constitutional Courts handling <br>
of the opposition candidates petitions, saying that the court did <br>
not pay attention to the final report of the OSCE observers, which <br>
had served as the basis for SICU chairman and presidential <br>
candidate Ashot Manucharian's petition.<br>
	The SICU leadership said the court simply organized a formal <br>
scrutiny of only 13 of the 45 precincts mentioned in the OSCE <br>
report, questioned only nine witnesses and did not consider <br>
violations committed before and during the voting. It only <br>
verified the summarized data of the Central Electoral Commission.<br>
	The SICU Council called on the international community to <br>
actively participate in and pay close attention to the <br>
Constitutional Court of Armenia.<br>
	In addition, the SICU called on European institutions to pay <br>
more attention to the crisis of legitimate power in Armenia and <br>
asked for the immediate suspension of financial assistance to the <br>
"illegitimate and corrupted regime."<br>
<p>
<p>
4. TEHRAN-ARMENIANS VOICE PROTEST<br>
<p>
TEHRAN (Alik)-A capacity crowd turned out at "Ararat" stadium <br>
"Sasountsi Davit" hall Friday to hear Armenian Revolutionary <br>
Federation Executive Council of Armenia member and other <br>
academicians who spoke about the ongoing threat to democracy in <br>
Armenia.<br>
	At the conclusion of the gathering, a protest resolution was <br>
adopted calling for new presidential elections in Armenia, the <br>
immediate release of all Armenian political prisoners and an end <br>
to the persecution of opposition leaders.<br>
	The hall was filled to capacity and many were forced to <br>
follow the program standing up or from the outside entryway.<br>
	A representative of the Armenian National Committee of Iran <br>
formally convened the program, saying that the imperative in <br>
Armenia today was the non-existence of leadership and the <br>
continued insistence by a self-proclaimed leader who rejected the <br>
will of the people.<br>
	A brief description of events following the presidential <br>
election and leading to the opposition rallies which were <br>
disbursed by gunfire from troops ordered into the city by the <br>
president and his authorities.<br>
	A videotape was then presented chronicling the events in <br>
Armenia, following which a message to the Iranian-Armenian <br>
community from opposition candidate Vazgen Manoukian was <br>
broadcast.<br>
	Organizers of the rally had called Manoukian earlier that <br>
day and had asked him to convey his thoughts to the Iranian <br>
Armenian-community.<br>
	The ARF Executive Council of Armenia member Vartan <br>
Petrossian then addressed the gathering, describing the current <br>
political climate in Armenia prior and following the presidential <br>
election, outlining the posturing and positions of the opposition.<br>
	Renowned poetess and academician Silva Kapoutikian was <br>
presented and prior to her remarks, poetess Silva Youzbashian <br>
recited several of Kapoutikians timeless works.<br>
	In her remarks, Kapoutikian captivated the audience by <br>
recounting the issues of importance to the Armenian people.<br>
	"Diaspora, with its existence and stability," Kapoutikian <br>
said, is a natural resource replacing the waterways and the oil <br>
which Armenia lacks.<br>
	"The belief is strengthened every time I travel abroad, and <br>
it was once again reinforced in me when I visited your community <br>
center. When I visited your schools, kindergartens I saw in them <br>
your national institutions, and todays gathering is enough for me <br>
to remember for several years to come that we have won, we are <br>
winning and we will win," remarked Kapoutikian.<br>
	At the conclusion of the gathering the protest resolution <br>
was read and approved through thunderous applause.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. ARMENIAN STUDENTS TURNED BACK AT CONSULATE<br>
<p>
BY SEBOUH SIMONIAN<br>
Asbarez Staff Writer<br>
<p>
BEVERLY HILLS-A group of Armenian-American youth arrived at the <br>
Consulate of the Republic of Armenia in Beverly Hills last Tuesday <br>
with intentions of delivering a letter to Consul-General Armen <br>
Baibourtian who was not in the office to accept the letter.<br>
	Baibourtian left for Yerevan Monday and was scheduled to <br>
return Tuesday, according to receptionist Hagop Hovanessian, who <br>
spoke with Meroujan S. Kitsinian and Lilith Davitian of the youth <br>
group.<br>
	[Eds: Baibourtian made an appearance Sunday at St. Marys <br>
Armenian Apostolic Church in Glendale during Mass.]<br>
	Kitsinian, 26, informed the receptionist that the group had <br>
been notified on Monday that Baibourtian would be in the office <br>
when the group arrived the following day.<br>
	Hovanessian suggested to the group to either leave the <br>
letter at the office or return at a later date.<br>
	The letter signed by a group of concerned Armenian-American <br>
youth addressed concerns about the recent presidential elections <br>
in Armenia, mainly criticizing the Constitutional Court. In regard <br>
to the courts rejection of a petition by the opposition to <br>
nullify the results of the recent presidential elections and hold <br>
a new election, the letter stated that the court has been "very <br>
much a part of the entire effort by the administration to, at all <br>
costs, maintain the stranglehold on the Armenian people and <br>
continue the persecution of innocent citizens of Armenia."<br>
	"We are extremely discouraged by the actions of Armenias <br>
current authorities and wish to voice severe discontent for the <br>
violation of human and individual rights which have occurred at <br>
the hands of Levon Ter-Petrosyan and his regime," the letter <br>
stated.<br>
	Davitian, a senior at UCLA, said that "Armenians must not <br>
stay indifferent about what is going in Armenia. Concerned <br>
Armenians need to go out and do their best to help Armenia become <br>
a truly democratic country."<br>
	"The people of America recently experienced a very <br>
democratic election where every citizen freely cast their vote," <br>
Kitsinian said. <br>
	"Armenians in Armenia have been deprived of this basic human <br>
right to elect their own officials. In addition, members of <br>
opposition parties have been subjected to imprisonment and <br>
beatings. We [concerned Armenians] will continue to make demands <br>
because we firmly believe in the democratic process," the letter <br>
read.<br>

        THE ARMENIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONDEMNS THE EUROPEAN<br>
 PARLIAMENT'S RESOLUTION ON ARMENIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, DECEMBER 2, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Recently the "Fact" news agency has published a statement of the<br>
 Central Committee of the Armenian Communists Party regarding the<br>
 European Parliament's resolution on presidential elections in<br>
 Armenia.<br>
 The statement reads, in particular:<br>
 "According to the Central Committee of the Armenian Communist Party,<br>
 the passage of this resolution is based not so much on the concern<br>
 about further democratic development of the country, but on the<br>
 desire to keep the influence of certain political forces in our<br>
 republic.<br>
 It is the first time since the declaration of indepence that our<br>
 society witnesses such a blatant interference with its internal<br>
 affair."<br>
 It also says in the statement that all the processes taking place in<br>
 the region are conditioned by the temporary weakness of Russia and<br>
 the desire of the West to established its influence in the countries<br>
 of the region.<br>
 Remaining a truly opposition party, which does not agree with the<br>
 present authorities of the Republic of Armenia on various important<br>
 principle issues, the Armenian Communist Party stated that using its<br>
 authority and influence, it will not allow for our country to become<br>
 an field for antinational and antidemocratic experiments.<br>
<p>
        BORDER INCIDENT<br>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Early in the morning of November 30, some unidentifies persons had<br>
 stolen 25 domestic animals from a resident of village Jujevan of<br>
 Tavush province (north-eastern Armenia, near the Azeri border). The<br>
 footprints were pointing toward the Ghazakh region in Azerbaijan.<br>
 Later on, the experts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and<br>
 National Security of the Republic of Armenia found the animals and an<br>
 armed group of people who stole them. The group was asked to drop<br>
the weapons, but instead they opened fire. The Armenian side had to<br>
 respond. 2 people from that group were killed, 2 escaped.<br>
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs asked the Ministry of Foreign<br>
 Affairs of the Republic of Armenia to sent a note of protest to the<br>
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
        "EDIPA" TO HELP ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENTS<br>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>

 relations for attracting foreign investments.<br>
 According to the agency's director, Mr. Boris Harutyunian, the agency<br>
 has active contacts with Italian, French, Greek, and Lithuanian<br>
 organizations. These contacts are very helpful in finding foreign<br>
 partner for Armenian organizations, as well as for involving foreign<br>
 factories in Armenian economy.<br>
 "Edipa" also offers consulting services and specialist training<br>
 courses.<br>

<p>
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev said in his speech to the Organization<br>
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit meeting in Lisbon on 2nd<br>
December that independence for the disputed region of Nagornyy Karabakh was<br>
unacceptable to Azerbaijan, NTV reported. <br>
<p>
"We cannot allow a second Armenian state to be formed, on the territory of<br>
Azerbaijan.   The Armenian side should finally recognize that the conflict<br>
which it has unleashed, which is in its eighth year now and which has brought<br>
great misfortune and suffering to the people of Azerbaijan, has also made<br>
things difficult for the people of Armenia itself," Aliyev said in remarks<br>
broadcast by the television. <br>
<p>
Aliyev told Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during their meeting<br>
later on 2nd that he was concerned about Baku and Yerevan's failure to agree<br>
the contents of a political declaration on the status of Nagornyy Karabakh to<br>
be adopted by the Lisbon summit meeting, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on<br>
3rd December. <br>
<p>
"According to some information received by ITAR-TASS on the sidelines of the<br>
meeting, Azerbaijan warned that it may block the adoption of the declaration<br>
if no consensus is reached on the Karabakh issue," the agency said. <br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin instructed members of the Russian delegation "to take measures<br>
to help in a search for a mutually acceptable understanding" , it added. <br>

<p>
The 54-nation European security summit agreed yesterday to work towards a new<br>
security system in Europe after a last-minute compromise in a row involving<br>
Armenia and Azerbaijan which threatened to derail the entire meeting. Heads<br>
of government of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe<br>
<i>&gt;from North America, Europe and the former Soviet Union issued a mildly-worded</i><br>
final statement on the promotion of "security and stability" in Europe which<br>
Azerbaijan had threatened until the last moment to veto. <br>
<p>
The Azeri veto was only lifted after the OSCE's Swiss chairman, Mr Flavio<br>
Cotti, agreed to read out a statement regretting Armenia's refusal to accept<br>
a compromise proposal on the future of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which<br>
is inside Azerbaijan, but largely populated by Armenians. Bruce Clark, Lisbon<br>

parliamentary exchanges are of great benefit to the development of bilateral<br>
relations, said chinese vice-president rong yiren when he met here today with<br>
an armenian national assembly delegation headed by its speaker babken<br>
ararktsyan. on behalf of the chinese government, rong extended a warm welcome<br>
to ararktsyan and his delegation on its first china visit since the two<br>
countries forged diplomatic ties in 1992.  china holds that all countries in<br>
the world should treat each other on the basis of equality and friendship,<br>
rong said, adding that since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the<br>
two countries, high-level visits have greatly promoted bilateral cooperation<br>
in the fields of politics, science and technology, and culture.  both china<br>
and armenia are developing countries, shouldering the task of developing<br>
their respective national economies and improving their peoples' livelihoods.<br>
the sharing of experiences is conducive to the development of both countries,<br>
since they have many things in common, rong noted.  rong also briefed the<br>
guests on china's reform and opening-up policies and its long-range<br>
development plan to the year 2010. ararktsyan said that his delegation is<br>
very glad to have an opportunity to become acquainted with china's history<br>
and present conditions as well as its reform progress, adding that he and his<br>
colleagues are particularly interested in the economic and social development<br>
of china.  both china and armenia are carrying out reform and have potential<br>
for co-operation, said the speaker, noting that it is important for armenia<br>
to get to know more about china's development road. <br>

<p>
iran, armenia, georgia and greece today held the second quadrilateral meeting<br>
of deputy foreign ministers in a bid to expand cooperation in fields of trade<br>
and transportation.  the four countries have proposed to establish four<br>
committees on telecommunications, tourism, industry, trade, economy and<br>
energy. iranian deputy foreign minister mahmoud vaezi, armenian deputy<br>
foreign minister sergei manasarian, georgian deputy foreign minister malkhaz<br>
kakabadzadeh and greek foreign ministry's secretary-general konstantin gorio<br>
are leading their respective delegations.  observers here noted that<br>
cooperation of the four countries is politically important because armenia<br>
and greece were believed to be historical enemies of turkey.  while iran is<br>
courting friendship of both to find an alternative for its outlet to europe,<br>
it is worried about the close ties between turkey and israel.  however,<br>
iranian deputy foreign minister vaezi made it clear that the economic<br>
cooperation in the region is aimed at more closer ties among the regional<br>
countries and is not detrimental to other countries. addressing the opening<br>
session of the two-day meeting, vaezi said the independence of the central<br>
asian and caucasian republics has provided an opportunity for iran to go on<br>
bilateral and regional cooperation with the republics.  he added that<br>
regional cooperation is an priority in the diplomacy of iran. iran believes<br>
that regional cooperation is an important means for guaranteeing peace and<br>
security in the region and that's why iran is seriously interested in<br>
bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral cooperation with the regional states.<br>
 "the islamic republic of iran, as an important transit route with abundant<br>
energy sources is ready to develop cooperation using the economic potential<br>
of the countries in the region," he added.  the foreign ministers of iran,<br>
armenia, greece and georgia are expected to hold meeting in athens in<br>
january. <br>

<p>
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan Monday told a 54-nation European<br>
security conference that he feared genocide in the disputed Nagorny Karabach<br>
region if proposals for a resolution by Azerbaijan were accepted. <br>
<p>
"Despite any and all assurances that may be given, Azerbaijan is unable to<br>
guarantee the security of the population in Nagorny Karabach," said<br>
Ter-Petrosyan in a speech to leaders from the Organisation for Security and<br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). <br>
<p>
Ter-Petrosyan said if Baku's plan was accepted the people of Nagorny Karabach<br>
would face "genocide or forced deportation". <br>
<p>
Nevertheless, he pledged Armenia would adhere to its ceasefire with<br>
Azerbaijan and continue to negotiate toward "a reasonable and fair<br>
compromise" over the territory. <br>
<p>
Nagorny Karabach is an ethnic Armenian region within Azerbaijan which has<br>
been under control of local and Armenian forces after a military conflict<br>
between Baku and Yerevan ended with a ceasefire in May 1994. <br>
<p>
Ter-Petrosyan was due to meet Azerbaijan's president, Heidar Aliyev, who is<br>
also attending the Lisbon summit. <br>
<p>
Angry over the Nagorny Karabach stalemate Azerbaijan has threatened to<br>
disrupt the summit by blocking approval of three OSCE declarations. <br>
<p>
Baku has demanded an OSCE pledge that any settlement of the Karabach dispute<br>
respect Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. <br>
<p>
Ter-Petrosyan insists that the people of Nagorny Karabach must be granted the<br>
right to self-determination. <br>
<p>
"Armenia refuses to recognise the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan,"<br>
declared Aliyev in a speech to OSCE leaders, adding that he believed Yerevan<br>
planned to keep part of the 20 per cent of his country currently under the<br>
control of Armenian forces. <br>
<p>
But he stressed Baku would also adhere to the ceasefire until a peace treaty<br>
was signed. <br>
<p>
Aliyev said Azerbaijan was prepared to offer Nagorny Karabach a high degree<br>
of autonomy linked to regional security guarantees. <br>
<p>
But Baku would not allow the creation of a second Armenian state within the<br>
territory of Azerbaijan, he said.<br>

     THE ARMENIAN CHURCH IN KAYSERI (GESARIA), TURKEY REOPENED FOR WORSHIP<br>
     <br>
     ISTANBUL ("Larper" 2/12/96)--Last weekend St. Gregory Armenian Church <br>
     of Kayseri (Gesaria) was officially reopened by formal ceremonies <br>
     presided by Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan, Chairman of the Religious <br>
     Council of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. For a long <br>
     time, the church was closed due to renovations. <br>
     <br>
     Currently, the St. Gregory Armenian Church serves the religious needs <br>
     of the small Armenian communities spread in central Anatolia and on <br>
     the eastern banks of the Black Sea. It is the only functioning <br>
     Armenian Church in the area.  The church in Kayseri (Cappadocian <br>
     Ceasarea) was built in 1191. Since the early centuries of <br>
     Christianity, Armenians have been active in this city as an important <br>
     commercial center in Asia Minor.<br>
     <br>
     According to Turkish encyclopedias, in 1890 there were 43,318 <br>
     Apostolic Armenians in the province of Kayseri, 1,800 Armenian <br>
     Protestants and 1,575 Armenian Catholics.  Today only 10 Armenians <br>
     live in Kayseri. However, St. Gregory Church serves as the religious <br>
     center for about 3,000 Armenians living in central Anatolia and the <br>
     Eastern provinces.<br>
     <br>
     On the Way to Kayseri<br>
     <br>
     Renovated in memory of Gesaria-native Hagop Tokerian, the reopening of <br>
     St. Gregory Church was decreed by the Armenian Patriarch of Turkey, <br>
     Archbishop Karekin II Kazanjian.<br>
     <br>
     On Thursday, November 30, over 400 Armenian pilgrims from Istanbul <br>
     headed to Gesaria on nine buses; they  were later joined by another 30 <br>
     pilgrims who traveled to the region by plane. Others came from Ankara, <br>
     Sepastia, Malatya, Tokat and the villages of Yozgat to participate in <br>
     the opening ceremonies.  Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan and his entourage <br>
     of priests and lay representative arrived on Friday and were greeted <br>
     by the representative of St. Gregory Church, Antranik Erkouyoumjian <br>
     and other officials. <br>
     <br>
     Upon their arrival, the delegation from the Patriarchate visited the <br>
     church and inspected the results of the renovations that were carried <br>
     out and discussed the schedule of weekend activities.<br>
     <br>
     On Saturday morning, the delegation, headed by Archbishop Mesrob, <br>
     visited the historic sites of Goreme, Urgupi and the famous churches <br>
     of the region.  In the afternoon, an elaborate ceremony of "Opening <br>
     the Doors of the Church" (T'rnpatzek) was held in St. Gregory Church <br>
     in the presence of more than 500 Armenian faithful.  Archbishop Mesrob <br>
     consecrated the three altars of the church and the baptismal font.  <br>
     The wood-carved altars and the delicate frescos inside the church, <br>
     which were carefully restored to their original brilliance, testify to <br>
     the fine artistry of Armenian masters. <br>
     <br>
     On this occasion, Archbishop Mesrob delivered a sermon highlighting <br>
     the importance of the reopening of the St. Gregory Church.  He <br>
     recounted the historic event when St. Gregory the Illuminator, the <br>
     patron saint of the Armenian Church, was consecrated the Head of the <br>
     Armenian Apostolic Church, here in Gesaria in the 4th century, by <br>
     Leontius, the Archbishop of Ceasarea.  As such, Gesaria has a <br>
     significant role in the history of the Armenian Church, especially as <br>
     we prepare for the celebrations of the 1700th anniversary of <br>
     acceptance of Christianity as state religion in Armenia. Based on a <br>
     passage from the Book of Psalms, Archbishop Mesrob then explained the <br>
     importance of temples build for the glory of God and how the faithful, <br>
     collectively, contribution to the edification of a `holy place' where <br>
     individuals experience the presence of God. <br>
     <br>
     The reopening of the church in Kayseri coincided with the 535 <br>
     anniversary of the founding of the Armenian Patriarchate of <br>
     Constantinople.  In 1462, Sultan Mehmet II, after conquering <br>
     Constantinople, established the Greek and Armenian Patriarchates <br>
     respectively.  The mayor of Kayseri, acting in the same spirit as <br>
     Mehmet II, has not only permitted the renovation of the Armenian <br>
     church, but has also allocated financial resources to build a high <br>
     stone-fence around the Armenian cemetery of Kayseri. <br>
     <br>
     The mayor of Kayseri, Dr. Shukri Karatepe, was present during the <br>
     consecration ceremonies of the church. After the religious services, <br>
     in the courtyard of the church, the mayor welcomed Archbishop Mesrob <br>
     and greeted the opening of the Armenian Church in Kayseri with warm <br>
     words.  He emphasized that it would be wrong to look at this event <br>
     from a "touristic point of view", but rather the importance of this <br>
     event rests in the peaceful coexistence of Christian and Moslem <br>
     peoples.  "In the past, we have passed through sad events together, <br>
     but today, the time has come to build strong bridges between various <br>
     communities", said the mayor. <br>
     <br>
     In his response, Archbishop Mesrob, after thanking the mayor, said: <br>
     "There are no formal inter-religious relations in Turkey between the <br>
     clergymen of various religions, however, we notice that there is a <br>
     dialogue in our daily-life relations with each other, which are very <br>
     important for mutual understanding and for steps toward formal <br>
     rapprochement".  <br>
     <br>
     Visit to the Armenian Cemetery<br>
     <br>
     At 3:00 p.m. on the same day, Archbishop Mesrob, in the company of the <br>
     mayor and several hundred Armenian pilgrims, visited the Armenian <br>
     cemetery in Kayseri.  A requiem service was conducted for the departed <br>
     souls of the Armenians of the city.  Archbishop Mesrob said that the <br>
     cemetery looked in better condition. Recently, the municipality of <br>
     Kayseri has appointed a full-time custodian for the cemetery.  Mayor <br>
     Karatepe expressed his willingness to enhance the efforts of Armenians <br>
     if they wish to renovate the cemetery and the old graves.  After the <br>
     cemetery visit, Archbishop Mesrob returned to Istanbul. <br>
     <br>
     Divine Liturgy and Blessing of Madagh<br>
     <br>
     On Sunday, December 1, Divine Liturgy was celebrated in St. Gregory <br>
     Church, presided by Fr. Aram Vartabed Ateshian.  The Blessing of <br>
     Madagh and requiem services followed the Liturgy. <br>
     <br>
     Henceforth, the Armenian Patriarchate will send visiting priests to <br>
     Kayseri on a regular basis to conduct religious services and to <br>
     minister to the needs of the Armenian communities in the region. <br>

ORGANIZING COMMITTEE FOR THE INAUGURATION<br>
OF THE NEW BUILDING OF THE EMBASSY OF ARMENIA <br>
7 Delaware Avenue, Ottawa, Ontario K2P OZ2 <br>
<p>
<p>
P.S.A.<br>
November 15, 1996<br>
For immediate release<br>
<p>
<p>
All Canadian-Armenians are invited to attend the dedication ceremony<br>
of the permanent site of the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in<br>
Canada. The ceremonies will be held at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday December<br>
7, 1996, at 7 Delaware Avenue in Ottawa. A reception will immediately<br>
follow.<br>
<p>
As you are aware, this year marks the eighth anniversary of the tragic<br>
earthquake of December 7, 1988, in Armenia. Entire villages,<br>
residential and industrial complexes, schools and hospitals were<br>
destroyed. Soviet officials estimated over 25,000 casualties and<br>
500,000 people left homeless. The Armenian Embassy, in collaboration<br>
with the Canadian-Armenian Community, will commemorate the Armenian<br>
Earthquake by hosting special Requiem Prayers on December 6, 1996, in<br>
the House of Commons in Ottawa.<br>
<p>
It is truly symbolic that the inauguration coincides with the<br>
catastrophic earthquake of December 7, 1988, in Armenia. It is,<br>
indeed, testament to the invincible Armenian spirit and will to<br>
flourish in spite of all adversities.<br>
<p>
On this historic occasion, for the first time, Canadian-Armenians from<br>
across the country will witness the blessing and raising of the<br>
tricolour at Armenia's permanent home in Canada. The mission is now<br>
housed in a landmark mansion built with a unique Spanish Revival style<br>
in 1907/8 on the corner of Queen Elizabeth Drive on the Rideau<br>
Canal. It is the third foreign mission to occupy these premises that<br>
have also housed a government agency and several local personalities.<br>
<p>
In the evening of December 7, 1996, the organizing committee has<br>
planned a tribute banquet in honour of the principal donors, Mr. and<br>
Mrs. Sarkis Acopian. The banquet will be held in the Grand Hall of the<br>
Canadian Museum of Civilization at 100 Laurier Avenue in Hall and will<br>
begin at 6:30 p.m. with cocktails. Reservations are required for this<br>
event.<br>
<p>
We look forward to seeing all at these events. Those who are unable to<br>
attend and would like to commemorate this historic occasion with a<br>
contribution can do so by forwarding their gifts to the Embassy of the<br>
Republic of Armenia, 130 Albert Street, Suite 1006, Ottawa, Ontario<br>

HEADLINE: Iranian parliamentary delegation chief criticizes Karabakh election<br>
<p>
SOURCE: IRNA news agency, Tehran, in English 1947 gmt 28 Nov 96 <br>
<p>
The head of an Iranian parliamentary delegation on a two-day official visit<br>
to Azerbaijan has criticized the 24th November presidential elections held in<br>
the disputed region of Nagornyy Karabakh, the Iranian news agency IRNA<br>
reported on the 28th. <br>
<p>
Seyyed Reza Akrami, a member of the Iranian parliament's foreign affairs<br>
commission, said his country viewed Nagornyy Karabakh as an integral part of<br>
Azerbaijan and therefore believed the holding of presidential elections in<br>
the region was "deplorable" . <br>
<p>
He said Iran was interested in the preservation of Azerbaijan's territorial<br>
integrity and added that his country was ready to offer its expertise to<br>
Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
Akrami accused "the US and the Zionist regime" of trying to sow discord in<br>
the Caucasus region, and said that "the hands of the US and the Zionist<br>

<p>
Armenian communists on Friday [29th November] marked the 76th anniversary of<br>
Bolsheviks rising to power in Armenia.   Some 2,000 people marched down the<br>
central street in Yerevan and laid wreaths on the graves of Armenian<br>
Communist leaders.  <br>
<p>
Armenian Communist Party leader Sergey Badalyan said during a solemn session<br>
of the party that the victory of Soviet power in Armenia had created<br>
preconditions for building a civilized society and moving toward communism.<br>
Badalyan voiced the hope that "the holiday of 29th November will soon become<br>
official" in Armenia. <br>

<p>
The sister of a student detained for his alleged participation in the 25th<br>
September clashes between Armenian opposition supporters and police following<br>
the republic's presidential election has gone on hunger strike, Interfax news<br>
agency reported<br>
on 29th November. <br>
<p>
Twenty-year-old Armenika Kiviryan is holding the protest action outside the<br>
Armenian prosecutor's office in Yerevan.   Her brother, Argishti Kiviryan,<br>
went on hunger strike in prison 10 days ago. "He demanded that all prisoners<br>
of conscience be freed<br>
in Armenia, new presidential elections be held and the ban on the activity of<br>
Armenia' s Dashnaktsutyun party be lifted," the agency said. <br>
<p>
According to a member of the opposition National Democratic Union party,<br>
Kiviryan has been held in prison for two months now without being formally<br>
charged. He is one of about 20 people still in custody after the 25th<br>
September events, the opposition spokesman said. <br>
<p>
"Armenika Kiviryan told Interfax that her only demand was that her brother,<br>
whose life she believes to be in danger, be released," the agency said. <br>
<p>
A senior Armenian investigator, Suren Gezalyan, denied that Argishti Kiviryan<br>
was on hunger strike and said his health was "normal" . "The issue of whether<br>
to bring charges against him or let him go will be finally settled in the<br>
next few days," the investigator said. <br>

<p>
qiao shi, chairman of the standing committee of the national people's<br>
congress (npc), met here today with an armenian national assembly delegation<br>
headed by its speaker babken ararktsyan.  qiao said that china and armenia<br>
established diplomatic ties immediately after the independence of armenia,<br>
and china believes the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation in<br>
various fields will be constantly  trengthened on the basis of the principles<br>
stipulated in their joint communique on establishing<br>
diplomatic ties.  a further development of the cooperation between the two<br>
countries in the fields of trade, science, education and culture would lay a<br>
broader foundation for bilateral relations, qiao said, and the development of<br>
bilateral political ties would push forward such cooperation in a positive<br>
way.  the chairman said that the armenian delegation's current visit will<br>
help promote the understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two<br>
countries, and the npc is willing to further develop its friendly cooperation<br>
with the armenian national assembly. ararktsyan said that relations between<br>
armenia and china have developed constantly, and their  cooperation has<br>
expanded since they established diplomatic ties five years ago.<br>
he added that he expects to see closer ties between the parliaments of the<br>
two countries.  the speaker reiterated that armenia recognizes that there is<br>
only one china, and that is the people's republic of china, and it will not<br>
have any official<br>
exchanges with taiwan. <br>

HEADLINE: HIV infection in Armenia likely to spread: official <br>
SOURCE:  Agence France, Dec 2, 1996<br>
 <br>
Just eight cases of AIDS and 20 carriers have been registered in Armenia in<br>
recent years, but that figure is likely to rise significantly in the near<br>
future, an Armenian health official said Sunday. <br>
<p>
Dr. Lev Zograbian, director of the Armenian AIDS control and Prevention<br>
Center, told Interfax that while Armenia now has just a handful of AIDS<br>
cases, higher HIV rates in neighboring countries like Turkey and Lebanon will<br>
undoubtedly soon affect the former Soviet republic. <br>
<p>
Zograbian said that Armenian health authorities are also hampered by other<br>
problems including the fact that the AIDS centre in Yerevan, which houses 10<br>
patients, lacks running water. <br>
<p>
Armenian officials claim that foreigners brought AIDS into the country and<br>
have proposed legislation which they say would slow the spread of the disease<br>
by requiring the deportation of foreigners who are HIV positive. <br>
<p>
This is similar to a law in Russia which was passed almost a year ago but is<br>
not yet enforced. <br>
<p>
When enforced, the Russian law will require that all foreigners planning to<br>
stay in the country for more that three months be tested for HIV and will<br>
restrict visits by those who test positive. <br>
<p>
Russia currently claims 2,105 HIV carriers and 245 AIDS patients, but medical<br>
experts predict an explosion in the infection rate which will mean at least<br>
100,000 new cases in the country by the end of 1997. <br>

HEADLINE: Islamic organization criticizes Karabakh elections <br>
SOURCE: SPA news agency, Riyad, in Arabic 2015 gmt 28 Nov 96 <br>
<p>
The secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Dr<br>
Hamed Algabid, has criticized the presidential elections held on 24th<br>
November in the<br>
self-proclaimed Nagornyy Karabakh republic, the Saudi news agency SPA<br>
reported on 28th November. <br>
<p>
The secretary-general said in a statement that the holding of presidential<br>
elections in the disputed region was an encroachment on the sovereignty,<br>
independence and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and "a political<br>
provocation that would not serve<br>
security and stability in the region" , the agency reported. <br>
<p>
Expressing his "deep concern" about the elections, Algabid described them as<br>
"an attempt to provide some legitimacy to the so-called Nagornyy Karabakh<br>
republic" . <br>
<p>
He urged the international community not to recognize the elections, which<br>
could have a negative effect on diplomatic efforts to settle the Nagornyy<br>
Karabakh conflict, the agency reported. <br>

HEADLINE: Armenian court says treaty on Russian military base constitutional <br>
SOURCE: Interfax news agency, Moscow, in English 1332 gmt 27 Nov 96 <br>
<p>
The Armenian Constitutional Court has recognized the constitutionality of the<br>
treaty on the deployment of a Russian military base in Armenia. <br>
<p>
The court pronounced its verdict on Wednesday [27th November] after it<br>
considered the case filed by Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan.   The<br>
Armenian Justice Ministry had said some provisions of the treaty did not<br>
comply with the republic's<br>
legislation. <br>
<p>
The Russian-Armenian treaty was signed by the two countries' presidents on<br>
16th March 1995 in Moscow. However, it has not yet been ratified by the<br>
Russian and Armenian legislators. The term of the treaty is 25 years.<br>
Ratification of the treaty will raise interstate relations between Russia and<br>
Armenia to a new level and become an important pledge of peace and stability<br>
in the Caucasus, said Armenian Deputy Defence Minister Vahan Shirkhanyan, who<br>
acted as presidential representative in the<br>
court. The Russian base will promote the establishment and strengthening of<br>
the Armenian armed forces, closer relations between the Russian and Armenian<br>
armies, cooperation in combat training and the creation of joint allied<br>
forces, Shirkhanyan<br>
said. <br>
<p>
The Constitutional Court will also have to rule on seven agreements stemming<br>
<i>&gt;from the treaty, an Interfax correspondent reported from Yerevan. The Russian</i><br>
State Duma plans to consider the treaty's ratification on 6th December,<br>
Maj-Gen. Aleksey<br>
Tretyakov, the chief of the combat management group of Russian troops in<br>
Armenia, told Interfax. <br>

HEADLINE: TWR relayed via Armenia on mediumwave <br>
SOURCE:    Trans World Radio press release, Cary (USA), in English 18 Nov 96 <br>
<p>
Since 15th November, people in Central Asia and parts of the Middle East who<br>
have had virtually no exposure to the Gospel are now able to hear the good<br>
news of<br>
Christ through Trans World Radio's new broadcast site in Armenia. Programmes<br>
in eight languages are aired from Radio AR Intercontinental by a one million<br>
watt AM [mediumwave] transmitter formerly used for Soviet propaganda. <br>
<p>
Within listening range are more than 60 of the world's least-evangelized<br>
people groups. Traditional missionary work among Muslims in this area is<br>
believed by many to be impossible.  <br>
<p>
According to Werner Kroemer, TWR's regional director for Europe, " Armenia is<br>
probably our most strategic site added in the last decade because of who we<br>
are able to reach." <br>
<p>
Gospel programmes in such languages as Turkish and Farsi [Persian] are<br>
broadcast to the region. This new ministry was made possible through<br>
negotiations, prayer and the delivery and installation of satellite downlink<br>
equipment. It was completed by<br>
TWR engineers hours before the start of Armenia's paralysing snow season. <br>
<p>

transmitter site near Yerevan, see WM/41 1996, page 18.] <br>

RUSSIA
<p>
CONTROVERSY CONTINUES OVER GROUND FORCES COMMANDER. As the scandal
surrounding Defense Minister Igor Rodionov's attempt to dismiss Army
Gen. Vladimir Semenov as Ground Forces commander intensified, the
Defense Ministry announced that Rodionov had postponed his scheduled 5
December visit to the U.S., Russian and Western media reported on 3
December. Russian commentators linked the decision, for which no
official explanation was offered, to the imbroglio over Semenov's
ouster. Further distancing Yeltsin from the move to dismiss Semenov on
misconduct charges, presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembskii
said on 3 December that while Yeltsin had approved the sacking "in
principle," he had left the justification for the dismissal in
Rodionov's hands. He added that Semenov is temporarily suspended from
his post pending a final decision by the president. Meanwhile, Semenov
protested his dismissal in a letter to Yeltsin, vowing to fight the
misconduct allegations "until the end." -- Scott Parrish
<p>
MASKHADOV TO RUN FOR CHECHEN PRESIDENT. Chechen interim Prime Minister
Aslan Maskhadov told journalists in Grozny on 3 December that he will
definitely contest the presidential election scheduled for 27 January
1997, Russian and Western agencies reported. Acting President Zelimkhan
Yandarbiev had told ITAR-TASS on 2 December that he favored a single
candidate representing the Chechen opposition forces; this approach has
been rejected both by Maskhadov and by field commander Vakha Arsanov,
who was nominated as a presidential candidate by the Party of National
Independence of Chechnya on 2 December. Also on 3 December, a spokesman
for the European Commission announced that it has allocated an
additional $2.8 million in humanitarian aid for Chechnya, according to
AFP. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
RUSSIA ISOLATED AT OSCE SUMMIT. Russia's proposal that the OSCE, not
NATO, play the leading coordinating role in a new European security
architecture was effectively rebuffed as the OSCE summit in Lisbon ended
on 3 December, Izvestiya reported on 4 December. The most Moscow could
accomplish was the omission of any mention of the disputed issue of NATO
expansion in the final summit communique, which tried to please everyone
by declaring that no new dividing lines should be created in Europe,
while also stating that each country has the right to choose its own
means of assuring its security, NTV reported. Russia also found itself
in the minority on other issues, RFE/RL reported, pressing for the
omission of criticism of Serbia from the final communique, and also
defending Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka against charges
that he has violated democratic norms and principles. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA WARNS U.S. OVER "SUBCRITICAL" BOMB TESTS. Responding to a 2
December report in The San Francisco Examiner that the U.S. Energy
Department is planning a series of test explosions involving small
amounts of fissile uranium and plutonium, Russian Ministry of Atomic
Energy spokesman Georgii Kaurov said any nuclear explosion would be a
violation of the recently-signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ITAR-
TASS reported on 3 December. Kaurov said the treaty contained no minimum
threshold for nuclear explosions, and argued that "if an explosion sets
off a chain reaction, the treaty will be violated ... no matter what
amount of fissionable material is used." U.S. officials insist the
planned tests will not trigger a chain reaction and are hence
permissible under the CTBT, although American critics claim they will
undermine the treaty by violating its spirit. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
INTERNATIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING IS WELL ENTRENCHED. The OECD has issued a
report analyzing the work of the Financial Action Task Force, which was
set up by a G-7 summit in 1989 to combat money laundering, RFE/RL
reported on 3 December. The report concludes that Russian and East
European gangs are very active in laundering money from drug-running,
prostitution, car theft, extortion, and corrupt privatization deals.
They have established a broad network of legitimate businesses to
convert the illicit receipts into legal assets. Favorite channels
include the purchase of real estate, art works, and the tourism
business. -- Peter Rutland

TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
LAST-MINUTE OSCE COMPROMISE ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH. A last-minute
compromise wording proposed by the U.S. prevented Armenia and Azerbaijan
&gt;from vetoing the final communique by the OSCE summit in Lisbon,
international media reported on 3 December. Armenia had objected to an
article of the draft communique which upheld Azerbaijan's territorial
integrity as a guiding principle for settling the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict. The provision was included following vigorous efforts by
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliev, who said he would block the entire
document unless it formally recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of
Azerbaijan. Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told RFE/RL that Flavio
Cotti, the Swiss chairman of the OSCE, might condemn Azerbaijan's
tactic. Yet, according to CNN, Aliev's position was strongly backed by
the European Union. As a result of the compromise, the contentious
language was removed from the final communique and adopted as a separate
document. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
GEORGIAN-RUSSIAN MILITARY TALKS. Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko
Nadibaidze and his Russian counterpart Igor Rodionov met on 3 December
in Moscow to discuss "issues of mutual interest," no details of which
were subsequently disclosed, ITAR-TASS reported. On the same day,
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Andreev told journalists
that at last week's round of inter-governmental Russian-Georgian talks
in Tbilisi, the Georgian side "raised or repeated some problems that do
not promote Russian-Georgian relations." Specifically, Georgia refused
to endorse a Russian draft agreement on developing military cooperation.
Agreement has also not been reached on payment in Georgian laris to
finance the presence of Russian troops in Georgia. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
KYRGYZ MINISTRIES CUT. President Askar Akayev signed a number of decrees
on 2 December, reducing the number of ministries in the Kyrgyz
government from 22 to 15 and cutting the government staff by 3,000
people, RFE/RL reported. Among the changes, former Finance Minister
Kemelbek Nanayev was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister and is
replaced by Taalaibek Koichumanov, the former economics minister. The
economics ministry ceases to exist. The ministries of education,
culture, and agriculture and water were combined. Akayev's decree on
cutting personnel will effect 30% of the presidential and parliamentary
staffs, 20% of government and ministerial officials and at least 10% of
local government staffs. On 25 November Akayev signed a decree allowing
private ownership of land, effective on 1 January. -- Bruce Pannier and
Naryn Idinov
<p>
KAZAKSTANI PENSIONERS DEMAND RESULTS. The Pensioner's Fund of Kazakstan
has appealed to local government officials to take action in paying
arrears to pensioners, who in some cases have not been paid for several
months, according to a 3 December ITAR-TASS report. Unpaid pensions
total 40 million tenge (about $545,000) despite government efforts to
free money for payments. Inspectors have found many cases of pension
money being loaned by state officials to commercial enterprises or as
short-term loans for quick profits, some funds being simply embezzled or
misappropriated. The ITAR-TASS report claims some pensioners have given
up on using official channels and are engaging in actions such as
blocking roads and rail lines to bring attention to their plight. --
Bruce Pannier
<p>
MINISTRY ABOLISHED IN TURKMENISTAN. Turkmenistan's Ministry of
Construction and Architecture was abolished by presidential decree on 3
December, ITAR-TASS reported the same day. In an address to ministry
personnel, President Saparmurat Niyazov charged that the ministry's
enterprises have been unprofitable, operate at 50% of their capacity and
construct facilities which are substandard. The industry is to be de-
centralized with existing enterprises shared out between regional
administrations, the republic's ministries of building materials, power-
engineering, and Turkmenneftgaz. -- Lowell Bezanis

BELGRADE CLAMPS DOWN ON INDEPENDENT RADIO STATION. In another effort to
muzzle the independent media and thwart the ongoing peaceful protests in
Serbia, the Belgrade authorities have taken Radio B 92 off the air. The
radio station has been giving extensive coverage to the protests. B 92
Editor Veran Matic told reporters that the station received a letter
&gt;from the federal Ministry of Transport and Communications saying that B-
92 does not have the necessary authorization to broadcast. The student-
run Radio Index has also been taken off the air. VOA reported today that
B 92 is continuing to broadcast on VOA's Serbian-language frequencies.
-- Stan Markotich
<p>
MASS PROTESTS CONTINUE IN SERBIA. For the 15th consecutive day, mass
demonstrations took place throughout Serbia to protest the authorities'
decision to nullify the results of last month's run-off municipal
elections, Nasa Borba reported on 4 December. An estimated 100,000
people again gathered in Belgrade. Demonstration organizers have vowed
to continue with the protest action until all second-round municipal
election returns are "honored." Meanwhile, Belgrade's electoral
commission has questioned the legality of the nullification of the
election results, which showed the opposition Zajedno coalition winning
in the 12 largest municipalities. AFP on 3 December reported that the
commission has sent a letter to authorities outlining its position. CNN
on 4 December reported that the regime is stepping up the police
presence at demonstrations. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
WASHINGTON WARNS SERBIA. U.S. press spokesman Michael McCurry said on 3
December that Washington could retaliate against Belgrade in the wake of
the clampdown on two independent radio stations. He noted that the U.S.
still maintains its own "outer wall" of sanctions against federal
Yugoslavia and could block that country's return to international
organizations, AFP reported. Washington is also working to prevent EU
countries from extending trade benefits to Belgrade at a meeting slated
for 6 December, the BBC reported on 4 December. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said that "the Serbian government has painted
itself into a corner," the VOA noted. Numerous international
journalists' organizations and other NGOs have joined in the protest.
Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia rejected the complaints, arguing
that "elections in a country are above all a domestic matter," AFP
reported. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
CALL FOR JUSTICE ON BOSNIAN WAR CRIMES. The International Crisis Group--
an NGO consisting of prominent people and headed by former U.S. Senator
George Mitchell--has called for tough measures against war criminals.
Noting that the big fish are still on the loose, it wants IFOR to
receive a mandate to arrest indicted individuals, the VOA reported on 3
December. The ICG urges donors to withhold aid from any country or
locality that harbors war criminals and to give the money instead to the
underfunded Hague-based war crimes tribunal instead. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
EXPULSIONS CONTINUE IN BOSNIA. The UN reported that over 30 Muslims have
been driven from their homes in the Bosanska Gradiska area of northern
Bosnia over the past ten weeks, Oslobodjenje noted on 4 December. Their
property is being taken by Serbs whose former homes in Donji Vakuf are
now under federal control. A report by Human Rights Watch says that
Serbian paramilitaries were involved in the expulsions and that the
local authorities did nothing to stop them. Meanwhile, the Helsinki
Committee for Human Rights noted in its latest newsletter that the
campaign to force Serbs to leave Ilidza is continuing. One man noted
that "after every quarrel or beating, four or five Serb houses are sold
cheap." -- Patrick Moore
<p>
ROMANIAN PRESIDENT, HUNGARIAN PREMIER DISCUSS BILATERAL RELATIONS. Emil
Constantinescu and Gyula Horn, meeting in Lisbon on 3 December during
the OSCE summit, agreed that Romania's new foreign minister will visit
Hungary soon, Romanian media reported the same day. Horn said that the
Hungarian parliament will ratify the friendship treaty next week. That
document was signed in September and ratified by Romania in October. The
previous day, Horn had noted that Hungary backs Romania's efforts to
achieve EU and NATO integration, and he had offered to "do [his] utmost
to fulfill [that] goal." Constantinescu said Romania has the "historic
chance" to become a stabilizing factor in the region. He added that all
neighbors are "viewed as partners and not competitors" on the road
toward integration. -- Zsolt Mato
<p>
MOLDOVA'S OUTGOING PRESIDENT URGES RUSSIAN TROOPS WITHDRAWAL. Mircea
Snegur, addressing the OSCE summit in Lisbon on 3 December, urged Russia
to withdraw its troops from eastern Moldova, BASA-press reported. He
complained that Moscow has not "honored the commitments" laid down in an
October 1994 bilateral agreement. The troops withdrawal was a key factor
to finding a peaceful settlement to the Dniester conflict, he added.
Snegur also appealed to the summit to issue a "political declaration" on
"the current state of affairs" in Moldova. The 1994 Russian-Moldovan
accord has not yet been ratified by the Russian State Duma. -- Dan
Ionescu

   Report by Georgiy Bovt:  "Chernomyrdin in One Boat with Lukashenka"<br>
<p>
  The behavior of the CIS leaders at the OSCE summit in Lisbon points to the<br>
conclusion that in their European policy the Commonwealth countries are in<br>
fact not a commonwealth.  Each leader stuck to his guns, stressing<br>
independence from Moscow.  Only two CIS countries were mentioned together in<br>
the summit lobby, as though separated from all others by an invisible<br>
barrier: Russia and Belarus.<br>
   Moscow's strong opposition to NATO expansion found no support among the<br>
CIS member states.  In particular, Leonid Kuchma, in his speech at the<br>
summit, was extremely cautious in choosing his words. But behind that<br>
cautiousness you could discern primarily an aspiration to show the West that<br>
Kiev, unlike Moscow, is not categorically against NATO, but reserves the<br>
right, as it were, to consider options for closer coordination with this<br>
bloc in the future.  Finding no words to condemn the aggressive plans of<br>
Western imperialists, the Ukrainian president observed philosophically that<br>
"of decisive importance for Europe's future will be the consequences of the<br>
expansion and at the same time reformation of the leading institutions: the<br>
EC and NATO as well as the Western European Union."  Moreover, he missed no<br>
opportunity to tease Russian nationalists eyeing Sevastopol, reminding them<br>
of the principle of the inviolability of borders, which, however, did not<br>
stop him from also saying that there are "no serious problems" between<br>
Ukraine and Russia.  But what about the Black Sea Fleet?  The one-on-one<br>
meeting, in Lisbon, between Kuchma and Chernomyrdin passed without any<br>
result:  The time frame for the Russian Federation premier's visit to Kiev<br>
was not determined.  It was only decided that he would go there after<br>
agreement has been reached on the division of the Black Sea Fleet.  The<br>
chances of this happening in the near future, however, appear remote.  On<br>
the other hand, Kiev has no problem with Baku:  The idea of building a<br>
Eurasian transport corridor (the main purpose being "to bypass Russia") is<br>
being translated into life, which, in fact, was duly recorded during<br>
Kuchma's meeting with Geydar Aliyev.<br>
   Two Commonwealth member states -- Armenia and Azerbaijan -- came off at<br>
the summit as enemies.  This provoked speculation whether the adoption of a<br>
final declaration will not be blocked by a veto on the part of either Baku<br>
(if the principle of the country's territorial integrity is not reaffirmed)<br>
or Yerevan (if, quite the contrary, Karabakh's right to self-determination<br>
is not recognized).  Both sides invoked Moscow as a member of the Minsk<br>
group on the Karabakh settlement, which was of no use, considering that<br>
these negotiations have in effect stalled for the past two years. <br>
   As for Nurzultan Nazarbayev, he would not be seen dead wasting his breath<br>
on the subject of NATO.  He has his own pet -- Eurasian -- idea.  The OSCE<br>
is, of course, a unique structure, but now a similar one needs to be created<br>
in Asia.  Failing to support Russia's indignation over NATO expansion, the<br>
Kazakh president hit on a formula that indirectly challenged Russia's<br>
initiatives:  This is the way to read his passage to the effect that the<br>
OSCE should not be turned into a quasi-UN (Moscow is seeking to upgrade the<br>
OSCE's status, finding understanding even in the remote France, but not in a<br>
Commonwealth partner: Ukraine).  President Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan<br>
spoke about what irked him the most: the war in Afghanistan, and intrigue by<br>
drug dealers and the intransigent opposition.  President Petr Luchinskiy of<br>
Moldova, who is considered to be a pro-Moscow politician, said from<br>
Cishinau:  Moldova, in its cooperation with NATO, does not intend to go<br>
outside the Partnership for Peace program, while the problems of "expanding<br>
the alliance and disagreements with Russia should be addressed without<br>
involving Moldova in it." <br>
   Moscow received unreserved support only from Alyaksandr Lukashenka.  He<br>
alone supported its proposal to build a European security system on the<br>
basis of OSCE, not NATO (moreover, NATO should, in effect, answer to OSCE,<br>
which is also in line with the Russian ideas).  Lukashenka spared no words<br>
to condemn NATO and the West which allegedly came down on him for his<br>
loyalty to Russia.  So, Moscow, on the path toward integration into Europe,<br>
has found itself in the same boat with the Belarusian president, whose<br>
authoritarian ways became a regular feature in OSCE discussions.  This,<br>
however, does not bother Moscow whatsoever.  <br>

1. NO DECISION REACHED ON KARABAKH AT LISBON SUMMIT<br>
<p>
LISBON (Reuter)-Bitterness over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict <br>
almost wrecked the Lisbon security summit Tuesday, forcing <br>
diplomats to revert to an unusual last-minute maneuver to avoid a <br>
major embarrassment.<br>
	Disaster loomed as negotiations between Azerbaijan and <br>
Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh hit a brick wall with no hint of a <br>
breakthrough in sight.<br>
	Forced into action by the threat of Azerbaijan vetoing the <br>
entire final summit declaration, international mediators agreed to <br>
drop all reference to the dispute from the closing document and <br>
issued a separate statement on it instead.<br>
	Levon Ter-Petrosyan sat stony-faced at the final session of <br>
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting. <br>
Azeri President Gaidar Aliyev, who dropped his veto threat, hailed <br>
his success.<br>
	"I am very satisfied," Aliyev told a news conference.<br>
	Ter-Petrosyan, by contrast, canceled a planned news <br>
conference.<br>
	The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh was also seen as a <br>
reminder of the instability and security problems that still haunt <br>
many parts of the former Soviet Union and could threaten European <br>
security.<br>
	Azerbaijan wanted its territorial integrity reaffirmed in <br>
the final summit statement. It also sought support for demands to <br>
define Nagorno-Karabakhs legal status clearly, based on the right <br>
to self-determination, and guarantees over its security. Armenia <br>
blocked Azerbaijans demands, earning the wrath of other states at <br>
the closing session, including Russia.<br>
	"I regret that one delegation could not accept this. These <br>
principles have the support of all other participating states," <br>
said Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, chairman in office of <br>
the OSCE.<br>
	Azerbaijans demands were included in the separate statement <br>
drawn up to the indignation of Ter-Petrosyan.<br>
	He rejected Cottis remarks, saying they did not correspond <br>
with the views of a group of 11 countries in the Minsk Group set <br>
up to mediate over Nagorno-Karabakh. He has said "unilateral <br>
solutions" must not be imposed over Karabakh. <br>
	"I would like to express concern in connection with this <br>
statement. In our view it does not reflect the spirit and the <br>
letter of the Minsk Group," Ter-Petrosyan said.<br>
	His comments made clear the leaders left Lisbon as far apart <br>
on Nagorno-Karabakh as when they arrived.<br>
	The OSCE agreed at its last summit, in Budapest in 1994, to <br>
prepare a multinational peacekeeping force for Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
but deployment cannot go ahead until the two sides agree to full <br>
terms for peace.<br>
	"You all know that no progress has been achieved in the last <br>
two years to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict," Cotti said.<br>
	Matters have been further complicated by tension over an <br>
election in Nagorno-Karabakh last month which Armenia acclaimed <br>
and Azerbaijan condemned.<br>
	Leaders from North America and Europe, however, pledged a <br>
new age of security and peace for all in the 21st century, but the <br>
Lisbon summit was marred by friction over NATO enlargement, <br>
Belarus and Serbia.<br>
	Leaders of the 54-nation OSCE agreed to respect democracy <br>
and human rights, and backed more arms control and an end to <br>
confrontation on the continent where two world wars started. <br>
	"We are determined to learn from the tragedies of the past <br>
and to translate our vision of a cooperative future into reality <br>
by creating a common security space free of dividing lines," the <br>
final summit declaration said.<br>
	The OSCE, sometimes accused of spouting lofty ideals, scored <br>
a notable success at the summit by agreeing to adapt a 1990 arms <br>
reduction pact to reflect a post-Cold War Europe no longer divided <br>
by military alliances.<br>
	Heads of state and government agreed to develop the idea of <br>
a security model for the 21st century, rooted in the principle <br>
that no nations security should be threatened by another. <br>
	"This is a very important document," John Kornblum, US <br>
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, said. "Given <br>
the history of destruction and warfare on this continent over the <br>
past 100 years, ...nations will draw on the tools of solidarity of <br>
others to make sure they are secure," Kornblum told a news <br>
conference.<br>
	But the summit was not free of its diplomatic wrangles. <br>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin underscored Moscows <br>
opposition to NATO plans to take in countries such as Poland and <br>
Hungary by the year 2000, raising the specter of new division <br>
lines spreading across Europe.<br>
	President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus drew open <br>
criticism from several leaders over his autocratic rule.<br>
	Chernomyrdin failed to win support to develop the OSCE into <br>
a more powerful security body to act as a counterweight to NATO. <br>
But one trophy he can carry home is the agreement to update the <br>
Conventional Forces in Europe  treaty, an issue Moscow has been <br>
pushing since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. <br>
	While the final text supported every nations right to <br>
change its security arrangements, Russia will be gratified that <br>
the summit issued no endorsement of NATO enlargement.<br>
	Western diplomats said Russia had insisted the declaration <br>
remove a call for democracy in Serbia, where President Slobodan <br>
Milosevic faces mass protests.<br>
	Many leaders in Lisbon had expressed concern that Milosevic, <br>
now facing an unprecedented challenge to his nine years of <br>
autocratic rule, could use force against protesters now thronging <br>
the streets of Belgrade and calling on him to quit. <br>
	Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, did not attend <br>
the summit because its OSCE membership has been suspended.<br>
	The last OSCE summit, in Budapest in 1994, collapsed over <br>
differences on the NATO issue and the war in Bosnia.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. ARF LEADER ADVISED NOT TO TRAVEL TO CANADA<br>
<p>
The Armenian Revolutionary Federation Central Committee of Canada <br>
had invited ARF Bureau member Peno Tontian as the main speaker of <br>
the ARF 106th anniversary celebrations in Montreal and Cambridge, <br>
Ontario. <br>
	Following the refusal of entry to ARF Bureau member Garo <br>
Armenian, the Canadian Embassy in Lebanon was contacted regarding <br>
Tontians scheduled visit. The Canadian Embassy suggested that <br>
Tontian not make his trip to Canada, because he too might be <br>
refused entry, even though Tontian had already received a <br>
visitors visa through the same Canadian Embassy.<br>
	Hence, the ARF leaders planned visit is postponed <br>
indefinitely. ARF Bureau member Viken Hovsepian (of Montreal, <br>
Canada) is replacing Tontian as the main speaker at the above-<br>
mentioned functions.<br>
	Three other ARF Bureau members have been refused  entry into <br>
Canada according to sec. 19 of the Immigration Act,  which states <br>
that no person shall be granted admission who is a member of any <br>
of the following classes: persons for  whom there are reasonable <br>
grounds to believe; (...) are or were members of an organization <br>
for which there are reasonable grounds to believe is or was <br>
engaged in (...) terrorism... <br>
	According to the ARF Central Committee, ARF Bureau members <br>
are being refused admission into Canada as part of a campaign by <br>
certain government agencies, to pressure and harass the Armenian <br>
community in the pretext of investigating the 1982 assassination <br>
of a Turkish diplomat in Ottawa and the 1985 raid of the Turkish <br>
Embassy in Ottawa, and in retaliation to legal steps taken by the <br>
community to stop the harassment.<br>
	The declaration further states that "in recent weeks the ARF <br>
Central Committee of Canada has multiplied its efforts with <br>
federal officials, in order  to put an end to these condemnable <br>
pressure tactics."<br>
<p>
<p>
3. CANADIAN DEPUTIES VISIT TORONTO CENTER<br>
<p>
TORONTO-Three members of the Canadian Parliament, Sarkis <br>
Assadourian (Lib. Don Valley North), David Collenette (Lib. Don <br>
Valley East) and Jim Peterson (Lib. Willowdale), through an <br>
invitation of the Armenian National Committee of Toronto, visited <br>
the Armenian Community Center of Toronto on Nov. 21. <br>
	The purpose of the gathering was to  once again familiarize <br>
the community leaders with those who represent them in Parliament.<br>
	Since the new federal electoral ridings are being changed to <br>
increase the total number of ridings from 295 to 301, some changes <br>
will effect the riding in which the Armenian Community Center is <br>
located.  Taking effect on January 8, 1997, the new electoral <br>
riding arrangement will eliminate the riding of Don Valley North, <br>
which will be divided between the Don Valley East and Willowdale <br>
ridings.  <br>
	Since the Armenian Community Center is situated within the <br>
Don Valley North riding, and since Assadourian is its <br>
parliamentarian, he has found it necessary to initiate this <br>
meeting. (Assadourian will be a candidate in another riding.) The <br>
aforementioned issue, as well as the increased cooperation with <br>
the parliamentarians regarding the Armenian Genocide resolution <br>
were among the key issues discussed.<br>
	Following  brief welcoming remarks, the Chairman of the <br>
Toronto ANC, Krikor Shitilian invited Assadourian to address the <br>
more than 60 guests.<br>
	Assadourian briefed the guests on the current concerns of <br>
the Center. He then invited the former Minister of Defense, <br>
Collenette, who stressed his dedication to the Armenian Cause as <br>
well as to the cooperation of the federal government and the <br>
Armenian community at large.<br>
	Peterson, a long time friend of the Armenian Community <br>
Center, detailed his 16-year knowledge of the Armenian Genocide as <br>
well as Armenian issues and reaffirmed his commitment to the <br>
recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the Canadian Government.<br>
	In his closing remarks, Assadourian thanked the two members <br>
of Parliament and all those present, and appealed to the Armenian <br>
community members to continue being demanding on issues concerning <br>
the Armenian Cause, and to strive for the welfare of those living <br>
in Armenia, and for the strengthening of democratic rule there.<br>

4. CHILD DIES IN LAND MINE EXPLOSION, FOUR INJURED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Respublica Armenia, Snark)-A land mine in the village of <br>
Karashen in Goris exploded Friday killing one boy and injuring <br>
four others.<br>
	The explosion occurred while the boys were playing with an <br>
unknown metal object, which turned out to be a land mine, <br>
Armenias Department of Emergency Situations said.<br>
	According to the International Committee of the Red Cross in <br>
Yerevan, some 50,000 mines were installed during the war in <br>
Karabakh. From 1994-95, 24 percent of the injuries were caused by <br>
mines, half of them injuring civilians.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. TWO AZERI CATTLE RUSTLERS KILLED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Two Azeri cattle rustlers were killed <br>
Saturday evening as they attempted to steal 25 heads of cattle <br>
from the village of Joujevan in the Tavoush province of Armenia. <br>
Two others escaped.<br>
	Agents of Armenias Interior Ministry and National Security <br>
followed the group to the Kazakh district of Azerbaijan.<br>
	The Azeris opened fire as Armenian officials asked them to <br>
surrender near the Yotnaghpiur border post. <br>
<p>
<p>
6. UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS GROWING IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The State Statistics Department of Armenia <br>
reported that the unemployment rate for the months of January <br>
through September of 1996 grew from 6.1 percent to 9.2 percent.<br>
	The labor force totaled 153,700 people in September 1996, <br>
which is one percent more when compared to the previous month and <br>
26.5 percent more if compared to September 1995.<br>
	Ninety-eight percent of those out of a job have been <br>
unemployed for a lengthy period. This number has risen by 0.6 <br>
percent since last month and by 27 percent since September 1995.<br>
	Residents of Yerevan, Gumri and Vanadzor make up 55 percent <br>
of the unemployed. Women make up 71.6 percent (109,200 people) of <br>
the total unemployed.<br>
	According to the same source, only 617 unemployed people <br>
were hired in September. Since January 1996, 3,423 people found <br>
jobs through employment services.<br>
	Unemployment benefits were paid to 41,700 people in <br>
September. The unemployment level, calculated as a ratio of <br>
registered unemployed and economically active citizens, was 9.8 <br>
percent in September 1996. It remained unchanged since last month <br>
and grew by 2.2 percent since the same month last year.<br>

7. HUMANITARIAN AID EXCEEDS $50 MILLION<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Between the months of January and August <br>
1996, Armenia received $53,700,000 in humanitarian aid, the <br>
Department of State Statistics reported.<br>
	The aid was donated by 31 countries, mainly the United <br>
States, France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Great Britain, <br>
Belgium and Greece.<br>

8. 25,000 TONS OF SEEDS TO BE SHIPPED TO ARMENIA IN 1997-1998<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The eighth session of the Commonwealth of <br>
Independent States Semena Association took place on Nov. 18-22 in <br>
Yalta, Crimea. <br>
	For the first time the session was attended by <br>
representatives of European countries. Armenia was represented at <br>
the session by First Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Food <br>
Samvel Stepanian, head of the Department of Land Cultivation <br>
Alfred Khachatrian and Director of the Semena firm Roland <br>
Hovakimian.<br>
	From 1997-1998, Armenia will received shipments of seeds <br>
from Russia, Ukraine, and some from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, <br>
Khachatrian said.<br>
	A total of 25,000 tons of seeds, including 20,000 tons from <br>
Russia, are expected to be shipped to Armenia during the 1997-1998 <br>
period. Under the agreement with Russia, in spring of 1997 Armenia <br>
will be supplied with 500 tons of wheat seeds, 2,000 tons of <br>
barley seeds and 500 tons of oat seeds. If there is a greater <br>
demand, the volume may be increased up to 9,000 tons, Khachatrian <br>
said.<br>
	The agreement also calls for 3,000 tons of winter wheat <br>
seeds, 1,000 tons of barley seeds and 1,000 tons of rye seeds to <br>
be shipped to Armenia in 1997, as well as pea, corn and sunflower <br>
seeds.<br>
	According to Khachatrian, due to the lack of funds, farmers <br>
are unable to purchase seeds which guarantee high yields. He said <br>
that next spring several organizations would allocate money to <br>
farmers for the purchase of high yield seeds.<br>

9. CHINESE VICE-PRESIDENT RECEIVES ARMENIAN DELEGATION<br>
<p>
BEIJING (Xinhua)-Parliamentary exchanges are of great benefit to <br>
the development of bilateral relations, Chinas Vice-President <br>
Rong Yiren told an Armenian parliamentary delegation, headed by <br>
Speaker Babken Ararktsian, on Tuesday.<br>
	Yiren welcomed the group on its first visit to China since <br>
the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1992.<br>
	"China believes that all countries in the world should treat <br>
each other on the basis of equality and friendship," Yiren said, <br>
adding that since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the <br>
two countries, high-level visits have greatly promoted bilateral <br>
cooperation in the fields of politics, science and technology and <br>
culture.<br>
	Both China and Armenia are developing countries shouldering <br>
the task of developing their respective national economies and <br>
improving their peoples livelihoods, the Chinese Vice-President <br>
noted. "The sharing of experiences is conducive to the development <br>
of both countries, since they have many things in common," he <br>
said.<br>
	Yiren briefed the guests on Chinas reforms and policies to <br>
open up the somewhat closed society with long-range development <br>
plans up to the year 2010.<br>
	Ararktsian said that his delegation was very glad to have an <br>
opportunity to become acquainted with Chinas history and present <br>
conditions as well as its reform progress, adding that he and his <br>
colleagues are particularly interested in the economic and social <br>
development of China.<br>
	"Both China and Armenia are carrying out reforms and have <br>
potential for cooperation," Ararktsian said, stressing the <br>
importance of learning more about Chinas road to development.<br>

10. ERBAKAN SPEAKS OUT ON "STATE GANG" SCANDAL<br>
<p>
ISTANBUL (Reuter)-Turkeys first Islamist prime minister broke a <br>
prolonged silence to distance himself from a scandal over state-<br>
backed death squads that the Kurdish opposition blamed for <br>
thousands of mystery killings.<br>
	"You cannot have a gang within the state...Nobody can be <br>
allowed to do anything illegal, with no exceptions," Erbakan told <br>
Turkish columnists in an interview widely published on Tuesday.<br>
	Erbakan was speaking in detail for the first time since a <br>
scandal over alleged "state gangs" in the underworld erupted last <br>
month following an accident in which a wanted gangster, Abdullah <br>
Catli, and a top policeman died in the same car.<br>
	A pro-Kurdish opposition party Tuesday blamed state-<br>
sponsored gangs for some 3,500 unsolved murders in southeast <br>
Turkey.<br>
	"We can say these gangs have a direct link with mystery <br>
killings. This is no longer a hypothesis or a guess, this is a <br>
reality acknowledged by officials," Guven Ozata, a senior member <br>
of the Peoples Democracy Party (HADEP), told a news conference.<br>
	"The exact figure cannot be confirmed but, according to the <br>
Human Rights Association, since the middle of the 1980s around <br>
3,500 people have fallen victim to mystery murders," Ozata said in <br>
Ankara.<br>
	Sedat Bucak, a government parliamentarian who heads Turkeys <br>
biggest private Kurdish militia in the fight with the Kurdistan <br>
Workers Party (PKK), was also in the car with Catli but survived <br>
with minor injuries. <br>
	"Nothing, including fighting the PKK, can be an excuse for a <br>
crime. If such things happen, those gangs, whatever their make-up, <br>
will be disbanded," said Erbakan in an apparent rebuff to comments <br>
by his deputy, Tansu Ciller, that anyone fighting for the state <br>
was a hero. Bucak is a deputy for Cillers party. <br>
	Ciller last week defended Catli, saying "those who fire <br>
bullets or suffer their wounds in the name of this country...will <br>
always be respectfully remembered by us." <br>
	Ciller had stressed that Catli had no confirmed convictions <br>
in Turkey. Catli had been on the run since the late 1970s, when he <br>
was accused of killing seven leftists in Ankara. He was also <br>
wanted by Interpol for his alleged role in the 1981 attack on the <br>
Pope and had been jailed-and escaped-in Switzerland for heroin <br>
trafficking.<br>
	Asked directly about Cillers comments, Erbakan said: <br>
"Everyone is entitled to their own view."<br>
	"When he answered this question you could see from his face <br>
that he was not at all pleased by Cillers attitude, but in his <br>
answer he was thinking of the coalition," wrote columnist Fatih <br>
Cekirge in the daily Sabah.<br>
	The scandal has rocked the government and cost Ciller her <br>
hard-line interior minister, Mehmet Agar, who quit following the <br>
crash in the quiet western town of Susurluk amid allegations he <br>
knew of the relationship among the unlikely trio in the car. <br>
	But analysts say Cillers stance during the scandal played <br>
into Erbakans hands and strengthened the coalition, which the <br>
former premier entered amid allegations of corruption against her. <br>
She needs backing from Erbakan-whom she had vowed never to ally <br>
with-to clear her name.<br>
<p>

11. PILIBOS WINS 19 MEDALS AT DECATHLON <br>
<p>
DUBAI (Reuter)-Iran and Russia agreed to set up a company to look <br>
for oil in the Caspian Sea, the official Iranian news agency IRNA <br>
said Tuesday.<br>
	The agreement was reached during economic cooperation talks <br>
in Moscow late Monday between Irans Minister of Economic Affairs <br>
Morteza Mohammadkhan and Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov.<br>
	It was the joint economic committees first meeting since <br>
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.<br>
	The two countries agreed to set up a company for joint <br>
exploration and exploitation of oil and mineral resources around <br>
the Caspian during a trilateral meeting with Turkmenistan last <br>
month. Russia said Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan were also welcome to <br>
join.<br>
	The Caspian Sea, eighth in the world in terms of discovered <br>
oil reserves, was divided between the Soviet Union and Iran first <br>
in 1921 and again in 1940.<br>
	But since the break-up of the Soviet Union and the birth of <br>
three new states-Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan-along the <br>
Caspian shores, the sea has become the subject of an intense <br>
diplomatic and legal battle over its immense reserves of oil and <br>
gas.<br>
	The committee also discussed ways to boost trade links, IRNA <br>
said. Bilateral trade dropped from $1.4 billion in 1991 to $200 <br>
million in 1995 before rising to $350 million this year. <br>
	Russia is helping Iran to build a $1 billion nuclear power <br>
plant at Bushehr.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
LOS ANGELES-Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School participated for <br>
the first time in the prestigious Academic Decathlon of Southern <br>
California Private Schools on November 16.<br>
	The highly challenging competition drew more than 200 <br>
students from top Southern California private high schools. In the <br>
all-day competition, students are asked rigorous questions in <br>
academic areas including economics, math, world history, <br>
geography, science, literature and fine arts.<br>
	Each school was represented by nine students and three <br>
alternates. Each student competed individually, and an overall <br>
team score was computed to rank the standing of each school.<br>
	Although Alex Pilibos participated in this decathlon for the <br>
first time and competed against schools that have been <br>
participating for many years, the results obtained surprised both <br>
other participants and the organizers of the event. Alex Pilibos <br>
won a total of 19 medals, 10 of which were gold. <br>
	Furthermore, the school ranked fifth among 21 participating <br>
schools on the Super Quiz, the most challenging comprehensive <br>
section of the competition. In addition to these impressive <br>
results, Lusine Danakian, an eleventh grade student at Alex <br>
Pilibos, ranked fourth among over 200 participants. Overall, Alex <br>
Pilibos ranked third in its division.<br>
	"We are astounded by the results achieved by our students," <br>
said Alex Pilibos team coach Jackie Mischler, "We have been told <br>
by the organizers of this event that, as first-time participants, <br>
our students achieved outstanding results. We are very proud of <br>
our students and school."<br>
	"We are not surprised by the brilliant performance of our <br>
students because we witness their abilities on a daily basis in <br>
our classrooms," noted Viken Yacoubian, principal of Alex Pilibos <br>
Armenian School. "However, considering that other teams offer full <br>
semester courses to prepare their students for the Decathlon while <br>
our team studied during their lunch times and after school in only <br>
a four-week period, we are extremely proud of our students. Once <br>
again, it becomes very clear to us that not only are we highly <br>
competitive in comparison to other top private schools in Southern <br>
California, but we are among the best," added Yacoubian.<br>
	Yacoubian announced that the school plans to participate in <br>
the decathlon in the forthcoming years as well.<br>

No. 232, Part I, 3 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
RUSSIA BLASTS NATO ENLARGEMENT AT OSCE SUMMIT . . . Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin admitted at the OSCE summit in Lisbon on 2 December
that Russia could not "veto" NATO enlargement, but urged his fellow
European leaders to consider "what the expansion of NATO might lead to,"
Russian and Western agencies reported. He rhetorically asked if the
expansion of a military alliance was the best way to achieve the goal of
a peaceful and united Europe, and called for giving the OSCE a
"coordinating" role in European security. According to AFP, the dispute
over the NATO issue will lead to its exclusion from the summit's final
communique, which is to outline plans for a new European security
architecture. Also meeting in Lisbon, the 30 signatories of the 1990 CFE
treaty agreed to begin talks this January on revising the cold war-era
treaty, a long-time Russian demand. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
. . . BUT U.S. STANDS FIRM. In his address to the OSCE summit, U.S. Vice
President Al Gore underlined the gap dividing Moscow and Washington on
the NATO enlargement issue, insisting that NATO expansion will increase
stability in Europe, and that NATO "poses no threat to any other state,"
AFP reported on 2 December. Chernomyrdin and Gore sought to put a
positive spin on their subsequent meeting, however, which the Russian
prime minister said "went off excellently." He added that "I cannot say
that the American side did not listen to our arguments." Chernomyrdin
said that Russia regards itself as part of Europe and does not want to
be isolated from the rest of the continent. The two leaders also
discussed a possible Clinton-Yeltsin summit, which is tentatively
scheduled for the first half of 1997. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
CHECHEN ELECTIONS MAY BE DELAYED. In an address read to the Chechen
parliament on 2 December by speaker Akhyad Idigov, acting Chechen
President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev proposed postponing for one or two months
the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 27 January,
AFP reported. Yandarbiev referred to his recent meeting with Russian
human rights activist Sergei Kovalev, who argued that there was not
enough time to draw up voter lists or organize absentee voting among
refugees from Chechnya. ITAR-TASS on 2 December quoted the chairman of
the Chechen Central Electoral Commission, Mumadi Saidaev, as rejecting
the proposed postponement. Also on 2 December, the head of the OSCE
mission in Grozny, Tim Guldimann, stated that he was confident of the
Chechen leadership's determination to hold democratic, free, and fair
elections, but that this could prove difficult given the shortage of
funds available. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
LEBED'S BROTHER LEADS IN KHAKASIYA. Aleksei Lebed, the younger brother
of former Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed, won 45% of the
vote in the first round of voting on 1 December in the executive branch
elections in the republic of Khakasiya, Kommersant-Daily reported on 3
December. He will face businessman Yevgenii Reznik, who won 19%, in the
second round. The incumbent Yevgenii Smirnov won only 8% and was
eliminated. Lebed formerly led an airborne regiment based in the
republic and was elected to the Duma from there in 1995. His victory can
be attributed to his brother's celebrity, backing from the Sayansk
aluminum factory, and the scandal surrounding an attempt to prevent him
&gt;from registering because he had not lived in the republic for seven
years. Presidential aide Aleksandr Kazakov has already declared that the
younger Lebed is not a member of the opposition and that if he wins they
will be prepared to work with him. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
CHILE COMPLAINS ABOUT MARS PROBE SECRECY. Chilean Defense Minister
Edmundo Perez criticized Russia on 2 December for failing to share
technical information on the failed Mars-96 probe, which crashed into
the Pacific Ocean off Chile on 17 November, Reuters reported. Chile is
concerned about possible radioactive contamination from the probe, which
carried 200 grams of plutonium as part of its power supplies. Perez said
Moscow had assured Santiago that there is no risk of contamination, but
complained that Russia "has been tremendously unwilling to give precise
information" which would support this conclusion. Chilean air force and
navy patrols have so far found no trace of radiation in the area where
the probe fell into the ocean. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
ARMENIAN, AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENTS CLASH AT OSCE SUMMIT. Azerbaijani
President Heydar Aliev, speaking at the OSCE summit in Lisbon on 2
December, accused Armenia of refusing to recognize his country's
territorial integrity and of pursuing "non-legitimate claims for the
independence of Nagorno-Karabakh," Reuters reported. Aliev said a high
degree of autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan, along with
security guarantees for the region's population, should be the key
principles for settling the conflict. Aliev added that "we cannot allow
the creation on the territory of Azerbaijan of a second Armenian state."
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan said the people of Nagorno-
Karabakh should be given the right to self-determination because
Azerbaijan is "unable" to guarantee their safety. Ter-Petrossyan warned
that the region's population would face "genocide or forced deportation"
if Azerbaijan's proposals were accepted. Observers note that Azerbaijan
may block a final declaration by the OSCE on the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict if it fails to affirm the region's territorial integrity. --
Emil Danielyan
<p>
RED CROSS CALLS FOR MORE AID TO CENTRAL ASIA. The International Red
Cross representative in Central Asia, Bob McKerrow, said $21 million
will be needed in 1997 to provide adequate aid to the Central Asian
states, according to a 2 December Reuters report. Speaking at a news
conference in Almaty, McKerrow noted that Kazakstan already has cases of
malnutrition, particularly in the western regions where drought ruined
almost the entire harvest. The aggravated situations in Afghanistan and
Tajikistan are also expected to increase the number of refugees in
Central Asia. In Kyrgyzstan there are presently 30,000 refugees, and
people fleeing from the fighting in Afghanistan have appeared in
Turkmenistan. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
PROBLEMS OF INDEPENDENT MEDIA IN KAZAKSTAN. Recent decisions by the
Kazakstani government to suspend the broadcasting of several independent
radio and television stations are drawing criticism from the Russian
media. On 29 November AFP quoted Ekho Moskvy as saying the shutdown of
nine stations on 4 November was an attempt by the Kazakstani government
to limit information concerning a demonstration the following day. The
government claimed the stations were broadcasting on frequencies which
interfered with air traffic control. Radio Rossii reported on 30
November that the shutdown was an attempt to put non-government stations
out of business for airing opposition views. It also noted that nearly
100% of TV and radio broadcasts are in Russian, and suggested that a
tender for frequencies, coming after the New Year, will likely favor
companies which will broadcast in Kazak, the state language. Members of
the independent media and opposition are planning a demonstration in
Almaty on 8 December. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
UZBEK HISTORIOGRAPHY. Academics working under President Islam Karimov's
Academy for State and Societal Construction plan to issue a three-volume
"Modern History of Uzbekistan," Khalq Sozi reported on 27 November as
monitored by the BBC. The book will cover Tsarist colonialism, "Soviet
Colonialism," and Uzbekistan's modern history of independence. The
academics, led by historian Hamdam Sodiqov, are battling against "false
conceptions about the history of independence" and "former Kremlin and
Communist Party sycophants," the report said. -- Lowell Bezanis

SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE
<p>
BELGRADE DEMONSTRATIONS SHOW NO SIGN OF WANING . . . Serbia-wide mass
protests against Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic are now entering a
third week, showing no signs of waning. Demands center on the
authorities' recognizing the outcome of 17 November run-off municipal
elections in which the opposition Zajedno coalition won majorities in
Serbia's 12 largest urban areas. Vuk Draskovic, a key opposition leader,
has said the protests will dry up when the regime recognizes the results
of those elections, CNN reported on 2 December. The Milosevic regime has
nullified most of those returns, claiming victory in a third round. But
signs are emerging that suggest the protesters are having a significant
impact. Police presence, notably that of riot forces, has been stepped
up, especially in Belgrade. Moreover, the regime has intensified its
state-media campaign against the demonstrators. On 2 December Vecernje
novosti dubbed Zajedno a "terrorist" organization bent on "seizing power
violently." -- Stan Markotich
<p>
. . . WHILE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY URGES REGIME TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT.
A growing wave of international condemnation is mounting against the
Belgrade authorities, and primarily Milosevic. Many Western leaders are
on record deploring the cancellation of the 17 November election results
and are urging the government to refrain from reacting violently to the
peaceful protests. For his part, U.S. State Department Spokesman
Nicholas Burns has said "the results of the municipal elections ought to
be respected. Some way must be found by the government to walk back from
its decision to stifle those elections," Reuters reported on 3 December.
Washington officials have also said an "outer wall of sanctions" will be
maintained against Belgrade, as well as efforts at blocking the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia's integration into institutions in the
international financial community, partly because of the nullification
of those elections. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
MONTENEGRIN REACTIONS. While hard-line members of Milosevic's Socialist
Party of Serbia are reportedly urging the president to deal forcefully
with the demonstrators, at least some Montenegrin leaders are on record
advocating restraint. Montena-fax on 2 December quoted Svetozar Marovic,
speaker of the Montenegrin republican legislature and member of the
ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, delivering an oblique criticism
of those authorities in Serbia inclined to deal with the demonstrators
with force. "No one has the right to change the foundation of democracy,
the will of the people, irrespective of whether it's done by the
authorities or the opposition," he said. "It is critical in the most
difficult of situations that those who take care of the people and the
state keep a cool and rational head," he added. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
SERBS LEAVE BRCKO TALKS. The Bosnian Serbs have pulled out of
arbitration talks regarding Brcko and said they will not recognize the
outcome of those talks. The northern Bosnian town and its surrounding
"corridor" are the land link between the eastern and western halves of
the Republika Srpska, and hence of vital importance to that "entity."
The area had a Muslim and Croat majority before the war, however, and
the Sarajevo government refuses to accept the results of "ethnic
cleansing." It was the only territorial question that was not at least
formally settled by the Dayton agreement and was left to be decided by
international arbitration by 14 December. The ball now seems to be in
the court of the international mediator, Roberts Owen, whom the Serbs
charge made decisions without consulting them or the Muslims. The State
Department said on 2 December, however, that the talks will go ahead
with or without the Serbs, Reuters noted. -- Patrick Moore

    By Timothy Heritage<br>
    LISBON, Dec 3 (Reuter) - Bitterness over a conflict in a<br>
remote corner of Europe almost wrecked the Lisbon security<br>
summit on Tuesday, forcing diplomats to revert to an unusual<br>
last-minute manoeuvre to avoid a major embarassment.<br>
    Disaster loomed as negotiations between Azerbaijan and<br>
Armenia over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh hit a<br>
brick wall with no hint of a breakthrough in sight.<br>
    Forced into action by the threat of Azerbaijan vetoing the<br>
entire final summit declaration, international mediators agreed<br>
to drop all reference to the dispute from the closing document<br>
and issued a separate statement on it instead.<br>
    Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan sat stony-faced at<br>
the final session of the Organisation for Security and<br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) meeting. Azeri President Heydar<br>
Aliyev, who dropped his veto threat, hailed his success.<br>
    "I am very satisfied," Aliyev told a news conference.<br>
    Ter-Petrosyan, by contrast, cancelled a planned news<br>
conference.<br>
    The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave with<br>
an Armenian majority which is surrounded by Azeri territory,<br>
flared in the Cold War era.<br>
    It is also a reminder of the instability and security<br>
problems that still haunt many parts of the former Soviet Union<br>
and could threaten European security.<br>
    About 10,000 people were killed in fighting which flared in<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh in 1988. The clashes ended under a ceasefire<br>
signed in 1994 but up to one million refugees still live in tent<br>
camps.<br>
    Azerbaijan wanted its territorial integrity reaffirmed in<br>
the final summit statement. It also sought support for demands<br>
to define Nagorno-Karabakh's legal status clearly, based on the<br>
right to self-determination, and guarantees over its security.<br>
    Armenia blocked Azerbaijan's demands, earning the wrath of<br>
other states at the closing session, including Russia.<br>
    "I regret that one delegation could not accept this. These<br>
principles have the support of all other participating states,"<br>
said Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, chairman in office of<br>
the OSCE.<br>
    Azerbaijan's demands were included in the separate statement<br>
drawn up to the indignation of Ter-Petrosyan.<br>
    He rejected Cotti's remarks, saying they did not correspond<br>
with the views of a group of 11 countries in the so-called<br>
Minsk Group set up to mediate over Nagorno-Karabakh. He has said<br>
"unilateral solutions" must not be imposed over the enclave.<br>
    "I would like to express concern in connection with this<br>
statement. In our view it does not reflect the spirit and the<br>
letter of the Minsk Group," Ter-Petrosyan said.<br>
    His comments made clear the leaders left Lisbon as far apart<br>
on Nagorno-Karabakh as when they arrived.<br>
    The OSCE agreed at its last summit, in Budapest in 1994, to<br>
prepare a multinational peacekeeping force for Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
but deployment cannot go ahead until the two sides agree full<br>
terms for peace.<br>
    "You all know that no progress has been achieved in the last<br>
two years to resolve the Nagorno-Karabkah conflict," Cotti said.<br>
    Matters have been further complicated by tension over an<br>
election in Nagorno-Karabakh last month which Armenia acclaimed<br>
and Azerbaijan condemned.<br>

        PRESIDENT LEVON TER-PETROSSIAN'S SPEECH IN THE OSCE SUMMIT<br>
        IN LISBON<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Yesterday, the OSCE Summit started its works in Lisbon, Portugal. The<br>
 President of the Republic of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian, who is<br>
 participating in the Summit, met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs<br>
 of Great Britain Malcolm Rifkind. The sides discussed issues related<br>
 to the Karabagh conflict settlement. On the same day, the Armenian<br>
 President met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France Herve de<br>
 Charette.<br>
 During the OSCE Lisbon Summit, the President of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian delievered a speech, in which he said,<br>
 in particular:<br>
 "The main direction of our activities formed immediately after the<br>
 cold war, when the OSCE came forward as a forum with a new vision,<br>
 which allowed to draw to cooperation all the countries left in the<br>
 political vacuum after the dissolution of the block system of<br>
 security. This was achieved also because the OSCE formed itself as a<br>
 "union of universal values" united all its members.<br>
 Armenia highly appreciates its membership in the OSCE.<br>
 The Budapest Summit passed a series of important decision on the<br>
 institutional transformation of the OSCE and the necessity of<br>
 developing a new model of the European security model. Today, we can<br>
 witness an obvious progress in both directions.<br>
 The OSCE made its specific contribution into the vision of the<br>
 problems of security. This vision is not limited to military issues,<br>
 but it considers them in the same context with with humanitarian,<br>
 political, economic and other issues.<br>
 This vision is reflected in our joint efforts for creating a<br>
 universal security system in Europe, as well as in the concrete steps<br>
 for early prevention of conflict, conflict resolution and<br>
 post-conflict rehabilitation.<br>
 An important aspect in guaranteeing security is the improvement,<br>
 passage and implementation of the agreement on ordinary armaments in<br>
 Europe. This process is significantly amplified by the improvement of<br>
 mechanism reflected in the documents of the Forum on Cooperation in<br>
 the Area of Security, which allow for vast field of activities in<br>
 every individual conflict situation.<br>
 The Missions and other specially created structures are efficient.<br>
 The OSCE is present everywhere, where there are conflicts in Europe:<br>
 Bosnia, Chechnya, Nagorny Karabagh, etc.<br>
 In the period after the Budapest Summit, Armenia has taken part<br>
 actively in the activities of the Minsk Group of the OSCE. In<br>
 addition to this process, Armenia became the initiator of direct<br>
 dialogue with Azerbaijan in order to agree on main principles of the<br>
 Karabagh conflict resolution.<br>
 However, I think that in this Summit Azerbaijan is trying to break<br>
 the accepted logics of the negotiation process.<br>
 We strongly believe that if the Karabagh problem is solved based on<br>
 the principles proposed by Azerbaijan, then the people of Karabagh<br>
 will have to live with a constant threat of genocide and forced<br>
 deportation.<br>
 The past experience of the Armenian massacres in Sumgait (February<br>
 1988), Kirovabad (November 1988), and Baku (January 1990),  as well<br>
 as the deportation of the population of 24 Armenian villages in<br>
 Karabagh (May-June 1991) clearly indicates that despite all the<br>
 promises, Azerbaijan is not able to guarantee the security of the<br>
 people of Karabagh.<br>
 That is why we think that the only way to exclude a new tragedy is<br>
 the respect of the right of the people of Nagorny Karabagh to<br>
 self-determination.<br>
 Nevertheless, confirming its commitment to respect the ceasefire,<br>
 Armenia expresses its preparedeness to continue its constructive<br>
 participation in the process of negotiations within the Minsk Group,<br>
 as well as in direct dialogues for the quickest possible resolution<br>
 of the conflict on the basis of a fair compromise.<br>
 In negotiating the present, we should not forget about the future.<br>
 The future security of the region is not possible without wide<br>
 regional coopearation, which will promote the further strengthening<br>
 of mutual trust in security in the process of the peaceful conflict<br>
 resolution.<br>
 As a step in that direction, I could suggest the informal<br>
 consultations between the three Caucasian countries within the<br>
 framework of the OSCE with the participation of other interested<br>
 member countries in order to develop the main directions of the<br>
 regional cooperation, arms control, conflict resolutions, and<br>
 regional integration."<br>

        THE UNITED ARMENIAN FUND SENT $160 MILLION OF AID TO ARMENIA<br>
        IN SEVEN YEARS<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The United Armenian FUnd completed its seventh year of operations<br>
 with records revenues of $42.4 million during the fiscal year<br>
 1995-1996, according to the audit of its financial statements<br>
 prepared by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP.<br>

 million of relief supplies which exceeded the prior year's shipments<br>
 by $10 million, or 33%. The shipments consisted primarily of medical<br>
 supplies. In addition, the UAF funded the Children's Cardiac Center<br>
 of Armenia which to date has performed 693 heart operations.<br>
 During the past seven years, the UAF sent a total of $160 million of<br>
 humanitarian assistance to Armenia on board 87 airlifts and 164 sea<br>
 containers, including $21 million of heating fuel during winter of<br>
 1993-1994.<br>
 The UFA is the collective effort of the Armenian Assemlby of America,<br>
 Armenian General Benevolent Union, Armenian Missionary Association of<br>
 America, Armenian Relief Society, Diocese of the Armenian Church of<br>
 America, Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America and<br>

KOMMERSANT-DAILY 3 December 1996 page 4<br>
<p>
   Report by Georgiy Bovt:  "The OSCE Summit in Lisbon.  NATO Will Be Absent<br>
Only from the Final Declaration"<br>
<p>
  On the eve of the opening of the OSCE summit in Lisbon, experts from<br>
various countries were sweating over the text of the final declaration all<br>
night long.  Yet at least on one point, which the Russian delegation regards<br>
as the key one, no consensus seems likely.  Before the summit Moscow<br>
announced its categorical rejection of the idea of NATO expansion, restating<br>
its stance of two years ago, which was made public at the OSCE summit in<br>
Budapest and caused something bordering on scandal there.  The only<br>
difference is that in Lisbon Russia is represented by the premier, not<br>
Yeltsin, and that the range of Moscow's allies narrowed down to just one<br>
man, Lukashenka.<br>
 The suggestions that Moscow might soften its stance, which a majority of<br>
OSCE countries see as inflexible and unpromising, were not borne out.  Boris<br>
Yeltsin said on the eve of the summit:  Russia's attitude to NATO expansion<br>
has remained unchanged.  The premier added that currently Russia would not<br>
agree to join NATO on any terms:  "We are not against NATO as a political<br>
organization, we are ready to cooperate with it.  But let us straighten<br>
matters out without any rush, there are no grounds for making haste."<br>
Chernomyrdin repeated this thought in Lisbon yesterday.  European partners<br>
could have gone into guessing as to whether the word "currently" can be<br>
interpreted as hinting at the possibility of softening its stance later, but<br>
an interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, who<br>
recently made a number of surprisingly moderate noises on NATO, dotted all<br>
the i's.  As behooves a military minister, he remains "a hawk," threatening<br>
to retarget nuclear missiles to NATO's freshmen in Europe.  He made a<br>
reservation, of course, saying that the missiles would only be retargeted,<br>
if the new members deploy nuclear weapons on their territory.  But even this<br>
reservation is unlikely to make discussions at Lisbon any easier, to say<br>
nothing of the fact that Rodionov's switch to threats will hardly please the<br>
East Europeans, whose dialogue with Russia is already marred by<br>
reminiscences of the Soviet era.<br>
 Just recently analysts indulged in playing the well-known game of "try to<br>
find 10 distinctions," noting that "the Foreign Ministry's line," insofar as<br>
its public statements are concerned, is not identical to "the Defense<br>
Ministry's line" -- some credited the military with greater flexibility and<br>
readiness to adapt itself to inevitable changes -- or "the Security<br>
Council's line" -- Ivan Rybkin suggested that Russia join NATO's political<br>
organization.  Now these exercises have to be abandoned:  "The Foreign<br>
Ministry's line" has clearly gained the upper hand and no deviations from it<br>
can be discerned any longer -- "We are opposed to the expansion.  Period."<br>
It seems that Primakov's ministry will even have to retreat somewhat after<br>
going a bit too far:  Rodionov's zeal with regard to pursuing "the  line of<br>
the Foreign Ministry," with which he was tasked by presidential edict to<br>
"agree on all his foreign policy actions," smacks of the extremes that could<br>
damage relations with the already jittery East Europe.<br>
 Chernomyrdin came to Lisbon essentially with the same baggage Yeltsin<br>
arrived in Budapest with two years ago, namely with the proposal that the<br>
European security system be reformed so that the OSCE, not NATO, will become<br>
its foundation, being a more efficient structure responsible for the<br>
settlement of crises in hot spots.  Two years ago, in the runup to the<br>
Budapest summit Moscow cherished illusions that it could manage to win over<br>
France, which had put forward -- first and foremost in order to spite the<br>
United States -- "the Balladur plan," in whose essence Andrey Kozyrev, the<br>
then head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, discerned many attractive<br>
features.  No fresh Russian-French Entente came into being, however.  (At<br>
this point we can draw interesting parallels between Kozyrev's former<br>
overtures to the French and Chernomyrdin's spectacularly successful visit to<br>
Paris, the only difference being that this time nothing similar to the<br>
"Balladur plan" was even discussed.)  The halt of the war in Bosnia by force<br>
of NATO's weapons -- although with the active involvement of the OSCE and<br>
the European Union -- buried the hopes that the Western European Union's<br>
military organization can be an alternative to NATO'.  In this regard<br>
Moscow's attempts to call into question NATO's leading role in Europe are<br>
doomed to failure and misunderstanding at the summit.  Nonetheless Russia<br>
continues to stick to its guns.  In his yesterday's speech Chernomyrdin<br>
spoke in favor of giving the OSCE the role of coordinator of the efforts of<br>
all European and Euro-Atlantic organizations, although he made it clear that<br>
it is not a matter of giving it "command functions" -- the OSCE should<br>
become "a universal forum to exchange views on acute problems."  In<br>
Chernomyrdin's view, the OSCE should be "the main security organization in<br>
Europe because it can bring us all together."  It is not yet clear, however,<br>
what can bring Russia together with the other summit participants as far as<br>
its criticism of NATO is concerned.  Yet Moscow has not yet proposed<br>
anything constructive -- apart from variations of "no expansion will come to<br>
pass" -- with regard to its new relationship with NATO.<br>
 Only one Russian ally was discernible at the summit -- Alyaksandr<br>
Lukashenka -- but he himself will have a hard time, being exposed to<br>
criticism for his authoritarian manners.  On the eve of the summit the<br>
"troika" of last year's OSCE chairman (Hungary), current chairman<br>
(Switzerland), and future chairman (Denmark) deemed Belarus' recent<br>
referendum to have been illegitimate.  Things went so far that Portuguese<br>
President Jorge Sampayo avoided a purely ceremonial meeting with his<br>
Belarusian counterpart.  The action was agreed upon with the European Union<br>
countries.  In these conditions Moscow would have been wise to keep its<br>
Belarusian friend at arm's length so as not to aggravate its possible<br>
isolation (notably, those same East Europeans, Russia's most difficult<br>
partners, have taken a very harsh stance on the Belarusian question).<br>
Moscow has chosen a different tactic, however.  In particularly, Rybkin<br>
thought it necessary to emphasize:  "Belarus is a sovereign country.  It<br>
held a referendum, passed a constitution on its basis, and formed a<br>
bicameral parliament.  And Belarus has the right to do so."  As if Ivan<br>
Petrovich [Rybkin] were unaware of how the parliament was formed or of the<br>
fact that telling Europe that the area of human rights falls outside the<br>
European community's jurisdiction is very bad manners indeed.<br>
 Maybe, Moscow's harsh stance with regard to NATO is a method of wringing<br>
from its partners concessions on other matters?  For instance, while<br>
reiterating the thesis of a threat coming from NATO, Moscow might have in<br>
mind Western concessions with regard to revising the Paris Treaty on the CFE<br>
[Conventional Forces in Europe], signed in 1990, because it proceeded from a<br>
standoff between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  Yesterday Chernomyrdin proposed<br>
that "the treaty be adjusted" by limiting the military potential of<br>
military-political alliances and obliging such alliances and individual<br>
countries to refrain from increasing their arsenals from the status as of 17<br>
November 1995.  But one might well suggest that Moscow's persistence in the<br>
question of NATO expansion could cause the West's counter persistence.  This<br>
will not render the talks on the treaty's revision, scheduled to take place<br>
in Vienna next year, any easier.<br>
 In Lisbon, complex discussions of such sensitive subjects as Chechnya and<br>
Karabakh are yet to be held.  According to the results of the discussion of<br>
Chechen problems a decision could be made for the OSCE to monitor Chechen<br>
elections, set for 27 January.  For all the innocuousness of this action, it<br>
promises yet more difficulties in store for Moscow:  If the authoritative<br>
OSCE sees no particular violations, this might give extra trumps to the<br>
newly-elected president of Ichkeria.  And that in a situation where a<br>
separatist is set to win the election!  What will then happen to the<br>
principle of territorial integrity?  Here both Moscow and the OSCE will find<br>
themselves trapped.  This has already happened with regard to<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh.  The Budapest summit decided to send peacekeeping forces<br>
there, but since then talks have stalled.  There will be no breakthrough<br>
this time around either:  Azerbaijan demands that its territorial integrity<br>
be officially confirmed, but all decisions at OSCE forums are made by<br>
consensus and Armenia is bound to veto such a resolution.  It is not yet<br>
clear how would Moscow vote in this case (on the one hand, it has its own<br>
Chechnya; on the other, Armenia lays claim to the role of its strategic ally<br>
in the region).  Nor is it clear how the Russian delegation can disentangle<br>
itself from another triangle of problems -- "Moscow-Tbilisi-Sukhumi."<br>
 The only thing that is known after the expert's all-nighter is that the<br>
summit's final declaration will apparently not mention NATO in its part<br>
proclaiming the European countries' free right to join military-political<br>
alliances.  Nor will it evidently mention Chechnya and Abkhazia.  But even<br>
if they manage to successfully negotiate all the points of friction in the<br>
document, they will not be completely straightened out for that, and the<br>
OSCE will not demonstrate the effectiveness for which Moscow is campaigning.<br>
The usually very reserved and ambiguous in phrasing Yevgeniy Primakov said<br>
yesterday that "difficult talks" were under way at the summit.  Simply<br>
speaking, Russia with its ideas might find itself on the verge of isolation,<br>
which could prompt Chernomyrdin to repeat the words Yeltsin uttered two<br>
years ago:  The Cold War is about to be replaced by a "Cold Peace."<br>

<i>&gt;From Monitor 12/03/96</i><br>
<p>
<p>
CHECHNYA BATTLES OIL BOOTLEGGERS, LOOKS TO SHARE IN PIPELINE PROFITS. "About<br>
3,000 tons of oil are illegally extracted in Chechnya every day. The market<br>
price for our oil is about $80 per ton. So we're losing about $240,000 every<br>
day!" Khodzhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Chechen oil monopoly YUNKO,<br>
told the Monitor. Homemade gasoline is sold everywhere in Chechnya. It is<br>
surprisingly easy to make: crude oil is simply distilled in a homemade<br>
still. The quality of the resulting product is low, but serviceable, if a<br>
driver is not finicky about his car. All efforts by the Chechen government<br>
to ban illegal production and trading have so far failed. Yarikhanov says<br>
the authorities intend to redouble the battle against the "oil mafias" but<br>
acknowledges that establishing a state monopoly will not be easy. "Moscow<br>
has not yet handed over a kopeck of the promised compensation. There's no<br>
work in the republic and the underground oil business is the only way many<br>
Chechens can feed their families," he told Monitor.<br>
<p>
The government in Grozny also intends to organize a guard for the Chechen<br>
sector of the pipeline which is projected to transport Azerbaijani oil to<br>
western markets. "In this case, the interests of Russia and Chechnya<br>
coincide, since we too are interested in the 'northern variant' for<br>
transporting Azerbaijani oil," Yarikhanov says. The interim agreement signed<br>
by the Russian and Chechen prime ministers on November 23 called for the<br>
question of the joint transportation of oil to be resolved by December 1,<br>
but Russian government sources now say that agreement will not be reached<br>
before the middle of this month at the earliest. (Trud, November 28) Chechen<br>
leaders will negotiate for some one-seventh or one-eighth of the profits,<br>
arguing that this proportion of the pipeline passes through Chechen territory.<br>

1. KARABAKH CONFLICT TAKES CENTER STAGE AT OSCE SUMMIT<br>
<p>
LISBON (Reuter)-Azeri President Gaidar Aliyev appealed Monday for <br>
a swift agreement on a peace settlement over Nagorno-Karabakh, but <br>
Armenia said the Azeri government was unable to guarantee the <br>
safety of the people in the region. <br>
	The dispute threatened to disrupt efforts to agree to a <br>
final document at the two-day summit of the Organization for <br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe.<br>
	Aliyev told more than 50 OSCE leaders that Armenia was <br>
intent on pursuing independence for Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
	The president said his framework peace proposal called for <br>
recognition of Azerbaijans territorial integrity, an assurance of <br>
a high degree of autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh and security <br>
guarantees for all the enclaves population.<br>
	"It is regrettable that the Republic of Armenia refuses to <br>
accept such a formula...It refuses to accept the territorial <br>
integrity of the Azeri republic," Aliyev told the summit. <br>
	"We cannot allow the creation on the territory of Azerbaijan <br>
of a second Armenian state," he said. "We do not want war. We want <br>
peace."<br>
	Azerbaijan wants its territorial integrity to be reaffirmed <br>
in the Lisbon summit final document, similar to a passage in a <br>
draft paper which expresses the OSCEs "utmost support for the <br>
sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Georgia.<br>
	But Armenia is opposed to any reference to Azerbaijans <br>
territorial integrity.<br>
	Levon Ter-Petrosyan said it was because of several "pogroms" <br>
of ethnic Armenians by Azerbaijan since 1988 that he believed only <br>
self-determination of Nagorno-Karabakh would ensure the safety of <br>
its people. <br>
	"Despite any and all assurances that may be given, <br>
Azerbaijan is unable to guarantee the security of the population <br>
of Nagorno-Karabakh," Ter-Petrosyan told the summit.<br>
	"That is why we consider that the only possible way to <br>
prevent further tragedy is to ensure the rights of the people of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh to self-determination," he added.<br>
	But Ter-Petrosyan repeated a pledge to take part in talks to <br>
try to find a peaceful settlement and cooperate with the 11-nation <br>
Minsk Group, a mediation body set up by the OSCE. <br>
	A fragile cease-fire has existed since May 1994, but both <br>
sides have failed to agree to a peace settlement. Talks in <br>
Helsinki mediated by the Minsk Group broke down last month.<br>
	The OSCE summit in Budapest in 1994 agreed to prepare a <br>
multinational peacekeeping force for Nagorno-Karabakh, but <br>
deployment cannot go ahead until both sides agree to peace.<br>
	OSCE sources said the dispute could disrupt efforts to put <br>
together a final declaration at the Lisbon summit. Azerbaijan <br>
could hinder, or block, a final summit document if it fails to win <br>
affirmation of its territorial integrity.<br>
	Leaders from Europe and North America opened the European <br>
security summit Monday to map out a future blueprint for peace, <br>
but Russias concerns over NATO expansion threatened to dominate <br>
the meeting.<br>
	Heads of state and government from the 54-nation OSCE were <br>
expected to agree a final document that will lay out plans for <br>
European security in the 21st century, launch a new round of arms <br>
control talks and shore up peace in Bosnia.<br>
	"Peace demands trust among peoples," Portuguese Prime <br>
Minister Antonio Guterres told the opening session of the two-day <br>
summit. "We, political leaders, must be the builders of that <br>
trust."<br>
	Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, standing in for <br>
President Boris Yeltsin who is recovering from heart surgery, was <br>
due to speak early in the Monday session.<br>
	Russia has wasted no time in underscoring Moscows <br>
opposition to NATO plans to take in former members of the now-<br>
defunct Warsaw Pact.<br>
	Speaking on the eve of the summit, Chernomyrdin repeated the <br>
tough line adopted by Russian leaders last week against the <br>
Western alliances eastward expansion, which Moscow says would <br>
threaten Russias security.<br>
	"Russia is categorically against NATO expanding eastwards," <br>
he told reporters. "There is no need to rush. The fact that Europe <br>
is now without blocs is very important. We must work together. We <br>
must develop this, strengthen this." <br>
	Western diplomats say they would prefer the Lisbon summit, <br>
which brings together the United States and Canada with European <br>
states, to avoid the debate on NATO enlargement.<br>
	The last OSCE summit two years ago in Budapest was wrecked <br>
by a row over the same issue and by differences over Bosnia. <br>
	The leaders will also hold a series of bilateral meetings on <br>
the fringes of the summit-more than 170 in total. Chernomyrdin was <br>
scheduled to meet Vice President Al Gore, German Chancellor Helmut <br>
Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac.<br>
	Representatives from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Japan <br>
and South Korea are attending the summit as observers, as well as <br>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.<br>
	Russia has little chance of winning support at the summit <br>
for its proposals to give the OSCE a more powerful role in <br>
European security and act as a counterbalance to NATO.<br>
	But by taking a hard-line on NATO enlargement, Moscow may <br>
win concessions in talks on other issues at the summit, including <br>
adapting a 1990 treaty on conventional arms control. <br>
	The United States, represented by Gore who arrived Monday, <br>
and most NATO states have indicated they will accept new talks <br>
next year on adapting and modernizing the Conventional Forces in <br>
Europe treaty.<br>
	Despite concerns over a possible NATO row, some diplomats <br>
said they were more worried over hard-line positions being taken <br>
by Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. NATIONAL ALLIANCE PRAISES EUROPARLIAMENT RESOLUTION<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The national alliance caucus issued a <br>
statement Friday welcoming the European Parliaments Nov. 14 <br>
resolution on the presidential elections in Armenia adopted.<br>
	The statement said that new and fair National Assembly <br>
elections are necessary for the establishment of democracy and <br>
rule of law in Armenia.<br>
	Below is the text of the statement.<br>
	"Being committed to our aspiration for membership in the <br>
European Council, which is a support for the democracy and rule of <br>
law, we, as a united opposition, since 1995 have been struggling <br>
for the establishment of democratic order in Armenia. Our first <br>
joint initiative in this direction was related to the <br>
parliamentary elections in Armenia held on July 5, 1995.<br>
	Because of the pressure exerted by the authorities, the 1995 <br>
elections were not successful. International observers claim they <br>
were unfair. The National Assembly has become a state structure, <br>
which prepared grounds for the present unfair elections. The <br>
demand of the European Council to observe equal representation in <br>
electoral commissions was ignored in the Law on Presidential <br>
Elections. This led to the fact that the pro-government forces in <br>
all organizing and controlling electoral commissions retained more <br>
than 2/3 of votes and were able to rig the vote.<br>
	We express our deep satisfaction with the tough position of <br>
the European Parliament on the issue of human rights and we hope <br>
for further cooperation in the process of establishing a <br>
democratic power in Armenia."<br>
<p>
<p>
3. KARABAKH FOREIGN MINISTRY RESPONDS TO RUSSIA<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (Noyan Tapan)-The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the <br>
Nagorno-Karabagh Republic issued a response Thursday to an earlier <br>
statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding the November <br>
22 presidential elections.<br>
<p>
The following statement was read by a ministry spokesperson.<br>
<p>
	"The statement issued by the representative of the Ministry <br>
of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation on November 26, 1996, <br>
on the subject of the presidential elections in the Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh Republic has caused utter bewilderment in the Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh Republic. Their calling the elections an independent <br>
action is at the least strange because elections in the civilized <br>
world are not initiated from without, but are held by the <br>
authorities of the given state. As for the legitimacy of the <br>
elections, which is doubted in the statement, it is confirmed by <br>
the results of the free expression of the peoples will. This was <br>
also confirmed by international observers, representing a number <br>
of countries and international organizations, including a group of <br>
deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation.<br>
	It is not understandable how the elections of the President <br>
of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic contradict the universally <br>
accepted human rights principles. It is well known that it is the <br>
free elections that are the most clear expression of civil <br>
freedoms and human rights. It is also known that the vast majority <br>
of the citizens of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic now lives in the <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and participated in the elections.<br>
	The position of forcing a model of its future status to <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh is also surprising because the  status issue <br>
should be settled in the process of negotiations and during the <br>
Minsk Conference of the OSCE [Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe], and not in the lobbies of the diplomatic <br>
organizations of third party countries.<br>
	It is puzzling how the authors of the statement see the <br>
continuation of mediating efforts, while ignoring the will of the <br>
whole nation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-<br>
Karabagh Republic hopes that another, more informed representative <br>
of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs will clarify who is <br>
supposed to be the contact in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic for <br>
the quick resolution of the Karabakh conflict. "<br>

4. LEBANESE CONSUL-GENERAL VISITS PRELATE<br>
<p>
LOS ANGELES-Lebanese Consul General Gibran Soufan met with Western <br>
Prelate Right Rev. Moushegh Mardirossian during a visit to the <br>
Prelacy Friday morning, reported the Prelacy.<br>
	Soufan thanked the Prelate and the Prelacy Executive Council <br>
for honoring his invitation and attending a special banquet <br>
organized by the Lebanese Consulate celebrating Lebanons <br>
independence.<br>
	During his pre-holiday visit to the Prelacy, Soufan <br>
personally invited the Prelate and the Prelacy Executive Council <br>
to take part in activities for the upcoming visit of Lebanese <br>
President Rafik al-Hariri to Los Angeles.<br>
	During the meeting the two leaders also discussed continuing <br>
and expanding cooperation both in Lebanon and the US.<br>
	At the conclusion of the meeting, Prelate Mardirossian <br>
thanked the Consul General and wished him success in all his <br>
endeavors.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. CLINTON THANKS ARAM I<br>
<p>
ANTELIAS, Lebanon-The US ambassador to Lebanon visited His <br>
Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia Sunday and <br>
delivered a thank you letter from President Clinton who expressed <br>
his gratitude for His Holiness congratulatory note on  his <br>
election to a second-term.<br>
	In his letter Clinton also emphasized the importance of His <br>
Holiness friendship and cooperation to his presidency.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. "DRO" TRIAL ENTERS FINAL STAGE OF TESTIMONY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenak Mnjoyan, co-defendant in the so-<br>
called "Dro" case pointed to a different version of events leading <br>
to the murder of Ashot Nersessian and his wife Nouneh Maroukian.<br>
	Mnjoyan drew the courts attention to a number of unclear <br>
pieces of evidence. According to Mnjoyan, multiple injuries were <br>
revealed on the body of Nouneh Maroukian, suggesting that she had <br>
been raped.<br>
	The investigation had failed to reveal whether the semen <br>
sample matched that of Mnjoyan, Armenak Zakarian or Armenak <br>
Grigorian, who following the indictment reportedly took part in <br>
the murder of Nersessian.<br>
	He also noted that investigators had found fingerprints at <br>
Nersessians apartment, but had not been identified. Fingerprints <br>
of the defendants, however, were never found at the apartment, <br>
Mnjoyan said.<br>
	He linked the murder of Gagik Sahakian to Ashot Nersessian. <br>
He said that Sahakian, who was responsible for arm shipments to <br>
Karabakh, was connected with Nersessian. Nersessian carried out <br>
those transactions, Mnjoyan said.<br>
	According to documents submitted in the case, the so-called <br>
"Dro" group ordered the assassination of Sahakian. If Nersessians <br>
murder is excluded from the case, then the murder of Sahakian <br>
automatically falls out of the case as well, Mnjoyan said.<br>
	According to relatives of the defendants as well as <br>
attorneys attending the court session, Mnjoyans account was <br>
"absolutely new for them."<br>
	According to Nouneh Maroukians mother,  her daughters body <br>
was mutilated and even the bones were broken. The documents <br>
submitted in the case lack forensic expertise, she said.<br>
	Speaking on behalf of Arsen Ardzrouni, Armenak Zakarian and <br>
Armen Grigorian, all sentenced to death, Mnjoyan said that if the <br>
court assumes responsibility and convicts them without having <br>
evidence of their guilt, they will refuse and instead request the <br>
court to follow the orders of the president of Armenia, who <br>
demanded to "severely punish the culprits."<br>
<p>
<p>
7. VERDICT PREDETERMINED, SAYS "31" DEFENDANT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armen Roustamian, one of the defendants in <br>
the "Trial of 31" said that he and his fellow defendants were <br>
presumed guilty before the trial even started.<br>
	"I have been forced to defend myself against the indictment <br>
because in Armenia there is a presumption of guilt instead of  the <br>
presumption of innocence. According to this principle, you remain <br>
guilty until you prove you are not," Roustamian said.<br>
	Pointing to statements by the Armenian Security Council-July <br>
30, 1995-and the National Security Ministry-August 4, 1995 <br>
Roustamian said, "These documents are no doubt a political order <br>
and pursue political goals. Their main goal is to stop the <br>
activity of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and to eliminate <br>
that party in Armenia."<br>
	Roustamian said the investigators interpreted the <br>
defendants testimonies in their own way, leading to charges that <br>
each apartment was a place for secret meetings and each friendly <br>
talk was a preparation of a coup or recruitment.<br>
	The co-defendant in the prolonged trial said that the <br>
verdict was predetermined and had no hope for acquittal of even <br>
one of the defendants. He said that the statements of the Security <br>
Council and the  National Security Ministry, as well as the <br>
documents from the Yerevan regional department of the Ministry of <br>
Interior be attached to the case.<br>
	Roustamian said that during the preliminary investigation, <br>
the majority of the defendants were called to the court as <br>
witnesses unless they had been testifying in accordance with the <br>
investigators scheme. Investigators forced the witnesses to give <br>
self-incriminating testimonies so that later, when necessary, a <br>
witness could turn into a defendant, Roustamian said.<br>
	He denied that arms found at his apartment during the search <br>
belonged to him.<br>
	Roustamian also denied allegations by some investigators <br>
that he was involved in espionage abroad. He said that in May 1993 <br>
he was in France conducting scientific research.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM PROPOSED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The National Academy of Sciences and the <br>
Engineering Academy of Armenia proposed a program Friday for the <br>
development of new technology for the creation of "sixth <br>
generation" computers.<br>
	The proposed program will be submitted to the Armenian <br>
government for consideration.<br>
	The president of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences, <br>
Fadey Sargssian said that the integration of the Republics <br>
scientific potential and appropriate financing were needed for <br>
that purpose.<br>
	If the program receives financial support, it would then be <br>
possible to assimilate such hi-tech productions in Armenia as <br>
computer assembly or computer manufacturing networks  such as <br>
"electronic nose" used to detect drugs.<br>
	All this will make it possible to create computers of the <br>
sixth generation which are mainly being used in defense and space <br>
industries.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. OSCE ENVOY ATTACKED<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (Noyan Tapan)-Tibor Lakatti, an envoy of the chairman <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was <br>
attacked while in Azerbaijan monitoring the militarized zone <br>
between the Azeri and Karabakh forces near Agdam.<br>
	According to a Nagorno-Karabakh Foreign Ministry <br>
spokesperson, it was pure luck that the Hungarian Lakatti escaped <br>
unscathed.<br>
	Similar provocations by Azerbaijan occur quite often, the <br>
spokesperson said. "In the month of April, representatives of  the <br>
OSCE High Level Planning Group Mission were attacked in a <br>
neighboring front-line section, according to the same source.<br>
	From a distance of 300 meters, it would be impossible to <br>
distinguish peacemakers, who wear yellow berets from servicemen of <br>
the Karabakh Army, a Foreign Ministry statement said.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. RELATIVES OF DETAINEES CONTINUE HUNGER STRIKE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Relatives of those arrested following the <br>
Sept. 25 events in Yerevan continued their solidarity hunger <br>
strike in front of the Armenian Prosecutor-Generals Office.<br>
	The group was  joined by the sister of detainee Argishti <br>
Kivirian who demanded the release of her brother.<br>
	Kivirian started the hunger strike on Nov. 19 from his jail <br>
cell.<br>
	"I hope that justice will prevail and human rights will be <br>
observed in Armenia," Arminka Kivirian said.<br>
	According to National Democratic Union member Vladimir <br>
[Vova] Hakhverdian, the chief warden of the Noubarashen prison <br>
where Kivirian is being held violated the law by falsely reporting <br>
to the Prosecutors Office that Kivirian was not on a hunger <br>
strike because he was smoking. According to Hakhverdian, <br>
Kivirians health is deteriorating.<br>
<p>
<p>
11. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP URGES OSCE TO SUSPEND BELARUS<br>
<p>
VIENNA (Reuter)-An international human rights group urged Europes <br>
top security body on Monday to suspend Belarus from membership <br>
following a controversial referendum last month that significantly <br>
increased the powers of its president.<br>
	"We take this step...based upon our analysis of recent <br>
political and human rights developments in the country," the <br>
Vienna-based Helsinki Federation for Human Rights said in a letter <br>
addressed to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in <br>
Europe chairman, Flavio Cotti. <br>
	"Belarus should...be suspended from membership in the OSCE <br>
pending its tangible re-commitment to democratic principles, human <br>
rights and the rule of law," said the letter, a copy of which was <br>
made available to Reuters.<br>
	Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko has come under <br>
strong criticism from the West which has accused him of building <br>
dictatorial powers.<br>
	Cotti, chairing the OSCEs two-day summit now under way in <br>
Lisbon, rapped Lukashenko in his opening speech on Monday, telling <br>
him the growing crisis in his country should be resolved through <br>
dialogue and that he was "deeply concerned" by developments in <br>
Belarus.<br>
	Western leaders lined up on Monday to attack Belarus <br>
President Alexander Lukashenkos record on democracy at a European <br>
security summit, but he hit back by warning the rest of the world <br>
to mind its own business.<br>
	"It would be counterproductive to try to exert pressure on <br>
us or try to interfere in our internal affairs," Lukashenko <br>
bluntly told the Lisbon OSCE meeting.<br>
	Lukashenko, said by his foes to have dictatorial tendencies, <br>
attended the two-day meeting of more than 54 nations despite <br>
growing criticism that a referendum on November 24 which gave him <br>
sweeping powers was neither free nor fair.<br>
	Vice President Al Gore, British Prime Minister John Major <br>
and President John Bruton of Ireland, which holds the European <br>
Unions rotating presidency, also joined the attack. <br>
	"The European Union remains profoundly concerned at the <br>
constitutional referendum in Belarus and the resulting <br>
developments there," Bruton said.<br>
	"We call upon Belarus to respect its commitment to OSCE <br>
norms and democratic principles.<br>
	Leaders of Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania expressed concern <br>
after meeting in Lisbon on Sunday to discuss the situation in <br>
their neighboring state.<br>
	Completely unruffled, Lukashenko denied there was a <br>
political crisis in Belarus, accused the United States of double <br>
standards, blasted NATO plans to expand eastwards and told <br>
Washington, the OSCE and neighboring states not to meddle. <br>
	"The United States is, of course, a great power but this <br>
does not give it the right to interfere in the affairs of another <br>
state," Lukashenko told a news conference.<br>
	He said he was flattered by the attention of the leaders of <br>
Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland, but added sarcastically: "I think <br>
there are enough problems in their own countries to deal with."<br>
	Lukashenko said the much-criticized referendum had been <br>
completely legitimate and democratic, and defended his handling of <br>
a crisis in which his opponents in parliament had threatened to <br>
try to impeach him.<br>
	"The recent referendum held in Belarus was held in full <br>
compliance with the constitution and legislation of our country. <br>
Any attempt to represent the results as not legitimate are <br>
completely without foundation," Lukashenko said.<br>
	"I emphasize strongly that we do not have a political crisis <br>
and there is no hint of a division in our society, despite what <br>
our internal opposition would have you believe." <br>
	Belarus only remaining major ally is Russia, with which the <br>
economically struggling country of 10 million is seeking closer <br>
integration five years after the Soviet Unions collapse. <br>
	In remarks likely to add to the wrath of the rest of Europe, <br>
Lukashenko joined Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in <br>
condemning NATOs plans to take in other countries of eastern and <br>
central Europe.<br>
	"When the military machine comes closer to Russia, it will <br>
pass through Belarus on the way. Belarus will find itself on the <br>
border of two blocs," he told the news conference.<br>

 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 2, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On November 29, the National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia<br>
 continued the discussion of the program of the new Government of the<br>

 deputies that none of the parliament's factions has submitted any<br>
 resolutions about a vote of no confidence to the new Government.<br>
 According to the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, if no such<br>
 resolutions are submitted within 24 hours after the presentation of<br>
 the program, then the program is considered approved by the National<br>
 Assembly.<br>
 Thus, the National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia approved the<br>
 program of activities of the country's new Government.<br>
<p>
        PRIME MINISTER SARGISSIAN VISITS GYUMRI<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 2, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On November 30, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia visited<br>
 Gyumri (second largest city in Armenia, badly damaged in the 1988<br>
 earthquake).<br>
 The purpose of the visit was to get acquainted with the current<br>
 situation in the region and the process of reconstruction of the<br>
 earthquake region.<br>
 Following is an overview of the main problems of the region and the<br>
 reconstruction programs which have already been implemented.<br>
 The main issue in the region today is the construction of residential<br>
 space (apartment buildings) which is taking place slowly. It is<br>
 planned to build 3000 apartments in Mush district. However, according<br>
 to the builders, only 1000 apartments will be completed by the end of<br>
 this year. Today, more than 10 buildings are completed, they have<br>
 electricity supply and communications. However, only 140 families<br>
 live there. The district is far from the city and there are no<br>
 schools, kindergartens and roads. These buildings were built with the<br>
 money provided by the World Bank, and the communications - with the<br>
 means of the state budget. Not a penny was allocated to the<br>
 construction of other conveniences in the district. As a result,<br>
 people prefer to live in the city instead of in these otherwise<br>
 convenient apartments.<br>
 In general, none of the programs implemented in the region allows to<br>
 resolve fully any problem. The only units which were fully equipped<br>
 and completed in a short time were the units constructed by foreign<br>
 firms.<br>
 According to Sirekan Ohanian, Head of the Urban Planning and<br>
 Earthquake zone reconstruction of the Government of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia, all the resources invested in the reconstruction of the<br>
 earthquake zone have not had the expected results. According to him,<br>
 the reconstruction programs should focus on separate districts. It<br>
 has to do not only with the availability of economic resources, but<br>
 also with the regulation of the moral state of the people. It is<br>
 necessary to achieve a state when people don't have to live in close<br>
 neighborhood with rubble, the presence of which constantly reminds of<br>
 the horrible earthquake. Today, the reconstruction works are<br>
 financed by the Government of the Republic of Armenia, the World<br>
 Bank, the Eurobank, the Armenian Relief Fund, and the "Hayastan"<br>
 Fund. Some coordination between these organizations will not hurt.<br>
 There should be a single organization which should coordinate the<br>
 efforts of reconstruction, prioritize the tasks, and address other<br>
 similar issues. Otherwise, we will have the same situation where<br>
 different things are constructed in different parts of the city, and<br>
 as a result, not a single district is completed.<br>
 Mr. Ohanian informed that the Armenian government has developed a<br>
 list of programs related to the earthquake zone reconstruction.<br>
 First of all, a central committee and a working group will be<br>
 created. They will examine all the work performed in 1988-1996, and<br>
 based on the results of the examination, they will develop the list<br>
 of tasks for the future. A reconstruction program should be developed<br>
 which will allow to fully finish the reconstruction of the earthquake<br>
 zone by the year 2001.<br>
 The visit of the Prime Minister coinsided with the last day of<br>
 autumn. Some regions in Gyumri already have heating for this winter.<br>
 This year, more regions will receive heating than last year.<br>
 According to the Minister of Social Welfare of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia Ms. Hranush Hakobian, many people in the earthquake zone will<br>
 receive kerosene distributed by the "Paros" program. Cards for<br>
 250-300 kw of free electricity will also be distributed.<br>

Greek islands.<br>
The nationalist Yeni Sefak paper headlined the yesterday,saying,<br>

at work instigating the outbreak of fires on Greek islands.<br>
Bucak and a top policeman were in the same car accident that killed<br>
Catli three weeks ago.<br>
A series of media revelations has ever sinc uncoverd a close relationship<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 231, Part I, 2 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
DUMA BACKS AWAY FROM CONFRONTATION. The State Duma leadership decided on
29 November not to hold a no-confidence vote on Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's government or initiate impeachment proceedings against
President Boris Yeltsin, Kommersant-Daily reported on 30 November. The
lower house did not even succeed in adopting a resolution on the matter.
The legitimacy of the votes was called into question when it was
announced that 42 Communist deputies did not have their voting cards
with them. Communist Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov charged that
Presidential Chief of Staff Anatolii Chubais has set up his own
government in the Kremlin which must be removed. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
YABLOKO SLAMS YELTSIN, CALLS FOR DEMOCRATIC UNITY. After blasting the
Yeltsin administration as a dangerous oligarchic clan system that is
pushing the country toward fascism, Yabloko leader Grigorii Yavlinskii
called for all "democratic" groups to unite at a 30 November party
congress, NTV reported. He also said Yabloko would be gradually
transformed from a "movement" into a political party. Former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev attended the congress and expressed his
support for Yabloko. Sergei Belyaev, the leader of the pro-government
Our Home Is Russia Duma faction, also attended the meeting and noted
that his bloc could find some common ground with Yabloko, but that the
two groups have differing opinions on the authorities currently in
power. During the 1995 Duma campaign, Yavlinskii rejected all attempts
by other groups to ally with him. He also failed to form a "third-force"
alliance with Aleksandr Lebed during the 1996 presidential campaign. --
Robert Orttung
<p>
YELTSIN REJECTS LAW ON AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION. President Yeltsin on
29 November rejected a Duma bill that would have made it easier to amend
the constitution, ITAR-TASS reported. The bill stipulated that if the
members of the Russian Federation do not act on a proposed amendment
within six months, they are assumed to be in support of it.
Constitutional amendments require the support of two-thirds of all
members of the Duma, three-fourths of the Federation Council, and two-
thirds of all legislatures in the 89 republics and regions. -- Robert
Orttung
<p>
GROUND FORCES COMMANDER SACKED. President Yeltsin dismissed Army Gen.
Vladimir Semenov from his position as commander of the Ground Forces on
30 November. The order accused Semenov of "activities incompatible with
his post," which "discredit the honor and dignity of a serviceman."
According to AFP, Semenov termed his sacking "completely unexpected,"
adding that no "convincing" charges of misconduct or corruption had been
leveled against him by the Defense Ministry. A Ground Forces spokesman
expressed "astonishment" at the justification for Semenov's dismissal.
-- Scott Parrish
<p>
OIL COMPANY BUYS INTO IZVESTIYA. LUKoil-Garant, a pension fund and
subsidiary of the Russian oil company LUKoil, is set to buy a 20% stake
in the daily newspaper Izvestiya, Segodnya reported on 28 November.
According to the fund's general manager, Mikhail Berezhnoi, LUKoil-
Garant plans to invest a considerable sum of money into the newspaper,
Kommersant-Daily reported the next day. According to an unnamed source,
the company has already bought 20% of Izvestiya's shares from Dialog-
bank and another 5% from foreign shareholders. A LUKoil company
representative has reportedly joined the newspaper's editorial board. --
Anna Paretskaya in Moscow
<p>
CHECHEN ELECTION PROSPECTS. The Chechen leadership on 30 November failed
to agree on a single candidate for the republic's presidential election
scheduled for 27 January 1997, ITAR-TASS reported. Also on 30 November,
Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin told ITAR-TASS that
Moscow will invite observers from the Council of Europe and the OSCE to
monitor the election. In an interview published in a Grozny newspaper
and summarized by ITAR-TASS on 1 December, former Russian parliament
speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov also advocated OSCE monitoring, but declined
to say whether he would run as a presidential candidate. Meanwhile, a
Russian presidential spokesman told ITAR-TASS on 29 November that the
withdrawal of Russian troops from the republic will be completed by 20
January 1997, but the commander of Russian Interior Ministry forces in
Chechnya, Col.-Gen. Anatolii Shkirko, said on 30 November that no
deadline has been set. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
RUSSIA STEPS UP CAMPAIGN AGAINST NATO ENLARGEMENT. On the eve of the
OSCE summit in Lisbon, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who will head
the Russian delegation in Lisbon, said on his departure, "we are
categorically opposed to NATO's eastward enlargement," and called for
bolstering the role of the OSCE instead. In a 28 November article in
Nezavisimaya gazeta, Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, generally a
moderate on the expansion issue, blasted NATO for refusing to sign a
charter with Moscow before accepting new members. He threatened that if
the alliance expands, Russia will consider changing its military
doctrine, seeking new allies, withdrawing from the 1990 CFE arms control
agreement, targeting nuclear weapons on Eastern Europe, and denouncing
START I and START II. The threats are probably aimed at securing
concessions in return for Moscow's eventual acquiescence to NATO
enlargement. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
INDIA AGREES TO BUY UP TO 50 SU-30 FIGHTERS. Indian Defense Ministry
officials and representatives of Rosvoruzhenie signed a contract on 30
November under which India will purchase a number of SU-30MK multi-
purpose fighters, Russian and Western agencies reported. Neither side
would reveal the number of planes involved, or the exact value of the
contract, although Rosvoruzhenie spokesman Valerii Pogrebnikov said the
contract is worth more than $1 billion, and Moscow has not denied
earlier reports that the deal calls for the delivery of 8 SU-30MK planes
initially, and up to 40 later. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF IN CUBA. A delegation led by Col.-Gen. Fedor
Ladygin, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the Russian
General Staff, arrived in Havana on 28 November to participate in
ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed
Forces, according to ITAR-TASS. Izvestiya, however, reported on 30
November that Ladygin's main mission is to discuss the continued
operation of the Russian electronic eavesdropping facility at Lourdes,
near Havana, for which Russia reportedly pays Cuba about $200 million
annually. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
MONETARY POLICY FOR 1997. The government has approved the Central Bank
of Russia's (TsB) blueprint for monetary and credit policy in 1997,
Segodnya reported on 29 November. The blueprint envisages a 22%-30%
annual increase in money supply. From January through October 1996, cash
emission in Russia totaled 17.7 trillion rubles ($3.5 billion), compared
to 31.2 trillion rubles over the same period in 1995, Segodnya reported
on 28 November. TsB Chairman Sergei Dubinin said that the economy can
withstand such an increase next year without boosting yearly inflation
to more than the 12% envisioned in the 1997 draft budget. On 29
November, the TsB announced the fifth cut in its refinancing rate this
year--from 60% to 48%, ITAR-TASS reported. -- Natalia Gurushina
<p>
OIL TAX TO BE CUT. On 29 November, First Deputy Economics Minister Yakov
Urinson announced that the excise tax on oil will be cut from 70,000 to
55,000 rubles per metric ton in 1997, ITAR-TASS reported. Urinson said
that energy companies account for 65% of budget revenue, and are taxed
more heavily than their Western counterparts. Economics Minister
Yevgenii Yasin told a government meeting on 28 November that the Russian
economy will continue to stagnate unless it adopts a new industrial
policy, Nezavisimaya gazeta reported. Yasin said the government should
give the space, nuclear, and power sectors investments, subsidies, and
export credits to help them compete on world markets, and use import
tariffs to protect domestic auto, engineering, and light industrial
manufacturers. Such recommendations are sharply at odds with the
government's current policies. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT GETS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. The Armenian parliament
on 29 November approved the government program of recently appointed
Prime Minister Armen Sarkisyan, ITAR-TASS reported the same day.
Speaking at a session of parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated
by deputies loyal to President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, Sarkisyan said a
"qualitative improvement" of economic reforms will be his government's
top priority. He also pledged more state support for education, science,
and culture. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
NIYAZOV IN TASHKENT. Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov began a two-
day state visit to Uzbekistan on 27 November, and signed a number of
economic and cultural agreements designed to improve relations which
have been overall cool, Western and Russian news agencies reported.
Niyazov and his Uzbek counterpart, Islam Karimov, also discussed the
situations in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. On 21 November, Uzbekistan
opened an embassy in Ashgabat. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
UPDATE ON CURRENCY CRISIS IN UZBEKISTAN. President Islam Karimov hinted
that importers bringing "high quality" goods into Uzbekistan would enjoy
a greater degree of convertibility from January 1997. Karimov went on to
say joint ventures engaged in "civilized business with Uzbekistan will
not suffer any material losses." His remarks, broadcast on Uzbek Radio
on 27 November and monitored by the BBC, suggest the government is
attempting to step back from regulations introduced in late October that
effectively forbid foreign currency transactions and limit currency
conversion to a handful of large firms operating in Uzbekistan.
Diplomats, traders, and international lending institutions have all
registered their displeasure with the new regulations. In other news,
Uzbek Radio on 26 November announced the minimum monthly wage in
Uzbekistan would rise to 600 som, approximately $12 at the official
exchange rate but about $5 on the black market. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
ANOTHER TAJIK TOWN UNDER SIEGE. The city of Garm in central Tajikistan
is the latest to fall to forces of the Tajik opposition, Russian and
Western media reported. Opposition fighters began attacking Garm on 1
December, killing at least seven government soldiers and by nightfall
were holding some 100-150 government employees and soldiers in a local
mosque. Government aircraft and helicopters responded by bombing the
city. Fighting continued into the next morning. The fall of Garm leaves
the opposition in control of a fork in a strategic highway leading both
southeast and northeast. Supplies must now be airlifted to government
forces in Tajikabad and CIS border guards in Khorog, Kalai-Khumb, and
Ishkashim. -- Bruce Pannier

     ALIEV ON GEORGIA. Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Ukleba held <br>
     talks in Baku with Azerbaijani President Haidar Aliev on 8 January, <br>
     RFE/RL reported the same day. Aliev, who termed Georgia a strategic <br>
     ally, declared Baku's full support for Tbilisi's position on Abkhazia, <br>
     noting that Azerbaijan opposes separatism, aggression, ethnic <br>
     cleansing, and instability. It appears Georgia is seeking Azerbaijani <br>
     backing to push for a toughened stance on Abkhazia among CIS states in <br>
     advance of the 17 January CIS summit in Moscow. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

               RED CROSS SAYS POWs SEIZED IN KARABAKH STILL TO BE FREED<br>
     <br>
                    YEREVAN, Jan 5 (Interfax) - Many of the POWs and hostages<br>
               seized during  the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh have not<br>
               been  freed  yet  and  are  currently  kept  in  Karabakh  and<br>
               Azerbaijan, Zoran  Jovanovic, the  leader of the International<br>
               Red Cross delegation in Armenia, told Interfax Sunday.<br>
                    He said, however, that the sides had promised to free all<br>
               prisoners. In  1996, he  said, the  Armenian  and  Azerbaijani<br>
               sides freed a total of about 110 POWs.<br>
                    The International Committee of Red Cross Organizations in<br>
               1996 spent  $4.2 million  on  the  implementation  of  various<br>
               humanitarian programs  for Armenia,  he continued.  Next year,<br>
               the International  Red Cross  is to  increase the  sum to $5.5<br>
               million. He  said that  the  International  Red  Cross  should<br>
               continue its humanitarian activity in Nagorno Karabakh until a<br>
               political solution has been found.<br>
                    Ten foreign  and 70  local Red Cross staff currently work<br>
               in Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. The Red Cross personnel is to<br>
               be increased  next year.  Proper conditions  have been created<br>
               for the  Red Cross staff and nothing threatens them in Armenia<br>
               and Nagorno Karabakh, said Jovanovic.<br>

     RUSSO-AZERBAIJANI TALKS "USEFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE." Following two days <br>
     of talks, Russia and Azerbaijan agreed to improve trade and economic <br>
     ties, signing protocols on trade in major commodities in 1997 as well <br>
     as the development of transport and metro building, Russian media <br>
     reported on 7 January. The head of the Russian delegation, Valerii <br>
     Serov, termed the meetings constructive and useful, noting that it was <br>
     the "first time" the two sides had agreed on specific joint actions. <br>
     Serov also noted that the two sides continue to hold differing views <br>
     on the Caspian Sea, and on mutual debts. While both Serov and Azeri <br>
     officials were upbeat about moving Azeri oil through Chechnya soon, <br>
     Chechen sources, cited by Reuters the same day, claim Russia is <br>
     dragging its feet in oil negotiations it was to have completed by 1 <br>
     December. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     France as the new co-chair of the deadlocked negotiations on the <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, RFE/RL reported on 7 January. France, <br>
     beating out an active U.S. bid, succeeds Finland, which held the <br>
     office for 20 months. The other co-chair is Russia, whose post is <br>
     permanent. The chief French negotiator will be Jacques Blot. -- Lowell <br>

     RUSSIA, AZERBAIJAN TALKS. A Russian delegation led by Deputy Prime <br>
     Minister Valerii Serov is in Baku for talks on a wide range of <br>
     bilateral, as well as CIS-related, issues, Russian media reported on 6 <br>
     January. Talks are expected to focus on bilateral trade and economic <br>
     cooperation, the repayment of Azerbaijan's debts to Russia, and the <br>
     time-frame and volume for Azeri oil to be transited via Russian <br>
     territory. Both Azerbaijan and Russia have announced that their <br>
     respective segments of the 1411 km-long Baku-Novorossiisk pipeline are <br>
     ready to carry Azeri oil to international markets, Russian agencies <br>
     reported. Azerbaijan wants to start pumping some 30,000 metric tons of <br>
     oil in February. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     TURKISH PRESIDENT TO FURTHER SUPPORT AZERBAIJAN. In a televised New <br>
     Year's Day interview, Suleyman Demirel said Turkey will stand behind <br>
     its "brother," Azerbaijan, at all future international negotiations, <br>
     Asbarez-on-line reported on 2 January, citing Cumhuriyet and Turkiye. <br>
     Demirel claimed that Azerbaijan occupies an "extremely important and <br>
     exclusive place" in Turkey's foreign policy. Demirel excluded the <br>
     possibility of "forcible" border changes in the disputed Nagorno- <br>
     Karabakh region. Demirel praised President Heidar Aliev for managing <br>
     to "achieve internal stability" and stop the war in Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>

     AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENT ON 1996. In his New Year's Day address, Heidar <br>
     Aliev described 1996 as a year of peace and stability, RFE/RL reported <br>
     on 1 January. He highlighted the effectiveness of the1993 Nagorno- <br>
     Karabakh ceasefire and termed the OSCE Lisbon summmit last month as <br>
     very important to the conflict's ultimate resolution. He said the <br>
     country has survived "attempts mounted by internal and foreign forces" <br>
     to destabilize it and said much work had been accomplished in building <br>
     a democratic, secular, and law-abiding state. Aliev said the economy <br>
     grew for the first time since the collapse of the USSR (albeit by only <br>
     1.2%), the decline in the rate of production slowed, and agricultural <br>
     output rose by 3%. He also noted that monthly inflation was less than <br>
     1% and foreign investments doubled last year. * Lowell Bezanis<br>

     ANOTHER FRENCH COMPANY TO PARTICIPATE IN AZERBAIJANI OIL CONTRACT. The <br>
     French oil company Total will participate in an international <br>
     consortium, led by the French group Elf, to develop the Lenkoran Deniz <br>
     and Talish Deniz shelf deposits in the southern part of Azerbaijan's <br>
     sector of the Caspian Sea, AFP reported on 27 December, citing <br>
     Interfax. A representative of the Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR, <br>
     which has a 25% stake in the project, said that the German Denimex <br>
     firm and the U.S. Mobil group are also likely to get involved in the <br>
     $2 billion deal. The project is the latest in a series of <br>
     multibillion-dollar oil contracts that Azerbaijan has signed with the <br>
     world's leading oil companies in recent years. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     PRESIDENT ALIYEV: AZERBAIJAN FAVORS EFFECTIVE CIS COOPERATION<br>
     <br>
     BAKU,  Dec  30  (Interfax)  -  Azerbaijan  attaches  much<br>
     significance to  its  participation  in  the  Commonwealth  of <br>
     Independent States and favors effective cooperation within the<br>
     <br>
     CIS, President  Heydar Aliyev  said at a meeting with Russia's <br>
     Ambassador to Azerbaijan Alexander Blokhin in Baku today.<br>
     Aliyev said  he wished  the  CIS  would  achieve  further<br>
     integration among its members economically and socially.<br>
     On Russian-Azerbaijani  relations, the president recalled<br>
     that this  year the  two countries had managed to deepen their <br>
     cooperation, although "a lot of untapped potential remains."<br>
     Azerbaijan and  Russia  have  noticeably  improved  their<br>
     cooperation  in  a  bid  to  settle  the  Armenian-Azerbaijani <br>
     conflict, Aliyev said.<br>
        That was  "clearly demonstrated"  during the  preparation<br>
     for the  OSCE summit  in Lisbon  earlier this month and during the <br>
     summit  itself, he  said. Aliyev thanked the Russian side, including  <br>
     Prime  Minister  Viktor  Chernomyrdin  and  Foreign Minister Yevgeny <br>
     Primakov, for their support at the summit.<br>
     The Azerbaijani  president also voiced the hope that 1997<br>
     would become "crucial" in terms of efforts toward settling the <br>
     Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.  "Not a  single day  should  be wasted. <br>
     This question must be resolved in 1997," the president stressed.<br>
     Blokhin presented  Aliyev with  a  message  from  Russian<br>
     President Boris  Yeltsin, offering his Azerbaijani counterpart best <br>
     wishes  for the  New Year  and inviting him to attend the CIS summit <br>
     in Moscow next month.<br>

     RUSSIA UPSET OVER ADAMS/KHACHUKAEV MEETING. Russia's Ambassador to <br>
     Baku, Aleksandr Blokhin, told ITAR-TASS on 18 December he was <br>
     displeased at the reported recent meeting in Baku between Terry Adams, <br>
     chairman of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), and <br>
     Chechen government official Eduard Khachukaev (See OMRI Daily Digest <br>
     for 18 December 1996). Blokhin argued that the export of Caspian oil <br>
     via Chechnya to Novorossiisk, which Adams and Khachukaev allegedly <br>
     discussed, was regulated under the terms of the existing agreement <br>
     between Transneft and the AIOC. A spokesman for Adams confirmed that <br>
     he had met with Khachukaev but denied that the two men had discussed <br>
     transit tariffs. * Liz Fuller<br>

     FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA. In <br>
     its annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based <br>
     Freedom House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 <br>
     most repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December. <br>
     Uzbekistan, which last year also appeared in the worst category, <br>
     improved its record in 1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, <br>

     AZERBAIJAN SIGNS ANOTHER OIL CONTRACT. Representatives of Azerbaijan's <br>
     state oil company SOCAR signed on 14 December a $2 billion 25-year <br>
     contract with a consortium of U.S., Japanese, and Saudi Arabian <br>
     companies to develop the Dan Ulduzu and Ashrafi Caspian shelf <br>
     deposits, Russian and Western agencies reported. The deposits are <br>
     estimated to contain 150 million metric tons of oil and up to 50 <br>
     billion cubic meters of gas. SOCAR will have a 20% stake in the <br>
     project, Amoco 30%, Unocal 25.5%, Itochu 20%, and Saudi Arabia's Delta <br>
     4.5%. Russia's LUKoil is not a direct participant in the consortium <br>
     but could acquire an interest, since SOCAR plans to link the <br>
     development of Dan Ulduzu and Ashrafi with that of the nearby Karabakh <br>
     deposit, according to AFP of 14 December quoting Interfax. -- Liz <br>

                    FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AZERBAIJAN COULD DOUBLE IN 1997<br>
     <br>
                    BAKU,  Dec  9  (Interfax-PIA)  -  Foreign  investment  in<br>
               Azerbaijan could nearly double next year compared with 1996 to<br>
               $872 million,  and command a 71.3% share of overall investment<br>
               in  the   country,  Oktai   Akhverdiyev,  deputy   Azerbaijani<br>
               economics minister, told a press conference in Baku Friday.<br>
                    Akhverdiyev said  $758 million  of  the  total  would  be<br>
               pumped into  oil projects:  the Azerbaijani  International Oil<br>
               Company, which is coordinating a project to develop the Azeri,<br>
               Chirag and  Gyuneshli offshore  oilfields, stands  to  receive<br>
               $723 million;  and other  projects to develop the Karabakh and<br>
               Shakh Deniz  oil fields should get $20 million and $15 million<br>
               respectively.<br>
                    Investment by  international financial  organizations  is<br>
               also anticipated.  The World Bank should open a credit line to<br>
               improve the  country's gas sector ($5 million), water supplies<br>
               ($5 million)  and land  melioration ($0.6  million); while the<br>
               European Bank  for Reconstruction  and Development  (EBRD)  is<br>
               expected to  set aside  $23.2 million for the construction and<br>
               reconstruction of hydroelectric power plants.<br>
                    Turkey's ExIm  Bank will  release $10  million of  a $250<br>
               million export  credit to build an air terminal at Baku's Bina<br>
               airport ($6  million) and to upgrade local telephone exchanges<br>
               ($4 million).  And the  Islamic Development Bank has agreed to<br>
               finance two  $2 million  projects, one  to build the Mil-Mugan<br>
               collector, and  the other  to reconstruct  the Samur  Apsheron<br>
               canal.<br>
                    Akhveriyev said  also that  Azerbaijan's export potential<br>
               was on  the up, despite a continuing foreign trade deficit. He<br>
               said total  foreign trade  next year  could be as high as $1.8<br>
               billion, compared  with $1.6  billion this  year.  The  figure<br>
               would include  $800 million  in exports  (compared  with  $675<br>
                million in 1996) and $1 billion in imports ($950 million).  <br>
                The main export  commodities, he  said, would  be oil       <br>
                products and cotton.<br>

               NAGORNO-KARABAKH MAY OPT OUT OF PEACE TALKS WITH AZERBAIJAN<br>
     <br>
                    STEPANAKERT, Dec  12 (Interfax)  - The  parliament of the<br>
               self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic has  questioned the<br>
               wisdom of participating in the Minsk peace process.<br>
                    It expressed  its regret Thursday over the failure of the<br>
               Organization for  Security and  Cooperation in Europe's summit<br>
               in Lisbon to denounce the Azerbaijani delegation's position on<br>
               the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict.<br>
                    The remarks  made by  the OSCE  chairman-in-office on the<br>
               principles underlying  the resolution  of the Karabakh problem<br>
               is "an  attempt at dictating the status of Nagorno-Karabakh in<br>
               total disregard  of the  people's right  to self-determination<br>
               and other OSCE principles," a parliament statement says.<br>
                    Every nation  has a  right to  freedom and  security,  it<br>
               says. "Our  people have  paid too  large a price for that, and<br>
               will never  agree to  become a  chit in  a big  oil game," the<br>
               statement says.<br>
                    The Karabakh  parliament called  on Baku  "to abandon the<br>
               policy of  annexation" and  start  bilateral  talks.  "We  are<br>
               convinced that this is the shortest and most constructive road<br>
               to accord  and peace between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan,"<br>
               the document says.<br>
                    The Karabakh  parliament described  the statement made by<br>
               the  OSCE   chairman-in-office  as  a  biased  position  which<br>
               reflects only  Azerbaijani interests  and is inconsistent with<br>
               the essence of international cooperation.<br>

     19 FORMER OPON MEMBERS ARRESTED IN AZERBAIJAN. Elchin Amiraslanov, the <br>
     former commander of the OPON special police sub-division in Kazakh <br>
     Raion, was arrested in Baku on 10 December along with 18 of his <br>
     associates, Turan and Western agencies reported. In March 1995, the <br>
     OPON unit occupied the local administrative building to protest a <br>
     planned crackdown on their involvement in the illegal export of <br>
     strategic metals; the incident precipitated a showdown between OPON <br>
     commander Rovshaan Djavadov and Azerbaijani army troops in which the <br>
     former was killed. Amiraslanov, who subsequently fled to Ukraine, will <br>
     be charged with treason and the murder of several high-ranking <br>
     security officials in October 1995. Azerbaijani parliament speaker <br>
     Yagub Mamedov has denied reports of Amiraslanov's arrest, according to <br>
     Turan. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     MEDIA CRACKDOWN IN AZERBAIJAN. The speaker of Azerbaijan's Milli <br>
     Mejlis (parliament), Murtuz Alesqerov, on 3 December gave instructions <br>
     that the accreditation of Azadlyg journalist Azer Huseynbala be <br>
     revoked, and warned other opposition journalists that their <br>
     accreditation will also be revoked if they publish materials "that <br>

     Parliamentary correspondents for opposition papers decided on 5 <br>
     December to take turns in supplying coverage of the proceedings of the <br>
     Milli Mejlis for publication in Azadlyg, the newspaper of the <br>

     HELSINKI WATCH PROTESTS TO ALIEV. The Helsinki Watch human rights <br>
     organization has sent a letter to President Heydar Aliev protesting <br>
     the handling by the Azerbaijani authorities of the criminal case <br>
     against former Defense Minister Rahim Ghaziev, Turan reported on 4 <br>
     December. The letter said that Gaziev was repeatedly not allowed to <br>
     meet with his relatives or his lawyer, who so far has only had one <br>
     meeting with his client. Gaziev was Azerbaijan's defense minister in <br>
     the government of former President Abulfaz Elchibey, and fled to <br>
     Russia after Aliev came to power in June 1993. Gaziev was charged with <br>
     the "surrender" of the Shusha and Lachin towns to Armenian forces in <br>
     May 1992 and sentenced to death in absentia. He was extradited by <br>
     Russia in April 1996 at Azerbaijan's request. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN, AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENTS CLASH AT OSCE SUMMIT. Azerbaijani <br>
     President Heydar Aliev, speaking at the OSCE summit in Lisbon on 2 <br>
     December, accused Armenia of refusing to recognize his country's <br>
     territorial integrity and of pursuing "non-legitimate claims for the <br>
     independence of Nagorno-Karabakh," Reuters reported. Aliev said a high <br>
     degree of autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan, along with <br>
     security guarantees for the region's population, should be the key <br>
     principles for settling the conflict. Aliev added that "we cannot <br>
     allow the creation on the territory of Azerbaijan of a second Armenian <br>
     state." Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan said the people of <br>
     Nagorno- Karabakh should be given the right to self-determination <br>
     because Azerbaijan is "unable" to guarantee their safety. <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan warned that the region's population would face <br>
     "genocide or forced deportation" if Azerbaijan's proposals were <br>
     accepted. Observers note that Azerbaijan may block a final declaration <br>
     by the OSCE on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict if it fails to affirm the <br>
     region's territorial integrity. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     RASI-ZADE CONFIRMED AS AZERBAIJAN'S PRIME MINISTER. Azerbaijani <br>
     President Heidar Aliev on 26 November issued a decree naming Artur <br>
     Rasi- Zade as Azerbaijan's new prime minister, ITAR-TASS reported. <br>
     Rasi-Zade had been acting prime minister since the resignation, <br>
     ostensibly on health grounds, of Fuad Kuliev on 19 July. Rasi-Zade was <br>
     born in Gyanje in 1935, trained as an oil engineer, and worked from <br>
     1957-1978 in the oil sector. He then worked as deputy chairman of <br>
     Gosplan and from 1981- 86 as head of the Machine-Building Department <br>
     of the Azerbaijan CP Central Committee. He held the post of first <br>

     BAKU SAYS KARABAKH ELECTION ATTEMPT TO "PRESSURE" AZERBAIJAN<br>
     <br>
     BAKU, Nov  24 (Interfax)  <br>
        - A senior Azerbaijani official<br>
     on Sunday called the current elections in Nagorno-Karabakh for the <br>
     post  of president  of the  enclave "a  new attempt to put pressure on <br>
     Azerbaijan."<br>
        "It  is  putting  pressure  on  Azerbaijan  and  not  the<br>
     legitimization of  the self-declared separatist regime that is the <br>
     main goal of the so-called election," State Counselor Vafa Guluzade <br>
     told  Interfax. "They  want to tell us directly: look who is able to <br>
     influence Karabakh."<br>
        He  quoted   U.S.  political  scientists  as  saying  the<br>
     separatist movements  in  Nagorno-Karabakh  and  in  Georgia's regions <br>
     of  Abkhazia and  South Ossetia  were "controlled from the same <br>
     center."<br>
        He said  raised tension in Karabakh served the purpose of<br>
     those who  are  seeking  "to  regain  their  foothold  in  the <br>
     region."<br>
        Meanwhile, Baku  residents and  refugees from Armenia and<br>
     Karabakh held rallies on Sunday in the Azerbaijani capital and its <br>
     suburbs,  condemning the election as an attempt to torpedo the current <br>
     truce between Azerbaijan and Armenia.<br>
        Each  rally  on  average  brought  together  about  5,000<br>
     people.<br>

     AZERBAIJANI FOREIGN MINISTER ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH PEACE TALKS. <br>
     Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov has refuted Armenian <br>
     presidential spokesman Levon Zurabyan's statement that Azerbaijan <br>
     refused to participate in drafting a declaration of principles on a <br>
     settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (see OMRI Daily Digest, 20 <br>
     November 1996), Turan reported on 20 November. Hasanov said a draft <br>
     declaration proposed by the Armenian side contradicts the "interests <br>
     of Azerbaijan," because it does not respect his country's territorial  <br>
     integrity. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     PROTESTS OVER BEATING OF AZERBAIJANI JOURNALIST. Reporters sans <br>
     frontieres and the independent Azerbaijani journalists' organization <br>
     Yeni Nesil have both protested the 17 November beating of journalist <br>
     Taptig Farkhadoglu by a group of plainclothes police officers, Turan <br>
     reported on 19 November. The incident took place shortly after <br>
     Farkhadoglu interviewed Party of National Statehood Chairman Nemat <br>
     Panahov, who had himself been detained by security officials on 15 <br>

     CLINTON PRAISES AZERBAIJAN'S STANCE ON CFE. U.S. President Bill <br>
     Clinton on 18 November dispatched a message to his Azerbaijani <br>
     counterpart Heidar Aliev emphasizing the importance of reaching a <br>
     settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as a basis for stability <br>
     and prosperity in the Caucasus, ITAR-TASS reported. Clinton also <br>
     praised Azerbaijan's "firm stand" on compliance with the CFE (in <br>
     contrast, Georgia has ceded to Russia part of its CFE allowance). <br>
     Clinton further affirmed the U.S.'s intention to broaden its dialogue <br>
     with Azerbaijan on issues of regional stability. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     BEREZOVSKII VISITS TBILISI . . . Russian Deputy Security Council <br>
     Secretary Boris Berezovskii, on his second visit to Georgia in less <br>
     than a week, met for two hours behind closed doors with Georgian <br>
     President Eduard Shevardnadze on 14 November to discuss the situation <br>
     in Abkhazia, Chechnya, and the North Caucasus in general, Russian <br>
     media reported. -- Liz Fuller<br>
     <br>
     . . . AND BAKU. Berezovskii then flew to Baku where he discussed <br>
     Russian-Azerbaijani relations, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and the <br>
     situation in Chechnya with Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev, noting <br>
     that the "urgent" problems of the region are linked and should be <br>
     tackled jointly. Berezovskii also tried to persuade Aliev of the <br>
     advantages of exporting Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil via the <br>
     "northern" pipeline that runs through Dagestan and Chechnya, according <br>
     to Turan. Aliev told TRT on 14 November, however, that he would prefer <br>
     that Azerbaijan's "strategic" (as opposed to "early") oil be exported <br>
     through the proposed Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, but that unnamed members of <br>
     the consortium engaged in exploiting the deposits in question oppose <br>
     that option. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     U.S. DELEGATION VISITS BAKU. A U.S. government delegation headed by <br>
     James Collins, special advisor to the U.S. secretary of state on the <br>
     newly independent states, and the U.S. special envoy to the OSCE Minsk <br>
     Group, Joseph Presel, held talks in Baku on 13 November with <br>
     Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov and President Heidar Aliev, <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported. Collins expressed concern that the disputed status <br>
     of the Caspian Sea could jeopardize several major oil consortiums; <br>
     Hasanov assured him that Azerbaijan's laws "guarantee the safety of <br>
     foreign companies." Collins handed Aliev a message from U.S. President <br>
     Bill Clinton expressing hope that a document on conditions for <br>
     resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict will be signed during the <br>
     December OSCE heads of state summit in Lisbon. -- Liz Fuller<br>

 CENTRAL  ASIAN  BATTALION  MAY  BACK  PEACEKEEPING  EFFORT  IN KARABAKH<br>
 <br>
 BAKU, Nov  12 (Interfax)  - Kyrgyz  Foreign Minister Roza<br>
 Otunbayeva  does   not  rule   out  the   possibility  of  the participation of <br>
 a Central Asian battalion in the peacekeeping operation in Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
 The Central  Asian states' forces might be represented in<br>
 the international peacekeeping contingent that is likely to be deployed in  the <br>
 conflict  zone after  Azerbaijan and  Armenia sign a peace agreement, she told <br>
 Interfax in Baku today.<br>
 If the parties concerned make this request, this question<br>
 may be  discussed by  the Interstate  Council of  the  Central Asian Union, <br>
 comprising Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.<br>
 The Central  Asian battalion  has this year taken part in<br>
 military exercises within NATO's Partnership for Peace program in Virginia, the <br>
 United States, she said.<br>
 Similar military  exercises, observed by foreign military<br>
 experts, including  NATO  representatives,  will  be  held  in Central Asia <br>
 next year, she said.<br>

     AZERBAIJAN'S OIL OUTPUT FALLS. Azerbaijan's oil output has declined <br>
     for the fifth consecutive year, from 15 million metric tons in 1991 to <br>
     an estimated 9 million tons for 1996, according to Nezavisimaya gazeta <br>
     on 11 November. The decline is the result of a lack of investment and <br>
     the loss of Azerbaijan's traditional export markets. The IMF <br>
     delegation that visited Baku in August made the disbursement of a <br>
     further $300 million loan contingent on the raising of domestic oil <br>
     prices. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     CASPIAN SEA AGREEMENT SIGNED. Representatives from four of the five <br>
     coastal states of the Caspian Sea signed an agreement in Ashgabat on <br>
     12 November on the status of the sea, ITAR-TASS and Izvestiya <br>
     reported. The agreement, granting each state an exclusive economic <br>
     zone 45 miles (75 km) off-shore, was recognized by all parties except <br>
     Azerbaijan. Every country came into the meeting with their own <br>
     proposal for the zone: Iran favored a 10-mile zone; Russia, 20 miles, <br>
     Turkmenistan, 60 miles; Kazakstan, 80 miles; and Azerbaijan wanted the <br>
     entire sea divided into sectors. The signatories regard the resources <br>
     beyond the 45-mile zone as subject to "joint ownership." Azerbaijan's <br>
     oil riches lie beyond the 45- mile zone and that country's <br>
     representative did not sign the agreement. Representatives of the <br>
     other states promised to review "pinpoint jurisdiction" in <br>
     Azerbaijan's case. Izvestiya noted that all of the countries had <br>
     already begun developing areas in the Caspian without any clear ruling <br>
     on its status. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     <br>
     FINNISH FOREIGN MINISTER IN TRANSCAUCASUS. Tarja Halonen on 3 November <br>
     concluded visits to Armenia and Azerbaijan in connection with the end <br>
     of Finland's almost two-year co-chairmanship of the OSCE-sponsored <br>
     negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, ITAR-TASS reported. <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev told Halonen that his country is <br>
     ready to grant Nagorno-Karabakh "the highest autonomy status," citing <br>
     the examples of the Aland Islands in Finland and "some republics of <br>
     Russia." Aliev reiterated that Azerbaijan's territorial integrity must <br>
     be preserved and criticized the OSCE's Minsk group for its <br>
     insufficient emphasis on the principle of inviolability of borders. <br>
     The next round of Karabakh talks will begin on 18 November in <br>
     Helsinki. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     AZERBAIJANI-TURKISH MILITARY COOPERATION. A delegation from the <br>
     Turkish armed forces general staff, headed by Deputy Chief of Staff <br>
     Gen. Cetin Dogan, met in Baku on 31 October with Azerbaijan's defense <br>
     minister Safar Abiev, Turan reported on 1 November. The two men signed <br>
     protocols on cooperation between the ministries of defense of the two <br>
     countries. Azerbaijani politicians have condemned recent Turkish <br>
     statements about the possible opening of a frontier crossing between <br>
     Armenia and Turkey; Azerbaijan Popular Front Deputy Chairman Ali <br>
     Kerimov argued that Azerbaijan's Milli Mejlis should appeal to the <br>
     Turkish parliament not to do so, according to Turan of 2 November. -- <br>

 NOTHING NEW IN THE LATEST ROUND OF NAGORNO-KARABAKH TALKS. No progress was made <br>
 at the negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict sponsored by the OSCE's <br>
 Minsk group that ended on 30 October in Moscow, RFE/RL and Russian media <br>
 reported. The OSCE urged all parties to agree on a "declaration of principles" <br>
 of the conflict's settlement before the December summit in Lisbon. The Minsk <br>
 group released a statement criticizing the plans of the Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
 leadership to hold presidential elections on 24 November, Noyan Tapan reported <br>
 on 31 October. Despite similar criticism from Azerbaijan, Russia, and the U.S., <br>
 Karabakh authorities said on 30 October that the elections will take place. -- <br>

 KARABAKH LEADER SAYS ELECTION WILL BE HELD. Robert Kocharyan, the president of <br>
 the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, said on 28 October that the <br>
 presidential election in Karabakh will be held despite criticism from <br>
 Azerbaijan and Russia (see OMRI Daily Digest, 29 October 1996), Noyan Tapan <br>
 reported. Kocharyan predicted that the Nagorno-Karabakh peace negotiations will <br>
 drag on "for years" and did not expect any progress from the upcoming OSCE <br>
 summit. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department expressed its concern over the <br>
 planned election and warned against "complicating the outcome of the OSCE's <br>
 Minsk Group peace process," Turan reported on 29 October. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SLAMS PLANNED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN <br>
 NAGORNO-KARABAKH. The Russian Foreign Ministry has condemned as "a challenge to <br>
 the international community" the decision by the parliament of the <br>
 self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh to hold presidential elections on <br>
 24 November while "up to one third of the enclave's population are living as <br>
 refugees beyond its borders", Radio Mayak reported on 26 October quoting <br>
 ITAR-TASS. The presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan discussed the Karabakh <br>
 peace process during the Black Sea Economic Cooperation heads of state summit <br>
 in Moscow on 25 October. A further round of talks on the Karabakh conflict <br>
 under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk group opened in Moscow on 28 October. -- Liz <br>

 KARABAKH ELECTION RUMPUS. Azerbaijan's Central Electoral Commission on 22 <br>
 October issued a statement condemning as "an attempt to legalize a puppet <br>
 regime" the presidential elections scheduled for 24 November by the <br>

 quoted the U.S. Ambassador to Baku, Richard Kauzlarich, as stating that the <br>
 U.S. government does not recognize the legitimacy of the elections. To date <br>

 former parliament deputy speaker Boris Arushanyan, Nagorno-Karabakh Communist <br>
 Party head Hrant Melkumyan, and the head of the Control Inspection of the <br>

     LEADERS OF TURKIC-SPEAKING COUNTRIES MEET. The presidents of six <br>
     Turkic- speaking countries assembled in Tashkent on 21 October, AFP <br>
     reported. It was the fourth meeting between the presidents of <br>
     Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and <br>
     Turkey. Discussion centered on trade relations: although the subject <br>
     of Afghanistan was touched on, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said the <br>
     heads of state "would not be dragged into settling political matters." <br>
     However, some time was devoted to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev again said that he was prepared to <br>
     give maximum autonomy to the region but that "Nagorno-Karabakh will <br>
     never be independent." The presidents signed a declareiterating "their <br>
     firm and unchanging commitment to the principles of<br>
     democracy, respect for human rights and a market economy," said <br>
     Karimov. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     International Operating Committee (which represents the consortium of <br>

     LEZGINS APPEAL TO RUSSIAN, AZERBAIJANI GOVERNMENTS. Members of a <br>
     committee organizing an international conference of the Lezgin <br>
     people-- the ethnic group whose traditional homeland is now divided <br>
     between Azerbaijan and Dagestan--have called for an immediate dialogue <br>
     with the Russian and Azerbaijani governments "in order to preclude <br>
     acts of violence," Nezavisimaya gazeta reported on 9 October. They <br>
     have also appealed to the two countries to alleviate the plight of <br>
     families prevented from visiting each other by the strict controls <br>
     currently in force on the Russian-Azerbaijani frontier, and they <br>
     called on the Azerbaijani leadership to abandon its policy of <br>
     discrimination against the Lezgin minority. The Congress of the Lezgin <br>
     People is scheduled to take place in Moscow in January 1997. -- Liz <br>

     AZERBAIJAN "COUP" TRIALS POSTPONED. Azerbaijan's Supreme Court has <br>
     again postponed the trial of some 37 members of the OPON special <br>
     police charged with treason in connection with the March 1995 standoff <br>
     between the OPON and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, because the defense <br>
     lawyers of some of those accused are not yet familiar with the case, <br>
     ITAR-TASS and Turan reported on 8 October. The Supreme Court will, <br>
     however, proceed with the trial of two former Azerbaijani generals <br>
     charged with plotting to shoot down President Heidar Aliev's plane in <br>
     the summer of 1995. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     NEW ROUND OF KARABAKH DIPLOMACY. Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev on <br>
     3 October criticized the OSCE Minsk group for having accomplished <br>
     nothing beyond declarations in the two years since the 1994 OSCE <br>
     Budapest summit, Turan reported the following day. Aliev, who was <br>
     meeting with representatives of the group, condemned the <br>
     organization's "failure to explain to Armenia that the Armenian <br>
     community of Karabakh will not receive the status of an independent <br>
     state." He also reiterated his criticism of Russia's "one-sided" <br>
     approach to the conflict. On 4 October, the OSCE delegation traveled <br>
     to Stepanakert for talks with the president of the self-proclaimed <br>
     Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Noyan Tapan reported on 7 October. The <br>
     Minsk conference co-chairmen, Heikki Talvitie and Valentin Lozinskii, <br>
     called for a quick settlement of political negotiations on the <br>
     conflict before the December OSCE summit in Lisbon. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     AZERBAIJAN "COUP" TRIALS POSTPONED. Azerbaijan's Supreme Court has <br>
     again postponed the trial of some 37 members of the OPON special <br>
     police charged with treason in connection with the March 1995 standoff <br>
     between the OPON and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, because the defense <br>
     lawyers of some of those accused are not yet familiar with the case, <br>
     ITAR-TASS and Turan reported on 8 October. The Supreme Court will, <br>
     however, proceed with the trial of two former Azerbaijani generals <br>
     charged with plotting to shoot down President Heidar Aliev's plane in <br>
     the summer of 1995. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     AZERIS DISTURBED BY JOINT RUSSIAN-ARMENIAN EXERCISE. The Azerbaijan <br>
     Foreign Ministry on 25 September expressed concern at the recent joint <br>
     Russian-Armenian military exercises, ITAR-TASS reported. A ministry <br>
     statement charged that the maneuvers were aimed at enhancing the <br>
     combat effectiveness of the "Armenian occupation forces" in <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azeris were particularly concerned that <br>
     officials from Nagorno- Karabakh attended the exercises, as did the <br>
     Armenian president and Russian Chief of Staff Col.-Gen. Mikhail <br>
     Kolesnikov. -- Doug Clarke<br>

     BADALYAN'S CAMPAIGN PROGRAM. Interviewed in Yerevan on 16 September, <br>
     Armenian Communist Party leader Sergei Badalyan highlighted the key <br>
     points of his program for the 22 September presidential election. <br>
     Badalyan advocates "renewed socialism," which he argues is an ideology <br>
     uniquely suited to the Armenian mindset; a new NEP (New Economic <br>
     Policy); the creation of agricultural collectives which peasants may <br>
     join on a voluntary basis without relinquishing the land they acquired <br>
     through privatization; and the revision of the constitution adopted in <br>
     1995 to limit the powers of the president and subordinate the <br>
     government to parliament. Badalyan's foreign policy focuses on <br>
     Armenian membership of the Russia-Belarus Union "in order to guarantee <br>
     Armenia's national security." He believes that in seeking a solution <br>
     to the Karabakh conflict the right to national self-determination <br>
     should take precedence over the principle of territorial integrity. <br>
     RFE/RL reports that there are now only three candidates for the 22 <br>
     September election. Incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan faces the communist <br>
     Badalyan and the unified opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan. -- Liz <br>
     Fuller in Yerevan (monitoring the presidential election for the <br>
     European Institute for Media)<br>

     NAZARBAYEV IN BAKU. Kazakstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his <br>
     Azerbaijani counterpart Heidar Aliev signed a treaty outlining the <br>
     basic principles governing relations between their countries, a joint <br>
     statement on the Caspian Sea, and 10 inter-governmental agreements in <br>
     Baku on 16 September, Russian and Western agencies reported. The <br>
     statement on the Caspian Sea calls for its demilitarization and the <br>
     need to intensify negotiations between littoral states to determine <br>
     the sea's legal status, ITAR-TASS reported. While in Baku, Nazarbayev <br>
     expressed an interest in Kazakstan's participating in a prospective <br>
     Transcaucasian railway line which Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, <br>
     Azerbaijan, and Georgia have agreed to build. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     BOTAS GETS WORLD BANK LOAN FOR BAKU-CEYHAN STUDY. The World Bank on 12 <br>
     September announced in a news release it will loan $5 million to <br>
     Turkey's oil and gas transmission company Botas to undertake a <br>
     feasibility study and environmental audit of several route options for <br>
     exporting up to 45 million metric tons of crude oil per year from <br>
     Azerbaijan and Central Asia. It appears routing options beginning in <br>
     Baku and transiting Armenia or Georgia to Ceyhan will be evaluated. <br>
     According to the news release, World Bank assistance for the study <br>
     does not imply a commitment to further finance the pipeline as it is <br>
     expected to be built and financed by the private sector. -- Lowell <br>

     COUNCIL OF CIS BORDER FORCES MEETS IN TBILISI. The commanders of the <br>
     CIS border guard services gathered in Tbilisi to discuss several <br>
     agreements aimed at closer cooperation among their forces, including a <br>
     declaration of demarcation and external border protection principles, <br>
     Russian and Western agencies reported on 12 September. Azerbaijan, <br>
     Georgia, and Turkmenistan did not sign part of the package, including <br>
     the declaration, and Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan did not attend <br>
     the meeting at all, NTV reported on 12 September. Special attention <br>
     was paid to extending the 22 January 1993 CIS agreement "On measures <br>
     to stabilize the situation on the state border between Tajikistan and <br>
     Afghanistan" until 1997. Speaking after his meeting with Georgian <br>
     President Eduard Shevardnadze, Russian Federal Border Service Director <br>
     Andrei Nikolaev denied that Russian-Georgian relations had worsened <br>
     and noted that Russia pays for 60% of Georgia's external border <br>
     patrols. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     GULIEV RESIGNS FOR "HEALTH REASONS." Azerbaijani parliament chairman <br>
     Rasul Guliev resigned from office on 11 September, Russian and Western <br>
     media reported the same day. His resignation had been expected to be <br>
     the locus of a stormy extraordinary session of the parliament, the <br>
     Milli Mejlis, but the matter was wrapped up in 15 minutes when Guliev <br>
     asked to resign due to ill health, ITAR-TASS reported. Parliament <br>
     accepted his resignation in a vote of 98-8, with four abstentions. <br>
     During his speech, Guliev pledged his full support to Azerbaijani <br>
     President Heidar Aliev, who was in attendance. It has been rumored <br>
     that Guliev is to serve as Azerbaijan's ambassador to Norway. A <br>
     Norwegian company, Statoil, is part of the international consortium <br>
     involved in exploiting three oil fields off Azerbaijan in the Caspian <br>
     Sea. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     EMERGENCY SESSION OF AZER-BAIJANI PARLIAMENT. The Azer-baijani <br>
     parliament, the Milli Mejlis, is expected to open an extraordinary <br>
     session on 11 September amid increasing speculation that parliament <br>
     chairman Rasul Guliev is set to resign, according to international <br>
     media. RFE/RL reported on 10 September that troop movements were being <br>
     conducted in the capital, Baku. President Heidar Aliev's New <br>
     Azerbaijan Party issued a statement accusing Guliev of placing his <br>
     "ambitions above national interests and attempting to keep the economy <br>
     under the control of a small group of people." The media has been <br>
     predicting the resignation of Guliev, who is closely associated with <br>
     the oil industry, for some time. --  Elin Suleymanov<br>

     IRAN DEMANDS EXTRADITION. Iran has demanded the extradition of Piruz <br>
     Dilenji, chairman of the South Azerbaijan National Liberation <br>
     Committee (SANCL), and a number of other Iranian emigrants living in <br>
     Azerbaijan, Segodnya reported on 4 September. Iran has been pressuring <br>
     Azerbaijan to back up its declared neutrality towards the nationalist <br>
     movement in Azeri-populated northern Iran with concrete steps. <br>
     Dilenji, who said Azerbaijani officials have warned him that he may be <br>
     extradited to Iran, may have to choose between leaving Azerbaijan and <br>
     halting his activities. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     MUTALIBOV SUPPORTERS SENTENCED. The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan has <br>
     sentenced Adyl Gadzhiev, a close associate of former Azerbaijani <br>
     President Ayaz Mutalibov, and Kenan Gyurel, an Austrian citizen of <br>
     Turkish origin, to 14- and 15-year prison sentences for taking part in <br>
     the alleged March 1995 coup attempt, as a result of which at least 50 <br>
     people were killed, ITAR-TASS reported on 6 September. President <br>
     Heidar Aliev has often accused Mutalibov, who fled to Moscow in 1992, <br>
     of trying to assassinate him. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     ELECTIONS SCHEDULED IN NAGORNO-KARABAKH . . . At a session marking the <br>
     fifth anniversary of the Republic of Nagorno Karabakh's (RNK) <br>
     unilateral declaration of independence from Azerbaijan, the RNK <br>
     parliament voted to hold a presidential election on 24 November 1996, <br>
     according to a 30 August Armenian Radio report monitored by the BBC. <br>
     The current RNK president, Robert Kocharyan, was elected in 1994; his <br>
     term expires in December 1996. Under the terms of the Law on <br>
     Presidential Elections passed by the RNK parliament in May 1996, the <br>
     new president will be elected for five years; presidential candidates <br>
     must collect a minimum of 1,500 signatures in their support from <br>
     residents of at least four of the six raions of the RNK. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     IRREDENTIST CAMPAIGN AMONG AZERIS IN IRAN. Tens of thousands of ethnic <br>
     Azeris in Iran have signed a petition calling on their deputies in the <br>
     Iranian parliament to introduce legislation demanding the "return" to <br>
     Iran of 17 cities in the Caucasus, including Baku, the capital of <br>
     Azerbaijan, AFP reported on 31 August, quoting the Iranian daily <br>
     newspaper Abrar. The petition calls on the leadership of Azerbaijan to <br>
     "be courageous and recognize historical facts" and accede to these <br>
     demands. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     <br>
     CONFUSION OVER GERMAN STANCE ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH. The German Embassy <br>
     in Yerevan on 28 August condemned what it described as the <br>
     misinterpretation of statements made by Germany's OSCE Minsk Group <br>
     representative, Ambassador Frank Lambach, during an early August <br>
     meeting with Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev in Baku, Noyan Tapan <br>
     reported on 29 August. On 23 August, the Information Department of the <br>
     self- proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (RNK) accused Lambach of <br>
     exhibiting pro-Azerbaijani bias in statements he had made about the <br>
     possible future status of the RNK. The German Embassy said that <br>
     Lambach's words had been misquoted and "had evoked fair criticism" <br>
     from Armenia, according to Noyan Tapan. Meanwhile, Gerard Liparitian, <br>
     special adviser to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, met this <br>
     week in Germany with his Azerbaijani counterpart, Vafa Gulu-zade, to <br>
     discuss the Karabakh issue before flying to Ankara for a two-day <br>
     working visit. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     AZERBAIJAN CREATES ANTI-NARCOTICS COMMISSION. Deputy Prime Minister <br>
     Iziat Orudzhev has been named to head a state commission on fighting <br>
     drug abuse and trafficking, ITAR-TASS reported on 28 August. The <br>
     commission was established just before a conference was convened in <br>
     Baku, attended by senior UN International Drug Control Program (UNDCP) <br>
     officials, devoted to these same issues. Azerbaijani officials <br>
     participating in the 27 August conference pointed to skyrocketing <br>
     figures for drug-related crimes, the cultivation of narcotic plants, <br>
     and drug seizures in the country. President Heidar Aliev told the <br>
     conference that the fight against the spread of drug addiction is one <br>
     of the country's priorities; the UNDCP will reportedly provide Baku <br>
     with $500,000 to help in the fight. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     AZERBAIJAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER IN TEHRAN. Hasan Hasanov, in Tehran on a <br>
     two-day official visit, assured President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani <br>
     on 27 August that Azerbaijan wishes to improve its relations with <br>
     Iran, which have been clouded by the recent arrests of Azerbaijani <br>
     religious activists accused of links with Iranian intelligence, <br>
     Reuters reported. Hasanov also met with his Iranian counterpart, Ali <br>
     Akbar Velayati, and discussed an upcoming meeting of foreign ministers <br>
     of Caspian littoral states which is to propose a new ruling on the <br>
     division of the Caspian. Iranian parliament speaker Ali Akbar <br>
     Nateq-Nuri expressed his anger at negative Azerbaijani media coverage <br>
     of Iran, according to AFP, quoting IRNA. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     FBI IN TRANSCAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. The U.S. Federal Bureau of <br>
     Investigation plans to double it overseas offices from 23 to 46 over a <br>
     four-year period, AFP reported on 20 August. Among other countries, <br>
     the agency plans to establish a presence in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, <br>
     and Georgia in 1998. This is part of the FBI's effort to create a <br>
     "first line of defense" or early warning system to cope with what it <br>
     considers to be the growing internationalization of crime and crime <br>
     threats to the U.S. The report detailing these plans stressed that the <br>
     agency, whose mission has been confined to domestic law enforcement <br>
     and counter-intelligence, would not be engaged in espionage but would <br>
     liaise with its foreign counterparts. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     AZERBAIJANI STATE OIL COMPANY REASSURES RUSSIA. SOCCAR President Natik <br>
     Aliev said on 14 August that his company considers the Russian port of <br>
     Novorossiisk as the best point for transporting early oil, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported. The comment comes just two days after Aliev was quoted as <br>
     saying that Azerbaijan would try to accelerate the construction of a <br>
     pipeline running from Baku to the Georgian port of Supsa if the war in <br>
     Chechnya continues to escalate. He now predicts that preparations for <br>
     moving the oil to Russia will be completed soon and that the oil will <br>
     begin to flow "on the first day of next year." The Turkish press has <br>
     interpreted Aliev's original remarks as a demonstration of his <br>
     willingness to "change" horses in mid-stream. Aliev is the son of <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     "WANTED" AZERBAIJANIS HIDING IN TURKEY. Azerbaijani Interior Minister <br>
     Ramil Usubov was quoted by Yeni Yuzyil on 10 August as saying many of <br>
     the fugitives wanted in his country, "including those wanted for <br>
     treason," are hiding in Turkey. He said his government has sought <br>
     their extradition repeatedly, but Ankara has been unable to locate any <br>
     of them to date. Turkey has denied these charges. In other news, the <br>
     Turkish Daily News quoted the Azerbaijani Ambassador in Ankara, Mehmet <br>
     Nevruzoglu, as saying the plans of the "secret" Armenian lobby in <br>
     Turkey, which aims to open the Turkish-Armenian border for economic <br>
     reasons, could hurt bilateral ties between Baku and Ankara. -- Lowell <br>

           DEATHS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS IN AZERBAIJAN <br>
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
                         Doubtful deaths<br>
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The special  anxiety  of  Azerbaijan  opposition  and  human<br>
rights  activists  is  about  the  cases  of  doubtful  deaths of <br>
prisoners arrested on the political  accusations.  Excluding  few <br>
Armenian terrorists died in Bayilov prison in 1992, there was not <br>
registered other deaths of political prisoners before the  Heydar <br>
Aliyev's return to power in June 1993.<br>
     On July  16'93  in  Bayilov prison (SIZO-1) in Baku died the<br>
former commander of  Agdam  volunteers'  batallion  of  "Karabakh <br>
Falcons"  YAQUB  RZAYEV,  called also as Qatir Mammed (the famous <br>
rebel of Tsar period) for the personal courage.  He died  4  days <br>
before  the  trial,  in  the  day  when the Parliament passed the <br>
resolution about new investigation of surrender of  Khojali  town <br>
in Nagorno-Karabakh  to  Armenian  armed  forces.  Rzayev who was <br>
arrested in the time of Popular Front's government in  late  1992 <br>
on  the  charge of banditry could reportedly be important witness <br>
of this event  and  also  was  well  informed  about  the  hidden <br>
activity of PFA in Agdam region. Since the Parliamentary hearings <br>
on July 15-16'93 began the arrests of opposition  leaders  [1,2]. <br>
According  unofficial sources,  Rzayev was tortured,  but doctors <br>
reported about the infarct of heart.<br>
     In Autumn 1993,  in same Bayilov prison died ARMEN AVANESIAN<br>
and ARNO MKRTCHIAN,  the ethnic Armenians who were  sentenced  to <br>
death for  terrorism.  According official information,  the first <br>
one died because of pleurisy and total  intoxication  and  second <br>
one from chronic tuberculosis [3].  However, the died people were <br>
not visited by ICRC and their corpses were not given to Armenians.<br>
     On May  15'94,  in  the same prison died also NATIQ QURBANOV<br>
arrested for the illegal custody of weapon.  He was in the past a <br>
bodyguard  of  former Minister of Defense Rahim Qaziyev sentenced <br>
to the death for the military and political crimes. His death was <br>
officially confirmed only during the trial started in August 1994 <br>
[4,5].  Unofficial sources reported that his corpse  looked  very <br>
exhaust.<br>
     On February 6'95, the activist of Qubadli regional branch of<br>
Popular Front NOVRUZ NOVRUZOV died  during  the  trial.  As  some <br>
other members of illegal military unit of "Qaranqush" established <br>
by PFA,  he was accused of killing several officials in  Qubadli. <br>
The death was caused by the heart attack.  It liked true, because <br>
his brother Guloglan Novruzov died for the same cause in  January <br>
1994  after he had seen on TV the accusation speach of Procurator <br>
General against the PFA activists [6].<br>
     On June 29'95,  in the hospital of Shuvelyan Prison (SIZO-3)<br>
died MP,   former  commander  of  frontier  guard  in  Nakhchivan <br>
Autonomous Republic,  activist of opposition Party  of  "Musavat" <br>
SHAHMARDAN (Shahsultan) MAHAMMAD OGLU JAFAROV. He was searched by <br>
the police since August 28'94 and arrested on June 17'95 in Julfa <br>
region. During the  arrest  he  was  wounded  by  5  bullets  and <br>
transported  to  the  Nakhchivan  Central Hospital [7,8].  It was <br>
happened 17 days later the Praliament sanctioned his  arrest  [9] <br>
and 5 days before the trial over 19 his supporters [10]. Although <br>
he  needed  the  quiet  after  2  medical  operations,   he   was <br>
transported  from  Nakhchivan  to Baku.  Reportedly,  he had been <br>
detained there 3 days without the adequate treatment [11].  Group <br>
of  opposition  deputies  of  Parliament  and international human <br>
rights organizations demanded the investigation  which  not  been <br>
made.<br>
     On July  10'95,  the  Chairman  of  Charitable  Society   of<br>
"Nidjat" NUSRET  QASIM  OGLU BUDAGOV died in Investigation Prison <br>
of Ministry of National Security.  He was extradicted from Russia <br>
in late May 1995 as one of the main organisers of attempt of coup <br>
d'etat in Ganja city on October 4'94 ("October case"). It was the <br>
first  extradiction  since Azerbaijan Parliament has initialed in <br>
March 1995 the treaty with Russia  on  mutual  legal  assistance. <br>
There  were  the rumors about the tortures over Budaqov,  but his <br>
relatives did not demand any investigation  [12].  Probably,  the <br>
reason  of that is that they are afraid for the fate of Budaqov's <br>
son Namiq who was also arrested on this case and sentenced to the <br>
long-term imprisonment.<br>
     On November  19'95,  in  the  Baku  prison  died  MP  SEYFAL<br>
BABAYEV. He  was  arrested  by sanction of Parliament on November <br>
5'95 for the organization of killing the H.Aliyev's supporter  in <br>
May 1990  [13].  It was well-known that his health was bad and he <br>
was repeatedly treatened without any hopeness [14].<br>
     On November 25'95, in the Prison Hospital in Boyuk Shor died<br>
the Vice-Chairman   of   Social-democratic   Party,   teacher  of <br>
Agricultural Academy  AYPARA  NASREDDIN OGLU ALIYEV.  The healthy <br>
36-years old man was arrested on October  7'94  on  the  "October <br>
case."  Soon,  his liver became ill. Immediately before the trial <br>
his health had worsened,  and  on  October  22'95  he  fell  into <br>
comatose situation and was transported from Bayilov Prison to the <br>
Boyuk Shor Hospital,  where he died one month later  without  the <br>
adequate  medical  treatment.  The corpse was burried without any <br>
serious investigation [15].<br>
     On December 5'95,  in the Correcting  Work  Colony  (ITK-12)<br>
probably died  the  activist  of PFA,  member of illegal military <br>
unit "Qaranqush" NATIQ AHMEDOV (see case  of  Novruzov).  He  was <br>
sentenced in  February  1995  to  the  13-years  imprisonment for <br>
killings.<br>
     <br>
                Probable attempts upon the lives<br>
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The opposition  sources  report often about the tortures and<br>
other ill-treatment in Azerbaijan prisons.  There are  only  some <br>
cases of immediate danger for the lives of political prisoners.<br>
     So, according the statement  of  arrested  Vice-Chairman  of<br>
PFA, former commander of Lachin regiment Arif Pashayev,  on April <br>
16'94 was happened the attempt to poison him in the Investigation <br>
Prison of   Ministry   of   National  Security  (SIZO  MNB).  The <br>
investigator gave him the cup of tea, and his state was worsened. <br>
After  the  necessary  treatment  was officially stated about the <br>
"dietetic gastritis" [16].<br>
     On July 12'94,  in  the  same  prison  was  the  attempt  of<br>
poisoning the  former  Vice-Minister  of Defense Alakram Hummatov <br>
who was arrested for the separatism.<br>
     On September 22'94,  above mentioned persons together former<br>
Minister of  Defense  Rahim  Qaziyev  and  his former deputy Baba <br>
Nazarli were kidnapped from SIZO MNB.  According latest statement <br>
of A.Pashayev, the Assistant Chief of Investigation Department of <br>
MNS Faiq Mirzoyev was instructed to kill them for the "attempt of <br>
escape," but  instead  that  freed  them and escaped together the <br>
prisoners. Nazarli died later in Moscow  hospital  with  doubtful <br>
circumstances, Qaziyev  hides in Russia,  and other were arrested <br>
again [17].<br>
     <br>
                     Position of authorities<br>
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The government  of  Azerbaijan  is still denied the facts of<br>
ill-treatment in the detention centers. However,<br>
- the fair investigation does not make even in the cases of deaths<br>
  of arrested members of Parliament;<br>
- ICRC delegate has not an access to the prisoners accused/sentensed<br>
  on the political accusations;<br>
- both  local  and  foreign  human  rights activists have not the<br>
  right of visiting the political prisoners;<br>
- the  appeals  of  international human rights organizations like<br>
  Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch are ignored.<br>
     All of them make the official statements unconvincing.<br>

              THE HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER OF AZERBAIJAN <br>
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The Human  Rights  Center  of  Azerbaijan is non-registered,<br>
non-governmental, non-political,  non-profit organization created <br>
on May  1993  by  free journalist and human rights activist Eldar <br>
Zeynalov. The  main  purposes  of that were the disagreement with <br>
the  political  censorship  in  Azerbaijan,  which  blocked   the <br>
publications  about  the  human rights violations in the country, <br>
and the necessity of the constant information on the human rights <br>
situation  for  local  and global human rights organizations like <br>
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Moscow Helsinki Group, <br>
Helsinki Citizens' Assembly etc.<br>
     The main  form  of the work of HRCA is the monitoring of the<br>
human rights situation with the publication  of  the  information <br>
bulletin, thematic   reports,   lists  of  prisoners  etc.  Other <br>
direction of its work is the re-printing the human rights reports <br>
of other  organization  with  translation to the local languages. <br>
HRCA propagates also  the  electronic  mail  in  the  information <br>
exchange in the human rights field.  It provides some local NGO's <br>
by the e-mail link with Western colleagues.<br>
     The programs carrying out by HRCA, are:<br>
- monitoring  the human rights situation in Azerbaijan (supported<br>
  by microgrants of different persons and NGOs);<br>
- monitoring  the  forced  migration  in Azerbaijan (supported by<br>
  Open Society Institute);<br>
- free  translation  office  for  local  e-mail  network  of NGOs<br>
  (supported by International Olof Palme Center).<br>
     For the present  HRCA  has  the  small  staff,  including  6<br>
people.<br>

        POLITICAL PERSECUTIONS IN POST-SOVIET AZERBAIJAN <br>
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
                     Background information<br>
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Azerbaijan is   the   former  Soviet  republic,  biggest  in<br>
Transcaucasia with the  territory  of  86.6  hundreds  sq.km  and <br>
population of 7.5 million people.<br>
     Azerbaijan declared the independence first time  on  28  May<br>
1918,   and  second  time  in  August  1991.  It  was  recognized <br>
internationally following the demise of the Soviet Union  at  the <br>
end  of  December 1991.  The republic was admitted to the CSCE in <br>
January 1992, and to the United Nations on March 1992.<br>
     Under strong pressing  of  Russia,  the  republic  joint  in<br>
Autumn 1993  to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  It <br>
was the direct result of armed conflict  with  neighbour  Armenia <br>
for  the  territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.  In Spring <br>
1992 the   war   unsuccessful   for   Azerbaijan  spread  without <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh and to day more than 20%  of  the  territory  of <br>
Azerbaijan   (it   is   3   time   more  than  the  territory  of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh  itself).  Now  in  Azerbaijan  are  about   200 <br>
thousands  refugees  from  Armenia  and Middle Asia and about 650 <br>
thousands of  internally  displaced  population.  Reportedly,  18 <br>
thousands were killed,  50 thousands were wounded and about 4.600 <br>
people missed in the operations.<br>
     Azerbaijan has a state-controlled economy rich in oil,  gas,<br>
and cotton.  It continues to deteriorate because of the war  over <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh.  In the result of economical crisis about 76.5% <br>
of population live under the level of poverty.  For the  present, <br>
the minimal monthly salary and social benefits are about $1.2 and <br>
average salary is $15.<br>
     The permanent  war  and  total poverty are the background of<br>
political life of the country.<br>
     <br>
                       Political situation<br>
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Azerbaijan is  a  republic  with  a  presidential  form   of<br>
government. Excluding  the period of March 1992 - June 1993,  the <br>
Presidents were former Communist leaders.<br>
     Since 1988,  the country lives in the situation of permanent<br>
political struggles,  mainly  between  radical  nationalists  and <br>
(former) communists.   It  was  the  reason  for  the  states  of <br>
emergency which was declared 5 times,  and  4  successful  and  2 <br>
failed attempts of coup d'etat.<br>
     Heydar Aliyev,  a  former  First  Secretary  of  Azerbaijani<br>
Communist  Party,  assumed  presidential  powers  after  the 1993 <br>
overthrow of his predecessor,  Abulfaz Elchibey,  and was elected <br>
President in   October   1993.   The  supporters  of  overthrowed <br>
Presidents Ayaz Mutallibov and Abulfaz Elchibey are a  main  part <br>
of opposition movement.<br>
     On November  12'95,  in  Azerbaijan  was  elected  the   new<br>
Parliament, Milli Medjlis  (National  Assembly).  The  local  and <br>
international observers  informed  about  the rough violations on <br>
democratic norms and  electoral  procedures.  As  a  result,  the <br>
Presidental Party of "Yeni Azerbaycan" ("New Azerbaijan") got the <br>
majority in Milli Medjlis that guarrants the legislative  support <br>
of President.  Opposition has only 6 from 125 deputies, less than <br>
in the old Parliament.<br>
     The political  struggles  are  still  accompanied   by   the<br>
permanent human  rights abuses increasing since Azerbaijan became <br>
independent.<br>
     <br>
             Violation of human rights and freedoms <br>
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Both old (1978) and new (1995) Constitutions  of  Azerbaijan<br>
declare the  basic human rights and freedoms.  The State is party <br>
of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights <br>
(ICESCR) and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights <br>
(ICCPR). On June 12-14'94 Azerbaijan presented to UN first report <br>
about  implementation  of ICCPR, which was met critically.<br>
     Peaceful demonstrations  and  meetings  are  suppressed   by<br>
the police.  The  National TV and print-houses are managed by the <br>
Presidental  Staff  that  facilitates  the  governmental   policy <br>
against opposition   mass   media.   The   strong  and  arbitrary <br>
censorship exists though the state of emergency was abolished.<br>
     The attacks against opposition were more active  before  the<br>
Parliamentary elections.  According  the new electorial law,  the <br>
public unions were deprived a right to propose their  members  as <br>
candidates. The Ministry of Justice abolished the registration of <br>
range of political  Parties.  The  Central  Electoral  Commission <br>
restricted to some other Parties the possibility of participation <br>
by various ways, including arrests of their activists.<br>
     The arrests on the political accusations indicate truly  the<br>
progress of  the  government in the human rights area.  After the <br>
change of  Azerbaijan  leadership  in  June  1993  the  political <br>
prisoners  of old regime were released and began the new waves of <br>
arrests.  Reportedly,  to day in Azerbaijan are from 873  to  894 <br>
prisoners  arrested by the cases related with political struggles <br>
and terrorist activity.  Among  them,  at  least  7  people  were <br>
reportedly arrested for the political crimes made in 1992,  70-84 <br>
people - in 1993, 270-282 - of 1994 and 510-513 people - in 1995.<br>
     Azerbaijan is not  joint  to  the  international  Convention<br>
against Tortures and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment <br>
or Punishment.  That liberates it from the necessity of reporting <br>
about the situation in this field.  The local human rights groups <br>
and International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross (ICRC) does not <br>
monitor the conditions of political prisoners,  but supporters of <br>
the   opposition   inform   that   policemen  beat  the  arrested <br>
oppositioners.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs  built  in  1995 <br>
twelf new prisons,  but the detencion centers are now overcrowded <br>
in 2-3 times and have not adequate provision for medical care.<br>
     The opposition   concerns  specially  about  the  deaths  of<br>
political prisoners became more often in this year. On July 15'93 <br>
in  the  prison  died well-known oppositioner and field commander <br>
Yaqub Rzayev.  On May 15'94 died Natiq Qurbanov, the bodyguard of <br>
former  Minister of Defense Rahim Gaziyev,  now one of opposition <br>
leaders in exile.  On February 2'95,  during the trial  died  the <br>
arrested activist  of  Popular  Front  Novruz Novruzov.  On March <br>
29'95 died one of the leaders of PFA,  MP Shahsultan Jafarov, who <br>
had been  wounded  by  police  and  deprived the adequate medical <br>
care. On July 10'95, six weeks later his extradiction from Russia <br>
died also  one of the organizers of attempt of coup d'etat Nusret <br>
Budaqov. On November 19'95 died MP Seyfal  Babayev,  arrested  on <br>
the charge  of  organizing  the  political  killing of H.Aliyev's <br>
supporter. On  November   25'95   died   the   Vice-Chairman   of <br>
Social-democratic Party  Aypara  Aliyev arrested on the same case <br>
as N.Budaqov.  At least two unsuccessful attempts  of  poinsoning <br>
the political  prisoners  were  registered  by local human rights <br>
activists in 1994.<br>
     These cases are not investigated by the authorities, and the<br>
appeals and requests of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch <br>
and other organizations are ignored.<br>
     <br>
             Suppression of Social-democratic Party <br>
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     SDPA was  created  on  December 1989 as the reaction of some<br>
democratic orientated  members  of Popular Front of Azerbaijan on <br>
the pressure of anti-democratic tendency  in  this  organization; <br>
the establishment  of internal terror against non-radical members <br>
ruled PFA;  the  protest  against  the  forced  methods  in   the <br>
political struggle.<br>
     In June   27'90   it   was  the  first  non-communist  party<br>
registered officially  as  the  public  association.  Because  of <br>
strong opposition of Ministry of Justice,  SDPA was registered as <br>
political Party only on September 1'95 under pressing of requests <br>
of big powers' Ambassadors.<br>
     SDPA as   the   Party   stating   always   for   the   civic<br>
reconciliation, dialogue  and compromises is permanently attacked <br>
by the radicals of both sides.  There are mainly used such "soft" <br>
means as   censorship   of   Party's   newspaper   of  "Istiqlal" <br>
("Independence"), slander in the media,  or obstacles in election <br>
campaigns.  Well-known is the case of beating the Editor-in-Chief <br>
of "Istiqlal" Z.Alizade by the Minister of  Internal  Affairs  in <br>
1993, mentioned in the reports of big human rights organizations.<br>
     The Chairman of SDPA,  MP Araz  Alizade  objected  to  armed<br>
overthrowing  of  President  was  in 1992 in the short-term exile <br>
because of several attempts  for  his  life.  He  was  under  the <br>
investigation in  1991,  1993  and  1995 for the critics of three <br>
Presidents.<br>
     Less known are the cases of arrests of SDPA members. So, two<br>
activists   of   Party   were   detained  in  1990-1991  for  the <br>
anticommunist activities.   About   30   social-democrats    were <br>
short-termly arrested in late 1992 for the peaceful demonstration <br>
afront Parliament against nationalist tendention of  governmental <br>
policy. Vice-Chairwoman  of  SDPA,  a  winner of Olof Palme Prize <br>
Arzu Abdullayeva was arrested twice in  1992  and  1993  for  her <br>
activity for the peace dialogue in the front area.  Two activists <br>
were repeatedly  arrested  in  1993-1995  for  the  advocacy   of <br>
minority rights.<br>
     At last,   the  Vice-Chairman  of  SDPA  Aypara  Aliyev  was<br>
arrested in October 1994 for the treason of Mother-land, the main <br>
political accusation from the Soviet period.  Soon, the health of <br>
this man was worsened in the prison,  and it was a reason of some <br>
appeals of  Socialist  International  to  the  authorities of the <br>
country. Before the law-suit,  he fell into  the  coma  and  died <br>
on November  25'95 without adequate medical care.  His corpse was <br>
burried without  any  official  investigation.  So,   the   false <br>
accusations  against  famous  SDPA leader in Parliament and media <br>
were not refuted in the court.<br>
     In the  statement  of  SDPA  leadership  the death of Aypara<br>
Aliyev was called as the crime against Azerbaijani democracy  and <br>
social-democracy, particularly.<br>

          THE DESERTION AND DRAFT EVASION IN AZERBAIJAN <br>
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
The Azerbaijani  Republic  is  being  in  the  situation  of  the <br>
undeclared war  with  neighbour  Armenia  since  1988,  when  the <br>
Armenian  Parliament  claimed  the  joining  of  Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
Autonomous District to Armenian Republic.  In the  Soviet  period <br>
(before end  of  1991)  Azerbaijan  had  not  own  army  and  the <br>
policemen and volunteers fighted in the battles.  The articles of <br>
the  Crime  Code on deserting and draft evasion were related only <br>
with the Soviet Army.<br>
     <br>
When the independence of the republic was claimed,  on the Autumn <br>
1991 was established the National Army of Azerbaijan (NAA). After <br>
the collapse the USSR were handed over the NAA all weapon and the <br>
part  of  the personnel of former 4th Army (ethnical Azeris).  In <br>
the same time were began also the call-up and the  responsibility <br>
for the military crimes, including deserting and draft evasion.<br>
     <br>
The main   rules   in   this   area   were   Decrees  "About  the <br>
recruitment of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan"  on  February  19, <br>
1992,  and  "About  the adjournment from the call-up" on November <br>
14,  1992.  They established the privileges for the only sons  in <br>
the families, fathers of 2 and more children, students.<br>
     <br>
The possibility  of the alternative military service was declared <br>
in 1991 and is  confirmed  by  every  call-up's  decree  [1,2,3]. <br>
Reportedly,  the  unpublished law "About the alternative military <br>
service of Azerbaijan Republic" mentioned only religious  reasons <br>
for  the  enrolment  to  this  service.  As  said the Head of the <br>
Department  of  Defense  Ministry,   Chinqiz   Mammedov,   mainly <br>
Christians  of  the Baptist and Adventist Churches have the right <br>
to alternative  service.  The  pacifism  as  the  reason  is  not <br>
mentioned [4].<br>
     <br>
In principle,   the   possible  order  for  the  call-up  to  the <br>
alternative service must be follows:  the citizen  gives  to  the <br>
District  Military Commissariat the application and the reference <br>
from his Church,  after that the question will be decided by  the <br>
Republican  Military Commissariat [4].  However,  as informed the <br>
Deputy for the  law  affairs  of  Military  Commissioner  of  the <br>
Azerbaijan  Republic  Agajavad  Javadov,  "now is not the certain <br>
procedure of the call-up to the alternative service,  and in  the <br>
meanwhile  nobody  from the Azerbaijan citizens was not called up <br>
to it" [5].<br>
     <br>
On the May  12,  1994  was  established  the  cease-fire  on  the <br>
Azeri-Armenian  front.  Now  here are not the military operation, <br>
but the call-ups are continuing.  For example, they were declared <br>
by the decree of the President on Juny 22,  1994 [4],  August 25, <br>
1994 [2].  By  the  anonimous  information  from  the  Republican <br>
Military  Commissariat,  in  the  begin of 1995 will be called up <br>
14,000 men [6].  Moreover,  by the Decree on June 22,  1994  were <br>
liquided  the  privileges,  which  was mentioned in the mentioned <br>
Decrees on February 19, 1992 and November 14, 1992 [2].<br>
     <br>
So, for the present only three group of the men have the right of <br>
the  adjournment.  These  are the men have 4 and more children at <br>
their maintenance; the students and post-graduate students of the <br>
Day Departments of the Universities and Institutes;  the men, who <br>
have at their maintenance the invalids  of  1st  and  2nd  groups <br>
(grades)  [2].<br>
     <br>
The statistics of the desertion and draft evasion is closed,  but <br>
its scale may be characterized by the follows.  For  the  present <br>
call-up  age for rankers is from 18 to 35 years,  and for reserve <br>
officers is to 45 years.  During the Soviet period every  call-up <br>
gave  the  Soviet Army about 50,000 rankers.  The regular call-up <br>
could give the NAA about 900,000 fighters. If the NAA is equal to <br>
the Armenian forces included about 30-50 thousands soldiers, then <br>
draft evasion spreads all over 90 percent of the men  of  call-up <br>
age.<br>
     <br>
The officers  of  the  Military Commissions recognize themselves, <br>
that the call-up and mobilization are not  taking  their  regular <br>
course.  "The  half  men older than 19 years are deserters," said <br>
the Military Commissioner of the Sabayil District  of  Baku  City <br>
Mehman  Mansurov  [7].  In  his  speech  on April 17,  1994,  the <br>
President said about the arrears of the men called up,  which was <br>
about 30%, and about desertiong the whole batallions [8].<br>
     <br>
The main ways of draft evasion are as follows:<br>
     <br>
a. Liberation by the bribes<br>
     <br>
It is very expensive way,  because the price of the liberation is <br>
about some thousands USD.  It is used mainly by the rich sections <br>
of the  population like salesmen or relatives of the officials of <br>
low and middle level.<br>
     <br>
On February 9,  1994 the Parliament discussed  the  case  of  the <br>
Military Comissioner of Qaradag District M.Jafarov,  who assisted <br>
to the illegal liberation  of  145  men  from  the  call-up  [9]. <br>
Sometimes  the  information  about same cases is published as the <br>
separate and rare [10],  but the true scale of this  abusing  the <br>
power is more large.  On April 1994 were retired from their posts <br>
and sent to the front 3 Military Commissioners [8].  As  informed <br>
the  Military  Commissioner of Azerbaijan,  colonel Asif Abbasov, <br>
after the prime-minister S.Huseynov was retired on October  1994, <br>
in  the  Commissariat  were  demobilized 20 officers,  demoted 11 <br>
officers and changed 6 District Commissioners [11].<br>
     <br>
b. Liberation by the connections<br>
     <br>
This way is  accessible  only  for  the  relatives  of  the  high <br>
officials. For  example,  the call-up aged son of Samur Novruzov, <br>
the Chair of the Foreign Tourism Council was sent to USA for  the <br>
study, and  the  necessary  sum  (17,500  USD)  was paid from the <br>
budget of the Agricultural Ministry [12].<br>
c. Enter the universities<br>
     <br>
In Azerbaijan are dozens of University, Institutes and other high <br>
schools.  Early  entering  to them to liberate automatically from <br>
the call-up,  but in 1994 they were reregistrated and the  almost <br>
of  the private high schools did not get the sertification.  Some <br>
students were detained by military police and  sent  to  the  NAA <br>
[13].  Reportedly,  the  group  of the workers of High Navigation <br>
School in Baku was arrested by getting the  bribe  for  enter  in <br>
this high school [10].<br>
     <br>
d. Emigration from Azerbaijan.<br>
     <br>
It is the main way.  The young men, who have not enough money for <br>
the liberation,  emigrated to the neighbour republics of ex-USSR, <br>
mainly Russia.  Generally their migration is not  registrated  in <br>
Azerbaijan,  because  it  is  forbidden  by  the  law,  but it is <br>
possible to buy a permit to leave the country for  the  bribe  in <br>
300  USD.  They  do  not  change  their citizenship,  because the <br>
Azerbaijanian citizenship protects them from the call-up  to  the <br>
local armies.  The Russian-Azerbaijanian treaty on the mutual aid <br>
in the crime cases was initialed by the National Assembly  (Milli <br>
Mejlis) of  Azerbaijan  only  on  March  9,  1995 [14].  The same <br>
agreement is also  between  the  Procurators  of  Azerbaijan  and <br>
Ukraine since May 17, 1994 [15]. There were no cases to hand over <br>
the deserters,  but it is  possible  by  the  conditions  of  the <br>
agreements.<br>
     <br>
In the Crime Code of Azerbaijanian Republic are a few articles on <br>
the  punishment  on  deserting  and draft evasion.  These are the <br>
absense without leave (Art.240  and  241),  deserting  (Art.242), <br>
escape from  military  unit during the fighting (Art.243),  draft <br>
evasion (Art.73), evasion from the mobilization (Art.74) and from <br>
military  service  by  self-mutilation  or other modes (Art.244), <br>
which are punished even in the peace time.  Before the peace pact <br>
between  Azerbaijan  and  Armenia  the situation is considered as <br>
'war' with all results [16].<br>
     <br>
In this case returning deserter may be punished to: <br>
- 5-10 years (Art.73)<br>
- 5-15 years or death (Art.74),<br>
- 2-10 years (Art.240),<br>
- 5-10 years (Art.241),<br>
- 5-10 years or death (Art.242),<br>
- 5-15 years or death (Art.243),<br>
- 5-10 years or death (Art.244).<br>
     <br>
The first  case  of  arrests  for the desertion was registered on <br>
January  1992  (during  so-called  "Dashalti   operation").   The <br>
occupation  by  the  Armenians 11 Districts of Azerbaijan (7 from <br>
them are without disputed Nagorno-Karabakh) started  some  trials <br>
on some military crimes, including deserting [17].<br>
     <br>
Now these  cases  are  the  common phenomenon in Azerbaijan.  For <br>
example,  only in Sabunchi District of Baku were investigated 107 <br>
cases  of  the  deserters,  and some cases were finished to July, <br>
1994 [18].  During two weeks after the Decree on August  9,  1994 <br>
were arrested about 500 deserters [19]. The police arrested about <br>
492 former criminals,  which were amnested and sent to the  front <br>
and then deserted [20].<br>
     <br>
Generally, the  sentences and other statistics on these cases are <br>
not published. In the known cases the sentences were rough: 10-15 <br>
years  of  prisonment  [21],  15 years [22].  There is the common <br>
tendention to make the punishment more  cruel.  So,  in  1993  in <br>
Azerbaijan  were  sentenced to death 22 people,  in 1994 - 23 (in <br>
2.3 times more than in Russia with its 150-millions  population). <br>
By  the  opinion  of  the  Member of the Collegium of the Justice <br>
Ministry,  Chairman of the Lawyers Union,  Dr. Ilham Rahimov, the <br>
situation is related with the activity of Military Tribunal [23]. <br>
It is the probable reason of  these  statistics  are  hidden.  In <br>
fact,  in  1993  was  published  the  information  about 12 death <br>
sentences [24].  Only one from them was about the sentence of the <br>
Military  Tribunal,  which was already abolished by the President <br>
[21].  Dr.Rahimov  considers,  that  in  1994   were   also   the <br>
executions.<br>
     <br>
The President  as  the  final  instance  for  the  appeal did not <br>
generally mitigate  a  punishment  to  the  deserters  and  draft <br>
evaders.  Only  once  he  amnested the group of 44 deserters from <br>
NAA,  which were arrested for the  deserting  in  December  1993, <br>
during  the  Armenian  attack in the Beylaqan District.  One from <br>
this group was sentenced to the death,  13 men to the 10-15 years <br>
of  prison,  the  25  cases were in the Military Tribunal,  and 5 <br>
soldiers were under the investigation [21].<br>
     <br>
In the whole,  the cease-fire changed nothing. No the battues for <br>
the forcible recruitment,  which were often in the near past [25, <br>
26,13] and used sometimes for political [27] and  moral  pressure <br>
[28].  However  now  is  the confusion with the evaluation of the <br>
present situation.  It was one of  the  topics  of  special  wide <br>
conference  of  the  Military Tribunals and Military Collegium of <br>
the Supreme Court on February 1995,  where was recommended to use <br>
more  regular  the  Article 42 of the Crime Code [29].  According <br>
this article, the criminal military serviceman can be sent in the <br>
war period to the front with the respite of punishment.<br>
     <br>
The typical  example  of  usual practice is the case Sardar Eldar <br>
oglu Alibalayev,  born 1973 [30].  It was  a  draft  evader  from <br>
December 1993 to September 1994.  Then he realized his guilty and <br>
came to the District Military Commissariat,  where  was  forgived <br>
and sent to the reception unit.  However the police arrested him, <br>
and he was sentenced by the District People Court to 7  years  of <br>
prisonment  for  the draft evasion (Art.73,  part 2).  During the <br>
sitting of the trial the Procurator considered as the aggravating <br>
fact,  that Alibalayev return after ending of the operations,  in <br>
the "peaceful time".  He demanded to use part 2 of  the  article, <br>
which  was  made  more rough by the National Assembly on November <br>
26, 1993 [31] (already  after  the  crime!)  and  using  for  the <br>
punishment  in the "war time".  But he refused to use the Art.42, <br>
because "the time is peaceful" and there are not the operations.<br>
     <br>
This undefinity makes possible the violation of the principles of <br>
humanity  and  justice.  The  protests  of the political [27] and <br>
civic [32] organizations  are  ignored  by  the  government,  and <br>
spontaneous civic movement is forcible suppressed [13,26,33].  In <br>
these conditions the deserters,  draft evaders,  who have  not  a <br>
money  for  the  bribe,  also pacifists,  conscentious objectors, <br>
political oppositioners can be punished disproportionally severe.<br>

     <br>
             AZERBAIJAN: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CALLS<br>
    FOR INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF POLITICAL PRISONER<br>
     <br>
     As the trial of Tofiq Qasimov resumes, Amnesty International<br>
is calling on the presiding judge in the trial to urgently accept <br>
defence requests for an independent medical examination  of  this <br>
possible prisoner of conscience.<br>
     "We are dismayed that Tofiq Qasimov, who was diagnosed while<br>
in detention as suffering from  a  serious  mental  illness,  was <br>
denied  the  chance  to  present to the court an evaluation by an <br>
independent psychiatrist of his fitness to stand trial,"  Amnesty <br>
International  said today.  "We believe this may adversely affect <br>
his chances of a fair trial."<br>
     Tofiq Qasimov,  a  member  of   parliament   and   prominent<br>
political  figure in Azerbaijan,  was diagnosed as suffering from <br>
reactive psychosis following his  arrest  in  September  1995  on <br>
charges  of  complicity  in  a  failed coup attempt in March that <br>
year.  He was released on health grounds in February 1996 pending <br>
his trial,  which began in May.  On 21 May the presiding judge in <br>
the case refused to allow into consideration an evaluation by  an <br>
independent   psychiatrist,   reportedly   citing  the  potential <br>
"insult" a further examination  may  cause  to  the  doctors  who <br>
carried out the initial one.<br>
     Amnesty International  is  urging  that  any   decision   to<br>
continue trial proceedings is based on a thorough and independent <br>
assessment of Tofiq Qasimov's state of health.  The  organisation <br>
is  also concerned about allegations that the charges against him <br>
are false,  and have been fabricated in  order  to  punish  Tofiq <br>
Qasimov  for  his non-violent political activity in opposition to <br>
the Azerbaijani Government.<br>

AZERBAIJAN - POLITICAL OPPONENTS  MAY FACE UNFAIR TRIAL<br>
     <br>
Amnesty International today expressed alarm that Tofiq Qasimov, a <br>
possible  prisoner  of  conscience,  is  to stand trial next week <br>
despite having been diagnosed as suffering from a serious  mental <br>
illness.<br>
     "We are  extremely  concerned that Tofiq Qasimov is not only<br>
made to stand trial in an unfit mental state, but also that there <br>
are allegations that the charges against him are false,  and have <br>
actually  been  brought  to  punish  him  for   his   non-violent <br>
opposition  to the Azerbaijani government," Amnesty International <br>
said today.<br>
     Tofiq Qasimov,  a  member  of   parliament   and   prominent<br>
political figure of Azerbaijan,  is to stand trial on 7 May after <br>
being charged with complicity in a failed coup attempt  in  March <br>
1995.  Amnesty  International  is  concerned  he faces a possible <br>
death sentence if convicted.<br>
     Tofiq Qasimov was diagnosed in February  as  suffering  from<br>
reactive  psychosis,  a  serious mental health problem induced by <br>
environmental circumstances. His poor state of health had led the <br>
authorities to release him pending trial, after some five months' <br>
detention.  He was returned to his family in Baku on 22 February. <br>
He  is  continuing  to  receive  medical  treatment at home.  His <br>
condition has improved, but he has reportedly not fully recovered <br>
and  there  are  fears  that  the  stress  of standing trial will <br>
aggravate his mental problems.<br>
     Amnesty International has put its concerns repeatedly to the<br>
Azerbaijani authorities,  and has urged them to ensure that Tofiq <br>
Qasimov  receives  a  fair  trial  in  line  with   international <br>
standards, should the case be brought to court.<br>
     Tofiq Qasimov's case has reportedly been linked to the cases<br>
against Adil Hajiyev,  an aide of fugitive former president  Ayaz <br>
Mutalibov, and Kenan Gurel, an Austrian citizen of ethnic Turkish <br>
origin living in Azerbaijan.  Both men have also been accused  of <br>
treason  in  connection  with  the coup attempt of March 1995 and <br>
face a possible death sentence if convicted. Sources in Baku have <br>
alleged that these cases are totally unrelated and that the trial <br>
may be held behind closed doors because Kenan Gurel is a  foreign <br>
citizen.<br>
     Adil Hajiyev,  who was extradited from Russia to  Azerbaijan<br>
in February 1996,  suffers from diabetes mellitus and unspecified <br>
heart trouble.  There have been reports that his state of  health <br>
has  seriously  deteriorated  and that he has attempted to commit <br>
suicide on several  occasions  in  pre-trial  detention.  Amnesty <br>
International  had  urged  the  Azerbaijani authorities to ensure <br>
that he receives all appropriate medical treatment. On 2 April he <br>
was  transferred  to  prison  hospital  and  is  believed  to  be <br>
currently still in hospital.  The organization is concerned  that <br>
Adil Hajiyev will also not be fit to stand trial on 7 May.<br>

                         Ayaz MUTALIBOV<br>
<p>
Amnesty International has learned with great  regret  that  Rahim<br>
Qaziyev, detained in Moscow on 14 April, was forcibly repatriated<br>
to Azerbaijan on 16 April 1996.  Amnesty International fears that<br>
he  will  suffer  serious  human rights violations in Azerbaijan,<br>
specifically torture, ill-treatment and the death penalty.<br>
<p>
Rahim Qaziyev's wife was unable to obtain access to  the  central<br>
police  station  Petrovka  38  in  Moscow where he was reportedly<br>
still  detained  in  the   afternoon   of   16   April.   Amnesty<br>
International  does  not  know  what  procedures,  if  any,  were<br>
available  to  Rahim  Qaziyev  to  appeal  against  his  forcible<br>
repatriation.<br>
<p>
Amnesty International   is   now   calling   on  the  Azerbaijani<br>
authorities to guarantee the  safety  of  Rahim  Qaziyev  and  to<br>
ensure that he is not subjected to torture or ill-treatment.  The<br>
organization is also appealing to the President of Azerbaijan  to<br>
commute Rahim Qaziyev's death sentence.<br>
<p>
Former President  Ayaz  Mutalibov,  detained  on  11  April,   is<br>
reportedly  held  in  the medical ward of the detention centre of<br>
the Moscow  City  Directorate  of  Internal  Affairs  (GUVD)after<br>
suffering  heart  problems.  The Office of the Russian Prosecutor<br>
General stated on 16 April that a decision  as  to  the  forcible<br>
repatriation of Ayaz Mutalibov had not yet been taken.<br>
<p>

                      = May 30, 1996 =                          <br>
<br>
     <br>
                   Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
     <br>
     I represent  here a small non-governmental organization from<br>
Azerbaijan, the  Human  Rights  Center  of  Azerbaijan.  It   was <br>
established in  April  1993  and  deal with monitoring of general <br>
human rights situation, including the forced migration issues.<br>
     Azerbaijan  is  a  typical  post-Soviet  republic  with  the<br>
old economy structures and social conciousness. Disintegration of <br>
USSR and  enter to the world community was painful.  As a result, <br>
appear a  forced  migration,  when  the  citizens  of  Azerbaijan <br>
escaped   from   war,   economic  stagnation,  ethnical  tension, <br>
political repressions.<br>
     Of course, since 1988, a main problem in this sphere are the<br>
refugees and  internally  displaced  persons.  I  would  like  to <br>
attract  your attention to several points only.  The first one is <br>
an absense of comprehensive migration service.  Its functions are <br>
divided between  State Committee on Refugees and Forced Settlers, <br>
Ministry of  Labour  and  Social  Maintenance,  State  Statistics <br>
Committee, and so on.<br>
     As a result,  there is not an unified  policy  and  reliable<br>
registration of  displaced population.  To October 1995,  only 60 <br>
thousands people,  or 7% from total had a sertification of refuge <br>
or IDP [1]. There are several total figures, and no one is right. <br>
When in February 1996,  the Executive Power of Baku city finished <br>
the  registration  of  IDP,  there  was get a total number in 118 <br>
thousands instead of 200 thousands [2]. The revision of the State <br>
Committee for  Refugees  and  IDP  in March 1995 showd,  that the <br>
official number of refugees was more to 119,229 people  than  the <br>
real number [3].<br>
     Simple accounting shows that it permits an  embezzlement  of<br>
humanitarian aids in many millions dollars. It is a main cause of <br>
absense of Migration Service and registration even after 8  years <br>
of Karabakhi  war  and  2  years of cease-fire.  It is better for <br>
donor states to help in the  establishment  of  these  structures <br>
than lose regularly a big part of humanitarian aid.<br>
     There is also the forgotten problem of Meskhetians  deported<br>
from Georgia  in  1944.  After  the  ethnical disorders in Soviet <br>
Middle Asia in 1989 they became  also  the  refugees.  The  total <br>
number of Meskhetians is 260 to 280 thousands [4],  but they have <br>
not such international attention as, for example, Crimean Tatars. <br>
About 60 thousands Meskhetians live now in Azerbaijan near to the <br>
mother-land,  but only several hundreds were repatriated.  United <br>
nations could deal with this problem,  concerns many republics of <br>
CIS. I appreciate highly that the representative  of  Meskhetians <br>
was invited and supported by UNHCR.<br>
     Painful is also a problem of political migrants, both to and<br>
from country.  In  Azerbaijan  live  to day about 7,000 apatrids, <br>
mainly from Iran.  Since Azerbaijan became independent, they lost <br>
their privileges.  As  apatrids,  they  have not a possibility to <br>
work in the state structures.  They are not a refugees and do not <br>
get an humanitarian aid.  Parliament discussed the law "About the <br>
legal status of foreigners and apatrids",  where is  this  right, <br>
but there   was  passed  only  first  draft.  Many  of  political <br>
emigrants are apatrids and have not the appropriate documents for <br>
going abroad, only temporary residence permit.<br>
     Some emigrants complaint to our Center that are harrassed by<br>
Iranian agents,  and there is the confirmation.  For example, Ali <br>
Tavassoli, an Iranian national, was reportedly abducted from Baku <br>
on 27 September 1995 and taken to Iran. Some Iranian families are <br>
threatened by phone.  Accounting the recent events in the Iranian <br>
Azerbaijan, where   police  persecuted  and  executed  the  Azeri <br>
opposition, and the  practice  of  Iranian  secret  service,  the <br>
emigrants would  like to change the permanent address.  But their <br>
appeals to Azerbaijan authorities and especially to UNHCR  office <br>
are without  adequate response.  What evidences are necessary for <br>
UNHCR for to save the migrants' rights?  Killing or disappearance <br>
of family members? But it could be also explained as accident.<br>
     Other group of political migrants are  opposition  political<br>
figures who  left  Azerbaijan  because  of  real danger for their <br>
health and  lives.  Practically  all  of  them  prefer  to   live <br>
illegally or  half-legally  in neighboring states than appeal for <br>
an asylum. No wonder that they do not appeal, because it needs to <br>
make known their address. Secret services of CIS countries abduct <br>
the oppositioners, and it is well-known for the Russian colleagues.<br>
     The mutual  agreements about the legal assistance are in CIS<br>
a tool for the extradition of  political  emigrants  without  any <br>
fair procedures.   For  example,  ex-Minister  of  Defense  Rahim <br>
Qasiyev escaped from Azerbaijan and sentenced to  the  death  was <br>
extradited  from Russia on April 16 only because of this sentense <br>
passed in absentia [5].  Whole extradition procedure took 2  days <br>
only. Only  special  resolution  of  Russian  Duma saved from the <br>
immediate extradition a  former  President  of  Azerbaijan,  Ayaz <br>
Mutallibov  [6].  As  many human rights organizations considered, <br>
there are a violations of Convention Relating to  the  status  of <br>
refugees  (1951).  In  February,  former State Adviser and former <br>
member of Parliament,  Adil Hajiyev,  who is accused in the  high <br>
treason  and  can  be  sentenced  to death,  was arrested without <br>
preliminary permission of Parliament and extradited  in  10  days <br>
[7]. Group  of  Azeri  agents  attempted  two  weeks ago abduct a <br>
former member of Parliament Araz Alizade who is  accused  in  the <br>
insult of  President and escaped to Moscow.  Nusret Budaqov,  who <br>
had been extradited in May 1995,  died in Baku  prison  in  seven <br>
weeks, although he was healthy [8].<br>
     Totally, in  1995  were extradited to Azerbaijan at least 13<br>
people: 4 people from Russia,  4 from Ukraine, 5 from Georgia. In <br>
1996 were extradited at least 8 oppositioners:  7 from Russia and <br>
1 from Ukraine.<br>
     I am  glad  that the draft of Programme of Action provides a<br>
way for deciding the situations I described.  It is a  result  of <br>
big work  of  many  partners,  including  both  governmental  and <br>
non-governmental organizations.  I hope that the  Programme  will <br>
stregthen their further cooperation.<br>
     Thanks for your attention!<br>

          REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS IN AZERBAIJAN<br>
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
                           Background<br>
                           ~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Azerbaijan is the greatest Transcaucasian republic with  the<br>
population in  7,5  mln.  people.  Among  them  are Azeris (71%),<br>
Talishes (11%), Russians (6%), Lezghis (4%), Armenians (1,6%) etc.<br>
     For the  present there are reportedly 233 thousands refugees<br>
and 665  thousands  displaced  persons  (DP).   From   Azerbaijan<br>
emigrated about  300-350  thousands  Armenians  and   about   200<br>
thousands Russians.<br>
<p>
                            Refugees<br>
                            ~~~~~~~~<br>
     Azerbaijan was the first republic of former USSR  came  face<br>
with  the  problem  of  coming  refugees  since  1988.  According<br>
official information, on January 25'88 first hundreds Azeris were<br>
forced  to  leave  the   Kafan city  in  Armenia  because of mass<br>
disorders against Azeris,  have made by the supporters of joining<br>
to   Armenia   Nagorno-Karabakh   Autonomous   Oblast  (NKAO)  of<br>
Azerbaijan.<br>
     In Winter  1988  the  eviction of Azerbaijan population from<br>
Armenia became the mass deportation  with  the  participation  of<br>
local  powers.  The  peak of that took place on November-December<br>
1988.  During the next year practically all Azeris left  Armenia.<br>
(Last Azeri  village  Nuvedy in Megry region was kept till Spring<br>
1991).<br>
     According our  information,  in  1988-91   more   than   180<br>
thousands of Azeris, 11 thousands Kurds-Muslims and 3,5 thousands<br>
Russians have left Armenia and placed in Azerbaijan. Besides that<br>
in 1989 more than 4,5 thousands of  refugees  (Azerbaijanian  and<br>
Caucasian  highlander)  came to Azerbaijan Republic from the city<br>
Novy Uzen  in  Kazakhstan,  and  also  about  50   thousands   of<br>
Meskhetian  Turks  from  Uzbekistan who became the victims of the<br>
interethnic pogroms.<br>
     The part  of  these  refugees  left  Azerbaijan  because  of<br>
different reasons, and now their number reduced to 233 thousands.<br>
     The Armenians  evacuated  to  Armenia  after  the  pogrom in<br>
Sumgayit city on February 1988 started the  migration  wave  from<br>
Azerbaijan.  They left finally the big cities in early 1990,  and<br>
now there are only 30 thousands in Baku and about  120  thousands<br>
in  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  zone.  The  total  number  of Armenian<br>
refugees is estimated in 300-350 thousands.<br>
<p>
                        Displaced persons<br>
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Since February 1988, when began the disorders and separatist<br>
meetings  of  Armenian in NKAO,  in Azerbaijan appeared the first<br>
forced deplaced persons (DP),  at  first  Azeris  from  the  city<br>
Stepanakert (Khankendi), then Armenians displaced from the cities<br>
Sumgayit and Shusha.<br>
     In May  1992  was  finished  the  full  ethnic  cleansing of<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh from Azeris which before conflict were about  50<br>
thousands. In  middle  May 1992 the operations went out of former<br>
NKAO. It made DP's the populations of 7 nearest regions  (Lachin,<br>
Kelbadjar, Agdam,  Fizuli,  Qubatli, Jebrayil, Zangilan) occupied<br>
by Armenian armed troops.  With that a great number of  Kurds  of<br>
Azerbaijan,  who lived compactly in Lachin,  partly Kelbadjar and<br>
Qubatli regions, became DP. The end of the operations in May 1994<br>
stopped the inflow of the DP.<br>
     UNHCR published in 1994 the report on  Azerbaijan  according<br>
which there are 778 thousands DP.  Other sources, which are close<br>
related with problem,  reported the less  number,  about  650-665<br>
thousands  DP.  The  revision of the State Committee for Refugees<br>
and DP's on March 1995 made known,  that the official  number  of<br>
refugees was more to 82,296 people than the real number.<br>
<p>
                        Meskhetian Turks<br>
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     We are guests of Georgia,  and it is the reason,  why I want<br>
to report separately about Meskhetian Turks, or "Ahiska Turkler",<br>
as they  called  themselves.  They are an ethnical group in about<br>
200 thousands people for to day, who was deported from Georgia in<br>
1944  to the Soviet Middle Asia.  So,  that was forced migration,<br>
and these migrants are DP.<br>
     The restrictions  for  the  free  movement  were   partially<br>
abolish in  1956,  and  already  in 1958 the first 2,150 families<br>
came for living to Azerbaijan,  near to mother land, Georgia. The<br>
total number  of  Turks  came  to  Azerbaijan  in   1958-62,   is<br>
approximately 20-25  thousands.  After  the  anti-Turk pogroms in<br>
Uzbekistan in June 1989 to Azerbaijan came 44-48 thousands more.<br>
     The migrants  of  1989  have from November 1991 the official<br>
status of refugees. Only 54 people were registered as DP.<br>
     Former leaders  of  Georgia  had the nationalist approach in<br>
the problem of returning  the  Meskhetians  to  Georgia.  As  the<br>
result, from  Georgia  were re-emigrated 160 families returned in<br>
1970's. Now the situation changed,  and the main problems are the<br>
lack of  law  basis  and  financial  difficulties.  Despite that,<br>
already 100  young  Meskhetians  returned  from   Azerbaijan   to<br>
Georgia, and reportedly, there is a plan of returning 40 families<br>
more.<br>
     The Meskhetian  problems  is  unical,  because  it  concerns<br>
most republics  of  former  USSR.  The leaders of Meskhetians are<br>
sure that only international pressing to Russia as  successor  of<br>
USSR, and  the  mass  humanitarian  aid  could help to solve this<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
                  The frameworks of the problem<br>
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     In the beginning the status of displaced people from Armenia<br>
and  Middle  Asia  as  refugees  was   unrecognized   by   Soviet<br>
authorities.  In  spite of the mogration was between the formally<br>
undependent Soviet republics,  they have not the official  status<br>
of  refugees.  They  were  considered  only as "persons temporary<br>
departed their permanent address" and deprived the  international<br>
humanitarian aid till the collapse of USSR.<br>
     The law "About the status of refugees and forcedly displaced<br>
persons" was adopted by the Parliament only on  September  29'92.<br>
But  even  2.5  years later the official status had to March 1'95<br>
only 31.066 DP or 8% from the total number of DP adults (406.755)<br>
and only 22.990 from the refuges (10%).<br>
     There is not the special legal difference between privileges<br>
of  refugees,  who  are  defined  as  people  migrated from other<br>
countries,  and DP,  who are displaced into Azerbaijan.  They are<br>
getting the  equal  allowance  and  all benefits,  common for the<br>
pensioners,  children etc.  The difference is only in  the  civil<br>
rights and duties,  because unnaturalized refugees  are  formally<br>
the foreigners (in reality, it is not practicize for the refugees<br>
from Armenia).  But in the practice in some regions were happened<br>
that refugees did not got the humanitarian aid as DP.<br>
     There is  also  other law acts related with DP and refugees,<br>
for example,  prohibition of the punishment for the violation  of<br>
passport registration, tax privileges, etc.<br>
     The governmental institution, which is busy by this problem,<br>
is the  State  Committee  for  the  Work  with  Refugees  and  DP<br>
(so-called "Dovletqachqinkom"), which has the status of Ministry.<br>
The structure  of  the  Ministers'  Cabinet has also the separate<br>
Department for the Work with Refugees and DP.<br>
     There are  also  the Parliamental Commission on Refugees and<br>
Connections with Compatriots and the  State  Councellor  for  the<br>
Humanitarian Affairs in the Presidential Staff,  who are busy for<br>
the migration problem by their duties.<br>
     In 1993 was established the State Commission for the Foreign<br>
Technical and   Humanitarian  Aid.  In  this  sphere  works  also<br>
half-governmental  Azerbaijani  Society  of  Red   Crescent   and<br>
Azerbaijani Refugees' Society.<br>
<p>
                     "Non-forced" migration<br>
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     There are some migration processes,  which are  without  the<br>
generally accepted frameworks of "forced migration", but they are<br>
forced by the same reasons.<br>
     For example, the Azeris DP occuped the flats of Russians and<br>
forced them to go to Russia.  According the public opinion Russia<br>
is guilty  in  the  Karabakhi  conflict.  The  Federal  Migration<br>
Service of Russia gave such people the official status of refuge,<br>
recognizing the forced character of this migration  process.  And<br>
Azerbaijani  government  do  not  recognized that as the problem,<br>
although in 1990-1995 from the republic went about 200  thousands<br>
Russians  and at least 42 thousands former citizens of Azerbaijan<br>
(including Russians) became the official refugees.<br>
     Other sample is the fate of Udin community of  Oguz  (former<br>
Vartashen) region.  Udins,  who  are  the  small ethnic autochton<br>
group of Azerbaijan,  were baptized  in  the  Armenian  Apostelic<br>
Church and  most them have the Armenian names and relatives among<br>
Armenians. Now  they are persecuted by local authorities and from<br>
300 Udin families of Oguz remainded about 35. The others migrated<br>
to  Russia  or  to Nidge village in neighbour Qabala region where<br>
they live compactly.<br>
     Georgian sources reported that the average number  of  Azeri<br>
emigration from  1989  is  about 10 hundreds yearly,  and half of<br>
them prefered Azerbaijan.  Of course,  the main  reason  is  hard<br>
economical  situation,  but  there  are  also many evidences that<br>
local Azeris are under the great national pressing:  to discharge<br>
from work,  hostage-taking,  attacks by armed  robbers  Svan  and<br>
Armenian    nationalities,    discrimination   while   the   land<br>
distribution.<br>
     Authorities of  both  republic do not see the reason to give<br>
them the status of refugees,  though make active work  to  return<br>
them to Georgia. As was said on 1994 by the head of the executive<br>
power of Dmanisi region of Georgia Otari Aslanishvili,  after his<br>
appeal  to  the  Azeri  refugees  come  back  only to this region<br>
returned 96 families or 347 persons.<br>
<p>
                       The social problems<br>
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The displaced  people  traditionally  prefer  to live in the<br>
cities,  because there their problems can be decided more really.<br>
in the end of 1994 about 402,735 DP or 61.6%  lived in cities and<br>
43.1% lived in four big cities.<br>
     From Summer 1993 began the building of the  tent  camps  and<br>
the  tendency  to the compact settlement of DP.  The reasons were<br>
following:  the ending of dwelling fund  (empty  flats,  hostels,<br>
guest-houses  and  health camps),  closing Baku by military power<br>
for unregistrated citizens in September 1993, also the comfort of<br>
the distribution of humanitarian aid.<br>
     To Winter 1994/95 in 13,5 thousands tents were settled about<br>
80 thousands DP.  Among them in South group  of  8  camps  (8,000<br>
tents) settled about 47 thousands DP.<br>
     Since March   1994   were  built  by  EC  also  20  standard<br>
settlements with 200 houses for  2  families  in  each  one.<br>
There were  settled  about  8  thousands  families  (40 thousands<br>
people).  Ten thousands houses for DP and refugees were built and<br>
put  into  exploitation  for  the account of republican budget in<br>
1994.<br>
     Despite that, the dwelling problem is still actual. Even now<br>
in some regions of republic are the adobe cottages.  And  on  the<br>
contrary, the big part of the built houses (136 individual houses<br>
and 1,173 flats) were given illegally to other  people,  who  are<br>
not refugees or DP.<br>
     Other big social problem  of  DP  is  the  unemployment.  It<br>
touches less the refugees than DP,  because refugees from Armenia<br>
got a work places of the escaped Armenians.  Among DP,  according<br>
the different information sources,  are from 303 to 352 thousands<br>
DP are employable and the level of enemployment is from 30.5%  to<br>
41.6%.<br>
     The main reason of the  great  unemployment  of  DP  is  its<br>
professional  structure.  The  great  part  of DP (59.7%) are the<br>
agriculture workers and now they have not  the  work  in  cities.<br>
According  official  information,  in  1994  got the unemployment<br>
benefit less than 1.6%  DP and only 3,340  people  have  got  the<br>
official status of unemployees.<br>
     More than half DP is unemployable:  under  age  (259,816  or<br>
40%) and pensioners (86,795 or 13.3%).<br>
     According general  opinion,  expressed  in  press and in the<br>
Parlament of Azerbaijan,  the state benefit for the refugees  can<br>
not cover  of  their  minimal  needs.  So,  DP  have  the income:<br>
pencioners  (mainly),  children,  students,  unemployers  without<br>
status - 8,500 manat ($1.89),  unemployers with official status -<br>
9,600 manat ($2.13).  At the same time the living wage on the end<br>
1994  made  41,180 manat ($9.15),  and the bread price is for the<br>
present 850 manat ($0.20) for 1 kg and more.<br>
     So, the benefit is not enough even for the food.  It is  not<br>
accedentally  a  great  number of sickness among DP especially in<br>
tent camps.  According official information,  the death  rate  of<br>
new-born refugees  is  more  than 6-8 times.  Wide-spride are the<br>
infectious illnesses.<br>
     Among 111,043 children till 5 years old only 8,300 go to the<br>
preschool institution.  At  the  same  time  about 400 school-age<br>
children mainly from families lived in farms do not study.<br>
     So, no one the main need of DP (work,  food,  public health,<br>
education)   is   not   supported  adequately  by  government  of<br>
Azerbaijan. Therefore external humanitarion aid is important.<br>
<p>
                        Humanitarian aid<br>
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The foreign  humanitarian  aid  to DP became real only after<br>
Azerbaijan found the independence at the end 1991 and  after  the<br>
republic  joined to UN and CSCE in 1992.  After the 4 resolutions<br>
accepted in  1993  by UN Security Council on Nagorno-Rarabakh was<br>
finally recognized  the  fact  of  occupation  the  territory  of<br>
Azerbaijan and the presense of DP. A great impuls to humanitarian<br>
aid gave also the resolution on November 22'93 "International Aid<br>
to  the  refugees  and  DP  in  Azerbaijan" accepted by the Third<br>
Committee of UN General Assembly.<br>
     To day  in  Azerbaijan work the branches of tens foreign and<br>
international humanitarian organizations.<br>
     The main  problem  is  the  control  for the distribution of<br>
coming humanitarian aid.  It is more effective only in  the  tent<br>
camps  and  settlements,  where  DP live compactly and are in the<br>
charge of  the  concrete  international   organization.   It   is<br>
recognized  officially  the  facts of mass thefts of humanitarian<br>
aid by the  representatives  of  local  powers  and  governmental<br>
organizations.  It  is  enough  to  mention  the case of about 82<br>
thousands "superfluous" DP.<br>
     The big  obstacle for the real assistance to the refugees is<br>
the  passiveness  of  US  as  the  main  state-donor  because  of<br>
so-called  Section 907 of "U.S.  Freedom Support Act" accepted in<br>
Autumn 1992  by  US  Congress.  This  amendment forbid the direct<br>
assistance of American government to the only republic of  former<br>
USSR,    Azerbaijan,   because   it   blockades   the   transport<br>
communications to neighbour enemy Armenia.  On June 29'95 the  US<br>
Congress confirmed these restrictions.<br>
     Simultaneously, US assistance is not forbided to Russia, the<br>
army of  which  bombed  the  civil  population  of  Chechnia,  to<br>
Tadjikistan, where the victims of communist regime became hundred<br>
thousands people, to the other post-totalitarian states of former<br>
USSR.<br>
     On the  Spring  1994 turned out paradoxical situation,  when<br>
from humanitarian assistance of US to Transaucasia  Armenia  has<br>
got  50,1%,  Georgia - 47%,  and more suffered Azerbaijan has got<br>
only 2,9%.  Among donors of humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan at the<br>
end of March 1994 USA has took only 9th place.<br>
     The US  government was forced to make the detour,  financing<br>
purposefully the projects of American and  international  NGO  in<br>
this field.  Till  to  end  1994  was made by such way the aid at<br>
least on 23-24 million  dollars.  But  the  effect  of  that  was<br>
reduced,  because  of  the  absense  of  direct intergovernmental<br>
efforts for the justice distribution of the aid.<br>
<p>
                 The perspectives of the return<br>
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     The troubles  of current peace Azerbaijani-Armenian negotia-<br>
tions were  programmed  from  the  begin.  Armenians  stated that<br>
Armenia  is  not  the  conflict  side  and  the  war  is  between<br>
Azerbaijan (7,5 mln. people) and self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
Republic (120 thousands  people  or  in  3  time  less  than  the<br>
population  of the well-known Sumqayit city).  With that the main<br>
conflict  side  is   protecting   from   possible   international<br>
sanctions.<br>
     There is forgotten not only  simple  logics,  but  also  the<br>
enclave   problem.  The  "neutral"  Armenia  occuped  directly  3<br>
Azerbaijani enclaves  (Karki,  Askipara  and  Barkhudarli),   and<br>
Azerbaijan also seizured one Armenian enclave (Artsvashen).<br>
     These plays in the mighty puppet "mini-states", successfully<br>
fighting against new independent republics,  is  characterly  for<br>
the   Russian  foreign  police  in  former  USSR  in  the  whole.<br>
Pridnestrovye in Moldova,  Abkhazia in Georgia,  Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
in  Azerbaijan,  the  attempts  to  organized  such  conflicts in<br>
Lietuva,  Estonia,  in Crimea - all of them are the result of one<br>
imperialist  policy.  The  goal of it we can understand here,  in<br>
Georgia,  observing the correlation between the  Russian-Georgian<br>
relations and changes in Abkhazian problem.<br>
     Therefore I do  not  believe  to  the  rapid  returning  the<br>
displaced people  to  the  conflict  area.  The  only way is the<br>
pressure of world community to Russia,  as it was in Baltia,  and<br>
the  realization  of  4 resolutions of UN Security Council by the<br>
sanctions against the agressor state.  In other case we will have<br>
in Transcaucasia a new "Northern Cyprus".<br>

     <br>
AZERBAIJAN - AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL URGES THE AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE <br>
APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR IMPRISONED POLITICAL OPPONENT<br>
     <br>
The Azerbaijani  authorities should ensure that Tofiq Qasimov,  a <br>
possible prisoner of conscience, receives all appropriate medical <br>
treatment  following  his  transfer  from prison to hospital last <br>
week, Amnesty International said today.<br>
     "At least two prisoners in ill-health are  alleged  to  have<br>
died  as  a  result  of  inadequate medical treatment in the past <br>
year.  We are concerned that Tofiq Qasimov may also suffer  as  a <br>
result of inadequate medical care," the human rights organization <br>
said.<br>
     Tofiq Qasimov, under arrest since September 1995, is said to<br>
have  been  diagnosed  in  recent days as suffering from reactive <br>
psychosis,  a  serious   mental   health   problem   induced   by <br>
environmental circumstances.  On 16 February,  he was transferred <br>
from an investigation prison of the Ministry of National Security <br>
to a prison hospital.<br>
     Amnesty International  is  seeking  further information from<br>
the Azerbaijani authorities on Tofiq  Qasimov's  reported  mental <br>
state  as  well as his treatment,  prognosis and plans for future <br>
care.  According to the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for <br>
the  Treatment  of  Prisoners,  any prisoner requiring specialist <br>
medical care  should  be  transferred  to  a  specialist  medical <br>
facility to obtain such treatment.<br>
     Tofiq Qasimov,   a   member   of  parliament  and  prominent<br>
political figure in Azerbaijan,  has been charged with complicity <br>
in a failed coup attempt in March 1995.  Amnesty International is <br>
concerned about allegations that the charges are false,  and have <br>
been  fabricated  in  order  to  punish  Tofiq  Qasimov  for  his <br>
non-violent political activity in opposition to  the  Azerbaijani <br>
Government.  The  organization  is also concerned that he faces a <br>
possible death sentence if convicted.<br>
     In a report issued in January (Azerbaijan -  Allegations  of<br>
ill-treatment  in  detention,  AI Index:  EUR 55/01/96),  Amnesty <br>
International expressed its  concern  at  continuing  allegations <br>
that   detainees   have   been  ill-treated  by  law  enforcement <br>
officials.<br>

       Information for the participants of Network Meeting <br>
       Forced Migrations Projects, Open Society Institute<br>
                         March 5-6, 1996<br>
     <br>
     General situation of forced migration in Azerbaijan in 1995 <br>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>
     The operations  in Nagorno-Karabakhi region did not restored<br>
since the cease-fire  agreement  of  May  12'94.  Simultaneously, <br>
there  were  not  the  certain  results  of  the  permanent peace <br>
negotiations in the framework of  OSCE  Minsk Group  and  shuttle <br>
visiting the region by the high diplomats of Russia.<br>
     Therefore, in Azerbaijan was  not  any  changes  in  neither<br>
number of  forcedly displaced people (FDP) nor situation of their <br>
repatriation.<br>
     There was  the  conference  on  problems  displaced  people,<br>
repatriants and migrants in Tbilisi on July 9-11'95. The heads of <br>
Armenian and  Azerbaijanian  delegations  had  signed  there  two <br>
protocols of intention about  the  information  exchange  on  the <br>
refugees and   harm   compensations,   but   it   had   not  real <br>
consequences.<br>
     In 1995  was  continued  the  Western  humanitarian  aid  to<br>
Azerbaijan in the total volume more than 100 Millions USD.<br>
     <br>
                     Changes of legislation<br>
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     In the   main,   the  national  legislation  on  the  forced<br>
migration and humanitarian aid had not been changed. However, the <br>
new Constitution   of  Azerbaijan  acting  since  December  27'95 <br>
content new significant items of political asylum right.<br>
     According to  the  Constitution of 1977,  the foreigners and<br>
apatrids have the asylum right,  if they are persecuted  for  the <br>
"protecting  of  workers  interests  and peace,  participating in <br>
revolutionary and  national  liberation  activities,  progressive <br>
social and political, scientist and other creative activity." The <br>
Constitution of 1995 gives the raight to the political asylum  to <br>
the foreigners  and  apatrids who "are being persecuted for their <br>
political believes and the actions, which are  not considered  as <br>
criminal in Azerbaijan Republic."<br>
     For the  privileges  to  FDP,  on  May 16'95 were passed the<br>
ammendments of 2 articles of Crime Code concerning the violations <br>
of passport regime. Now, FDP are not punished for that.<br>
     Some  new  laws  facilited  the  activity  the  humanitarian<br>
organizations in  the  country.  For  example,  in  January  1996 <br>
fifteen foreign humanitarian organizations were released from the <br>
registration tax   $2,000  for  opening  the  local  offices.  On <br>
February 8,  there was signed the protocol  about  special  legal <br>
status of IFRC in Azerbaijan.<br>
     In April 1995,  Milli Mejlis (National Assembly) refused  to<br>
pass the  agreement  "About Help to Refugees and Forced Settlers" <br>
signed by CIS leaders.  Reportedly, the reason was that according <br>
this agreement,  the  harm  compensations to internally displaced <br>
people from the territories occupied  by  Armenians  are  in  the <br>
responsibility of Azerbaijan itself.<br>
     <br>
                           Statistics<br>
                           ~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     State Committee for Statistics informed that to January 1'96<br>
in Azerbaijan were 918,622 FDP or 202,918  families.  Among  them <br>
are  233,682  people (49,149 families) are refugees,  and 684,980 <br>
people (153,763 families) are internally displaced persons. There <br>
are  330,000  displaced children:  144,500 are in the age under 5 <br>
years, and 185,500 are from 5 to 16 years old.<br>
     The number of employable people is 395,829,  and only 93,271<br>
are employed. There are also 90 thousands pensioners.<br>
     It is possible that total figures are inflated, as it was in<br>
the past  (the  previous  official  fugure of 1993-1994 and early <br>
1995 was 1.030.000 people).<br>
     For example,  in  May  1995  the revision of activity of the<br>
State Committe  on  the  Work  with  Refugees and Forced Settlers <br>
discovered that total figure of FDP only in the  main  places  of <br>
their compact living was inflated to 199,229 people. According to <br>
information  of  Baku  City   Administration   for   Population's <br>
Employement,  to  September  1'95 in Baku lived 192,560 FDP.  But <br>
latest information (February 1996) proved that in city are living <br>
only  118 thousands FDP,  because some people were simultaneously <br>
registered in two addresses.<br>
     The problem  of  official  registration  is not decided yet.<br>
According to State Committe on the Work with Refugees and  Forced <br>
Settlers,   during  last  5  years  24,971  refugees  and  35,785 <br>
internally  displaced  persons  got  the  certain  statuses.  The <br>
establishment  the  card file of FDP living in Baku needed half a <br>
year.<br>
     It is correctly when a head of local representation of  IFRC<br>
Torsten Wegner  stated  that  official statistics "is our biggest <br>
difficulties," because of "governmental data is  not  reliable... <br>
there are several figures."<br>
     To October  1995,  in  Azerbaijan  were   registered   3,962<br>
apatrids, including  1,897  political  emigrants and persons with <br>
the equal status.  Together their  families  members,  the  total <br>
fugure is  about  14 thousands people. Azerbaijan takes the first <br>
place in  former  USSR  on  the  number  of  political  emigrants <br>
(registered officially).<br>
     According to the result of opinion poll,  the monthly income<br>
of 38%  FDP was in 1995 from $1 to $2 for one person,  19% - from <br>
$2 to $4,  5%  - more than $4,  16%  - less than  $1.2  (official <br>
minimum), 21% couldnot say the amount of their income.<br>
     <br>
                   Placement and repatriation<br>
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     In 1995,  the significant part of FDP (about 50,000  people)<br>
lived in the tent camps.<br>
     There was continuing the building  of  standard  settlements<br>
from the  prefabricated  houses by EC in both front-line area and <br>
regions far from the front-line.  However,  the revision in March <br>
1995 showed that from 4,389 built flats 112 were given to persons <br>
who was not FDP.  According to preliminary information,  also 136 <br>
houses and 1,173 flats were given to the unidentified persons.<br>
     Sociologists consider that  only  7%  FDP  do  not  want  to<br>
return, 40%  FDP  want to return unconditionally,  12%  FDP would <br>
return if the state would warranty their security,  and 41% FDP - <br>
if the state would warranty their security and give the financial <br>
means for restoring their households.<br>
     For example,  after  the  establishment of the settlement in<br>
the unoccupied  part  of  Agdam  region  there  were  voluntarily <br>
repatriated some thousands of FDP.<br>
     State Committee  on  the  Work  with  Refugees  and   Forced<br>
Settlers informed   that   the   draft   version  of  Program  of <br>
Repatiation of Refugees and  Forced  Settlers  was  presented  to <br>
Ministers' Cabinet already.  However, it was neither published in <br>
the press nor discussed in the Parliament.<br>
     Although the  authorities  do  not  recognize the problem of<br>
Azerbaijan emigration from the Eastern  Georgia,  they  facilited <br>
the  repatriation  of persons who escaped from Georgia because of <br>
the rise in crime.  For example,  the executive power of Dmanissi <br>
region  had  decreed  in  1995  the abolishment the rewjection of <br>
passport registration of returning  people.  As  a  result,  tens <br>
families returned and was quickly registered again. The change of <br>
national policy in Georgia resulted in the election 4  Azeris  to <br>
the  Georgian  Parliament  (in  the  previous one was nobody from <br>
Azeris).<br>
     <br>
                        Humanitarian aid<br>
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     From January 23 to  29,  1995,  the  representatives  of  UN<br>
humanitarian organizations  visited Azerbaijan for collecting the <br>
documents on the needs of FDP.<br>
     Then, UN  decided to give Azerbaijan the UN humanitarian aid<br>
from April 1'95 to March 31'96 in the amount $34,536,620. It will <br>
be made through UN structure (UNHCR, UNESCO, WFP, etc.). Besides, <br>
without  the  framework  of  UN  programs  will   be   made   the <br>
humanitarian aid for $77,437,219.<br>
     The necessity of visit of UN officials was probably grounded<br>
by  the difference in the governmental data and information about <br>
the embezzlement of humanitarian aid that is  confirmend  by  the <br>
authorities, too.<br>
     For the struggle against these abuses,  President decreed on<br>
January  15'95  the establishment of Republican Commission on the <br>
International  Humanitarian  and  Technical  Aid  with  Chairman, <br>
Deputy Prime-Minister Izzet Rustamov.  The Commission established <br>
on April 26'93 was practically stopped its activity a  long  time <br>
before   this   decree,  and  control  for  the  distribution  of <br>
humanitarian aid was lost.<br>
     Totally, in  Azerbaijan  to  December  1'95  were  active 38<br>
international   humanitarian   organizations,   among   them   35 <br>
registered officially.<br>
     In the  contrary  to  the  official  statements  about   the<br>
governmental control  for  the  distribution of humanitarian aid, <br>
even the  few revisions  in  1995  resulted  scandaleously.<br>
     The revision  of the activity of State Committee on the Work<br>
with Refugees  and  Forced  Settlers  in  March  1995  discovered <br>
119,229  inflated  FDP,  embezzlements  of  tens tons foodstuffs, <br>
rough abuses in the distribution of housing and fees. In December <br>
1995  were  published the results of checking the activity of the <br>
Azerbaijan Society of Red Crescent (ASRC).  There were discovered <br>
the disappearance of about 440 ton foodstuffs,  using the form of <br>
humanitarian aid for the transport of  tens  tons  of  commercial <br>
stuffs,  big  difference  in  the  amounts of given food parcels, <br>
distribution of humanitarian aid to the died  or  false  persons. <br>
Finally, there was discovered the correspondence of ASRC with the <br>
Head of Executive Power of Baku city about permitting to sell the <br>
humanitarian  aid  in  the  Baku  markets (early,  a Deputy Prime <br>
Minister had denied this information).<br>
     Since January  1995  the railway and sea communications with<br>
Russia were aborted by it because of Chechenian war.  It had been <br>
violated   the  schedule  and  amounts  of  humanitarian  aid  to <br>
Azerbaijan, which was  transported  with   difficulties   through <br>
Georgia, Iran  and  Turkmenia.  The cargo transport was partially <br>
restored only in January 1996.<br>
     Beside that,  in  1995  the  donor countries were interested<br>
more for not Karabakhian, but Abkhazian and Chechenian conflicts. <br>
Other factor complexing the humanitarian situation was the acting <br>
ammendment #907 to the US Freedom Support Act,  which relates the <br>
direct  humanitarian and technical aids of USA to Azerbaijan with <br>
the deblockade of Armenia by Azerbaijan. It practically postpones <br>
these  aids  till  the  peace  agreement  between two conflicting <br>
states.  (This ammendment was softened a little on January 26'96, <br>
when   the   President   Clinton   signed  the  decree  about  US <br>
governmental humanitarian aid  to  Azerbaijan  if  the  President <br>
would  consider  that  aid providing through NGOs was not covered <br>
the refugees' needs. The decree will valid till September 30'96).<br>
     <br>
                 Activity of HRCA in the Network<br>
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     In 1995,  the experts of  HRCA  took part  in  the  regional<br>
meeting in   Tbilisi   and   international   meeting  in  Warsaw, <br>
concerning the preparation to the UN Conference on the  migration <br>
in CIS.<br>
     There were sent to OSI 54 newsletters on the  general  human<br>
rights situation in Azerbaijan,  including refugees,  minorities, <br>
peace-making, etc.  issues.  Also were made 4 special reports for <br>
the Forced Migration Projects.<br>

              DEATH PENALTY IN AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC <br>
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
                           Background<br>
                           ~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Azerbaijani Republic  became an independent state in May 28,<br>
1918. Soon,  the death  penalty  was  accepted  as  an  exclusive <br>
punishment. It  was  abolished  in  January  1920 and restored in <br>
1922. In the period from 1947  to  1950  the  death  penalty  was <br>
changed to 25-years imprisonment [1].<br>
     Since 1950 the death penalty is used for the wide  range  of<br>
crimes. Acting  list  of  crimes which are punishing by the death <br>
was adopted in 1958 and includes 34 articles of Crime Code. Among <br>
them are:<br>
     - military crimes                            - 16 articles; <br>
     - specially dangerous state crimes           - 6;<br>
     - other state crimes                         - 6; <br>
     - crimes against a person                    - 2; <br>
     - crimes against a state property            - 1; <br>
     - malfeasance                                - 1; <br>
     - crimes against the order of administration - 1; <br>
     - crimes against the social security and<br>
       social order                               - 2.<br>
     The military   crimes  are  usually  judged  by  the  closed<br>
sessions of Military Tribunals or Military Collegium  of  Supreme <br>
Court. It  is  the reason what the big part of death sentences is <br>
not published.<br>
     The death  penalty is not used if the criminal have been not<br>
full age in the moment of crime [2].  This punishment  for  women <br>
was abolished on October 21'94 [3].<br>
     It is important to note that since 1992 the death  sentences<br>
are  being  passed  by  the  court of so-called "Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
Republic" in the territory controlled by  ethnic  Armenians.  For <br>
example,  the  Ukrainian  mercenary  served in the Azerbaijan Air <br>
Forces Yury Belichenko was sentenced on May 23'94 to  death  [4], <br>
which was later reportedly abolished [5].<br>
     <br>
            Conditions of imprisonment and executions <br>
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     According to Art.22 of Crime Code,  the mode of execution is<br>
the shooting.  The executioner shoots to the occiput of prisoner. <br>
In the  execution  take  part  also  Chief of prison,  doctor and <br>
priest [6].<br>
     The prisoners sentenced to death are detained in only prison<br>
of Azerbaijan. It is so-called "Bayilov Prison," which is used as <br>
the  investigation  prison  (SIZO-1) and the place of serving the <br>
imprisonment.  This prison is accounted as safely and  till  1994 <br>
was known only case of escape (future dictator of USSR I.Stalin). <br>
But on October 1'94 the group of sentenceds to death  escaped  by <br>
undermining [7].  To day practically all of them (9 from 10) were <br>
rearrested or killed [8].<br>
     There are   not   a  long-time  the  information  about  the<br>
executions.  Since 1993,  in Azerbaijan were not  the  executions <br>
[9].  The Chief of the Sector on the mercy problem of Presidental <br>
Executive Staff Irada Hasanzade confirmed that during 1995  there <br>
had been not executions [10].<br>
     For that reason the Bayilov prison is overcrowded. According<br>
to the above-mentioned advocate T.Ismiyev,  some prisoners waited <br>
the execution  4-5  years.  Instead  the one-man cells,  they are <br>
detained in those cells by 5-6 people.  More than 10 people  died <br>
already by the natural death [11].<br>
     <br>
                           Statistics<br>
                           ~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Reportedly, Azerbaijan is  the  country  with  traditionally<br>
high rate of death penalties. So, the President of Lawyers' Union <br>
of Azerbaijan, Director of Reserch Institute of Problems of Legal <br>
Examination,  Criminalistics and Criminology,  Dr.  Ilham Rahimov <br>
stated that during  two  last  "Soviet"  decades  (1971-1991)  in <br>
Azerbaijan were  sentenced  to  death  more  than 400 people [6], <br>
i.e., the average rate of such sentences is about 20 yearly.<br>
     It is  confirmed  by  the Chief of Department of Research of<br>
Legal Experience,  Rafael  Gvaladze,  and  Department  Consultant <br>
Ilyas  Mammedov,  who  said  that  the  average  figure  of death <br>
sentences in  Azerbaijan  since  1991  are  18-20   yearly   [1]. <br>
Dr.I.Rahimov  informed  about 22 sentenced in 1993,  and 23 death <br>
sentences in 1994 [6]. Only Baku City Court sentenced to death 25 <br>
people in 1991-1994 [12].<br>
     The official figure of the sentenceds to  death  in  1989-95<br>
are  73  people,  among  them 66 for the killing with aggravating <br>
circumstances, 4 for banditry, 2 for diversion and 1 for the high <br>
treason  [9].  But  the independent expert,  member of Advocates' <br>
Collegium since 1955,  Dr.  Teymur Ismiyev estimated in September <br>
1995 the total figure of sentenced as about 100 people [11].<br>
     <br>
                     Death penalties in 1995<br>
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     As it was above mentioned, the half articles related with<br>
the death  penalty  are  the  military crimes.  Because of closed <br>
sessions of them and existing military censorship,  this part  of <br>
death sentences is hidden from the mass media.<br>
     From the open sources are known 15 cases of 1995.<br>
     Victor Alexandrovich Osminkin,  DOB 1958,  was sentenced  to<br>
the death by Baku City Court on February 17'95 [13].<br>
     In early April two killers, Sahib Quliyev and Nazim Zeynalov<br>
were sentenced to death for the serial killings  by  the  Supreme <br>
Court [14].<br>
     On April 11'95, the resident of Goychay city, Elshan Ibrahim<br>
oglu Ibrahimov,  DOB  1975,  was  sentenced  to the death for the <br>
double killing by the Supreme Court as court  of  first  instance <br>
[15].<br>
     On April  26'95,  Baku  City  Court sentenced to death Mayil<br>
Mirismayil oglu Muradov, DOB 1970 [13].<br>
     In early  May  1995 four activists of illegal armed group of<br>
"Qaranqush" established by the Qubadli branch  of  Popular  Front <br>
were  sentenced  to  death  for  the killing of some officials in <br>
Qaranqush  region  during  the  Armenian  attack,  robbery,   and <br>
stealing the  weapon.  The  names  of  the sentenceds are Intiqam <br>
Qayibov, Sahib Mammedov,  Yashar Shahmuradov, Rovshan Asadov. The <br>
sentence was passed by the Collegium of Supreme Court [16].<br>
     On May 13'95,  the former Minister of Defense Rahim  Qaziyev<br>
was sentenced  to  death  for  the surrender of Shusha and Lachin <br>
regions to Armenians [17].  He  escaped  from  the  Investigation <br>
Prison of Ministry of National Security on September 22'94 [18].<br>
     In early  August  1995,  the  ethnic  Armenian,  citizen  of<br>
Russia, Kamo   Saakov   was   sentenced  to  the  death  for  the <br>
preparation of diversion, illegal custody of weapon and explosion <br>
materials, and contraband [19].<br>
     On August 10'95,  the Supreme Court sentenced to  the  death<br>
Ismayil Ibad oglu Baxshaliyev, DOB 1972 [13].<br>
     Supreme Court sentenced to  death  on  October  3'95  Mammed<br>
Hasan oglu Mustafayev, DOB 1927 [13].<br>
     On October 26'95,  the Military Collegium of  Supreme  Court<br>
sentenced  to  death the resident of Ganja city,  former Chief of <br>
City Military Police Eldar Aliyev.  He was accused in the attempt <br>
of  coup  d'etat  of  October  4'94  and  sentenced  for the high <br>
treason, establishment of illegal armed group, etc. [20].<br>
     On October  27'95,  Agalar  Hadjimirza  oglu  Mehmanov   was<br>
dentenced to the death by the Supreme Court [13].<br>
     Five from above-mentioned people were amnested in 1995. They<br>
are:   I.Baxshaliyev,   A.Mehmanov,   M.Muradov,    M.Mustafayev, <br>
V.Osminkin.<br>
     <br>
                   Perspectives of abolishment<br>
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     Since 1993, when the death penalties were stopped, there was<br>
published an information about 5 people amnested in 1993 (Russian <br>
mercenaries) [21], 1 person amnested in 1994 (deserter) [22], and <br>
7 criminals amnested in 1995 [13].<br>
     The high  level  of  crimes  urges the public to support the<br>
necessity of death penalty.  So,  in  January  1995  the  opinion <br>
polling in Baku showed that 82.4% respondents are for it [23]. In <br>
May 1995 was published the results of  other  polling  given  81% <br>
supporters  of  capital  punishment  [6].  In  January 1996,  the <br>
official press informed about 83.6%  population  supporting  this <br>
measure  [9].  Therefore  the  abolishment  of  death  penalty in <br>
Azerbaijan likes for the near future as impossible.<br>
     In December 1995,  the President changed for  7  people  the<br>
death penalty to 16 and 20-years  term  of  imprisonment  [9,13]. <br>
That  punishments are not in the acting Crime Code,  but they are <br>
discussed as the alternate punishment.  This  action  may  be  an <br>
examination of public opinion.<br>
     <br>
                 Death sentences are continuing<br>
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
     On January 26'96,  the death sentence to  former  member  of<br>
Special Police  Unit  J.Qadimov  for  the  attempt of coup d'etat <br>
began the  list  of sentenced in 1996 [24].  On February 12,  two <br>
more death sentences were passed to former Minister  of  National <br>
Security Nariman  Imranov  and former Deputy Minister of Defense, <br>
Talish nationalist leader Alakram  Hummatov.  All  of  them  were <br>
punished for the political crimes.<br>

     <br>
<i>&gt;Section 1</i><br>
<i>&gt;B. Disappearance</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Human Rights Center of Azerbaijan, a group connected to  the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Social Democratic Party, reports that...</i><br>
     <br>
HRCA is not affiliated or administrated by SDPA.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;Section 1</i><br>
<i>&gt;C. Torture and other cruel,  inhuman,  or degrading treatment or </i><br>
<i>&gt;punishment</i><br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;In general,  access to regular prisons for foreign officials  is </i><br>
<i>&gt;not a problem; however, access to those held in security prisons </i><br>
<i>&gt;is denied.</i><br>
     <br>
Here is  only  one security prison,  an Investigation Isolator of <br>
Ministry of National Security.  Other  investigation  prisons  as <br>
well as  Correcting  Work  Colonies  is  common  for  the  people <br>
sentenced for the political and non-political crimes.<br>
     <br>
ICRC and journalists could visit in 1995  only  Armenians,  women <br>
and the people suffering by tuberculosis.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;D. Arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile</i><br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;Various local  estimates  put  the  number  of   prisoners   and </i><br>
<i>&gt;detainees currently   under   arrest  on  politically  motivated </i><br>
<i>&gt;charges at 70 to 100.</i><br>
     <br>
Only after the attempt of coup d'etat in March 1995 were arrested <br>
for the treason of mother-land more than 500 people. Total number <br>
of imprisoneds for the political charges was in  1995  more  than <br>
800 people.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;Azerbaijan does not practice forced exile.</i><br>
     <br>
But tens  of people were forced to escape from Azerbaijan because <br>
of real danger for their freedom,  health,  and lives. There is a <br>
practice of  forced  extradition  of  such kind of emigrants.  At <br>
least 13 political opponents were  extradited  to  Azerbaijan  in <br>
1995: 4 people from Russia, 4 from Ukraine, 5 from Georgia.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;Section 2.</i><br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;D. Freedom of movement</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is  no  government  policy   of   discrimination   against </i><br>
<i>&gt;Armenians, who are free to travel.</i><br>
     <br>
Police always detains the  Armenians  who  try  to  escape  from <br>
Azerbaijan or  enter  to  it.  This  is  described  in the press, <br>
including the official one.<br>
     <br>
For example,<br>
* on  April  24, the  police detained in Baku Armenian woman Alya<br>
  Vanina-Kazarian who came from Russia;<br>
* in  May,  in Baku was detained Emil Paranian,  who lived in the<br>
  flat of his former wife;<br>
* in  late  June,  at  the border with Georgia,  in the train was<br>
  detained a resident of Baku,  Anahit Pashayeva who tried to  go <br>
  to Georgia;<br>
* in late July, at the Georgian border was detained a resident of<br>
  Ganja city, ethnic Armenian Maria Hasanova;<br>
* on December 26,  the ethnic Armenian woman, resident of Georgia<br>
  Sophia Safarova was detained by police.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;Section 5.</i><br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;The latter,  Turks  originally  from  the  Black  Sea  coast  of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Georgia, have  been  spread  throughout  Central  Asia  and  the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Caucasus, and want to return to their original motherland.</i><br>
     <br>
Meskhetian Turks  never  live at the Black Sea coast,  but in the <br>
Samtskhe-Javakheti region  close  to  the  Turkish  and  Armenian <br>
borders.<br>
