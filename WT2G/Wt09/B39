<center><h1>Annual Editions Education 96/97</h1></center>
<center><h2>To The Reader</h2></center>
<hr>
<img  Align=left SRC="../Images/AE96CoverLG.GIF">
Public concerns regarding the education of elementary and secondary students in the United States continue to center around certain key issues as Annual Editions:  Education 96/97 goes to press.  There have been important shifts in the attitudes of some major organizations toward public schooling in recent months.  The debate over whether all public monies should go to the public schools or whether public tax dollars for education should follow the student into either public or private schools has again intensified.  The "school'" choice debate is heating up even more.  "Charter schools" are anticipated for more public schools to enable them to attempt very innovative approaches to elementary and secondary curricula and instruction.  Citizens and teachers are very concerned over violence in the schools and the need for character education, as well as the teaching of methods of nonviolent conflict resolution to students.  People within and outside of the teaching profession are also concerned about what specific moral and cultural canons the public schools ought to champion.  Several new approaches to schooling are describe in this year's edition.  There is a great deal of experimental innovation going on in American elementary and secondary schools.  Debates regarding academic tracking of students and inclusion continue.  Interest in the quality of education is being voiced by many individuals and organizations as elementary and secondary schools strive for excellence.<br><br>

American communities are intensely interested in local school politics and school funding issues.  Not only the 27th Annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of public attitudes but other essays in this edition reflect these interests and concerns as well.  There continues to be healthy dialogue about and competition for the support of the various "publics" involved in public schooling.<br><br>

The essays reflect spirited criticism as well as spirited defense of our public schools.  There are competing, and very differing, school reform agendas being discussed, as has been the case for years now.  Democratic publics tend to debate and disagree on important issues affecting public institutions and resources.  All of this occurs as the United States continues to experience fundamentally important demographic shifts in its cultural makeup.  In 1993 the cultural composition of the United States indicated that 30 percent of all American school children were from cultural minority groups.  By the year 2000, it is estimated that 453 percent of the overall student body will be comprised of students from minority cultural backgrounds.  Minority student populations are growing at a much faster rate than traditional Caucasian populations.  Many scholars argue that the distinction between majority and minority school populations is being steadily eroded and will become meaningless by the year 2030.<br><br>

Dialogue and compromise are the order of the day.  The many interest groups within the educational field reflect a broad spectrum of viewpoints ranging from various behaviorist and cognitive developmental perspectives to humanistic ones.  The agendas and interests of students, parents, state/provincial governments, and the corporate world compose the many differing views on how people should learn.<br><br>

<center><b><a NAME="Article1">Education For Conflict Resolution</a></b>, <br>David A. Hamburg</center>
<blockquote>David A. Hamburg explores the question of whether human groups can achieve internal cohesion, self-respect, and adaptive effectiveness without promoting hatred and violence. He stresses the importance of strengthening research and education on child development, prejudice, ethnocentrism, and conflict resolution and maintains that the leaders of nations bear a heavy responsibility for promoting social tolerance.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article2">Will Schools Ever Get Better?</a></b>, <br></center>
<blockquote>An unexpected enrollment boom caused by immigration and higher-than-expected birthrates is resulting in a financial crunch for public schools.  In the past, public schools have spent vast sums without much visible improvement in student performance. In an effort to make schools more productive by making them more competitive, states are considering options such as voucher systems and charter schools.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article3">Full-Service Schools: Ideal As Reality</a></b>, <br></center>
<blockquote>Some schools offer an array of "add-on" social service programs.  The SUMA school in Manhattan and Hanshaw Middle School in Modesto are particularly outstanding models of service to their communities. Both were created "from scratch," with new principals and new facilities. Both are situated in poor neighborhoods with large ethnic and immigrant populations.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article4">Public School Lifts Kids Off New York's Mean Streets</a></b>, <br>Stephen Goode</center>
<blockquote>Pairing a curriculum that stresses general knowledge with students from one of the poorest neighborhoods in the Bronx, the Mohegan school has developed one of the best records for student success among New York public schools. The Core Knowledge curriculum stresses vocabulary and general knowledge. Critics claim that it is "Eurocentric," makes no allowances for individual differences, and encourages passivity. Principal Jeffrey Litt refutes these claims.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article5">America Skips School: Why We Talk So Much About Education And Do So Little</a></b>, <br>Benjamin R. Barber </center>
<blockquote>There have been numerous reports about the problems with our  educational system. Despite all the talk, little has happened to  improve the system. The reason is that Americans only pretend to  care about education and would rather find scapegoats than  solutions to problems. In the final analysis, giving up on  schools and children means giving up on democracy.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article6">The 27th Annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup Poll Of The Public's Attitude Toward The Public Schools</a></b>, <br>Stanley M. Elam And Lowell C. Rose</center>
<blockquote>The 1995 poll of the public's attitudes toward public schools features in-depth exploration of a number of significant national education issues.  Among these are the public's grading of schools, level of awareness of educational issues, public and nonpublic school choice, higher achievement standards for   students, inclusion of special education students in regular classrooms, violence in the schools, and ways of dealing with disruptive students.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article7">Shifting The Target Of Educational Reform</a></b>, <br>William E. Klingele</center>
<blockquote>The changing nature of the student is the source of the problem in American education today. Education must focus on students rather than teachers.  Factors that affect children's ability to succeed in school include use of alcohol and drugs by pregnant women, child abuse and neglect, poverty, and lack of adult supervision.  A total quality student focus requires new support from families, health care agencies, the media, business, and government.	</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article8">How Our Schools Could Be</a></b>, <br>Deborah Meier</center>
<blockquote>The only top-down reforms that are useful are those that help to create and sustain self-governing learning communities.  The Central Park East schools operate according to what we know about how human beings learn and are guided by a respect for all parties involved.  They do this by extending the principles of a good kindergarten to other grades.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wendy Kopp wants to revolutionize the teaching profession.

Rochelle L. Stanfield describes these efforts.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article11">Schools That Do More Than Teach</a></b>, <br>Maggie Mccomas</center>
<blockquote>Schools are increasingly called on to fill a comprehensive role in the development of productive adults.  In addition to providing instruction, they must help close the gaps left by the erosion of traditional family and social structures through a variety of school-based or school-related social services, especially health care.  Maggie McComas describes two full-service schools and discusses possible sources of funding for such programs.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article13">On Lasting School Reform: A Conversation With Ted Sizer</a></b>, <br>John O'neil</center>
<blockquote>Evidence shows that the school reforms initiated in the 1980s had little effect.  Ted Sizer sees this as unsurprising because too many reforms never questioned the basic assumptions about how schools are organized.  He suggests that the way schools run must be fundamentally reshaped.  In a conversation with John O'Neil, he discusses his views about effective school reform.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article14">Towards Excellence In Education</a></b>, <br>Chester E. Finn Jr.</center>
<blockquote>The central policy problem posed by the Department of Education is that it is not adaptable to changing educational needs.  Federal involvement in education should be wholly recast around today's needs rather than those of the 1960s, argues the author.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article15">Not All Standards Are Created Equal</a></b>, <br>Matthew Gandal</center>
<blockquote>School reform efforts have generally not paid off in terms of significant gains in student performance.  A promising new idea that has received national, bipartisan support is school reform based on rigorous standards for students.  The basic premise is that once rigorous standards and monitoring practices are in place, teachers and schools can be freed from traditionally  burdensome rules and given the flexibility to determine the best ways to help their students achieve.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article16">Wrong Problem, Wrong Solution</a></b>, <br>Kenneth R. Howe</center>
<blockquote>In response to the rigorous academic standards proposed by Matthew Gandal, Kenneth Howe suggests that while better standards can contribute to improving education, they are only a small piece of effective educational reform. He claims that the most pressing problem facing public education today is the need to provide a much larger, more diverse population with genuine opportunities to learn.</blockquote>

Diane Ravitch proposes means-tested scholarships that would give these children and their parents educational choices.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article18">Making America's Schools Work</a></b>, <br>Eric A. Hanushek</center>
<blockquote>Reforming schools does not require more money.  On the contrary, the cause of reform will best be advanced by holding overall real spending constant.  Schools must embrace the basic principles of economics.  In the long run, it may be appropriate to increase school spending.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article19">A Morally Defensible Mission For Schools In The 21st Century</a></b>, <br>Nel Noddings</center>
<blockquote>It is obvious that the main educational purpose of schools today is not the moral one of producing caring people but a relentless and hapless drive for academic adequacy.  Nel Noddings maintains that a reordering of priorities is essential and that the primary educational aim should be to encourage the growth of competent, caring, loving, and lovable people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Gertrude Himmelfarb compares the history of public moral values in Great Britain and the United States from the Victorian period to the present.  She identifies similarities and differences in British and American public moral concerns and provides in-depth comparative statistics in areas of moral concern, such as the crime rate and the illegitimacy rate.  She discusses the redefining of deviancy in modern society and the de-moralizing of social policy.</blockquote>

<center><b><a NAME="Article21">The Return Of Character Education</a></b>, <br>Thomas Lickona</center>
<blockquote>Throughout history, the goals of education have been to help people become smart and to help them become good.  In the twentieth century, such factors as personalism, pluralism, and the increasing secularization of the public arena led to a retreat from moral and character education.  As signs of moral trouble become more rampant, character education is making a comeback in American schools.  Educators now face the task of developing a comprehensive, holistic approach to character education.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is important to establish early with a new class the routines and associated rules that a teacher wants to use.  Once that is done, lessons simply become a string of known routines, where the behaviors of both students and teacher are common knowledge and appropriate behaviors are therefore automatically generated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The acceptance of cognitive psychology by educators has loosened the grip of behavioral psychology, which has dominated educational practice for much of this century.  The application of cognitive science to school learning will allow teachers to transform classrooms into vital, interesting places where children truly move from novice to expert practice in discipline-specific knowledge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Despite growing evidence that tracking is unfair and injurious, it remains a prominent organizational feature of most American high schools as well as junior high schools.  Successful detracking is tantamount to school restructuring. Viewed and handled as such, it offers much promise both for ending an inequitable arrangement and for improving educational practice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the past, challenges by conservative groups to the public schools were usually aimed at individual books.  Now they are more likely to focus on entire textbook series and school programs.  The most common complaint is that certain materials or activities promote anti-Christian or anti-American doctrine. If policymakers do not take a stand against these mounting attacks, Martha M. McCarthy warns, school restructuring efforts will be more difficult, if not impossible.</blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE>David A. Hamburg explores the question of whether human groups can achieve internal cohesion, self-respect, and adaptive effectiveness without promoting hatred and violence. He stresses the importance of strengthening research and education on child development, prejudice, ethnocentrism, and conflict resolution and maintains that the leaders of nations bear a heavy responsibility for promoting social tolerance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>An unexpected enrollment boom caused by immigration and higher-than-expected birthrates is resulting in a financial crunch for public schools.  In the past, public schools have spent vast sums without much visible improvement in student performance. In an effort to make schools more productive by making them more competitive, states are considering options such as voucher systems and charter schools.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The SUMA school in Manhattan and Hanshaw Middle School in Modesto are particularly outstanding models of service to their communities. Both were created "from scratch," with new principals and new facilities. Both are situated in poor neighborhoods with large ethnic and immigrant populations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The Core Knowledge curriculum stresses vocabulary and general knowledge. Critics claim that it is "Eurocentric," makes no allowances for individual differences, and encourages passivity. Principal Jeffrey Litt refutes these claims.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There have been numerous reports about the problems with our  educational system. Despite all the talk, little has happened to  improve the system. The reason is that Americans only pretend to  care about education and would rather find scapegoats than  solutions to problems. In the final analysis, giving up on  schools and children means giving up on democracy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The changing nature of the student is the source of the problem in American education today. Education must focus on students rather than teachers.  Factors that affect children's ability to succeed in school include use of alcohol and drugs by pregnant women, child abuse and neglect, poverty, and lack of adult supervision.  A total quality student focus requires new support from families, health care agencies, the media, business, and government.	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>School reform efforts have generally not paid off in terms of significant gains in student performance.  A promising new idea that has received national, bipartisan support is school reform based on rigorous standards for students.  The basic premise is that once rigorous standards and monitoring practices are in place, teachers and schools can be freed from traditionally  burdensome rules and given the flexibility to determine the best ways to help their students achieve.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In the twentieth century, such factors as personalism, pluralism, and the increasing secularization of the public arena led to a retreat from moral and character education.  As signs of moral trouble become more rampant, character education is making a comeback in American schools.  Educators now face the task of developing a comprehensive, holistic approach to character education.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Reflective practice goes beyond just thinking about one's teaching and opens doors to professional growth and collaboration that can contribute to teachers' having a clearer and more substantive role in reform, both locally and nationally.  Reflection involves searching for patterns in one's thinking about classroom practices and interrogating the reasons for labeling some lessons as successes or failures; it challenges one not to stop with thinking about the doing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the past, challenges by conservative groups to the public schools were usually aimed at individual books.  Now they are more likely to focus on entire textbook series and school programs.  The most common complaint is that certain materials or activities promote anti-Christian or anti-American doctrine. If policymakers do not take a stand against these mounting attacks, Martha M. McCarthy warns, school restructuring efforts will be more difficult, if not impossible.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<center><h2>To The Reader</h2></center>

Public concerns regarding the education of elementary and secondary students in the United States continue to center around certain key issues as Annual Editions:  Education 96/97 goes to press.  There have been important shifts in the attitudes of some major organizations toward public schooling in recent months.  The debate over whether all public monies should go to the public schools or whether public tax dollars for education should follow the student into either public or private schools has again intensified.  The "school'" choice debate is heating up even more.  "Charter schools" are anticipated for more public schools to enable them to attempt very innovative approaches to elementary and secondary curricula and instruction.  Citizens and teachers are very concerned over violence in the schools and the need for character education, as well as the teaching of methods of nonviolent conflict resolution to students.  People within and outside of the teaching profession are also concerned about what specific moral and cultural canons the public schools ought to champion.  Several new approaches to schooling are describe in this year's edition.  There is a great deal of experimental innovation going on in American elementary and secondary schools.  Debates regarding academic tracking of students and inclusion continue.  Interest in the quality of education is being voiced by many individuals and organizations as elementary and secondary schools strive for excellence.<br><br>

American communities are intensely interested in local school politics and school funding issues.  Not only the 27th Annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of public attitudes but other essays in this edition reflect these interests and concerns as well.  There continues to be healthy dialogue about and competition for the support of the various "publics" involved in public schooling.<br><br>

The essays reflect spirited criticism as well as spirited defense of our public schools.  There are competing, and very differing, school reform agendas being discussed, as has been the case for years now.  Democratic publics tend to debate and disagree on important issues affecting public institutions and resources.  All of this occurs as the United States continues to experience fundamentally important demographic shifts in its cultural makeup.  In 1993 the cultural composition of the United States indicated that 30 percent of all American school children were from cultural minority groups.  By the year 2000, it is estimated that 453 percent of the overall student body will be comprised of students from minority cultural backgrounds.  Minority student populations are growing at a much faster rate than traditional Caucasian populations.  Many scholars argue that the distinction between majority and minority school populations is being steadily eroded and will become meaningless by the year 2030.<br><br>

Dialogue and compromise are the order of the day.  The many interest groups within the educational field reflect a broad spectrum of viewpoints ranging from various behaviorist and cognitive developmental perspectives to humanistic ones.  The agendas and interests of students, parents, state/provincial governments, and the corporate world compose the many differing views on how people should learn.<br><br>

<H1><CENTER>Take the SecondSTEP!</CENTER></H1>
<HR>
<B>General Program Information</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have the opportunity to become a member of a special group of prospective secondary teachers at Miami University.  As a member of this group your curriculum will be different, hopefully more instructive and certainly innovative.  SecondSTEP, an acronym for Secondary Science Teacher Education Project, is a National Science Foundation funded grant to address the development of pedagogical content knowledge through experience and practice and the preparation of teachers competent and willing to teach in diverse cultural and ethnic settings.  The project also focuses on the collaboration of faculty from the College of Arts and Sciences, faculty in the School of Education and Allied Professions, and faculty from Cincinnati Public Schools, including Aiken High School for course development, instruction, and supervision of field experiences.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<B>The Academic Program </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to accomplish the objectives of SecondSTEP, a series of seminar classes and experiences have or are being developed.  These one-credit hour seminar courses are an opportunity for you to extend the already strong academic and professional program at Miami.  The plan is for the seminars to be accommodated within each certification program, approved as major requirements or as advised electives.  The capstone experience will be offered in both CAS and EDT to provide maximum flexibility and opportunity.  The tentative titles and course numbers of these courses are:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><UL TYPE="disc">
<LI> EDT 217,   Science, Research, and the Laboratory;
<LI> EDT 228,  The Contexts of Teaching; 
<LI> CAS 384,  Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Seminar
<LI> EDT 422, Capstone Experience in Science Education
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=-2><CENTER>NOTE: CAS represents a course listed in<BR>
 multiple departments in the College of Arts and Sciences</CENTER></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition, it is anticipated that the project will impact other professional education courses that are a part of secondary science education certification programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>  
<B>Program Benefits</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SecondSTEP offers a variety of specific benefits.  In addition to professional and content program requirements, participation in SecondSTEP provides you with sustained, intensive field experiences and credentials that will help you to be a highly competitive and attractive teaching prospect for the 21st century.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A personal letter will be added to your placement file certifying your participation in this program, outlining the unique experiences you have been afforded, and detailing the particular skills that you have acquired as a result.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Program Obligations</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In return for the unique professional education opportunities SecondSTEP offers, we will ask that you register for and participate in the additional seminars.  This means that you will have to be creative in building your semester course schedules.  However, you will have available additional assistance regarding scheduling and implementing a sequential plan of study.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Along with traditional measures of learning and understanding, you will be asked from time to time to complete questionnaires and evaluations that will provide information to gauge the effectiveness of SecondSTEP.  These questionnaires and evaluations will not affect any seminar or course grade and will be kept anonymous and confidential.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Questions</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Feel free to contact the project staff if you have any questions or concerns regarding SecondSTEP.  We are committed to insuring that you have a rewarding, enjoyable, and productive undergraduate experience at Miami and that you leave here fully prepared and confident to teach secondary science.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h1><center>An Instructional Dialogue</center></h1>
<center><font SIZE=-2>Adapted from Borich, G. D.  Observation Skills for Effective Teaching  . Merrill Publishing Company. 1990.</font></center>   
<hr>
<blockquote>The scene is a ninth-grade social studies classroom in which Ms. Koker, a first-year teacher, is just beginning a unit on forms of government.  It is the fall of the year, so the class is still somewhat new to her.  The first several weeks of school were  a  bit rough for Ms. Koker because she was somewhat unprepared for the aggressive talking out behavior of some of the boys and in the short amount of time devoted to some of her favorite topics in the curriculum guide.  Things have calmed down somewhat now  that she has decided to organize her class more tightly with drill and practice exercises and establish some classroom rules.  Ms. Koker's goals for this lesson are to introduce several types of government, and then begin to develop the concept of democracy.  Aside from a tendency to be a bit loud and talkative, this class is composed of students of mostly average intelligence, with a few who are bright and a few who are troublemakers.</blockquote>
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3>

<tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>Today we begin a unit on various forms of government.  In the next few days, we will study what the concepts of monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy mean, and how a government is formed using each of these three concepts.  In fact, we will cover these three forms of government so thoroughly that at the end of the week,  each of you will know how to create a government of your own using each of these--but, please don't start any revolutions with what you learn?  [Nobody laughs.]  Let's start by defining what a monarchy is.  Does anybody know?  [At this point, some class members turn to their neighbors to ask if they know the answer.]</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Please, no talking.  Bobby, do you know what a monarchy is? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Bobby:</td><td> No.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Betty, do you have any idea?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Betty:</td><td> No, I'm afraid I don't, Ms. Koker. </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Tim, you're not in your seat, so I'll have to ask you.  Do you know what a monarchy is?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Tim:</td><td> I didn't hear the question.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> I said, do you know what a monarchy is?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Tim:</td><td> Yep, it's a butterfly.  [Class bursts out in laughter.] </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Okay, that's an extra assignment for you tonight.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Tim:</td><td> [in protest]  But . . . </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Okay, I guess I have to tell you then.  A monarchy is a government that is ruled or governed by a single person, for example, a king or queen, is the supreme head of a state for his or her entire lifetime.  Now, what other names besides &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Queen&quot; do we have for individuals who serve as head of a country for a lifetime?  No talking out this time.  Let's go from left to right across the first row.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Mary:</td><td> I'm not sure what you mean, Ms. Koker. </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Next.  Ricky? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Ricky:</td><td> You mean, what do we call someone who is just like a king, but called something else? </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> You're on the right track.  Next.  Ann? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Ann:</td><td> Well, I would call a king, an emperor.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Tim:</td><td> [talking out] Yep, in Flash Gordon movies they called &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot; an emperor. </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Okay, that's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Tim.  You will answer two extra homework questions tonight if you don't want me to write up a detention slip.  [Class begins to talk in low voices to one another as teacher's focus turns exclusively to Tim.]  Now, go up and write your name on the board, so I won't forget to give you the assignment.  [By now, talking has grown louder and a few students have left their seats waiting for Tim to return from the board.]  Okay, okay.  [In loud voice] Let's get back to business, unless some others would like to put their name on the board.  [Class quiets down.] Let me remind some of you that absolutely no one leaves their seat without permission in my class.  Let's see now, where were we? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Student:</td><td> [from somewhere in back of room] We were talking about emperors.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Yes.  Emperors, like kings, usually indicate a monarchy--or rule by a single person over a long time.  Other names for heads of sta e that indicate a monarchy are czar, which was a title once used in Russia; kaiser, which was a term used in the early German empire; and sultan, which is a word still used today in the Middle East.  These individuals, like kings and emperors throughout history, have often had absolute power over the people and lands they ruled.  Traditionally, these rulers gained their power from the family they were born into, and not from any accomplishments of their own.  In some cases today, a type of monarchy exists  alongside some other form of government.  Can anyone think of a country like our own that has a king or a queen?  Let's go across the second row this time.  Patrick? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Patrick:</td><td> Maybe Canada.  They have the Royal Mounted Police.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> No.  Next.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Sue:</td><td> England.  They have a queen and royal weddings and that kind of stuff that we don't have in this country.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Good, Sue.  Some present day monarchs, like the Queen of England, still exist.  However, in England the queen possesses only minor authority and exists for mostly symbolic purposes, or as a way of showing a country's historical roots.  Although kings and queens did at one time have absolute authority over England, today they serve mostly ceremonial functions.  That was a good response, Sue.  Now , before we move to another form of government, called an oligarchy, does everyone understand what a monarchy is?  [No one responds.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Okay, I guess we can go on.  Let's see, where did we leave off in the second row?  [Tricia meekly raises her hand.]  Can you tell us what an oligarchy is, Tricia?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Tricia:</td><td> I don't believe so. </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Next.  Ray?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Ray:</td><td> Don't know.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Well, I guess I'll have to tell you--but it's in the chapter, which you all should have read.  An oligarchy is a form of government in which, instead of a single rule as in a monarchy, absolute power or authority is given to a few persons.  These  individuals usually come to power, not through heredity or being born into the right families, but through some political power struggle  or compromise agreement.  Oligarchies sometimes are the result of the political power amassed by a few individuals after a military victory over another country--as when the leaders of the army take charge and share authority among themselves.  As a result of the revolutionary or violent ways in which some oligarchies have come into existence, they are sometimes associated with a government that is under the control of a small number of persons who are intent on serving their own interests, to the exclusion of the welfare of the people.  Oligarchies, which were common in ancient times, are hard to find today, but some governments, almost like an oligarchy, still do exist.  Can anyone think of one?  Jeff, Kathy, you're the last two in the second row.  Any i deas? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Jeff:</td><td> I'm not sure, but is it like a mother and father in a family. </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> What do you mean?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Jeff:</td><td> Well, my parents have a kind of agreement--not written or anything like that--in which my mother is responsible for taking care of the house and my  brothers and sisters, while my father is responsible for his job and doing repairs.  That's a kind of sharing of responsibility, isn't it?</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Yes, maybe.  But it's not what we're talking about here.  Kathy?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Kathy:</td><td> I can't think of any examples.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Well, you probably never heard of the Peloponnesian Wars, but shortly after one of these, in about 400 B.C., ancient Greece was ruled for a brief time by a group of persons called the Thirty Tyrants.  This may have been the very first oligarchy.  A lso, if you've ever heard of a country called Yugoslavia, you might know that power and authority is divided among individuals representing each of the states or regions of that country.  So you see, oligarchies in some form still exist.  Now, let's compare the two forms of government we have been discussing-monarchy and oligarchy--with our own form of government.  First, let's remind ourselves of what our form of government is called.  Let's pick up with the first person in the third row, Peter?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Peter:</td><td> [No answer.]</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Peter, I called on you.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Peter:</td><td> I'm not ready yet. </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Everyone should be ready when I call on them.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Peter:</td><td> Well, I didn't get to read this yet.  [Class begins to snicker at Peter getting in trouble.]</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Okay, from now on I'm going to make the rule that everyone must read the assignment before we begin a topic.  That means that the reading for the entire week must be done by class on Monday.  Does everyone understand that?  [Loud moans are heard.]</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td><tr valign=top><td> Tim:</td><td> [speaking without acknowledgment]  But that means we'd have homework over the weekend and no other teacher makes us do that.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> I'm not concerned with what other teachers do.  Now let's get down to work.  We still have one more form of government to discuss.  Joan is next.  [Class becomes noisy and restless at the thought of weekend homework.]</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Joan:</td><td> I guess you want me to say we live in a democracy.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Yes, I do.  What else can you tell us about a democracy?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Joan:</td><td> Well, I'm not too sure.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> You're living in one, aren't you?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Tim:</td><td> [calling out]  Not in this class.  [Class laughs.]</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Okay, that will be one day in detention for Tim for . . . . [Just as she is finishing, the public address system clicks on.]</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Principal:</td><td>  [on P.A.]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but two lunch time jobs are still available for any students who want to be paid for working in the cafeteria during the second half of their lunch.  We need some workers for today so, teachers, if anyone is interested, please write them a hall pert and send them to the office immediately.  Thank you.  [Bobby and Tim raise their hands, indicating their interest in the job.  The teacher ignores Tim and writes a pass to the office for Bobby.  Noise picks up as the class waits for the teacher to start up  again.]</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Okay, we were discussing democracy.  Time is short, so take out paper and pen and write down everything I say.  Another rule we will start tomorrow, since you're not doing the reading, is to take notes on everything I say.  The word democracy comes from the Greek word demus, which means &quot;the people,&quot; and the Greek word kratein, spelled K-R-A-T-E-I-N, which means &quot;to rule.&quot;</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Student:</td><td> [calling out]  How is that first word spelled?</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Whoever, [then, responds by spelling the word.]  D-E-M-U-S.  So, who's next to be called on?  [Rhonda raises her hand.]  Okay, Rhonda, putting these two words together, what does the word democracy mean? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Rhonda:</td><td> It means that the people rule</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Good.  And who are the people in a democracy?  Next.  Flo? </td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Flo:</td><td> I guess it's all of us--everyone that lives in a certain place.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Okay, a democracy differs from a monarchy and an oligarchy by who is given the authority to rule.  As we have seen, in a monarchy, a single person, usually through heredity, is given absolute authority, and in the case of an oligarchy, a small number of persons, representing only a fraction of all the people in the land, are given the authority to rule.  In a democracy, however, authority to rule rests in the hands of all the people.  But how could such a system work when everyone has authority over everyone else.  Next person.  Diana?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Diana:</td><td> We--or I should I say--all the people elect persons to represent us.  I guess that's what our senators and representatives do.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> So when we say that all the people have the authority to rule in a democracy, we really mean . . . .Next.  That's you, Phil.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td>Phil:</td><td> We elect persons--like Diana said--representatives and senators and we give them the authority to rule.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Yes.  So in a democracy like ours, the people have authority, but indirectly, through the election of individuals that represent their interests.  This, of course, is much more orderly than having a country where every individual is king or queen.  It's much more representative than a country ruled by only a small number of individuals whose self-interests may be promoted at the expense of everyone else's.  In our form of democracy, called representative democracy, a legislature composed of senators and representatives is elected by the people, and so is a president.  Does anyone know of any other kind of democracy?  Mark, you're next.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td><tr valign=top><td> Mark:</td><td> Nope.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Well, if you had read the book, you would have learned about another form of democracy, called parliamentary democracy.  A parliamentary democracy is much like our own except that the president--or head of state, as it is called-is appointed by a  body of lawmakers called a parliament, which is elected.  Now, Mark, tell me the difference between our own form of democracy and a parliamentary democracy.</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td><tr valign=top><td> Mark:</td><td> It's not my turn. </td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td> Did you take notes?</td></tr>
  <br>
<tr valign=top><td><tr valign=top><td> Mark:</td><td> I was going to finish them tonight.</td></tr>
  <br>
 <tr valign=top><td>Teacher:</td><td>  Okay, the new rule is that notes must be completed in class.  To be sure you do, I will check notes at the end of every class.  Since some of you have not read the assignment, we will use the remaining time to read Chapter 7.  Write down all the  important points in the chapter in your notebook for homework.  I will check your notebooks tomorrow and, then, with all of us caught up, we can continue our discussion.</td></tr>

VIRTUAL EMAIL do for me?</I></H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">An ACELINK Virtual Email account can take an email address
like <B>johnname.mr.chips.the.teacher@myuniversity.edu</B> and allow you to
turn it into <B>jname@acelink.com</B>. </FONT></P>
<P>An<B> ACELINK Virtual Email account</B>   is valid for life as long as you
maintain your annual dues..By using an<B> ACELINK Virtual Email account</B> you
can then put it on your business card,  in your .sig file, or on your corporate 
letterhead, because it nevers changes. Its yours for life! When your  actual
address at your ISP changes, just notify us. We then forward all your mail to
your new actual email address.</P>
<P>

<HR>
<P>Are you a candidate for an<B> ACELINK Virtual Email account</B><BR>Below
is a sample listing of people who may benefit from such an account.</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>If your email address is long or hard to remember (ie
johnname.mr.chips.the.teacher@myuniversity.edu)   You can choose a short easy to
remember address of  your own  Maybe mr.chips@acelink.com</LI>
<LI> Maybe your address is a string of numbers as on Compuserve or one of the
other ISP's, you can choose your actual name instead. of
789543,9809@compuserve.com you could choose johnd@acelink.com or
s.felding@acelink.com. Maybe even your company name mycompany@acelink.com, this
would give clients the illusion that you actually are on the internet</LI>
<LI> Do you switch ISPs frequently, or maybe have accounts at work on
Compuserve, at home on AOl or Prodigy and can't decide which email address to
give out.  An <B> ACELINK Virtual Email account</B> would alow you to give out
one eamil address that will never change, unless you change it.</LI></UL>
<HR>
<H2>HOW DO I GET AN <B> ACELINK Virtual Email account</B></H2>
<P>You can  register for your <B> ACELINK Virtual Email account</B> on line

<H2>RETIREMENT PLANNING</H2>
<P> November 1996
<BR><B>Improvement to Consumer Protection</B><BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">  F</FONT></B>ollowing
extensive discussions within the life and health insurance industry, the
Canadian Life and Health Insurance Compensation Corporation's (CompCorp)
member-insurers agreed  that the current CompCorp compensation rules should be
simplified. As a result, CompCorp proposed amendments to the coverage it offers.<B>They
affect primarily Group Retirement Plans.</B>These changes have been approved by
the Board of Directors of CompCorp on September 20, 1996, and will become
effective on January 1, 1997.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to remind the reader that it is CompCorp and not the
member-insurers who decides whether specific contributions and policies are
covered in particular situations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A Group Retirement Plan refers to any type of group
retirement arrangement (registered or not), including without limitation, a
group pension plan, a group RRSP and a deferred profit  sharing plan (DPSP).</I></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These changes expand and clarify the coverage afforded to
Group Retirement Plans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below, we present the highlights of the changes.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Change in Scope of Coverage</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The $60,000 coverage limit applicable to monies deposited
into guaranteed funds (i.e., funds held in the general assets of an insurer) 
now applies <I>separately </I>to each of the following types of policies:</P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="0" ALIGN="CENTER">
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>Registered individual policies</LI>
<LI>Registered group policies</LI>
<LI>Non-registered individual policies</LI>
<LI>Non-registered group policies</LI></UL></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the maximum coverage available under all types of
policies combined is $240,000 (i.e., $60,000 x 4).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previously, the $60,000 coverage limit applied to guaranteed
funds held under all registered policies and non-registered policies, as two
separate types of policies. Therefore, the maximum coverage was $120,000 (i.e.,
$60,000 x 2).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, all <A HREF="#definition">defined benefit
plans</A>  are now eligible for coverage. In the past, aside for individual
pension plans (IPPs), few defined benefit plans were eligible for coverage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The coverage applies to all group retirement plans combined
with the same insurer having the same plan sponsor, whether they are defined
benefit or defined contribution pension plans, RRSPs or DPSPs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pooled fund policies (i.e., funds segregated from the
general assets of an insurer) that provide no guarantee on death or maturity are
not protected by CompCorp.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To illustrate the recently adopted changes, the table
appearing below compares the CompCorp coverage before and after January 1,1997. 
In this example, a plan sponsor has a defined contribution registered pension
plan (RPP) and a group RRSP with the same insurer. One of the plan members has
$48,000 accumulated in the RPP, $18,000 in the Group RRSP, $20,000 in an
individual RRSP and $15,000 in a non-registered guaranteed term deposit
investment with the same insurer.</P>

<HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER" NOSHADE="NOSHADE"></PRE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>How Does Coverage Apply?</B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>1. Defined Contribution (DC) Plans</B><BR>A &quot;defined
contribution plan&quot; is defined as a retirement plan in which each member's
entitlement to benefits is based on specified contributions to that plan, and
the income thereon, that are allocated among, and credited to, each member on an
individual basis</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, a DC plan could be one where member
contributions are 2% of the salary and the employer contributions are also 2% of
the salary. All these contributions earn investment income. Upon retirement, the
accumulated value of these contributions is used to purchase a pension payable
for life or a life income fund.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For DC plans including third party administered DC plans (as
long as periodic investment allocation listings per member are supplied to the
insurer), CompCorp covers guaranteed funds up to a maximum of <TT>$60,000 </TT>per
member.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Third party administered DC plans refer to DC plans under
which retirement funds are invested with any number of financial institutions
and member investment records are maintained by an outside administrator.</P>
<P><A NAME="definition"></A><B>2. Defined Benefit (DB) Plans
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A &quot;defined benefit plan&quot; is defined as a
retirement plan in which each member's entitlement to benefits is based on a
formula, usually related to years of service and earnings, or a fixed dollar
amount. For greater certainty, it excludes any combination or hybrid plan and
any defined contribution plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, a DB plan could be one where member
contributions are 5% of the salary. The pension promised at retirement is 2% of
the member's salary for each year of service. Alternatively, the pension
promised at retirement may be 40% of the member's contributions. The employer
contribution is equal to the difference between the cost of the promised pension
and the amount of contributions the member has paid.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Employer contributions </I>to a DB plan, going into a
guaranteed fund of an insurer, are now eligible for coverage by CompCorp up to a
maximum of<TT>$60,000.</TT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Employee contributions </I>to a DB plan are treated in
the same manner and subject to the same rules as a DC plan, i.e., eligible for
coverage up to a maximum of <TT>$60,000 </TT>per member.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3. Combination or Hybrid (Combo) Plans</B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A &quot;combination or hybrid pension plan&quot; is
generally a mixture of a DB pension plan and a DC pension plan. More
specifically, it is defined as a retirement plan in which each member's
entitlement to benefits is determined by reference to::</P>
<UL>
<LI>a) a formula usually related to years of service and earnings, or a fixed
dollar amount, <I>and</I></LI>
<LI>b) specified contributions to that plan, and the income thereon, that are
allocated among, and credited to each member on an individual account basis,</LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">including without limitation, plans in which the benefits
are the greater of, or are calculated as the sum of a) and b).</P>
<P><BR> Examples of Combo plans are:
</P>
<OL>
<LI> A promised pension at retirement of 1% of the salary for each year of
service totally paid for by the employer, plus member contributions of 2% of the
salary. Member contributions earn investment income and at retirement, the
accumulated value of member contributions is used to purchase a pension payable
for life or a life income fund in addition to the pension promise already
provided for by the employer.</LI>
<LI>A pension plan where the member contributions are 2% of the salary and the
employer contributions are also 2% of the salary. All these contributions earn
investment income. Upon retirement, the accumulated value of contributions is
used to purchase a pension payable for life or a life income fund. However, the
employer guarantees that the pension provided, by the accumulated value of
contributions, will not be less than 1.5% of  the salary for each year of
service.</LI></OL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Combo plans are eligible for coverage similarly to DB plans.
However, allocated contributions to individual member accounts are eligible for
coverage by CompCorp as DC plans.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Summary of Coverage
</B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The maximum coverage applicable to group retirement plans
can be summarized as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>$60,000 for all <I>member allocated </I>employee and employer
contributions invested in guaranteed funds under all DC, DB and Combo plans 
combined, with the same insurer having the same plan sponsor.</LI>
<LI>$60,000 for all <I>non-allocated </I>employer contributions invested in
guaranteed funds under all DB and Combo plans combined, with the same insurer
having the same plan sponsor.</LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The $60,000 coverage limit stated above applies<I>separately
</I>to both registered and non-registered group policies, as two separate
classes of policies.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Record Keeping Considerations</B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order for CompCorp to determine if contributions
deposited with an insurer are covered, it is necessary to determine the type of
plan involved and whether there are employee contributions or not. For this
purpose, insurers will seek to obtain a copy of the plan document or some other
credible evidence of the plan type.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we have mentioned, employee contributions to a DB plan as
well as employee contributions to the DB component of a Combo plan are treated
in the same manner and subject to the same rules as those made into a DC plan,
i.e., eligible for coverage by CompCorp. Accordingly, plan sponsors are
encouraged to submit annually to their insurer, within six months of the
retirement plan year end, a contribution breakdown as well as a list of
guaranteed investments allocated per member.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For DC and Combo plans using full service group retirement
plan policies, the insurer usually maintains appropriate records for CompCorp
coverage purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plan sponsors of third party administered DC plans are
encouraged to provide their insurer, each year within six months of the
retirement plan year end, with a list of investment allocation per member with
respect to guaranteed investments. Where no breakdown between guaranteed and
variable funds is available or where more than one carrier is involved, insurers
should be provided with a list of total plan assets allocated to each member.
CompCorp's protection will apply on a pro-rata basis of each insurer's
guaranteed funds to the total funds held under the plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an example, assume that a Registered Pension Plan has
$750,000 in total assets. One insurer holds $500,000 in guaranteed funds; the
balance is held by another insurer. A particular member has $25,000 in his
pension plan account. In this case, the CompCorp coverage is calculated as
follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">($500,000/$750,000) x $25,000 = $16,666.67.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the unlikely event of the wind-up of a member insurer,
plan sponsors (including third party administrators) will have 60 days to update
the investment membership records from the date of the wind-up order of the
member-insurer. For plans that did not, at least, submit investment membership
records within the 12 month period preceding the issuance of the wind-up order,
the coverage will be limited to $60,000 per plan with no individual member
coverage  provided.</P>

<H2>Personal Income Tax Rate Cut</H2>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>On    January 1, the second stage of the personal income tax  rate cut
announced in the 1996 Budget came into effect  Fully half of the promised  30
per cent personal income tax rate cut has been delivered, as promised This will 
mark the second time in six months that Ontario taxpayers will see an increase
in their lake-home pay<BR><BR>
</LI>
<LI>Since the first phase of the tax cat in July of 1996,  67% of the jobs 
created in Canada have been created in Ontario.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>When the Ontario government has fully implemented the tax cut in three
years:
<UL>
<LI>91% of all taxpayers will see a 30% reduction in their provincial tax rates</LI>
<LI>All taxpayers with in comes of $60,000 or less will see their Ontario tax
raates  fall by 30% or more
</LI>
<LI>64% of the benefits from this tax cut will be concentrated on middle-income
    Ontarians earning between $25,000 and $75.000 a year</LI>
<LI>The top marginal rate in Ontario will  be reduced to 49.6 cents for every
dollar     earned, the third lowest in Canada
</LI></UL>

<H3> Cutting the Emplyer Health payroll Tax (EDT)</H3>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>As of January 1, the Ontario government has cut the Employer Health payroll
Tax for all private sector employers</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Payroll taxes kill jobs The government is committed to making the first
$400,000 of payroll for private sector employers exempt from the EHT.  This tax
cut will be phased in over three years:
<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
<LI> - $200,000 exemption effective january 1, 1997</LI>
<LI> - $300,000 exemption effective January 1, 1998</LI>

<LI> Small businesses create most of the new jobs in our economy, yet they
faced the     highest on-going marginal EHT rates when hiring new employees This
discouraged hiring in     the sector where most new job growth occurs.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI> After January 1, 1999, fully 88% Of all private sector employers will no

<LI>The over-contribution limit was reduced from $8,000 to $2,000.
Over-contributions as at February 26, 1995 do not have to be withdrawn from the
R.R.S.P., instead they can be used as deductible contributions ( upto the
allowed contribution room) each year until the amount of over-contribution in
the R.R.S.P. is reduced to $2,000. The individual will then be able to resume
normal contributions to the R.R.S.P.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The limits on contributions to  a Defined Contribution Registered Pension
Plan will remain at the 1996 level of $13,500 through to the year 2002.  As of
2003 the limit will increase to $14,500 and to $15,500 in the year 2004.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The contribution limit on contribution to Deferred Profit Sharing Plans
will remain at one half the contribution for Defined Contribution Registered
Pansion Plans.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The  contribution limit for Defined Benefit Registered Pension Plans will
remain at $1,722 per year of service through 2004<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The budget also proposes to eliminate the tax deduction for R.R.S.P. and
R.P.P. fees which are paid outside of the plan. This will apply to any fees paid
after March 6, 1996.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The budget also proposes to do away with the 7 year limit on the
carry-forward of unused RRSP contribution room accumulated since 1991.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>The budget also proposes to reduce the upper age limit for contributing to
Registered Pension Plans and Registered Retirement Savings Plans from age 71 to
age 69. Individuals will have to transfer monies in registered plams to a
R.R.I.F. or begin to receive pensions from these plans by the end of the year in
which they become 69. Under these proposed rules, individuals aged 70 or more at
the end of 1996 will not be affected, however individuals turning 69 during 1996
must wrap up their plan by the end of 1997. Individuals aged 68 or younger at
the end of 1996 are subject to the new rules..<BR>

<H2>Generic Drug Substitution:</H2>
Generic Drug Substitution is the substitution of a generic drug in place of a brand name drug (where a generic exists). Under <B>Ontario Bill 55</B> a pharmacist must dispense the lowest priced generic equivalent drug.  However, if the doctor indicates <E>"no substitutions"</E> or the patient requests a particular brand then the drug will be dispensed as requested.<BR>
The look  and color of a generic  medication may be different to the brand name, but your doctor or your pharmacist will assure you that the generic is the exact same drug  and provides the same therapeutic benefits. <BR>
<EM><B>Generic dugs cost less and save you money.. Ask for them whenever you have a prescription filled. You'll be surprised  as to how much money you can save yourself and / or  your Drug Plan.</B></EM

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Changes in Fee Payments to Ontario Practioners!</B></FONT><BR>
Chiropractor and Podiatrist fees are covered expenses under most group health plans. These expenses are payable by a group health plan after the Ontario Provincial plan annual maximum has been paid by the Province. Currently under <EM>Section 14 of the Ontario Health Insurance Act </EM> coverage for Chiropractor, Podiatrist or Osteopath services are not allowed until the annual maximum under the O.H.I.P. has been paid.<P>
<LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Effective August 1, 1996</B></FONT> the Ontario Ministry Of Health is planning to put into place a new regulation exempting Chiropractors,and Podiatrist from <EM>Section 14 of the Ontario Health Insurance Act </EM>. This new regulation will impact Group health plans that cover expenses for Chiropractors & Podiatrists. With the new regulation service fees will be payable starting with the first visit. This means expenses in excess of the Provincial plan per visit limit would be payable by a Group Health Plan.
<P>
<LI><H4>Changes to the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan (ODB)</H4>
<UL>
<LI><EM>ODB Dispensing Fee</EM><BR>
The maximum dispensing fee under the ODB plan is currrently $6.11 In the past, this fee    has been a result of negotiation between the Provincial Government and the Ontario   Pharmacists Association. Unber Bill 26 the government will set the maximum dispensing fee through regulation. This change is expected to come into effect around June 1, 1996.
<LI><EM>Drug Pricing Changes</EM><BR>
At the present time, the maximum a pharmacy can charge for drugs that are included in the ODB formulary is Best Available Price*{BAP} plus a markup of 10 to 20%. This maximum charge applies to drugs that are dispensed to both the general public and ODB benefit recipients. There are no regulatory restrictions on the price charged for drugs NOT INCLUDED in the ODB formulary.
<FONT SIZE="-1">(BAP) is the lowest price at which a particular dosage and strength of a drug can be purchased in Canada.</FONT><BR>
Under <B>Bill 26</B> 
<UL>
<LI>- The price of the drug and the mark-up will still be subject to regulation, but only for ODB plan recipients. The term BAP will be replaced with <EM>Drug Benefit Price</EM> nad the Government will negotiate this price wiith the drug manufacturer directly.
<LI>- The Government will no longer regulate the mark-up or price of drugs charged to the general public including drugs included in the ODB formulary.
<LI>-The mark-up on drugs will no longer be restricted to between 10 to 20% but will be set by regulation. For now the mark-up will be set at 10%
</UL>
These changes are expected to come into effect around June 1, 1996.
<P>
<LI><EM>Ontario Drug Benefit Deductible</EM><BR>
Under Bill 26, effective June 1, 1996 ODB recipients will be required to pay a deductible when receiving drugs under the Plan. The deductible will be as follows:

$2 for each prescription. This will apply to single seniors earning less than $16,000 a year and to senior couples earning less than $24, 000 a year, and also to residents of nursing homes and home care recipients.
<LI>All Other Seniors<BR>
The first $100 in prescription cost per person per year. After this the Ontario Drug Benfit Plan dispensing fee for each prescription filled during the year. Currently this is $6.11.
<LI> All other ODB Recipients.<BR>
$2 for each prescription.
</UL>
</UL
<P>
In our opinion the deregulation of drug prices in Ontario may lead to an increase in drug costs for the general public. Ultimately private and group health insurance plans will end up bearing these costs, which in turn are passed on to employees through increased premiums or benefit cut-backs. Now is a good time to have one of our Health Insurance Specialist <A HREF="ac01002.html" ><B> contact you or your plan sponsor</B> </A> to discuss ways to lessen the impact of some of the changes proposed by <B>Bill 26</B>.
<P>
The preceding information is for reference only and should not be used  without checking its accuracy with the Ministry of Health for your  Province.

<H2>BILL 33 AS PASSED INTO LAW</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../tiedye.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>Quebec's Bill 33 proposing a universal drug plan was passed into law on June
19th.  It included major amendments to the initial version that has been tabled
May 15th in the national Assembly.</P>
<P>The key provisions of the law as adopted are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> A mandatory basic drug plan for all Quebec residents.
</LI>
<LI> The government, through the RAMQ (Regie d'assurance maladie du Quebec),
will offer basic plan coverage to those age 65+, welfare recipients and all
individuals not eligible for group plan coverage, including their dependents.
</LI>
<LI> The RAMQ plan parameters for seniors aged 65 and over who do not receive a
guaranteed income supplement are:
</LI></UL>
<P>Premium:     $175/adult</P>
<P>Quarterly deductible:    $25</P>
<P>Coinsurance:     25%</P>
<P>Quarterly maximum user fees:  $187.50</P>
<P>Recipients of welfare and guaranteed income supplement will have the same
deductible and coinsurance but will see their premiums vary from $0 to $175 and
their quarterly maximum user fees reduced to $50 or $125 depending on their
annual revenues.  Children of RAMQ insured have completely free drug coverage: 
no premiums and no user fees.</P>
<P>&#183; Group drug coverage offered by the private sector must meet certain
minimum requirements of the basic general plan.  These are:</P>
<P>-   All drugs that are listed and periodically reviewed by the government
(on the recommendation of the Pharmacology committee) must be covered.</P>
<UL>
<LI>   The maximum coinsurance for the listed drugs is fixed at 25%.
</LI>
<LI>   The originally planned limitations on annual deductibles have been
lifted.  However, total annual user fees for the listed drugs (deductible and
coinsurance) have to be capped at a maximum of $750 per adult.
</LI>
<LI>   The originally planned exclusion of any form of user fees for children
has also been lifted.  NOTE:  These user fees have to be accounted for within
the $750 annual limit of the insured adult.
</LI>
<LI>   Coverage of unlisted drugs is not subject to any form of constraints in
terms of deductible, coinsurance and maximum user fees.
</LI></UL>
<P>&#183; Private insurers may not offer the same basic individual drug
coverage as RAMQ.  However, they may offer complementary individual plans.</P>
<UL>
<LI> All employees and their dependents eligible for group coverage must enroll
in their group plan, unless they can prove they are covered by another group
plan.  Insurers cannot exclude any eligible group member or dependent from a
plan due to age or health status.
</LI>
<LI> The law states that any insurer and employer offering accident, disability
or health coverage must also offer basic drug coverage.
</LI>
<LI> Residents over age 65 who are eligible for coverage in a private drug plan
(i.e., a retiree plan) and choose to enroll in that plan, are free to do so. 
The group plan must accept them.
</LI>
<LI> There are no regulatory provisions regarding group pricing of risk
premiums or administrative services in the private sector.  The premium
divisibility requirement between basic plan coverage and complementary coverage
has been dropped.
</LI>
<LI> All insurers must agree on high risk pooling practices between themselves
before November 1st, or the government will intervene to regulate them.
</LI></UL>
<P>Some uncertainties on the implications of certain provisions of the law
remain.  We anticipate that these will only be clarified when regulations
related to Bill 33 are adopted, at the end of the summer.  One of the most
discussed uncertainties is the group eligibility requirement for temporary and
part-time workers, if it is to be regulated.</P>

COLOR="#800000">Click on graph for a larger image</FONT><BR><I><B>Being
prepared can help you see beyond temporary dips in mutual fund values</B></I></P>
<P><B>The low-interest-rate environment of the 1990's has spawned a new breed
of investor--hungry for higher returns and looking for them in the mutual funds.</B><BR><B>As
yields on interest-earnings securities declined over the past several years,
investors turned in droves to mutual funds.  Based on figures compiled by the
Investment Funds Institute of Canada, investment in mutual funds exploded to
almost $1.50 billion at the end of 1995 from $34 billion in 1990.</B><BR><B>It's
true that mutual funds have potential for higher growth.  But if you're new to
the game, brace yourself: Unlike Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) and
Canada Savings Bonds (CSBs), the value of your mutual fund investment is not
guaranteed.</B><BR><B>Sooner or later, most mutual funds will experience a
temporary downturn in unit value.</B></P>
<H3><B>Risk vs. reward</B></H3>
<P><B>Your first step is to acknowledge the relationship between risk and
reward.  Highly secure investments, like money market funds, are reliable, but
the returns are tied to current interest rates.  If you're looking for better
performance, you'll have to accept more risk by investing n bond and equity
funds.  While bonds and equities are more volatile, over the long term, they
provide superior returns.</B></P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Successful</B><B> fund strategies</B></FONT></I></P>
<P><B>Here are some guidelines to help you weather the inevitable market
downturns.</B></P>
<P><B><I>Know how your investments behave.</I></B> <B> Knowing the potential
volatility of your funds--that is, how much they fluctuate in value in the
shorter term--will help you maintain your perspective during a performance
crunch.</B><BR><B>Look at the fund's average annual compound return over five
years or more.  This figure will help you compare returns of different mutual
funds.  Then, check the year-over-year returns to give you an idea of
volatility.</B><BR><B>In addition, always read the fund's prospectus for
information.  It will outline the fund manager's investment style and clearly
identify the potential risks involved.</B><BR><B>Assess the amount of risk you
are comfortable with.  If you cannot bear the thought of your hard--earned cash
going into an investment that might go down in value--even it is means you could
make a substantial profit over the long term--stick with guaranteed or low-risk
investments like money market funds, GIC's or CSB's.</B><BR><B>If the prospect
or market fluctuation doesn't alarm you, and you're patient, consider devoting
part of your portfolio to investments that are geared for growth.  Know yourself
and know what your's getting into.  Your financial advisor can help.</B></P>
<P><B><I>Diversify your investments.</I></B>  <B>Spreading the risk means
picking a variety of investment types.</B><BR><B>Even if you have a high risk
tolerance, for example, it's not wise to place all your money in aggressive
investments.  Holding a variety helps to protect your portfolio from declines. 
While one type of fund declines, other funds could be growing.</B><BR><B>Getting
professional advise to tailor a diversification plan for you is  a good
investment.</B></P>
<P><B><I>Take a long-term approach.</I></B>  <B>The longer your time frames,
the better chance you give your investments to perform to their potential.  As
noted above, equity mutual funds have historically earned more than
interest-paying securities.  However, over short periods, they are usually more
volatile.  The key to success for these funds is to focus on the long term.</B></P>
<P><B><I>Don't panic</I></B>.  <B>Don't sell just because your unit values
decline.  As the example below shows, chances are that the unit value will turn
up again.  If you bail out at the bottom, you're locking in losses, and missing
out on potential future profits.</B></P>
<P><B><I>Don't jump from fund to fund.</I></B>  <B>Many investors are
prompted to change their portfolio on the basis of unusually strong one-year
returns in another fund or another type of investment.  Last year's winner isn't
necessarily going to be next year's top performer.  If you're always chasing
last year's winner, you'll always be a year behind.  Instead, focus on
high-qualify funds whose objectives match your own.</B><BR><B>Before you
invest your money in mutual funds, do your research, and consult a financial
advisor.  Be prepared to enjoy the market uptrends, and to wait out the

<HR>
<H2>KEYS TO INVESTING<BR>Our simplified guide to basic principles, and how you
can benefit<BR>Dollar-cost averaging</H2>
<P><B>No doubt you've seen the term &quot;dollar-cost averaging&quot; or &quot;dollar-averaging&quot;
bandied about in the popular press.  Banks, trust companies, and mutual fund
organizations like to promote it as a way to average down, or reduce, your price
for shares, mutual fund units, and other investments.</B></P>
<P><B>While it's true that dollar-cost averaging can have this effect in the
right circumstances, there's a lot more to it.</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B><I> WHAT IT IS</I>.</B><B>Dollar-cost averaging is the result of
investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, in stocks, bonds, or
other investments, regardless of the unit price of the investment.  Many
investors buy units of equity funds because of the stock market's history of
increasing value over the long term.</B>
</LI>
<LI><I><B> HOW IT WORKS.</B></I> <B> When the price of the security or
mutual fund unit is high, your regular investment buys fewer shares.  When the
price is low, your money buys more.  That's where the dollar-cost averaging
comes in -- you are averaging down the dollar cost of your investment.
</B></LI></UL>
<P><B>For example, if Fund A is worth $10 per unit in August and drops to $5
in September, the average price is $7.50.  But if you invest $100 to buy 10
units in August and another $100 to buy 20 units in September, your average
purchase price is only $6.67.</B></P>
<P><B>Of course, dramatic numbers like these tend to exaggerate the benefits,
and the price changes used in many similar examples may not be realistic. 
However, over the long term, dollar-cost averaging may very well reduce your
price per unit by a few cents, and possibly more.</B></P>
<P>&#183;<B><I> WHY IT MATTERS </I></B><B> Saving a few cents where you can
is always to your benefit.  But the true value of dollar-cost averaging lies in
what it represents:  your ongoing commitment to an investing program.  You can
benefit from regular investing in your Registered Retirement Savings Plan or
non-registered investment portfolio, and get the advantage of dollar-cost
averaging.</B></P>
<P><B>The key is to pay yourself first.  Then, stick with the plan, even when
markets experience a temporary decline.  In the long run, you stand to come out
ahead.</B></P>

<HR>
<P>Many investors are familiar with the concept of compound interest - the
process by which you earn interest on interest. Over time, compounding magnifies
your interest income growth rate. But investors are not so familiar with
Dividend Reinvestment Plans, or <B>DRIPS</B> as they're usually called. DRIPS
can be the equity investor's equivalent of<A HREF="mutual_fund_4.html"><B>
compound income. </B></A> </P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
SRC="whatare.gif" ALT="What Are They!" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="64"></TD>
<TD>
<P>Dividends are company earnings that are distributed to share-holders. When
you're a member of a DRIP, you don't receive these payments as cash. Instead,
you receive more company shares. Your dividend income is automatically
reinvested. </P></TD></TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
SRC="how-work.gif" ALT="How They Work" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="64"></TD>
<TD>
<P>DRIPS offer two major advantages. First, they eliminate the problem of how
to reinvest dividend income. Second, they can save you money You pay no
brokerage or stock market commissions. And some companies offer shares to their
DRIP participants at 5% less than the current market price. <BR>Even though you
don't receive the dividend payments as cash, they're still considered taxable.
Fortunately the Dividend Tax Credit, available on dividends received from
Canadian corporations, gives them preferential tax treatment. After tax, $1 of
dividend income is roughly equivalent to $1.33 of interest or employment income.</P></TD></TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG

<TD>
<P>DRIPS are usually associated with blue-chip stocks, major corporations  with
a long history of distributing earnings to share- holders. To participate in a
DRIP, you must be a registered shareholder and you have to sign up for the plan.<BR>In
addition to participating directly in a DRIP, you can get similar benefits
through mutual funds or other investment funds. Most funds automatically invest
any earnings, whether from dividends or interest income, in more units of the
fund. FPG </P></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Suppose you invest $10,000 in a compound-interest Guaranteed Investment
Certificate that earns 8% annually, and is held in a plan where tax is deferred
(such as an RRSP). In the first year, your $10,000 will generate $800 in
interest. That $800 will then be added to your original investment principal In
the second year,. you'll have $10,800 earning 8%, which will generate $864. That
amount will then be added to your existing investment, and so on.<BR>By the end
of the tenth year, assuming that no tax has been paid, your $10,000 will have
grown to $21,589. After 15 years, it will have grown to $31,722. And after 25
years, your original $10,000 will be worth $68,485 almost seven times what you
originally invested, without your having to add a single cent.</P></TD></TR>

<P>The principle of compound growth also: applies to other forms of income.<BR>When
dividend income is reinvested in more shares of the same stock, it's called a
Dividend Reinvestment Plan, or <A HREF="mutual_fund_3.html">&quot;DRIP.&quot;</A><BR>Mutual
funds, and segregated funds offered by insurance companies, also let you benefit
from compound growth. Your earnings are usually reinvested  automatically in
more units of the underlying fund. Over time, the results can be  even more
impressive than the compound-interest example above, if the investment funds
include potential for capital gains.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>

<H2>INSURANCE STRATEGIES</H2>
<H3>New tax benefits from charity</H3>
<HR>
<P><I>With charitable donations it's as beneficial to give as it is to receive</I>If
you want to leave a portion of your estate to a charitable cause that's close to
your heart, a life insurance policy or annuity can make it possible to
contribute more and contribute it sooner.  And thanks to the latest federal
budget, you can donate more than before and increase the amount of tax credits
you can claim.</P>
<H3>Tax advantages</H3>
<P>Donations to registered charities earn a federal income tax credit of 17% on
the first $200 donated and 29% on anything above that.  Above the $200 mark,
every dollar donated reduces taxes by about 50 cents when surtaxes and
provincial taxes are included.</P>
<P>Recent budget changes increase the benefits of charitable giving:</P>
<UL>
<LI> The maximum donation eligible for tax credits in a given year has been
increased to 50% from 20% of net income.
</LI>
<LI> The maximum eligible donation has been increased to 100% of net income for
the year of death and the preceding year.  This could be particularly beneficial
if the proceeds of a life insurance policy are bequeathed in your will to a
charity, as more credits may be available to your estate.
</LI>
<LI> Donations of property (corporate shares or investment funds, for example)
will no longer trigger taxable capital gains.
</LI></UL>
<H3>How to proceed</H3>
<P>There are several ways that life insurance policies and annuities can be
used for charitable giving:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Buy a life insurance policy and name the charity as the beneficiary.  The
cost of the insurance won't earn you any tax credits, but no tax is payable when
the benefits are collected.
</LI>
<LI> In your will, bequeath the proceeds of your policy to charity.  Your
estate will earn tax credits.
</LI>
<LI> Purchase an insurance policy and donate it irrevocably to a charity.  Your
annual premium payments may qualify for tax credits.
</LI>
<LI> Donate an existing policy to receive tax credits for the cash value and
future premium payments that you make.  Accumulated earnings might be added to
your tax bill, but you may be able to arrange for the charity to pay the taxes
due.
</LI>
<LI> Buy an interest-income annuity and donate the interest earnings to the
charity.  You'll pay little if any tax on the interest earnings.  You can retain
the principal amount of the annuity for any emergency or unforeseen need;
otherwise, the principal also could go to the charity.
</LI>
<LI> Buy a prescribed life annuity so you can make a donation to charity while
still retaining income from the annuity, within certain limitations.
</LI></UL>
<P>There are many details that should be checked carefully.  Professional
advice can help you make the right choices.</P>

<H2>INSURANCE STRATEGIES<BR>7 smart ways to keep your home secure</H2>
<HR>
<P>When you're planning your summer vacation, don't forget about home security.
 If your home looks unoccupied, you could be inviting intruders.  And if it's
not properly protected, your insurance might be invalid for burglary claims.</P>
<P>Before you pack your bags, review this checklist of seven ways to protect
your property while you're away.</P>
<UL>
<LI> Hire a house sitter or security service to visit daily, pick up
newspapers, flyers, and mail, mow the lawn, water plants, change the arrangement
of drapes and blinds, and generally make the house look occupied.
</LI>
<LI> Ask a neighbour who has more than one car to park one in your driveway. 
But the car should not be parked in exactly the same spot the entire time you're
away.
</LI>
<LI> Install timers that will turn on indoor lights and the radio at irregular
intervals.  This will make your house look and sound occupied.  Don't leave fans
or the television on -- they could be a fire hazard.
</LI>
<LI> Install motion-detector floodlights outside your home, or light-sensitive
floods that come on automatically at night.  Burglars prefer to work in the
dark.
</LI>
<LI> Never announce on your telephone answering machine that you're away.
</LI>
<LI> Join a Neighbourhood Watch program.  In some areas, Neighbourhood Watches
have reduced residential break-ins as much as 48%.
</LI>
<LI> Keep ladders, ropes, wrenches, and other tools securely locked in your
garage or workshop, away from easy reach of burglars.

<H2>INSURANCE STRATEGIES</H2>
<H3>What to insure when you're self-employed</H3>
<HR>
<P>T here's a growing army of self-employed Canadians&#151;more     than 2.2
million of them with special insurance needs. Their ranks have increased to 14%
of the working population today from 1 1% in 1975. If you're among them you need
business, life, medical, travel, and disability insurance to protect yourself
and your family.</P>
<P>Most people are protected by group plans at work against loss of income,
dental and medical expenses not covered by government plans, and medical costs
when travelling. When you're on your own, that protection should be replaced.
Often it isn't.</P>
<P><B>First priority </B>Perhaps most urgent and neglected &#151;is the need
for disability insurance to replace income if an accident or illness keeps you
from working. You are far more likely to suffer a work-disrupting disability of
three months or more than you are to die before age 65, according to the
Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association. </P>
<P>The Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (CPP and QPP) provide some disability
protection. The amount you're entitled to will depend on how much you've
contributed, and for how long. For more information you can view our<A
HREF="../rmib/cpp_fact.html"> CPP/QPP pages.</A> and press the
<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#008000">BACK BUTTON </FONT>on your browser menu to
return here.</P>
<P>Government assistance won't go very far, though. The maximum (payable after
a three-month waiting period) is slightly more than $10,000 per year, plus
$2,000 per dependent child. <BR>Provincial workers' compensation plans might
provide some protection, but only if you're injured on the job, and
self-employed people may experience problems collecting.</P>
<P><B>Bridging the gap </B>For adequate protection, you'll have to obtain your
own coverage through a group plan or an individual disability policy. </P>
<P>Group plans typically replace <I>60%  to 70% </I>of lost income after a 3
l-day waiting period and are available to members of professional or trade
associations, fraternal associations, or even university alumni associations.</P>
<P>Individual disability policies, while the premiums may be higher, often
offer broader coverage. In addition, they're fully portable, transferable, and
non-cancellable. <BR>It's essential to get expert help to identify the most
appropriate coverage for your situation.</P>
<P><B>Special needs </B>In addition to protecting yourself, you also need to
protect your business. Business insurance provides coverage in case equipment or
records are lost, damaged, or stolen. Coverage usually  includes any loss of
income that results as well.<BR>In some cases, liability protection is
included. Self-employed people who work from home and many do&#151; should
review their home insurance.</P>
<P>Standard homeowners' policies <I>do not</I> provide coverage for premises
or equipment used for business purposes. You need either a rider to your
homeowner policy or an additional policy. The same can apply to auto insurance
if you use your car for business as well as personal travel.</P>

<H3>Due south? Protect yourself, and enjoy a worry free holiday.</H3>

winter, make sure your  holiday isn't disrupted because of insufficient health
insurance, home  protection, or car insurance.<BR><B>Health insurance. </B>  -
Out-of-country  coverage for snowbirds is essential. If   you're hospitalized in
the United States for just one week, the bill could easily  be as much as
$100,000 - of which  your provincial health plan will pay only a small part.
British Columbia, for example limits out-of-country claims to just $7 a day.
Other provinces are more generous, but coverage is still far below  typical U.S.
medical fees.</P>

of the working population today from 1 1% in 1975. If you're among them you need
business, life, medical, travel, and disability insurance to protect yourself
and your family.<BR>The cost for appropriate coverage will depend on your age,
health, and the length of your visit. A couple in their sixties without any
health problems can expect to pay around $2,000 for 180 days of family coverage.
(Remember that health insurance premiums qualify for the medical tax credit, so
the final cost of coverage after you do your tax return maybe less.)</P>
<P><B>Home insurance. </B> Check that your homeowner's policy is up-to-date,
adequate, and fully paid. Arrange to have someone check your house regularly
while you're away. Failure to do so could invalidate a claim if, for example, a
burst water pipe causes extensive damage. To make your house look occupied,
arrange to have driveways and sidewalks cleared of snow, papers picked up, and
automatic timers installed to operate lights and radios. (For more tips see
<A HREF="insurance_1.html">7 ways to keep your home secure</A>)</P>
<P><B>Auto insurance. </B> If you plan to rent a car in the U.S., consider a
rider on your existing policy to give you the protection you'll need. Some
premium credit cards include insurance on rental cars, but make certain it's
adequate.</P>

<H1>RETIREMENT PLANNING</H1>
<H2><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Why a secure future means paddling your own
canoe</FONT></I></H2>
<P><I><B>With the passing of each federal budget, it's becoming clearer that
Canadians will need to make their own way</B></I></P>
<P><B>Would you consider yourself well off if you and your spouse had $78,000
a year coming in?  Under the government's latest pension reform proposals, if
your combined income reaches that amount, you're too prosperous to qualify for
any part of the new Seniors Benefit.  For singles, the cut-off point is $52,000
annually.</B></P>
<P><B>In fact, there is just one way you'll qualify for the full Seniors
Benefit of $11,420 ($18,400 for couples):  Be sure to have no income whatsoever
from other sources.  With income of only $5,000 a year, your Seniors Benefit
will be chopped by $2,500.</B></P>
<P><B>Clearly, if you're looking forward to a financially secure retirement,
you'll need a solid financial plan.  Then you'll have to rely more on your own
financial resources -- and resourcefulness.</B></P>
<H1>Part of a trend</H1>
<P><B>The Seniors Benefit is scheduled to come into effect in 2001, to replace
the existing programs of Old Age Security (OAS) and the Guaranteed Income
Supplement (GIS).  It makes the latest stage in a series of government changes
to assistance for retirees.</B></P>
<P><B>For several years now OAS has been &quot;clawed back&quot; by the
government if your tax return shows an annual income of more than $53,215. 
Starting in July this year, OAS will be cut off completely for seniors with
income above this level.  In other words, instead of having to pay back some or
all of your OAS, you won't receive any payments in the first place.</B></P>
<P><B>As an aging population increases the pressure on our social safety net,
look for an even lower income threshold above which OAS is unavailable.</B></P>
<H1>Pressure on CPP</H1>
<P><B>Even the Canada Pension Plan, to which anyone who earns income
contributes, is under review by the government.  The result could be an increase
in premiums, or a reduction or delay in benefits, or both.  The bottom line? 
Universal benefits for seniors are a thing of the past.</B></P>
<P><B>With government programs running into difficulties, what can you do now
to ensure the type of retirement lifestyle you've dreamed of?</B></P>
<H1>How to take charge</H1>
<P><B>Personal savings plans, such as Registered Retirement Savings Plans
(RRSPs) and company pension plans, are the two biggest sources of retirement
income for most middle-income Canadians, after government-funded plans. 
However, employer-sponsored pension plans are declining in relative importance,
and probably will continue to do so.  The reasons:</B></P>
<P>&#183;<B><I> Pressure on pensions.  </I></B><B>The most generous pension
plans are usually found in the public sector.  Fewer and fewer people are
working for these types of organizations.  Governments and large companies are
hiring many more part-time or contract workers who do not qualify for their
pension plans.</B></P>
<P><B>In addition, pension plans are most advantageous for people who spend
their entire career with one employer.  However, employees today are more likely
to change companies in order to advance their careers, rather than waiting for
promotions with the organization they first joined.</B></P>
<P>&#183;<B><I> The RRSP dilemma.</I></B>  <B>That leaves RRSPs as the most
viable retirement savings program for most middle-income Canadians.</B></P>
<P><B>Even here, though, the government is cutting back.  Last spring's
federal budget, for example, froze RRSP contribution limits at $13,500 until
2003.  And RRSPs now must mature by the end of the year the plan-holder turns
69, instead of 71.  That means two years' less tax-sheltered compounding.</B></P>
<P><B>These restrictions follow hard on the heels of last year's changes that
reduced overcontributions to $2,000 from $8,000 and disallowed the transfer of
retiring allowances into an RRSP after 1996.</B></P>
<P><B>In spite of these changes, the RRSP system remains the best way to defer
taxes today and build up a retirement fund for tomorrow.  To make sure your
retirement is everything you hoped it would be, however, you have to work a
little harder to get the best value from your RRSP, and augment it with
personally held investments.</B></P>
<P><B>In our previous pages, we discussed investment strategies in the article
</B><A HREF="mutual_fund_1.html"><I><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;How to weather
choppy market seas.&quot;</FONT></I></A> <B> In future issues, we'll look at
some of the more sophisticated techniques you can use to increase your
retirement income.</B></P>
<H1>Guideposts to a secure retirement</H1>
<P><B>Whether your retirement is around the corner or 20 years away, here are
some guideposts to help you meet your goals.</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B><I> Don't count on the government.</I></B> <B> The demographic
profile of Canada's population and its large accumulation debt mean that the
government simply cannot afford to look after you in your retirement.  Start
making plans now to do it yourself.
</B></LI>
<LI><B><I> Start early.</I></B> <B> Funds saved and invested at an early age
multiply to vastly greater amounts by the time you retire than funds saved
during the years just prior to retirement.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> <I>Boost your RRSP.</I></B> <B> Make the maximum allowable
contributions to your RRSP every year, and catch up on prior years' contribution
shortfalls as soon as you can.  Revenue Canada's Notice of Assessment for 1995
tells you the maximum amount you can contribute for 1996.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> <I>Take charge of your retirement.</I></B>  <B>Ensure that the funds
in your RRSP are invested so that you'll be able to achieve your retirement
objectives.  Be sure to have the appropriate level of diversification, with at
least some investment in equities and some investment in international markets.

<H2>How Spousal Plans<BR>could save you thousands</H2>
<H3><EM><B>Equalizing retirement income between couples is an effective
tax-reduction strategy, and the spousal RRSP can be a powerful tool for
implementing it. See if it makes sense for you.</B></EM></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE="+4"><B>Y</B></FONT><B>ou already know that contributing to a
Registered Retirement Savings Plan can save you thousands of dollars. You get a
tax deduction immediately, and defer tax on your contribution until after you
retire, when you'll probably be in a lower tax bracket. A spousal RRSP takes
these concepts one step further. It's worth a close review, because the tax
benefits could be enormous in years to come. Here's how they work, and why:</B></P>
<P><B><I>Income-splitting</I></B><BR><B>Think of a spousal RRSP as a tool
in long-term retirement planning. The key is that it can help a couple reduce
their overall income tax bill by splitting income more evenly between them
.Spousal RRSPs are most effective when the spouses are at different ends of  the
income tax spectrum. One spouse contributes to the spousal RRSP an, claims the
immediate tax deduction. The funds in the spousal RRSP accumulate, free of tax,
until they're withdrawn by the other spouse .The tax savings can be significant.
For example, consider a B.C. couple with a combined retirement income of
$60,000. If $50,000 were earned by one spouse, that spouse would have to pay
$14,367 in income tax. The $10,000 earned by the other spouse would attract tax
of $1,096. Total tax bill:$15,463</B></P>
<P><B>But suppose they could split that $60,000 income, so that each spouse is
reporting $30,000. Each spouse would pay $6,281 in income tax. The total tax
bill would be $12,562, or a savings of almost $3,000.</B></P>
<P><B>To accomplish that, the spouses need to equalize their retirement
income. That's where a spousal plan can<A NAME="middle"></A> help<CITE><A
HREF="#guidepost"><B>(see Guide Post)</B></A></CITE> There can be other
benefits. If your spouse is younger than you, a spousal plan makes it possible
to contribute even after you turn 69, the year your own RRSP must mature.(Before
the recent <A HREF="../rmib/rsp_fact.html"><B>federal budget</B></A>, you had
until the end of the year you turned 71 to mature your RRSP) As long as you have
earned sufficient income, you can contribute to your spouses's RRSP until the
end of the year in which he or she turns 69. If your spouse is much younger than
you, that can add up to many years of tax-sheltered compound growth.
</B></P>
<P><B><I>How much to contribute</I></B><BR><B>Contributions to a spousal
RRSP are confined to the total amount of  the contributor's own limits. This
means that in any given year you may contribute to your own RRSP, a spousal
plan, or both. The total must not exceed your allowed maximum for the year.
However, the contributions you make for the spousal plan will not decrease the
amount your souse may contribute to his or her own plan.To determine how much to
contribute to your spousal plan and to your own keep in mind your long-term
retirement plan. Consider the current value of both your spouse's and your own
RRSPs, estimate how much they'll be worth by the time you'll be drawing on the
income, then contribute as necessary to equalize the amounts. You'll also need
to consider the effect of employer pension plans. If your spouse has a company
pension that will provide a large amount of income after retirement, you'll need
to factor that in the equation.
</B></P>
<P><B><I>The three-year rule.</I></B><BR><B>There's one tax planning point
you'll need to work around, known as the <CITE>attribution</CITE> rules.</B><BR><B>If
money is withdrawn from a spousal plan in the same year as the contribution was
made or within the following two calendar years, the withdrawal will be<CITE>attributed</CITE>
to the spouse who made the contribution. In other words, the contributor will
have to pay the tax on the withdrawal.<BR>This rule applies to any spousal
RRSPs to which a contribution has been made, so you can't avoid the rules by
setting up more than one plan. The only way to steer clear of the
<CITE>three-year rule</CITE> is to wait until the time is up before you make a
withdrawal from the spousal plan. In addition, the three-year rule doesn't apply
if there is a divorce, or if either spouse becomes a non-resident of Canada or
dies.</B></P>

<P> <TT><B>What it is:</B> A spousal RRSP is a registered plan to which one
taxpayer contributes, while the assets in the plan are registered in the name of
the contributor's spouse. Common-law unions are considered eligible if the two
partners have lived together for a year or more, or if they have children.<BR><B>When

<H2>RETIREMENT PLANNING</H2>
<H3>Trust your family for tax breaks</H3>
<H4>Diverting income may prevent benefit drawbacks</H4>
<P>The <B>virtues of saving are </B>deeply ingrained in Canadians. However,
older Canadians may actually find they can save more by giving away some of
their assets.</P>
<P><B>Consideration No. </B>1: Unless it's within the shelter of a
tax-deferred plan such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), every
cent of investment income you make is taxed to some extent by the government.
<BR>For a top-bracket taxpayer earning interest income, the tax bite can run to
50% or more.</P>
<P><B>Consideration No. </B>2: If you're over 65, everything you earn
decreases your entitlement to benefits such as Old Age Security (OAS). <BR>The
new Seniors Benefit, slated to come into effect in 2001, will make it even more
difficult to collect from the government. A single person reporting income of
just $52,000 will get no benefits whatsoever. For couples, the threshold is
$78,000.</P>
<P><B>The family way </B>With the government taking more than ever and
becoming increasingly less willing to give anything out, what can you do? A
family trust is one option to explore. <BR>By setting up a family trust, you,
as trustee, can divert annual investment income to beneficiaries such as
unemployed or under-employed children in lower tax brackets. Or you might choose
to divert income to your grandchildren, to cover their education expenses. <BR>Meanwhile,
your personal tax returns will show a lower income, meaning that you may not
have to forfeit your government pensions and other benefits. If you find
yourself short of funds, you can always dip into your investment capital, which
is probably earmarked to go to your children or grandchildren anyway.</P>
<P>If you think a family trust might benefit you and your family, consider a
formal review to determine the most effective setup. Considerations should
include your overall financial, estate and investment plans, as well as taxation
and legal issues. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>lastic credit can be costly, so it pays to cut it
where you can. The best way is to avoid interest costs altogether by paying all
charges within 21 days of the statement date. If you can't do that, here are
some other ideas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>First pay those with the highest interest rate, usually credit cards issued
by department stores or other retailers</LI>
<LI>Consider a low-interest credit card. However, be aware that low-interest
cards have annual fees so there's no net saving unless you usually carry a hefty
outstanding balance.</LI>
<LI>If it's going to take several months to pay your balance, consider
arranging a low-interest loan.</LI>
<LI>Bonus points or rebates that help pay for goods or services when you use
some credit cards can be worthwhile. Points can be used for such things as air
travel or the purchase of a car or home.</LI></UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FF0000">Be cautious.</FONT></B><BR>Several
years ago one credit card From a large bank offered 5% rebates to be applied to
the down payment on a first home. The catch was you had to take out a mortgage
with the interest rate set for a five-year term, while rates for  one-year terms
were considerably lower.</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE. </FONT></B>Pay off credit charges as
quickly as you can. Make sure bonus points don't entice you to spend more than
you otherwise would. If they cause you to incur interest costs, the &quot;savings&quot;
could be dubious. <B> </B></P>

all Canadians.</B></I></P>

April 30, 1997, will no longer be deductible for the payer and taxable to the
recipient.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> The annual limit on donations to charity increases to 50% of net
income from the previous 20%.  In the year of a taxpayer's death, the limit is
100%.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> Contribution limits to Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs)
increase to $2,000 per beneficiary per year (up from $1,500).  The cumulative
maximum increases to $42,000 from $31,500.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> The Education Credit increases to $100 per month from $80.  In
addition, transferable tuition and education amounts, which can be claimed by
the person supporting the student, rise $1,000 to $5,000 a year.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> The maximum tax credit for support of infirm dependants increases to
$400 from $270.  In addition, the infirm dependant is now allowed to earn $4,103
(increased from $2,690) before the credit starts to be phased out.

<H3><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Big refund?  Lend less to Ottawa this year</FONT></B></H3>
<P><B>Your income tax refund might seem like a windfall.  But it's not.  In
fact, all it means is that Revenue Canada has enjoyed the use of your
hard-earned money all year.</B></P>
<P><B>By reducing the amount of personal income tax withheld from your
paycheque, you can see to it that your refund for the 1996 tax year never leaves
your hands, so you can invest it and make it work for you.</B></P>
<P><B>If you have made sizeable RRSP contributions or charitable donations,
your taxable income is probably less than the amount on which your withholding
is calculated.  By applying to Revenue Canada, you can arrange for these
contributions to be taken into consideration and have less tax deducted from
your paycheque.</B></P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE.</FONT></I></B> <B> Write or visit
your nearest Revenue Canada taxation office, and explain why you want less tax
deducted at source.  You'll be expected to provide proof of regular
contributions to your RRSP,  group RRSP, or a registered charity.  If Revenue
Canada approves your request, your employer will be authorized to withhold less
tax, and you'll see your net pay rise.</B></P>
<P><I><B>With no tax increases and no additional taxes, the March 6 federal
budget didn't elicit much reaction from the general public.  However, it
contained a number of measures that may affect you immediately.  Even more
important, the budget's pension reform proposals have serious implications for
all Canadians.</B></I></P>

<H3><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Renovations that pay</FONT></B></H3>
<P><B>Renovations to your home can add to its beauty and to your enjoyment. 
And in today's flat real estate market, the right renovations can add value to
your home.  So before you knock down a wall or dig up the backyard, consider the
following:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>A swimming pool might increase your use and enjoyment of your home,
but it's unlikely to add to the resale value.  In fact, because of the
maintenance involved, a swimming pool will probably make your house more
difficult to sell.
</B></LI>
<LI> <B>Don't expect to add value to your house by finishing the basement as a
recreation room.  Buyers have their own ideas of how they want the basement
finished.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> Kitchen upgrades such as new or refinished cupboards, or a central
island, generally increase the resale value of your house by about 90% of what
the renovations cost.  Extra windows, doors, or a deck can return an average of
about 70% of cost.
</B></LI>
<LI> <B>A second bathroom adds value and convenience to your home, providing
you don't build it in the basement.  Potential buyers will be looking for an
ensuite, not a trip down to the basement.
</B></LI></UL>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE.</FONT></I></B>  <B>If you're even
thinking of selling, ask your real estate agent for advice well in advance. 
After an inspection, he or she can give you specific suggestions on what
improvements will make your house more saleable and help you get the price you
want.</B></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>How to cut car insurance costs</B></FONT></H3>
<P><B>Understanding auto insurance can be difficult, with various policies and
plans changing from province to province.  But all drivers understand the desire
to keep their costs as low as possible.</B></P>
<P><B>No matter where in Canada you live, there are some things you should
keep in mind when looking to reduce your car insurance costs:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Drive safely.  Nothing drives up car insurance costs faster than
accidents and moving violations.  Too many violations mean that you could have
difficulty even getting car insurance.
</B></LI>
<LI><B> Take a defensive driving course.  Even if you've been driving for 30
years, a refresher course won't hurt, and it might reduce your insurance
premium.  If the teenage driver in your family takes a course, it could cut your
extra premium costs by as much as 50%.
</B></LI>
<LI> <B>Increase your collision and comprehensive deductibles to $500 or even
$1,000.  That's usually more prudent than reducing the amount of protection.
</B></LI>
<LI> <B>Choose car models carefully.  For example, four-wheel drive and
sport-utility vehicles generally have the worst insurance records for theft,
collision, comprehensive, and accident benefits.  As a result, they cost more to
insure.
</B></LI></UL>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE.</FONT></I></B>  <B>If you're
renewing your car insurance, this is the right time to discuss these ideas.  If
you're in the market for a new car, the Vehicle Information Centre of Canada
tracks insurance claims in its annual report.  Copies are available by writing
to the Centre at 175 Commerce Valley Drive West, Suite 220, Markham, Ontario,
L3T 7P6.</B></P>

<P><B>The federal government has acknowledged how difficult it can be to pay
for post-secondary education.  To make it a little easier, the
<A HREF="../rmib/rsp_fact.html">March 1996 federal budget</A> increased the
amount you may contribute to a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP).</B></P>
<P><B>Like Registered Retirement Savings Plans, RESPs allow you to defer tax
on earnings -- in other words, the money in the plan can grow without attracting
tax each year.  Unlike RRSPs, however, your contributions to an RESP can't be
deducted from current taxable income.  After a maximum of 25 years, the plan's
earnings are distributed to the beneficiary to help pay post-secondary education
costs.  The income is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries.</B></P>
<P><B>Effective this year, the amount that can be contributed to an RESP has
been increased to $2,000 from $1,500 per year, with the cumulative limit rising
to $42,000 from $31,500 per beneficiary.  In addition, the federal budget
removed some restrictions on other assistance that once affected the plans of
beneficiaries.</B></P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE.</FONT></I></B>  <B>Maximum RESP
contributions, combined with the 25-year tax deferral, can cover a good portion
of your child's university costs.  There are several types of plans available. 
Some provide full management for your contributions, while others leave the
decisions up to you.  With the self-directed RESP, you can invest your
contribution in the same type of securities as qualify for your RRSP, including
equity and fixed-income mutual funds.  Be sure to explore all the possibilities
before you commit yourself to a particular plan.</B></P>

deferral. </LI>

outstanding, paying them down could be your most profitable investment. In fact,
a penny saved on interest costs could be worth as much as 1.5 cents earned,

loans, starting with those that charge the highest interest rate. </LI>

<P>There's money to be saved when you renew your home mortgage. Or if you're
saddled with a five-year term at a high interest rate, the savings can come
sooner.  <EM>Consider these strategies:</EM></P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Shop around for the lowest possible rate. -</B><BR>Competition for
mortgage loans is fierce. In order to get or retain your business, financial
institutions may be willing to cut as much as half a point (half of one percent)
off a five-year term and a quarte rpoint off a one-year term.</LI>
<LI><B>Reduce your amortization. </B><BR>Your monthly payments will be
larger, but you'll save an amazing amount on interest cost.</LI>
<LI> <B>Make a lump sum payment.</B><BR>There's no limit on the amount of
principal you can pay down when you renew. Use whatever cash you have available
to pay off as much as you can.</LI>
<LI><B>Switch from monthly to weekly payments. </B><BR>The effect is similar
to making 13 monthly payments each year</LI>
<LI>.<B>Consider a blended-rate renewal</B><BR>A blended renewal extends your
mortgage beyond the existing term at a rate that averages what you're paying
with current rates. If your existing rate is quite high, and current rates are
much lower, the savings could be substantial.<BR>For example, suppose you owe
$100,000 on an original five-year term at 9.5%. There are two years remaining to
the ends of the term. Today's  five-year rate is 8.5% A blended  renewal rate
would fix your rate at 9% for the next five years.<BR>You'd get a lower rate
for the next two years and protection against rate increases for the following
three years. The risk, however, is that two years from now the rate may be less
- not   more -than the 9% you're paying now.</LI></UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE. </FONT></B>Shop and compare. Visit
several financial institutions in person. Calculate costs carefully since the
arithmetic is different in every case and saving opportunities change with
changing interest rates.  </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>K</B></FONT>eeping a contingency fund equivalent  to
three to six months' salary is a key element of a sound financial plan. But
where's the best place to keep it?<BR> Long-term investments such as stocks or
bonds are out, because you may wind up taking a loss if you have to cash them in
a hurry. You'll want your emergency money where you can get it quickly, but
still earn a good rate of return.
</P>
<P><B>It's your choice </B>Generally, you rchoices consist of Canada Savings
Bonds ((CSBs),), savings accounts that offer investment-level rates of interest,
cashable Guaranteed Investment Certificates ((GICs)), and money market mutual
funds.<BR> There are five key factors to take into consideration when deciding
on the best place to keep your contingency funds.</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>&#187;Safety. </B>You don't want to risk losing any of the principal in
your emergency fund. That's why safety should be your number-one consideration.</LI>
<LI><B>&#187;Liquidity</B>. You must be able to get cash out of your
investment quickly and easily.</LI>
<LI><B>&#187;Convenience. </B>You don't want to spend a lot of time managing
this investment.</LI>
<LI><B>&#187;Re-investment of earnings. </B>The purpose of your contingency
fund isn't t oprovide you with regular income. As aresult, you'll want earnings
re-invested immediately and automatically.</LI>
<LI><B>&#187;Yield. </B>With the degree of safety you need for your
contingency fund, you obviously can't expect to earn a yield equivalent to the
longer term returns on stocks or bonds. However, the yield is still a
consideration in weighing other alternatives.</LI></OL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOUR MOVE </FONT></B>For many investors, a money
market fund is the investment of choice for holding emergency funds. Money
market funds invest in Treasury bills and other forms of safe, highly liquid
government and corporate debt. Usually, the return is close to that of Treasury
bills, and you can get your money out within 24 hours<BR>For more information

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>R</B></FONT>esolve now that the holiday season won't
leave you with a financial hangover in January. Here are some guidelines to
follow:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Stick to a budget. </B>List all the extra expenses you can think of:
gifts, entertainment, travel, greeting cards, home decorations, and so on. Bump
up the total by 10% to allow a cushion for the unexpected. If your budget
exceeds your available funds, start trimming.</LI>
<LI><B>Use credit cards sparingly. </B>Paying with plastic often leads to
impulse buying. Shop with cash, cheques,, or debit cards instead. That way, you
can't spend more than you have. If you do use credit, use just one card, set a
limit on the amount you'll charge, and keep close track of your account balance.
Major credit cards make up-to-date informationon your account available by phone
seven days a week. <A HREF="money_moves_1.html">(See How to cut plastic credit
costs)</A></LI>
<LI><B>Shop early. </B>Avoiding the last-minute rush means you can comparison
shop, which can help you stick to your budget. Deal with well-established
retailers, and check their return, exchange, and refund policies. </LI></UL>

<H2> <I>Writing a living will provides loved ones<BR>with your health care
directions and<BR>is a key step in a complete estate plan.</I></H2></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>You've written and signed your  will, outlining who gets what _&#151;when
you pass away. You've arranged a power of attorney, so someone you trust can
make money management decisions should you become incapacitated. You might think
your estate plan is now complete. But it's not quite finished: You need to
consider who would be responsible for making decisions on your behalf about your
personal care, if you're not able.</P>
<P>The document you need is called a <FONT SIZE="+1"><EM>living will</EM></FONT>,
and it's the third vital element in the foundation of your estate plan.</P>
<P>Until recently, living wills had no legal status in Canada. They could only
provide advice to family members and doctors, which might or might not be acted
on. But most provinces now have, or are planning, legislation which gives them
legal force.</P>
<P><B>Terminology varies </B>The terminology may differ from one province to
the next. In Ontario, the term is &quot;power of attorney for personal care.&quot;
Elsewhere, living wills may be known as &quot;health care directives&quot; or &quot;advance
directives.&quot; In Quebec, an enforceable living will can be created by filing
a mandate with a notary, or by signing a document in the presence of two
witnesses. Their newly recognized legal status makes living wills important no
matter where you live in Canada.</P>
<P><B>How they help </B>Without some kind of legal directive to follow when
you're unable to speak for yourself, you might experience delays in medical
treatment, even life-saving emergency treatment. Under other circumstances,
health and personal care decisions might be made for you by a government
bureaucrat rather than someone you know and would choose.</P>
<P>Here are some of the major points to consider for you own living will:</P>
<P><B>Selecting decision-makers. </B>Without a living will, consent for
medical treatment is normally provided by next of kin &#151;spouses, children,
or parents. That may not be the best choice for you. You might prefer a more
distant relative or a close friend to make decisions for you.<BR>Be sure the
person you choose is willing to accept the responsibility and is comfortable
with the decisions you've outlined. This individual should be given a copy of
the final document to keep and refer to when necessary. It's also important to
name an alternate in case the primary person isn't available when consent must
be granted or decisions made, often in a hurry. <BR>Select your decision-makers
with care: people who are close to you, who are competent, and in whom you have
absolute trust.</P>
<P><B>Health care directions. </B>A living will allows you to leave
instructions for the health care treatment that you want under certain
circumstances. Some people provide for removal of life support systems if they
are in a coma with no chance of recovery, for example. You can also give
instructions regarding palliative care and pain management in the event of a
terminal illness. <BR>Providing such instructions not only ensures that your
wishes will be carried out, but can also relieve family members of the anguish
of trying to decide what you would want.<BR>It's a good idea to discuss these
types of decisions with your family doctor. This will make it possible for you
to express your desires as clearly and specifically as possible, and to consider
all the situations that are likely to arise. It's also a good idea to ask your
doctor to file a copy of the document along with your medical records.</P>
<P><B>Personal care directions. </B>You can also provide personal care
instruction &#151;for example, stipulations that would outline the circumstances
under which you would consent to move to a nursing home.</P>
<H3>Get expert legal advice</H3>
<P>Great care is needed to make sure your living will accomplishes what you
want. For instance; if you've named more than one person as your representative,
you may need to specify how conflicts between thwm are to be resolved. You may
want to stipulate that one individual has the final say and can override the
decisions of other family members.</P>
<P>The legislation that governs living wills is often complex. In addition, the
regulations vary from province to province, and are still evolving. That's why
your living will should be drafted with the assistance of a professional.
Fill-in-the-blank documents are simply not adequate for this job. </P>

SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0080C0">Shine up your finances with a year-end review.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>s the year-end approaches, look for tax planning
opportunities that will disappear after Dec. 31. Year-end is also ideal to make
sure your insurance is sufficient, and your investment strategies remain on
track. The key? An up-to-date financial plan<BR>.<I>Tax savings could be among
the benefitsif you take the time now to review yourfinancial situation 
</I><BR><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>s the year-end approaches, income tax is
probably one of  the furthest things from your mind. After all, you don't have
to submit your income tax return until the end of next April.<BR>But by
spending some time reviewing your situation now, you may be able to take
advantage of potentially lucrative tax-saving opportunities - some of which must
be acted on by Dec. 31 or they're gone forever.</P>
<P><B>Tax-deductible expenses </B><BR>A reviewof the past year's events will
jog your memory about what you can deduct next April. Here are some areas that
are often missed</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Moving expenses. </B>If you've relocated in order to start a new job,
the expenses you incur are deductible as long as the move brings you at least 40
kilometres closer to your place of employment.<BR>Deductible costs include
travelling expenses, movers' fees, and the realestate commission and legal fees
involved in selling your old home.<BR>Students can deduct their movingcosts
when they start a job, including asummer job</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Investment expenses. </B> Interest expenses if you borrowed to invest,
accounting and investment advice fees,safety deposit box fees, and other
safekeeping charges are deductible.These charges must be paid before the
year-end to be deductible from 1996 income. Other frequently overlooked
deductions include convention expenses, repayment of taxable life insurance
policy loans, and legal fees that relate to collecting employment income.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Tax credits </B>With a little strategic forethought, you can take
maximum advantage of the tax savings presented by tax credits.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Charitable donations. </B>The charitable tax credit is worth about 27%
(taking both federal and provincial taxes intoaccount) on the first $200
donated.Above that level, it jumps to 50%.<BR>  By grouping your planned
donations so that they fall into one year, you can pass the threshold and enjoy
the higher rate. And thanks to the March 1996 federal budget, you can earn
donation tax credits up to 50% of earned income. The limit last year was 20%</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>The medical tax credit. </B>Eligible medical expenses paid in any
12-month period ending in 1996 can generate a credit on your 1996 return.
Advancing payment for 1997 services to qualify as part of 1996's claim may
generate a larger credit.<BR>Another tip: Eligible expenses for all family
members can be claimed by either spouse. Having the lower-income spouse claim
the expenses may make it easier to pass the threshold above which the credit
applies. That threshold is 3% of net income or $1,614 (whichever is less).</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Tuition fees. </B>If you've attended a course at a qualifying
post-secondary institution, your tuition fees qualify for a17% federal tax
credit. If you've paid tuition fees for your kids to go to school, their tax
credit may be transferable to you.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Job-related strategies </B>Whether you work for a large or small
company, or work for yourself, tax-saving opportunities exist.
<UL>
<LI><B>Bonuses. Contributing </B>any bonus to your Registered Retirement
Savings Plan(RRSP) up to your deduction limit is an ideal way to defer tax
almost indefinitely.You have until next March to contribute for the 1996 tax
year, but the sooner you invest, the more you'll benefit from compound growth.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Retiring allowances. </B>In addition to your regular contribution,
retiring allowances can be rolled over into your RRSP, subject to the following
limits:$2,000 for each year of service prior to1996, plus $1,500 for each year
prior to1989.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Installment payments. </B>If  you're self-employed, chances are you're
required to submit personal income tax installments on a quarterly basis. Your
fourth-quarter installment is due Dec. 16. Be sure to pay on time to avoid
late-payment penalties and interest charges.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>For retirees. </B>If  you turned 71 in1996, be sure to convert your
RRSPs into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) or annuity before yearend.
If you don't, the entire amount will be added to your taxable income.<BR>  If
you do establish a RRIF this year, remember that you aren't required to start
making withdrawals until the end of next year. By postponing withdrawals until
after Jan. 1,  you won't have to report the income until April 1998, when you
file your return for the 1997 tax year.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI><B>The big picture </B>The end of the year is also an ideal time to sit
back and review your total financial plan.
<UL>
<LI><B>Insurance. Check </B>your existing personal, home, and auto insurance
policies. Are they still adequate given the changes that may have occurred over
the course of the year?<BR>  If you've married, divorced, or had a child, for
instance, you probably have different life insurance needs than you did last
year.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Investments. </B>Review your existing strategy. Are your current investments
meeting your objectives for income and growth? Do you expect your needs to
change in the near future? If you're planning to retire in the near future, for
example, it may be time to alter your investment mix.

<H2>Tax Strategies</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0080C0">Timing you income for tax deductions!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C</B></FONT>anadians are accustomed to seeing federal
and provincial tax rates nudge upwards year after year (not to mention new
taxes, surtaxes, and rising consumption taxes).<BR>  But believe it or not, tax
rates can come down. And when they do, that creates some interesting tax
planning opportunities.</P>
<P><B>A made-in-Ontario tax break</B> Ontario residents are a case in
point.Over the next few years Ontarians will have a special opportunity to save
tax.<BR>  Under the 1996 Ontario provincial budget, personal income tax rates
will be reduced over the next few years. This means that if Ontario residents
can defer income for tax purposes for a year or two,they will pay a considerably
lower rate of tax on it.<BR>  Before the last budget, the personal income tax
rate in Ontario was 58% of basic federal tax. Beginning in July this rate was
cut to 56% for 1996. It is then scheduled to fall to 49% effective Jan. 1,1997,
and be further reduced to 40.5% by1999. Because provincial tax is calculated as
a percentage of federal tax payable (except in Quebec), the savings  increase as
income rises.</P>
<P><B>Deferring income </B> Deferring taxable income can be an attractive
strategy in many situations, for residents in all provinces.<BR>  If you expect
your income to be lower in a particular year - perhaps because you're planning
to take a year off work to travel - deferring income to that low-income year can
pay big dividends.<BR>  Here are some suggestions on how to proceed.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Make an RRSP contribution.</B>Contributing the maximum to your
Registered Retirement Savings Plan(RRSP) is the most obvious way to defer tax.
It may be wise to borrow to contribute, especially since interest rates these
days are near historic lows.</LI>
<LI><B>Time your capital gains and losses.</B>One of the big advantages to
owning a capital asset is that you don't have to account for any change in its
value until you actually sell the property (or otherwise dispose of it for tax
purposes). This allows you to sell when it suits you best, tax-wise (always
bearing in mind that investment decisions should never be based solely on the
tax consequences).<BR>  In a year of high income, for example,any capital gain
you make will be taxed at your top marginal rate. It may be a good idea to delay
selling investments that will realize a capital gain until a year when your
income is lower. If you have gains you want to offset, you might want toconsider
selling property that will realize a capital loss now.</LI>
<LI> <B>Defer withdrawals from tax sheltered plans. </B>Within government
imposed limits,it can be to your advantage to delay receiving income from a
pension or annuity. Withdrawing only the minimum required from your Registered
Retirement Income Fund is another effective way t odefer taxable income.</LI></UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Because everyone's financial situation is different,
it's always a good idea to seek professional advice before proceeding, and to
identify other ways to defer taxable income. </FONT></B></P>

<P>
In examining your employee benfits program we would operate in the following way.
Our first step would be to obtain an experience and rate summary, together with any financial statements the plans were underwritten on a retention basis.
<P>
Next, we would run our own figures based on various financial underwriting models to ascertain which method of underwriting would best serve your interest.
<P>
Then we would request a meeting with you to review our findings  and agree on the plan specifications to be submitted to the market.
Plan specifications would then be prepared  and submitted together with the experience and rate summary, underwriting requirements and the employee data to the insurance market place.
<P>
Quotations received would be analyzed and a report would be prepared commenting on the following areas:
<P>
<OL>

<IMG ALIGN middle SRC = "../qs_okok.gif"> Cost saving measures<BR>
<IMG ALIGN middle SRC = "../qs_okok.gif"> Recommendations<BR>
</OL><P>
If our recommendations are accepted,  a new benefit programme would be implemented. contracts would be prepared, new benefit booklets for each employee would be printed and individual certificates of insurance would be distributed.
<P>
Our consultants would be available for staff meetings where your employees would be given the opportunity to voice any questions they may have.
<P>
We would keep you advised by quarterly claims report, annual claims analysis and undertake renewal negotiations with the insurance company underwriters.
<P>
We would also keep you advised on any changes in benefit legislation, trends in health benefits and trends in human rights legislation.

arrangements and other various cost factors.

<H1>X.500 Query</H1>

X.500 is a distributed directory protocol which allows hierarchies of
countries, regions, organizations, and individuals to be
catalogued.

<P>

You can browse the X.500 directory of countries and organizations, and
you can search for individuals within these organizations.

<BR>
<DL>
<DT><DD><FONT size=+1>You, the employees of NASA, made it happen.
<P>
<DT><DD>You made 1996 a red-letter year for NASA&#151;one that will be
remembered for years, decades, perhaps even centuries.  You wrote a chapter
in our Nation's history that will not soon be forgotten.
<P>
<DT><DD>As you take a well-earned respite for the holiday season, please
take a moment to reflect on NASA's outstanding accomplishments of the last
12 months.  Just for starters, consider the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI type=disc>The discovery of possible fossilized life in an asteroid from Mars,
providing the most compelling evidence ever of life on another planet.
<P>
<LI type=disc>The successful launches of two low-cost spacecraft, Mars Global Surveyor
and Mars Pathfinder, holding great promise for more scientific discoveries
about the Red Planet.
<P>
<LI type=disc>Solid progress on the International Space Station, paving the way for
on-orbit assembly to begin in the coming year.
<P>
<LI type=disc>A series of near-flawless Space Shuttle docking missions with the Mir
space station, demonstrating the success and promise of U.S.-Russian space
cooperation.
<P>
<LI type=disc>Shannon Lucid's incredible 181-day stay in space, breaking records for an
American in space and capturing the attention and imagination of people
around the world.
<P>
<LI type=disc>Selection of a builder for the X-33 technology demonstration vehicle,
marking a major step in the quest for cheaper and more reliable access to
space.
<P>
<LI type=disc>Successful propulsion-controlled aircraft landing, demonstrating software
that enables a pilot to land a plane safely with only engine power.
</UL>
<P>
<DT><DD>I could go on and on.  The roll-out of the X-36&#151;a series of truly amazing
discoveries by the Hubble Space Telescope that will rewrite science
textbooks&#151;a plethora of revelations by Galileo as it explored Jupiter and
its moons, including the exciting finding of ice on Europa.
<P>
<DT><DD>And when you weren't capturing headlines around the world with the
astounding accomplishments, you were professionally going about NASA's more
"routine" business:  conducting valuable research about our home planet and
its fragile environment; safely launching and carrying out seven Space
Shuttle missions; and working on technological breakthroughs that will
strengthen the efficiency, safety, and competitiveness of the American
aviation industry.
<P>
<DT><DD>You did all of this, and more, during a very challenging period.  You did
it as we continued to reinvent the Agency, making it more relevant to our
society and more responsive to the concerns of your fellow citizens and
taxpayers.
<P>
<DT><DD>You have my sincere thanks and congratulations for an unbelievable year.
<P>
<DT><DD>YOU made it happen.

<H2 ALIGN=Center>Space Summit Update</H2>
<P>
On August 7, 1996, President Clinton called for a bipartisan Summit on 
the future of the space program. The Summit will allow the 
Administration to work with the Congressional leadership to develop a 
broad consensus on a balanced NASA program for the future. The Summit 
will also provide an opportunity to discuss the recent evidence that 
life may have existed on Mars, as well as other significant advances in 
space science and technology.
<P>
To assess the Mars findings, and their relationship to our current space
science program, Vice President Gore called for a pre-Summit Symposium. 
To support the Symposium, the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
(OSTP) requested that NASA assemble a group of experts to offer an 
objective assessment of 1) the major questions in space science, 2) how 
current U.S. programs respond to those questions, and 3) appropriate 
"next steps" that might be taken. This group was also asked to focus its 
attention on developing discussion papers on three broad topics: 1) the 
Universe--its large-scale structure and evolution; 2) Planets--planetary 
systems, including exploration of neighboring planets and moons, the 
formation of other planetary systems, and searching for Earth-like 
planets around nearby stars, and 3) Life-its possible existence and 
development elsewhere in the universe.
<P>
NASA and the National Research Council (NRC) convened a workshop for
approximately three dozen biologists, planetary scientists, astronomers,
and cosmologists who met October 28-30, 1996 to consider these questions and 
emerging directions in space science. Dr. Claude Canizares of MIT and 
Dr. Anneila Sargent of Cal Tech served as co-chairs of the workshop. The 
participants identified the NASA ORIGINS program as a unifying theme for 
future initiatives.  The study of ORIGINS follows the 15 billion year 
long chain of events from the birth of the universe at the Big Bang, 
through the formation of the chemical elements, of galaxies, stars and 
planets, through the mixing of chemicals and energy that cradled life on 
Earth, to the earliest self-replicating organisms and the profusion of 
life.  Click here to view the <A HREF="workshop.html">Executive Summary of the Workshop Findings</A> or the 
<A HREF="findings.html">Findings of  the Workshop.</A><P>

The findings from the workshop were presented to the Vice President 
at a symposium on December 11, 1996 at the White House. In addition to 
representatives from the NASA/NRC workshop, additional scientists, 
engineers, and theologians were invited to participate in the 
symposium.  Click here to view the <A HREF="vpsss.htm">White House Statement</A>, the 
<A HREF="guest.html">Guest List</A>, or the
<A HREF="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/summit/brief.htm">Briefing Book that NASA prepared for the Participants.</A><P>
The results of the Space Science Symposium will serve as one of many 
inputs to the Space Summit meeting that will take place after the first 
of the year.  Additional inputs will include information from the NASA 
Strategic Plan, the NASA Fiscal Year 1998 budget submit, and submissions 
from industry, private organizations and the public. Participants for 
the Space Summit will include key Administration officials and members 
of Congress.

To search, simply enter a query -- type the words you want to search for in the '<em>search term box</em>' (or follow the instructions from your client as to how to enter a search). If you enter two or more words, than any document that contains ANY of the words will be found. (For example, if you search for <B>ice cream</B>, then any document with either <B>ice</B> or <B>cream</B> will be on the list.) If you want only documents containing BOTH <B>ice</B> AND <B>cream</B>, then use <B>AND</B> between the words; your query would be: <B>ice and cream</B>. See the list below for a full description of searching options and their effect.<p> The result of this search will be a list of the documents which satisfy your search request (or a reply that indicates that NO documents match). The list is ordered by 'relevancy rank' (highest first), which very roughly corresponds to the number of times the word you searched for occurred in the document versus the size of the document.<p>
The following is a list of all the search options available:
<DL>
<DT><B>Right-hand truncation</B> (stemming) queries -- Expand Your Search
<DD>The query 'astro*' will find documents containing the words 'astronomy' as well as 'astrophysics'. If you are not sure of the
 spelling or form of the word used in the documents, use this.<p>
<DT>'<B>And</B>' queries -- Narrow Your Search
<DD>The query 'red and blue' will find the <B>intersection</B> of all the documents containing the words 'red', and 'blue'.The use of 'and' limits your retrieval.<p>
<DT>'<B>Or</B>' queries -- Expand Your Search
<DD>The query 'red or blue' will find the <B>union</B> of all the documents containing the words 'red' and 'blue'.The use of 'or' increases your retrieval.<p>
<DT>'<B>Not</B>' queries -- Narrow Your Search
<DD>The query 'red not green' will find all the documents containing the word 'red', and <B>excluding</B> the documents containing the word 'green'.The use of 'not' limits your retrieval.<p>
<DT><B>Nested</B> queries -- Complicated Searches
<DD>The query '(red and green) or blue not pink' will find the union of all the documents containing the words 'red', and 'green'. It will then add (union) all documents containing the word 'blue'. Finally, it will exclude all documents containing the word 'pink'.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H2><P ALIGN=Center>
The Search for Origins:<BR>
Findings of a Space Science Workshop<BR>
October 28-30, 1996<BR>Executive Summary</H2>
<P>
<P>
This document reports the findings of three dozen biologists, planetary
scientists, astronomers, and cosmologists assembled by NASA and the 
National Research Council at the request of the White House Office of 
Science and Technology Policy.
<P>
This discussion paper reports the findings of three dozen biologists, 
planetary scientists, astronomers, and cosmologists assembled by NASA 
and the National Research Council at the request of the White House 
Office of Science and Technology Policy. They met in Washington, DC on 
October 28-30, 1996.  In a workshop format, the group considered 
emerging directions in space science and identified ORIGINS as a 
unifying theme for future initiatives. Questions about our ORIGINS are 
as old as human thought; broadly interpreted, they comprise:
<P><UL>
<LI>How did the Universe come to be what it is today?
<P>
<LI>What is the origin of life? What are the building blocks and 
conditions necessary for life, and how did these come about in the 
universe?
<P>
<LI>Is life unique to Earth? Can we find convincing evidence that life 
once existed or even now exists elsewhere in or beyond our solar system?
</UL><P>
The study of ORIGINS follows the 15 billion year long chain of events 
from the birth of the universe at the Big Bang, through the formation of 
the chemical elements, of galaxies, stars and planets, through the 
mixing of chemicals and energy that cradled life on Earth, to the 
earliest self-replicating organisms and the profusion of life.
<P>
Recent discoveries from diverse disciplines attest that life is 
remarkably hardy and that each step in the chain of ORIGINS occurred 
surprisingly quickly.  Discoveries in just the past few years provide 
the first scientific basis for believing that life may be widespread in 
the universe, in our solar system and beyond. We also have a new 
comprehension of the development of the universe, its constituent 
galaxies and stars, the number and variety of planetary systems,
and the processes that shape them. For the first time in history, we 
have achieved the level of understanding and technical capability 
necessary to fill in "missing links" along the chain of ORIGINS by 
exploring on the Earth and outward in space, in the present and backward 
in time. To do so, we need to understand more about the processes 
leading to the origin of life, about habitats suitable for life, and 
about the origins of the building blocks of the universe.
<P>
Answers to these questions are within reach. Major advances over the 
next 15 years can be realized by continuing and building upon the 
multidisciplinary programs that have brought us to this point. The 
current and planned space science programs of NASA begin the next steps 
in the quest for ORIGINS and pose the technology challenges needed for 
subsequent steps. Missions now underway and in planning, including 
upgraded instrumentation for the Hubble Space Telescope, the Advanced X-
ray Astrophysics Facility, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, the 
Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, the Mars Surveyor 
series, and other planetary and space astronomy and physics
projects, will offer powerful tools for advancing the ORIGINS program. 
At the same time, while the ORIGINS challenge provides a unifying core 
for the space science program, neighboring disciplines address important 
problems of their own, and may unexpectedly contribute directly as was 
the case for the recent analyses of Martian meteorites. These related 
activities span the broad panoply of laboratory, field, and theoretical 
research conducted by NASA.  Existing NASA planning processes, 
coordinated with NSF and other agencies and using peer review, are the 
best way to define the details and priorities of these programs.
<P>
Investment in a balanced and diversified ORIGINS program will yield a 
steady return of significant findings and, inevitably, major surprises. 
Over the next 15 years, scientists and the public could share the 
excitement of discoveries such as:
<P><UL>
<LI>when and how primitive life emerged and flourished on Earth;
<P>
<LI>whether the Martian meteorites found on Earth or rocks returned from
Mars confirm that life existed on that planet;
<P>
<LI>the presence of a liquid water ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa that
could harbor primitive forms of life;
<P>
<LI>the detection of dozens of planetary systems, including some which
may be conducive to life as we know it;
<P>
<LI>sharp pictures of planet-forming disks, infant stars and the growth
of galaxies;
<P>
<LI>more detailed histories of the early stages of the universe, 
including maps of the dark matter seeds that grew to form galaxies.
</UL><P>
The Hubble Space Telescope images of embryonic solar systems and the 
evidence for possible past life on Mars have aroused intense public 
interest in the ORIGINS of the universe and its contents. These 
breakthroughs are the astonishing returns from years of investment in 
many scientific disciplines. The ORIGINS quest informs, excites and 
inspires the public. Its outcome could well have as profound an effect 
on human thought as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions.

<P><B>RECENT ADVANCES AND NEXT STEPS</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extraordinary time for civilization
and this nation. For the first time, we have achieved the level of understanding
and the technical capability that allow us to grasp the full meaning of
our origins, our history, and our context in the universe. For as long as
humans have been able to think, we have been explorers, inventors, and dreamers,
pondering how the universe came to be as it is, how the richness of life
on this planet developed, and whether life on Earth is unique in the cosmos.
In the past, these questions were answered by speculation and myth. Now
they can be addressed with the scientific soundness of evidence and quantitative
analysis.<BR>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past several years, indeed the past several
months, scientists have reaped breathtaking returns from years of investment
in basic science, from cosmology to microbiology, from astrophysics to analytic
chemistry. Diverse disciplines are converging in a remarkable and unprecedented
way to a focus on understanding our origins in the broadest and the deepest
terms. For example, it is only recently that biologists have begun to understand
the diversity and ubiquity of life forms in extreme environments on Earth,
that astronomers have detected the first planets outside the solar system,
and that cosmologists have measured the subtle ripples in the early universe
which formed all present galaxies and stars. In these discoveries can now
be perceived a chain of development that stretches from the instant that
time began to our pondering these issues today.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following narrative is intended to accompany
and elaborate the briefing book presentation of the findings of the 1996
Space Science Workshop. The narrative is divided into four major sections:
Life on Earth, Our Solar System as a Home for Life, Other Solar Systems,
and The Universe. Each of these main sections provides additional information
about recent advances and next steps in its area.</P>

<P><B>RECENT ADVANCES</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NASA exobiology program broadly addresses
the origin and evolution of life in the universe, and has been instrumental
in providing the basis of our new and exciting understanding that life may
be widespread in the universe. The program begins with the cosmic origins
and evolution of those elements necessary for life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur). It looks inward to the natures and limits
of environments capable of supporting existing life on Earth and the geological
record of past life and its environments; it studies by means of new molecular
biological tools the evolutionary relationships among existing organisms,
thereby influencing our understanding of the nature of the common evolutionary
ancestor of all known terrestrial life forms; and it investigates the characteristics
that may have allowed the appearance of the first self-replicating &quot;life-like&quot;
forms. Finally, the program again looks outward to identify and investigate
extraterrestrial bodies on which environments potentially favorable to life
exist or have existed in the past.</P>

<P>UBIQUITY OF LIFE ON EARTH WHEREVER LIQUID WATER AND USABLE ENERGY ARE
PRESENT</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent explorations of a number of extreme (extraordinary)
environments on Earth reveal that diverse microbial life forms can be detected
and even observed in surprisingly large numbers. These bacteria are able
to thrive on unusual sources of energy and under conditions that do not
support the growth of larger organisms. Nearly every moist environment that
has been examined contains some form of life. At temperatures exceeding
100 C, deep-sea vents spew forth a diverse microbial biota, some of which
can grow by metabolizing such unlikely sources of energy as hydrogen and
sulfur. Deep subsurface terrestrial aquifers contain bacteria that consume
energy sources released from basalt. Some hot springs contain a diverse
and ancient microbiota yet to be cultivated. Some very acidic hot springs
with temperatures near boiling are inhabited by bacteria that consume sulfur.
In the extremely cold dry valleys of Antarctica microorganisms are found
growing within rocks. Other bacteria found in abundance in evaporitic basins
can grow only in the presence of saturated salt. The recent discoveries
of life in such diverse environments as these on Earth greatly expand the
range of habitats that can be considered suitable targets for life-detection
missions on other planets.</P>

<P>IMPORTANT NEW INSIGHTS INTO RIBONUCLEIC ACID (RNA)-BASED CHEMICAL PROCESSES
AS LIFE'S BEGINNINGS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important new approach to the investigation
of the origin of life is based on the proposal that the most important biopolymer
in the first life forms was RNA. In this conjecture, RNA has two central
functions: the storage of genetic information and the catalysis of chemical
processes essential to maintaining life. This primitive life would have
been much simpler than contemporary living organisms, which are based on
proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), lipids and carbohydrates. Recent
laboratory studies have provided strong support for the idea that early
life was RNA-based. It has been demonstrated that RNA can be formed from
its monomers under prebiotic reaction conditions in a process catalyzed
by clay minerals. The RNA prepared in this way has been shown to have the
ability to store information. In a second set of studies it has been demonstrated
that RNA with one type of catalytic activity can mutate into an RNA with
a different structure and different catalytic function. These evolution
studies, carried out in test tubes in the absence of life, suggest that
life based on RNA was capable of evolving to contemporary life based on
DNA and proteins.</P>

<P>DERIVATION OF EXISTING LIFE ON EARTH FROM MICROBES THAT LIVED AT HIGH
TEMPERATURES IN THE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past decade, biologists have enjoyed
remarkable success in constructing the &quot;Universal Tree of Life,&quot;
a family tree of all living organisms. The tree is based on the fundamental
insight that all organisms contain subcellular components called ribosomes
and that all ribosomes contain structurally similar components made of RNA.
By comparing the sequence order of the building blocks in the DNA that provides
the blueprint for these RNA structures, biologists now have a means of evaluating
the evolutionary connectedness of organisms as dissimilar as baker's yeast,
blue whales and bacteria. The emerging family tree shows clearly that the
plants and animals of our experience form only the tips of the Universal
Tree. Organisms found on the tree's innermost branches-the microbes-are
those most likely to retain features that characterized life on the young
Earth. Such organisms live at temperatures near the boiling point of water
and do not use oxygen in cellular processes. In fact, many are killed by
oxygen in even trace amounts. The Universal Tree thus suggests that our
earliest known ancestors were microorganisms that lived in hot, oxygen-free
environments such as exist today in the hot springs at Yellowstone National
Park. Continuing study of environments as exotic as deep-sea hydrothermal
systems or as familiar as farm ponds also indicates, however, that we still
know very little about the biology and diversity of microbial life on our
own planet.</P>

<P>EARTH LIFE ORIGINATED VERY EARLY AND EVOLVED VERY RAPIDLY</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the past 5 years, NASA-supported research
has resulted in discovery of the oldest firm evidence of life on Earth,
a diverse assemblage of 11 species of microscopic organisms cellularly preserved
in Western Australia's sedimentary rocks nearly 3.5 billion years old. These
fossil microbes appear to have been relatively advanced, perhaps including
oxygen-producing photosynthetic cyanobacteria, and life therefore must have
originated much earlier. In recent months, this supposition has been supported
by other NASA-sponsored studies that resulted in detection in 3.85-billion-year-old
rocks of southwestern Greenland of graphitic carbonaceous matter that has
an isotopic signature suggestive of a biological origin. If this carbon
is a product of life, living systems must have originated quite rapidly,
because Earth, like the Moon and Mars, was subjected to intense meteoritic
bombardment from the time of its formation, 4.5 billion years ago, to about
3.9 billion years ago, including periodic impacts of bodies so large as
to have vaporized the early ocean and sterilized the early planet. Life
on our planet originated early, evidently easily, and evolved extraordinarily
rapidly.</P>

<P><B>NEXT STEPS</B></P>

<P>SURVEY THE EARTH'S BIOSPHERE AND MAP OUT THE &quot;UNIVERSAL TREE OF
LIFE&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of diverse and exotic habitats for life
on Earth have shown that living organisms are present wherever liquid water
and a source of energy are available. Life thrives in environments from
hot springs with temperatures above the boiling point of water, to permanently
ice-covered lakes in Antarctica. A significant fraction of Earth's living
creatures live far beneath the surface in oceanic and continental sediments.
In the latter environment, diverse anaerobic communities are supported in
ecosystems driven by geochemically produced hydrogen. The possibility of
such ecological niches on other planetary bodies is compatible with current
knowledge. Exotic habitats must be explored more fully on Earth, so that
the capability of living organisms to adapt to different environments and
the ways in which life has adapted to changing environments can be better
understood.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies using molecular approaches to
establishing genealogical relationships have revolutionized the way we think
about the natural history of life. Using these approaches, it has been possible
to begin to map out the Universal Tree of Life, and this has led to the
conclusion that the most likely common ancestors of existing life were heat-loving,
hydrogen-metabolizing microorganisms. Molecular data gathered using these
same approaches have yielded insights into the yet-undiscovered diversity
of life on Earth. Ribosomal RNA sequences from many natural environments
suggest that only a small fraction of Earth's microbes have been cultured
and identified with respect to their functional roles in nature. Estimates
suggest that as much as 99% of the microbial populations on Earth have yet
to be grown and studied in culture. It will be necessary to map out the
ancestry of the entire range of microbes in order to fully understand the
origin of life on Earth; this will in turn require field studies. Molecular
sequencing will be needed to complete the Universal Tree for all newly discovered
organisms.</P>

<P>ASSEMBLE AN INTEGRATED HISTORY OF LIFE AND THE ENVIRONMENTS FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT
ON EARTH</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Universal Tree is properly read as
a history of life, it can also be understood as a chronicle of Earth's environmental
history, because the presence of microorganisms is closely tied to particular
environmental conditions. Thus, the Universal Tree enables predictions about
the history of both life and environments that can be tested against the
direct history of life and environmental conditions encrypted in the geological
record. Recent discoveries of fossils and new geochemical techniques for
reconstructing past environments indicate that we are finally in a position
to integrate information from comparative biology and the rock record in
a way that will show how our planet and its biota have developed in concert
through 4 billion years of Earth history. Remarkably, the first fossils
date from a period very near to the origin of Earth and soon after a period
of heavy cometary bombardment. These discoveries suggest that the origin
of life was rapid and therefore easy once the terrestrial environment became
relatively benign. The co-evolution of life and the environment will be
a major theme wherever life may be found.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, once life had originated on a
planet it could have been transferred to other worlds by impact processes.
Thus the origins of life may not have been isolated to individual planets.
In recent years, many lunar and martian meteorites have been found on Earth.
One rock from Mars probably falls on Earth each month. Interstellar and
interplanetary dust grains also continuously transfer materials from deep
space to the planets.</P>

<P><B>RECENT ADVANCES</B></P>

<P>THE CHANGING SUN AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE PLANETS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment fusion began in the Sun's core,
the center of the protoplanetary disk of gas and dust was bathed in light,
heat, and energetic ionizing radiation. Evidence in meteorites suggests
that the young Sun also rotated much more rapidly than it does today, generating
a much stronger magnetic field that penetrated into the disk where boulders
were forming from the dust. Observations of stars like the Sun show that
a gaseous &quot;wind&quot; was also produced by the star's interaction with
the disk, in a manner still not understood. This wind may have cleared the
inner part of the planet-forming disk of gas, resulting in the remarkable
differences between the atmospheres of the giant and terrestrial planets.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, the Sun has gradually brightened
by about 30% to its present luminosity, but has declined (by orders of magnitude)
in its production of ionizing ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet radiation.
The Sun's rotation has also slowed, and its wind has subsided to the contemporary
solar wind. As the Sun's evolution proceeded, the planets were affected
by it. Each planetary body seems to record different responses in its atmosphere
and surface. In particular, Venus and Mars show evidence of having lost
large amounts of their original water, rendering these otherwise most Earth-like
of the planets apparently inhospitable to life today. Observations of how
Earth and the other planets currently interact with the various solar outputs,
including light, ionizing radiations and solar wind, provide clues about
the physical processes that the early planets and their atmospheres must
have undergone in response to exposure to the more extreme young Sun.</P>

<P>METEORITE EVIDENCE THAT MICROBIAL LIFE ONCE MAY HAVE EXISTED ON MARS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For centuries Mars has been an object of fascination
as a possible abode of life. The Mariner and Viking images of Mars, taken
two decades ago, showed the planet to be cold and dry today, geologically
active in the recent past, and possessing a much less extreme climate in
more distant epochs. The Viking lander failed to find any evidence of organics,
but rather documented a chemically reactive surface.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important recent developments
in planetary science is strong evidence that laboratories and museums contain
a number of rocks from Mars which arrived on Earth as meteorites. These
rocks were blasted from Mars by large impacts and spent some time in space
before they came within Earth's gravitational attraction and fell to the
ground as meteorites. Currently, 12 of the collected meteorites are believed
to have come from Mars. Half of these fell in Antarctica, and most were
collected in the annual expeditions of a joint NASA-NSF program. One was
collected by a similar Japanese program. While all of these meteorites are
igneous rock, most show evidence of low-temperature alteration by liquid
water, and the evidence shows that some or most of this alteration occurred
on Mars prior to the ejection of the rock into space. The oldest (4.5 billion
years) of these meteorites (ALH84001) has recently been found to contain
some features that could be interpreted as evidence of early microbial life
on Mars. These features include the presence of organic chemicals, some
of which may be from Mars, some very small iron oxide and iron sulfide grains
that are very similar to those known to be made by microorganisms on Earth,
and shapes and forms resembling fossil and living microorganisms on Earth,
except that the forms found in the Mars meteorite are generally much smaller
than known Earth microorganisms and microfossils. While none of these observations
and interpretations is definitive for early microbial life on Mars, taken
together they provide a strong impetus for more detailed study of the existing
martian meteorites as well as for an intensive search for new ones in Antarctica.<BR>
</P>

<P>PRESENCE OF THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE (WATER AND ENERGY SOURCES) IN VARIOUS
SOLAR SYSTEM LOCATIONS, NOW OR IN THE PAST</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know when and where habitable zones may have
existed in the past in the solar system, it is necessary to know when and
where liquid water has been present. Over the past 4.5 billion years, the
Sun's luminosity has increased as it has matured. For the inner solar system,
the habitable zone has moved as solar luminosity has increased and the composition
of planetary atmospheres has evolved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is likely to have been quite different
for the outer solar system. Here, frictional heating of planetary interiors
due to tidal flexing reduces the importance of solar luminosity as an energy
source, and liquid water environments could have been stable for a much
longer period of solar system history. Liquid water may be present on icy
satellites of the jovian planets where tidal forces or the decay of radioactive
elements in their interiors may heat them above the melting point of ice.
The concept of tidal heating is best illustrated by Io, one of Jupiter's
four, so-called Galilean satellites. Io is, undoubtedly, the most active
volcanic body in the solar system. The interior of Io constantly erupts
molten sulfur as the gravitational attraction of Jupiter and its moons tugs
on the small satellite, causing its outer shell to flex and crack.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the environment of Io can hardly be considered
a clement medium for life, this may not be true for its icy neighbors, especially
Europa. The water-rich icy surface of Europa is quite smooth and free of
mountains or craters, suggesting that it has a liquid interior. But the
spectacular images obtained during a recent close flyby of the Galileo spacecraft
revealed that Europa has a complex, fractured surface where plates of icy
crust have pulled apart, allowing darker material to well up from below,
filling the cracks between. The origin of the darker material is the subject
of an ongoing debate. An exciting proposition is that this material is organic-rich
ice that formed when liquid water from a subterranean ocean welled up between
diverging plates of ice. This suggests the possibility of a subsurface organic-rich
ocean, sustained by the gravitational heating of the interior. Where there
is liquid water and the right mix of organic molecules, there is the possibility
for life. Hydrothermal vents, similar to those discovered on the deep ocean
floors on Earth, could exist on the floor of a Europan ocean. On Earth,
such places teem with microbial life and, even in the absence of sunlight
for photosynthesis, are able to sustain communities of many complex higher
forms of life. To test such ideas, more information is needed about Europa's
surface composition and interior structure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life-supporting zones may also exist within the
interiors of other jovian moons. Ganymede, one of Europa's neighbors that
is thought to be almost half water by weight, is also covered by an icy
crust that has the appearance of a cracked egg shell. Rifted mountain ranges
encircle the surface of Ganymede for hundreds of kilometers, testifying
to a past history of tectonic activity. Could Ganymede also harbor subsurface
pools of liquid water where prebiotic chemical evolution may have led to
some form of life? Similar questions can be asked of Enceladus, one of Saturn's
moons, where tidal heating may maintain warm interior zones of liquid water,
and of Neptune's moon, Triton. Subsurface hydrothermal processes may have
operated even within the interiors of large asteroids.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn's giant moon Titan, larger than the planet
Mercury, possesses a thick nitrogen atmosphere with abundant methane and
other organic molecules. A rich chemistry powered by sunlight in the upper
atmosphere produces hazes that hide the surface below, on which occasional
pools of liquid water (created by impact or volcanism) undergo brief episodes
of chemistry as yet unknown but perhaps on pathways toward life. Titan is
the best extant planet-sized analog for Earth before it held life, and NASA's
upcoming Cassini-Huygens mission will reveal the nature of its surface and
lower atmosphere.</P>

<P>PRIMITIVE REMNANTS OF THE FORMATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials that have remained relatively unmodified
since the birth of the solar system provide the best opportunity to understand
the past and unravel how the planets formed. Such materials must have been
stored far from the sun's warmth in bodies too small to be heated by internal
geological processes. Comets, asteroids, and the newly discovered Kuiper
Belt objects fulfill these requirements and enable us to explore the internal
chemical beginnings of the solar system.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comets are small dark bodies composed of a mixture
of organic materials, refractory grains, and ices, predominantly water.
Vast numbers reside at great distances from the Sun, but occasionally one
is nudged into the inner solar system where it becomes more accessible to
observation from Earth. Asteroids were born in the transition region between
the rocky planets and the gaseous giants of the outer solar system. Because
of their small sizes, asteroids and the meteorites that derive from them
are relatively pristine and so may provide clues to the origin of the terrestrial
planets.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, more than three dozen
objects with radii of only 50 to 200 km have been detected in the Kuiper
Belt at the outer edge of the observable solar system. Pluto itself might
be considered the largest of these Kuiper Belt objects. They represent the
most primitive remnants of planetary accretion, fragments that were not
captured or scattered by the growing giant planets. As such, they may contain
the best chemical records of the solar system's original makeup, including
delicate organic and volatile molecules from the molecular cloud out of
which the solar system formed.</P>

<P><B>NEXT STEPS</B></P>

<P>CHARACTERIZE THE SUN'S HISTORY AS IT INFLUENCES THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
OF LIFE; UNDERSTAND THE VARIABILITY OF THE SUN AS A STAR</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun has evolved over 4.5 billion years from
its initial state as a rapidly rotating, strongly magnetic, violently active
star with a massive solar wind. During this time, the Sun has contracted
and grown hotter as hydrogen in the core fused into helium, and it is now
about 30% brighter than in its youth. The problem today is to understand
the convection and circulation within the Sun, because it is these fluid-like
motions that generate and manipulate the magnetic fields that control the
variable activity at the visible surface. This solar variability includes
sunspots, flares, coronal mass ejections, x-ray emissions, and variations
in total brightness. Precision observations of the activity and brightness
of the Sun and monitoring of a large number of other solar-type stars are
essential if we are to fill in the general picture of how stars like the
Sun behave from birth to death. At the same time, the techniques of helioseismology
are making the convection and circulation within the Sun available for direct
study. Helioseismology, together with high-resolution studies of the motions
and magnetic fields at the Sun's surface and simultaneous optical, ultraviolet,
and x-ray observations, will help to guide the theoretical studies and modeling
needed to understand the past, present, and future of the Sun and other
stars like it.</P>

<P>CHARACTERIZE THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT, CLIMATIC EVOLUTION, AND GEOLOGIC
HISTORY OF MARS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars holds a special place in both planetary
science and exobiology. Since Mars is the planet most like ours, the synergistic
study of the two worlds may help unlock some of Earth's secrets. Even prior
to the discovery of possible signs of past life in the meteorite ALH84001,
exobiologists have found Mars most interesting as a place to trace the chemical
evolutionary pathways that ultimately led to life on Earth. NASA's new Mars
Surveyor program will at its outset survey the global elemental, geochemical,
and physical characteristics of Mars, with an emphasis on volatiles; this
is useful both for comparative studies with Earth and as a basis for deciding
the most likely abodes of life, if any, past and present. NASA also plans
to place a series of landers, including rovers, on the surface; these will
carry out simple scientific investigations and will provide a testbed for
the technologies needed for sample return. Once promising sites for possible
life have been identified, emphasis should shift to the surface exploration
of these favorable locations to seek more clear-cut evidence of past conditions,
and to search for more direct confirmation of past life such as the presence
of biogenic elements and compounds, and anomalous isotopic fractionations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulfilling the primary objectives of the atmospheric
sciences and of geophysics will require the deployment of a network of long-lived
monitoring stations. Meteorological stations, when combined with simultaneous
sounding from orbit, will provide essential data on the martian weather
and will lead to much-improved general circulation models. These stations
can also ascertain the seasonal cycles of carbon dioxide, water, and dust
and thereby clarify the processes by which Mars's layered sediments are
deposited. If the polar laminae can be dated in situ, a chronology of martian
climate change can be developed. In addition, accurate determinations of
rare-gas and isotopic abundances, plus estimates of water trapped in the
crust, may be useful in helping to characterize Mars's ancient climate.
These same stations could transmit seismic data to elucidate the Red Planet's
internal structure and could include sophisticated geochemical laboratories
to assay local materials.</P>

<P>RETURN TO EARTH SOME WELL-CHOSEN MARS SAMPLES TO ELUCIDATE ITS PAST AND
TO ENABLE A SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF BOTH FOSSIL AND EXTANT LIFE</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the recently announced findings from the
Antarctic meteorite ALH84001 are not proof of life on Mars, they have yielded
strong evidence that both hydrocarbons and minerals deposited by water are
in ancient martian materials. It now appears that the critical ingredients
required for the emergence of life-organics, water, and energy-have existed
in the martian environment throughout its history. The expectation that
life developed on Mars has therefore been significantly heightened.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important immediate steps in pursuing the possibility
of martian life are to expand the search for martian meteorites and to intensify
the analysis of these meteorites. Beyond this, the crucial task is to collect
well-chosen rock samples from Mars and bring them back to Earth for analysis.
This task should be carried out in several steps. The first is to obtain
a global-scale understanding of martian geologic and climatic history as
it relates to life. This step has begun with the launch of the Mars Global
Surveyor spacecraft. The next is to intensify the search for potential sites
of past and present life. Mars Global Surveyor will begin this search, and
future missions can extend it. Once good sites have been located, robotic
vehicles can be sent to the martian surface to search for the most promising
samples, collect them, and return them to Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars could have both fossil evidence for life
and extant life itself. But because the present martian surface environment
is so harsh, evidence of fossil life will probably be much easier to find.
Promising locations for fossil life can be identified by planned orbital
missions, and promising samples can be collected by relatively simple surface
vehicles. Extant life, however, may exist only deep below the surface, and
hence may be difficult to locate and sample. The search for fossil life
therefore can and should precede the search for extant life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any returned samples, it will be essential
to have a facility where they can be received and processed, and state-of-the-art
laboratories were they can be analyzed. Adequate receiving facilities do
not exist now, and adequate laboratories are scarce; both need development
before the first samples are returned.</P>

<P>EXPLORE POTENTIAL HABITATS ELSEWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM: EUROPA AND
TITAN</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Mars, most of the solar system is inhospitable
to life because it is too hot or too cold, or too dry. A possible exception
is Jupiter's moon Europa, now being scrutinized by the Galileo spacecraft.
Beneath its icy crust may lie a shallow ocean kept fluid by tidal heating,
which may, as a result of ancient and continuing bombardment by organic-rich
cometary materials, contain the ingredients for life. Saturn's moon Titan
is known, from Voyager and ground-based observations, to contain a wealth
of complex organic molecules in its dense atmosphere and is suspected to
have at least puddles of organic material on it surface. This satellite's
complement of prebiotic and proto-biologic molecules could provide a valuable
benchmark in understanding the development of terrestrial life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its nominal mission, Galileo will provide
high-resolution imaging of only a small fraction of Europa's surface because
of communications constraints imposed by the spacecraft's unfurled antenna.
Observations of the enigmatic satellite, at both visual and mineralogically
diagnostic near-infrared wavelengths, will be substantially enhanced during
a proposed extended Galileo mission, which would flyby Europa a dozen additional
times at close range and various latitudes. These close encounters would
significantly improve the characterization of the satellite's surface geology
and geophysics, but would not allow any complex chemistry to be discerned.
A lander, carrying chemical laboratories, will ultimately be necessary to
unravel the nature of the surface if the global orbital reconnaissance indicates
some promise for biological activity; site selection for this lander would
be based on the same principles as site selection at Mars.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the Cassini-Huygens mission, should
the surface of Titan prove rich in complex organic molecules, follow-on
missions to detect the extent and complexity of Titan's organic chemistry
could reveal preserves of molecules in the hazy boundary between the biological
and nonbiological domains. The goal is to understand the level of chemical
or possibly biochemical complexity achieved in this natural environment.</P>

<P>ANALYZE PRIMITIVE BODIES TO UNDERSTAND THE CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS, PROCESSES,
AND PLANETARY CONDITIONS LEADING TO LIFE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemistry that began with the Big Bang, continued
in stars now dead, and still influences the properties of the clouds of
gas and dust from which new stars are born is the starting point for the
raw materials of life. How was this material transformed as the solar system
began and planets formed? From where in the solar system did Earth receive
its massive store of water and organic molecules during the first 10% of
its history? Was it from nearby asteroid-like materials, or from early comets
streaking inward from the realm of the giant planets?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the clues may be locked in primitive
bodies such as asteroids and comets, and in the vast reservoir of the Kuiper
Belt. A small fraction of Kuiper Belt objects are perturbed, over time,
into orbits that bring these bodies into the inner solar system as comets.
Early in the history of the solar system similarly scattered fragments may
have seeded Earth with water and organic molecules. A crucial next step
to understanding whether Earth's oceans and organic store came from this
outer realm is reconnaissance of the Kuiper Belt using the most sophisticated
chemical remote-sensing techniques available, first from large ground-based
telescopes. These observations can limit the range of possible surface materials,
but can yield only averages as results. Ultimately, flyby, rendezvous, or
sample-return missions will be required. In situ measurements and complementary
theoretical studies will enable us to determine the specific regions of
the presolar nebula that are sampled by particular meteorites. This will
enable us to construct a general picture of planetary accumulation processes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flyby of Pluto, which would complete the initial
reconnaissance of the solar system, has been the subject of recent studies.</P>

<P>OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS AROUND OTHER STARS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the last year, the discovery that at least
a dozen ordinary stars have planet-like companions has transformed the search
for other planetary systems. The presence of these companions is implied
by ground-based telescope observations that some stars &quot;wobble,&quot;
presumably as a result of the gravitational pull of an orbiting object or
objects. In addition, the inferred orbits and masses of the newly discovered
companions are quite unlike those predicted by theoreticians. All have masses
at least as large as that of Jupiter, for example. However, their detection
suggests that we are on the threshold of being able to observe other planets.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>NEXT STEPS</B></P>

<P>DETERMINE HOW STELLAR AND PLANETARY SYSTEMS FORM AND EVOLVE</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding of the process of star and planetary
system formation has improved significantly in recent decades, in large
part as a result of NASA programs that encouraged the study of primitive
solar system materials and supported observational and theoretical investigations
of star-forming regions. Other agencies, such as NSF, have funded complementary,
ground-based observations at near-infrared and millimeter wavelengths, leading
to a perspective that intimately connects the formation of stars and potential
planetary systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars are born in dense, dusty, and consequently
dark clouds of molecular hydrogen. How do these clouds form and survive,
and what controls their fragmentation into progressively smaller clumps
in which aggregates of stars, or even individual stars, are formed? Clarifying
this process would be a giant stride along the path to understanding the
provenance of stars that, like the Sun, are capable of sustaining life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is ample observational evidence that most
protostars are embedded in and developing from highly flattened, rotating
disks of material. It now seems clear that these protostellar disks are
the switching stations for material on its journey from interstellar clouds
to stars and planetary systems. Disk properties, and their variation with
age, strongly affect the nature of any planetary system that may subsequently
develop. Overall disk properties, such as mass and angular momentum, are
accessible to ground-based observational study, but very little information
is currently in hand about their detailed structure and the way in which
it changes as the disk and its associated star age. However, an understanding
of these details is key to determining why some stars eventually emerge
alone, why some have one or more stellar companions, why some may be accompanied
by planets, and what kind of planets these will be. High-spatial- and high-spectral-resolution
observations, making use of interferometric techniques in the infrared-to-millimeter
wavelength regions of the spectrum, will be critical in probing the origins
and evolution of these potentially planet-forming disks.</P>

<P>DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination of the frequency of occurrence
and the overall structure of planetary systems around stars other than the
Sun is now within reach. For the first time, it is possible to consider
putting to the observational test theories of how the solar system formed.
Detection of planetary systems is a demanding observational task, requiring
both much more accurate instrumentation than was available a decade ago
and new generations of ground- and space-based telescopes. While astronomers
have recently used such systems to discover substellar-mass companions of
several nearby Sun-like stars, the exact nature of these newly discovered
companions remains unknown. To advance in this area, basic physical parameters
such as mass and orbital character must be measured for a statistically
significant sample. Current theories can then be improved or modified. Ground-based
programs will be useful here, although only space-based instruments will
be capable of detecting and studying planets that are similar to Earth in
mass and surface conditions.</P>

<P>FIND AND STUDY POTENTIALLY LIFE-SUPPORTING PLANETS ORBITING OTHER STARS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is general agreement that liquid water
is essential to life as known on Earth. A search for life-supporting planets
is therefore in reality an effort to detect planets that have suitably dense
atmospheres and evidence of liquid water. These candidates would be expected
to orbit their associated suns at distances where surface temperatures range
between the freezing and boiling points of water. Further, their masses
are unlikely to be very different from that of Earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detection of such small and dim planets,
located relatively close to their central star, is a daunting challenge
that lies beyond the capability of existing telescopes. However, planets
emit most of their energy at infrared wavelengths, and the energy radiated
by a Sun-like star is less in the infrared than it is in the visible region
of the spectrum. Studies suggest that it would be possible to search for,
and subsequently study, life-supporting planets around other stars using
a space-based, infrared observing system. Candidates for examination will
be stars known from previous, less sensitive searches to have planetary
companions. The goal will be to obtain a &quot;family portrait&quot; of
another sun with its retinue of planetary companions. The long-term goal
would be to detect and study Earth-sized planets with a view to determining
atmospheric temperature and composition, and the possibility for life. Such
studies will require innovative techniques, most likely interferometry carried
out from platforms in space.</P>

<P><A NAME="universe"></A></P>

<P><A HREF="#top">Return to Top of File</A></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>The Universe</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>RECENT ADVANCES</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the origin of the universe, of
galaxies, and of stars has long been one of the central themes of NASA's
space science program. Indeed, the 1990s have been the most productive period
in the history of space astronomy; our theory of how the universe originated
has been dramatically affirmed, and the long chain of events leading from
the Big Bang to the present epoch is coming into sharper and deeper focus.</P>

<P>OBSERVATIONS OF INFANT STARS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now possible to fill in many chapters in
the story of star formation. Stars are born in dense clouds of interstellar
gas; the most massive burn their nuclear fuel, age, and ultimately die in
enormous explosions called supernovae; these supernovae scatter ashes of
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and heavier elements from the star's nuclear cremation
into interstellar space; over time, this debris cools and collapses to form
new stars. By contrast, the lightest stars have not yet had time to go through
this cycle even once. Observations of massive stars elucidate the production
of different elements over the history of the galaxy. The existence of many
slowly evolving, lower-mass stars gives an opportunity to study star formation
over a range of protostellar ages and to characterize the birth of stars
like the sun.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding of the processes that take place
inside stars is already quite well developed. There is, however, a paucity
of information about the physical and chemical processes that take place
in interstellar gas and dust. With time, the properties of these interstellar
clouds change significantly, often by way of chemical reactions that are
quite different from those known in terrestrial laboratories. In particular,
a rich smorgasbord of often unfamiliar organic molecules, some of which
may have a central role in prebiotic evolution, are actually observed in
interstellar clouds. Detailed studies of interstellar chemistry are now
under way to clarify how and when these molecules are formed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very recent Hubble Space Telescope optical images
of the Eagle Nebula, a part of the Milky Way galaxy long known as a stellar
nursery, illustrate the complex processes that transform cold interstellar
gas clouds into new stars. The surface of the cloud is contorted into a
series of columns that, themselves, display smaller protuberances. The complicated
morphology of this surface, the boundary between a cold, dusty, and consequently
opaque region and one that is hot and transparent to visible light, is due
to photoevaporation by ultraviolet light from nearby hot stars that have
already emerged from the clouds where they formed. Infrared radiation can
penetrate the dark clouds that obscure forming stars from optical view,
and an infrared image of the same region displays for the first time a myriad
of new stars in and around these clouds.</P>

<P>ORIGIN OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stars, which emitted the first light,
must have been made from gas that emerged as essentially pure hydrogen and
helium from the Big Bang, uncontaminated with heavy elements. Theory indicates
that it would be difficult for stars to form under these conditions. However,
once the process has happened once, it takes only a few million years for
nuclear reactions to produce carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other heavy elements,
and for supernova explosions to disperse them, facilitating the birth of
succeeding generations of stars. Recent measurements made with the Keck
telescope in Hawaii have shown that creation of the elements began when
the universe was one-tenth its present age, while some elements formed even
earlier.</P>

<P>MANY MORE GALAXIES THAN EXPECTED</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out in space to the most distant observable
luminous objects is looking back in time. Astronomers are now able to see
galaxies as they were less than 2 billion years after the fiery birth of
the universe, long before the formation of the solar system. In the past
year, a very long observation with the Hubble Space Telescope of a tiny
patch of the sky near the Big Dipper has indicated the existence of many
more galaxies than previously anticipated. This patch was chosen because
optical pictures made from the ground indicated that this region was as
empty as possible of foreground objects. It offered an unobstructed view
of the faintest and most distant objects that could be found.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resembling a drop of water drawn from a tide
pool and viewed under a powerful microscope, the little patch was discovered
to be teeming with galaxies, self-organized islands that each contain billions
of stars. It is estimated that a comparable survey of the whole sky would
reveal about 100 billion galaxies, far more than previously expected, in
a rich variety of shapes and colors, some surprisingly similar to our immediate
neighbors, and some in forms that have never been seen before.</P>

<P>THE BEGINNING OF STRUCTURE IN THE UNIVERSE</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ground-based observers, the microwave radiation
from the ancient universe looks the same in all directions; astronomers
describe it as &quot;smooth.&quot; A major question related to origins is
how the galaxies, stars, and planets of the present universe emerged. Where
are the ripples that would presage the structure evident today?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space observations made with the Cosmic Background
Explorer have provided very precise maps of radiation emitted shortly after
the Big Bang, when the universe was only some 300,000 years old, and much
smaller. They show tiny ripples in the smoothness, the cosmic seeds from
which present structure took shape. These galactic antecedents, the most
primitive objects in nature that are likely to be observed directly, are
immense clouds of hot gas. Most importantly, they are thought to contain
a great amount of still-unobserved internal structure that might shed light
on fundamental problems of cosmic evolution. In particular, they might lead
to a better understanding of why the measured masses of galaxies, and even
clusters of galaxies, disagree with the amount of mass that can be seen
in the form of stars. In fact, most of the mass of the universe is in essentially
invisible form, termed &quot;dark matter.&quot; Much contemporary research
is devoted to locating, identifying, and characterizing dark matter.</P>

<P><B>NEXT STEPS</B></P>

<P>UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF STARS AND PLANETS</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravitational collapse of gas clouds is undoubtedly
a key element in the formation of stars and planets, but the process is
still shrouded in mystery. The division of labor between gravity and other
forces, such as magnetic fields, stellar winds, and shock waves, is unclear.
Both space- and ground-based observations during the past decade have opened
up star and planet formation to detailed investigation. These deeply intertwined
subjects together constitute one of the most important and active areas
of contemporary astrophysics, linking astronomy to the planetary and geological
sciences.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now possible to pose well-defined questions
for space programs. Key areas for study include the detailed characterization
of the disks that surround young stars and may go on to form planetary systems,
the evolution of the dense molecular clouds that are apparently the source
of all star formation in a spiral galaxy like ours, and the role of supernovae
and other violent events in triggering star formation in molecular clouds.
Space infrared observations will enable astronomers to draw aside the dusty
cloaks surrounding local stellar nurseries like those in the Eagle Nebula.
Measurements of the long-wavelength radiation from gas molecules in the
clouds will help characterize such properties as density and temperature.
Indirectly, this information could help in determining what environments
are hospitable to prebiotic molecules and compounds. The Stratospheric Observatory
for Infrared Astronomy and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility will permit
long strides in these areas.</P>

<P>DETERMINE HOW GALAXIES WERE FORMED</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several steps are required to reach the goal
of understanding the origin and development of galaxies like our own. Measurements
at longer infrared wavelengths are needed to observe starlight emitted from
galaxies at earlier epochs when the universe was a mere billion years old,
less than ten percent of its present age. Next generation observations will
be carried out by upgraded instrumentation on the Hubble Space Telescope,
and later by the Space Infrared Telescope Facility. Were these galaxies
assembled out of smaller subunits or did they form &quot;in toto?&quot;
There are already tantalizing hints that the answer to this question depends
strongly on the type of galaxy, whether it is &quot;elliptical&quot; or
&quot;spiral.&quot; The answer should also help explain why the galaxy that
we inhabit turned out to be a spiral rather than an elliptical one.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the chemical elements must be
traced back to much earlier times. X-ray observations from space will open
an additional important window on the early universe. For example, the Advanced
X-ray Astrophysics Facility will enable analysis of the chemical composition
of gas ejected from galaxies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking farther into the future, the deployment
of a spaceborne optical interferometer could revolutionize understanding
of cosmic origins through accurate measurements of the ages of the oldest
stars in our galaxy-which must be younger than the universe. It would also
enable measurement with exquisite accuracy of the motions of star in the
outer parts of our own galaxy and thereby establish its dark matter content.
Finally, the unprecedented microarcsecond resolution would help uncover
the mysteries of active galactic nuclei by allowing the direct measurement
of motions in their central regions.</P>

<P>UNCOVER THE HISTORY OF STRUCTURE IN THE UNIVERSE</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery of cosmic seeds, the faint ripples
in the intensity of the cosmic background radio waves across the sky, carries
the quest for the origin of structure in nature back to the beginning of
the universe. The ripples reflect the presence of immense clouds of hot
gas and dark matter with a great amount of still-unobserved internal structure,
and bear on some of the fundamental problems of cosmic evolution. These
include questions about how primitive gas clouds collapsed under the action
of gravity to form the early galaxies and clusters of galaxies currently
observed, how much invisible or dark matter exists in the universe today,
and whether the ultimate fate of the universe is indefinite expansion or
inexorable collapse. The Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility will enable
estimates of the mass of hot gas in the most distant clusters of galaxies,
and hence assays of their dark matter fraction. Since these clusters occupy
a region so huge that normal matter cannot separate from the mysterious
dark matter, they should represent a fair sample of all of the material
contents of the entire universe, and provide key information about the birth
of galaxies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microwave features 30-times smaller than those
observed by the Cosmic Background Explorer could have been formed by delicate
enhancements in mass density, tiny gravitational depressions into which
matter drains while the universe expands. They grow to form the giant clusters
and fronts clearly visible in the distribution of galaxies today. Theory
predicts that it should be possible to relate the microwave ripples to the
local distribution of galaxies and dark matter, and also to the size, curvature,
and age of the today's universe, in a quantitative manner. The stage is
being set for a lively confrontation between observations of the ancient
and the modern world, spanning the universe's &quot;dark age&quot; when
the cosmic clock advanced from a million to a billion years. The next step
observationally will be taken by the Microwave Anisotropy Probe, which will
measure the ripples in the microwave background radiation in more detail
and with much higher sensitivity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of these primitive clouds of gas might
seem to lie beyond scientific inquiry, because at epochs earlier than 100,000
years after the Big Bang the universe was so dense and hot that it was highly
opaque, and direct observations are impossible. However, one of the boldest
hypotheses of modern science, the theory of cosmological inflation, plausibly
attributes the ultimate origin of the clouds to microscopic random fluctuations
amplified by a huge factor during an epoch of explosive expansion at the
very beginning of the universe. The initial microscopic fluctuations themselves
are not controversial: they are present in all matter at all times, predicted
by quantum mechanics, the universally accepted theory of physics on the
atomic and subatomic scale. The crucial point is that inflation theory makes
specific predictions about the as-yet unobserved internal structure of these
objects, and by a comparison of prediction with observation it may be possible
to extend current ideas of origin and evolution to the very beginning of
space and time.</P>

<P>
<B>Statement on Vice President's Space Science Symposium</B>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore convened a Space Science Symposium in the
Indian Treaty Room of the White House on December 11.  Joined
by Mr. Goldin and Dr. Gibbons, the White House Science Advisor,
the Vice President stayed 45 minutes beyond the scheduled two
hours to meet with 23 scientists and theologians to discuss NASA's
ORIGINS program.
<P>
In a statement released by the White House after the meeting,
the Vice President said, "This discussion today about possible
evidence of life throughout the solar system was exhilarating
and thought provoking.  Today's discussion reinforces how
important it is that we continue to pursue the unknown and that
we as a nation continue to place a high value on protecting and
promoting our scientific enterprise.
<P>
The scientific and technological breakthrough that led to today's
meeting presents extraordinary opportunities for exploration,
observation, contemplation of our universe and the presence of
life within it.  Working with the scientific community, NASA will
continue to pursue a robust space science program that will give
us greater knowledge about our planet and our neighbors.  NASA's
ORIGINS program is a vital contribution to our national and global
pursuit of knowledge."
<P>
The Administration will build on the agenda that was discussed
at the Symposium as they prepare for the bipartisan Space Summit
meeting with Congressional leaders that will be held early next
year.

YEAR-END MESSAGE FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR
</P><P>
You, the employees of NASA, made it happen.
</P><P>
You made 1996 a red-letter year for NASA ... one
that will be remembered for years, decades,
perhaps even centuries. You wrote a chapter in our
Nation's history that will not soon be forgotten.
</P><P>
As you take a well-earned respite for the holiday
season, please take a moment to reflect on NASA's
outstanding accomplishments of the last 12 months.
Just for starters, consider the following:
-The discovery of possible fossilized life in an
asteroid from Mars, providing the most compelling
evidence ever of life on another planet.
-The successful launches of two low-cost
spacecraft, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars
Pathfinder, holding great promise for more
scientific discoveries about the Red Planet.
-Solid progress on the International Space
Station, paving the way for on-orbit assembly to
begin in the coming year.
-A series of near-flawless Space Shuttle docking
missions with the Mir space station, demonstrating
the success and promise of U.S.-Russian space
cooperation.
-Shannon Lucid's incredible 181-day stay in space,
breaking records for an American in space and
capturing the attention and imagination of people
around the world.
-Selection of a builder for the X-33 technology
demonstration vehicle, marking a major step in the
quest for cheaper and more reliable access to
space.
-Successful propulsion-controlled aircraft
landing, demonstrating software that enables a
pilot to land a plane safely with only engine
power.
</P><P>
I could go on and on. The roll-out of the X-36 ...
a series of truly amazing discoveries by the
Hubble Space Telescope that will rewrite science
textbooks ... a plethora of revelations by Galileo
as it explored Jupiter and its moons, including
the exciting finding of ice on Europa.
</P><P>
And when you weren't capturing headlines around
the world with the astounding accomplishments, you
were professionally going about NASA's more
"routine" business: conducting valuable research
about our home planet and its fragile environment;
safely launching and carrying out seven Space
Shuttle missions; and working on technological
breakthroughs that will strengthen the efficiency,
safety, and competitiveness of the American
aviation industry.
</P><P>
You did all of this, and more, during a very
challenging period. You did it as we continued to
reinvent the Agency, making it more relevant to
our society and more responsive to the concerns of
your fellow citizens and taxpayers.
</P><P>
You have my sincere thanks and congratulations for
an unbelievable year.
</P><P>
YOU made it happen.
</P><P>

Administrator

HEADQUARTERS BUYOUT UPDATE
Because we are in the process of coordinating the
details of our Headquarters buyout plan, there is
a need to slightly delay the opening date for
Headquarters employees to apply for buyout.
</P><P>
   We still fully expect that the application period
for the Headquarters buyout will begin during the
week of Thanksgiving, with employees being able to
begin to separate a few days later. Of course,
employees could choose to leave NASA Headquarters
any time between the day separations begin and
February 3, 1997. All employees taking the buyout
must be off NASA Headquarters rolls no later than
February 3, 1997.
</P><P>
   We apologize for this delay in the buyout
opportunity, and will provide more information as
soon as it is available. If you have any
questions, or if we can help you in any way,
please feel free to call Elaine Maxwell at
358-1577.

UPDATE ON NASA BUYOUT
Senior management conducted a teleconference
yesterday to plan for an anticipated buyout under
the enactment of the FY 1997 VA, HUD, and
Independent Agencies Appropriations bill.
</P><P>
If this measure is cleared by Congress and signed
by the President, which we expect maybe as early
as this week, each NASA Installation will be
requested to develop a plan for providing a buyout
in FY 1997.
</P><P>
Everything is contingent on enactment of the bill,
but it is anticipated that a buyout would be
available to those employees who are eligible and
who are interested in separating from Headquarters
no later than in the early second quarter of FY
1997, provided they are in excess skill
categories.
</P><P>
More information will be provided as it becomes
available.

PARKING GARAGE AT HEADQUARTERS OPENS TO THE PUBLIC
</P><P>
Effective August 5, the Colonial parking garage located
in the Headquarters building will be open to the
public.
</P><P>
NASA employees will no longer be able to enter and exit
the garage for a flat fee of $5 per day. With the
exception of permit holders, all patrons will be
charged each time they enter the garage. New daily
parking fees will be established by Colonial Parking.
Parking permit holders will be provided continued
access to the garage. Monthly parking fees for NASA
employees will remain the same.
</P><P>
These changes come as a result of continuing pressure
on the Headquarters budget and the downsizing effort.
</P><P>
More information will be provided as soon as possible.

<H2>NELLCOR, PURITAN-BENNETT TO COMBINE IN $475 MILLION MERGER</H2>
<HR><BR><BR>
Pleasanton, CA and Overland Park, KS -- May 22, 1995 -- Nellcor Incorporated
(Nasdaq:NELL) and Puritan-Bennett Corporation (Nasdaq:PBEN) today announced
that their boards of directors have approved a definitive merger agreement to
combine the two companies in a transaction valued at approximately $475
million.  With combined revenues of approximately $600 million, the new
company, Nellcor/Puritan-Bennett, will be the world's premier respiratory
products manufacturer.
<BR><BR>
The merger represents a unique opportunity to combine worldwide leaders in two
complementary areas, patient safety monitoring and respiratory therapy.
Nellcor/Puritan-Bennett will provide a comprehensive line of products to
diagnose, monitor and treat patients with respiratory difficulties across the
entire continuum of care -- the hospital, alternate care sites and the home.
<BR><BR>
Under terms of the agreement, Puritan-Bennett shareholders will receive 0.88
shares of Nellcor common stock for each outstanding share of Puritan-Bennett
common stock. The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization
and a pooling-of- interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
Based on the Friday, May 19, 1995 closing price of Nellcor and Puritan- Bennett
common shares on the Nasdaq, the combined company will have a total market
valuation of approximately $1 billion.
<BR><BR>
C. Raymond Larkin, Jr., 46, Nellcor's president and chief executive officer,
will be president and chief executive officer of the new company. Mr. Larkin
will establish an executive management committee that will oversee and manage
the integration of the two companies. Burton A. Dole, Jr., 57, chairman,
president and chief executive officer of Puritan-Bennett, will be chairman of
the Board for a term of two years. The Board of Directors will have nine
members: six from Nellcor, two from Puritan-Bennett and one to be selected by
both companies. Nellcor/Puritan-Bennett will be headquartered in Pleasanton,
CA, site of Nellcor's current headquarters.
<BR><BR>
"This merger provides the broad product offering and market approach demanded
by health care providers today by merging Nellcor, a leader in hospital-based
respiratory monitoring, with Puritan-Bennett, the largest respiratory therapy
products company in the world," Mr. Larkin said. Nellcor/Puritan-Bennett will
be the market leader in respiratory products, with the significant leverage
needed to compete in the rapidly changing health care environment. With
approximately $50 million of annual combined research and development
investment, we plan to build on our leadership with continued product
innovation.
<BR><BR>
"We expect this merger to create both immediate and long-term synergies in
revenue and earnings growth, cost savings and new product development," Mr.
Larkin added. "Excluding the effect of transaction-related expenses, we expect
earnings accretion in the first year. Opportunities include revenue synergies
generated by offering a comprehensive, combined product line and cost savings
through consolidating operations." Both companies have significant operations
in the San Diego and Kansas City areas, and in Tijuana, Mexico.
<BR><BR>
"We are very pleased to be joining forces with Nellcor," Mr.  Dole said.
"Nellcor/Puritan-Bennett will be a leading provider in both established and
high growth respiratory market segments across the spectrum of acute, alternate
and home care. Our new company will offer providers a single point of contact
for a broad array of products and services, resulting in increased value for
both our customers and shareholders."
<BR><BR>
Nellcor Incorporated, founded in 1981, designs, manufactures and markets
high-performance monitoring equipment, sensors and accessories for patient
safety and management throughout the hospital, in emergency care and in the
home.
<BR><BR>
Puritan-Bennett, founded in 1913, is a world leader in products related to
respiration. These products are used in multiple health care settings and on
aircraft.

<H1>Virtual Trade Show Served Over the Net</H1>

<BR><BR>
Foster City, Calif.- A new "virtual trade show" has hit the Internet, enabling
"attendees" to punch up exhibit floor plans, seminar schedules and information
about individual exhibitors, including product demos featuring sound and video.
The concept is widely seen as a harbinger of the future of trade shows, but
questions remain as to whether it will serve as an adjunct or substitute for
walking the show floor. +The on-line show, sponsored by Softbank Exposition and
Conference Co., headquartered here, was offered to exhibitors as an add-on at
the Networld+Interop computer networking show in Atlanta Sept. 25-29.
<BR><BR>

<H2>Virtual Trade Show</H2>
<BR><BR>

The on-line portion opens two weeks before the actual trade show, and runs
until two weeks afterward. +To visit the "virtual show," users log on to the
Internet and enter the show's address to get to a "welcome page": They are then
prompted to enter information about themselves, including their e-mail
address,purchasing power and job title.On-screen icons help the user navigate
to seminar descriptions, general show information and schedules, and exhibit
floor details. "We basically take our whole database of exhibitors - what
products each company is selling, last-minute changes, booth numbers - and make
it available on-line. Using a search function, people can enter key words to
find out which exhibitors meet their product interests," said Ora Chaiken,
on-line project director. +For more detailed information on specific companies,
the program offers "hot links" that enable users to easily click onto an
individual company's web sites.
<BR><BR>
"Users can also send e-mail directly to an exhibitor and say, "I'm really
interested, but only if you can solve this problem" or 'I would like to meet
with someone in your booth at 3:00 on Thursday," said Chaiken. Ultimately, the
program may also include videoconferences via desktop comuters between vendors
and customers.
<BR><BR>
Cost to exhibitors ranges from $2,500, the early-bird rate, to $5,000, which
includes construction of a web site for companies that don't already have one
in place.

<BR><BR>
<H2>PLUG IN, TUNE IN, TURN ON</H2>
<BR><BR>

Although exhibitors have been slow to embrace the one-line version - only 10
percent of the 640 exhibitors at the last Networld+Interop Show in March signed
on - those who took the leap gave the concept mostly positive reviews. Cisco
Systems, a San Jose, Calif. manufacturer of networking hardware, took full
advantage of the on-line show, loading its web site with video and audio clips,
a lot of "really cool graphics" and a form for capturing leads, according to
Bill Kelly, director of technical marketing. "It allows the nerd at his desk to
get information at his own pace and to not be harassed by a salesperson saying,
'Buy my stuff.' It's a way to deliver a complex marketing message containing
more information because people have time to look at it, "he said. He conceded,
however, that the communication is one way, and that salespeople can't answer
prospects' questions or make sure they understand the products. +Cisco's web
site yielded 200 leads, far fewer than were garnered at the live show. But
Kelly gave the on-line concept a thumbs-up, calling it an ecconomical way to
reach prospects compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it can cost to
put up a booth.
<BR><BR>
Economy and ease of use were also cited by another on-line exhibitor,
INTERPRISE Networking Services, a firm that provides network connections. Brian
Ozman, marketing launch manager, said he "would have liked to have seen more
leads" than the 75 pulled from the March on-line show, but added, "It only
takes one or two sales to cover the cost of going on-line. "Still, he fretted
that an on-line show might actually be too convenient, and that some buyers
might opt to stay home.
<BR><BR>
But several industry insiders doubted that would happen. "I don't think the
impact will be as great as people think it will be," said Stephen Sind,
president and CEO of the Center for Exhibition Industry Research in Bethesda,
Md. "There's no substitute for face-to-face relationship-building and selling,"
he added, also suggesting that on-line capabilities could actually play an
important role in pre-show/post-show promotion. +Mac Stone, marketing manager,
for Bobbin Blenheim, a Columbia, S.C. company that produces trade shows for the
textile industry, felt that it's only a matter of time before the on-line
concept spreads to other shows. "Our industry is just starting to get on the
Internet," he said. "Whether it's two years or 10 years from now, on-line shows
will become standard."

<CENTER><H1>POST-MENOPAUSAL BLEEDING</H1></CENTER>
<HR><BR>
Chicago."The cause of vaginal bleeding in post-menopausal women
is regularly diagnosed th a biopsy, an inaccurate procedure
that should be abandoned in favor of safe, painless and highly
accurate ultrasound techniques, according to information
presented here today during the 81st Scientific Assembly and
Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America
(RSNA). "Biopsy of the endometrium, or inner lining of the uterus,
is currently considered the standard of care by many
gynecologists," said Theodore J. Dubinsky, M.D., assistant
professor of radiology, the University of Texas, Houston.  "Yet
biopsy misses 50 percent or more of endometrial cancers because
you cannot biopsy the entire endometrium.  Further, only 40
percent of post menopausal bleeding is caused by endometrial
problems. "Ultrasound, on the other hand, can detect virtually 100
percent of endometrial problems, including cancerous and non-cancerous 
growths, and has the added advantage of being able to
diagnose problems outside the endometrium such as tumors of the
ovaries or uterus," he said.  Other advantages of ultrasound:
 It is considerably less painful than endometrial biopsy. 
<BR><BR>
It may lead to early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
It has fewer potential complications. A combination of two ultrasound techniques was used to
diagnose the cause of post menopausal bleeding in the Texas
study.
<BR><BR>
Initially, transvaginal (through the vagina) ultrasound
examinations were performed on 178 women referred over the course
of one year at Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital, Houston.  All
of the women had previously undergone endometrial biopsy with
negative results.  Transvaginal ultrasound revealed endometrial
thicknesses of 5 mm or greater in 45 of the women.  "A thickness
of 5 mm or greater is generally considered a sign of
abnormality," Dr. Dubinsky said. The 45 women underwent a second test, called
hysterosonography, in which a catheter is inserted through the
cervix into the uterus and saline is infused through the catheter
while an ultrasound picture is taken.  With this technique, the
radiologists diagnosed 5 previously undetected endometrial
cancers, 17 polyps (non-cancerous growths), 4 cases of focal
hyperplasia (potentially pre-cancerous cells) and 12 fibroid
tumors in 38 women. Studies have shown that use of the ultrasound technique in
women with thickened endometria will detect 97 percent of
cancers, he said. "We believe that transvaginal ultrasound should be the first
examination for women with unexplained post-menopausal bleeding,
followed by hysterosonography when the endometrium is 5 mm or
thicker," Dr. Dubinsky said. Of the 133 women with endometria less than 5 mm thick, the
transvaginal ultrasound exam diagnosed enlargement of the uterus
or fibroid tumors as the cause of bleeding in 89 cases, and
endometrial atrophy, or thinning of the endometrium, in 44. 
Endometrial atrophy is generally treated with hormone replacement
therapy, he said. "The cost of transvaginal ultrasound at our institution is
slightly more [$200] than endometrial biopsy alone [$150], but
the added cost of a pathologist's evaluation of tissue obtained
during biopsy makes the two exams comparable in price."
<BR><BR>
 Also, because endometrial biopsy is often inconclusive, the
addition of follow-up tests further drives up the cost. 
"An additional $200 is added for hysterosonography in women
with thickened endometria, but the additional test yields a
definite diagnosis in virtually 100 percent of cases," he said. Co-authors of a paper on the topic presented by Dr. Dubinsky
during the RSNA meeting are H. Parvey, M.D.; and N. Maklad, M.D.,
Phd.

<CENTER><H1>QUALITY COMPARISONS BETWEEN RADIOLOGISTS AND
NON-RADIOLOGISTS IN PERFORMANCE AND INTERPRETATION OF X-RAYS
</H1></CENTER><HR><BR><BR>

Very few studies have been carried out comparing the technical quality and accuracy of
interpretations of radiographs performed by radiologists with those performed by
nonradiologists.  Those studies that have done so have shown convincingly that trained
radiologists do a better job than untrained physicians from other medical specialties.  A
study by Pennsylvania Blue Shield in the mid-1980s (Edmiston 
and Levin,  Diagnostic Imaging, 1992;14:37) compared technical film quality among radiographs performed by
radiologists and other specialists.  Radiologists and orthopedists had similar low rates of
unsatisfactory quality (12% and 13% respectively), while rates of unacceptable quality
FSranged from 41% to 82% among films produced by family practitioners, internists,

pulmonary disease specialists, podiatrists and chiropractors.  Hopper, et.al. ( Radiology 
1991;180:557) also compared image quality among radiologists and nonradiologists in a
series of chest radiographs.  Unacceptable film quality was found in 3% of studies by
radiologists and 28% of those by nonradiologists.  Serious errors in interpretation
occurred in no cases read by radiologists but in 7% of cases read by nonradiologists.  A

study performed in Great Britain (Vincent,  Arch Emerg Med  1988;5:101) compared
interpretations of emergency room radiographs by senior emergency room residents
with the final interpretations by staff radiologists.  The senior emergency room house
staff missed 39% of clinically significant positive findings.  
Just recently, Scott et. al. (Radiology   1995;195:223) compared readings by radiologists and emergency room
physicians in a series of radiographs which contained critically important findings. 

<BR><BR>
These studies indicate that radiologists, all of whom undergo 4-6 years of training in
imaging, will consistently do better than physicians from other disciplines in performing
and interpreting imaging studies.  Residency and fellowship programs in other medical
disciplines rarely provide formal training in imaging.

<CENTER><H1>MOST X-RAYS IN DOCTORS' OFFICES ARE PERFORMED BY PHYSICIANS UNTRAINED IN RADIOLOGY</H1></CENTER>
<HR><BR>
Chicago Virtually every x-ray or other imaging study performed
in a hospital setting is done by a radiologist, whereas the
majority of exams performed in private physician offices are
self-referred by physicians who have no formal training in the
radiologic sciences.  These were among results of a study of
Medicare data presented here today during the 81st Scientific
Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America (RSNA). "These data raise concerns about utilization and quality of
medical imaging performed in physician offices," said David C.
Levin, M.D.  "Although many non-radiologists claim they are
adequately trained to interpret images, hospitals are the only
arena where hands-on training in radiology takes place.  Since
virtually no exams are performed by non-radiologists in this
setting, there isn't any mechanism available for training these
physicians in how to read them.  This means that a sizable number
of x-rays being performed and interpreted in private physician
offices are being done by inadequately trained individuals," he
said.  Dr. Levin is professor and chairman of the department of
radiology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia. "Studies have consistently shown that radiologists, all of
whom undergo four to six years of training in imaging, do a
better job of performing and interpreting imaging studies than
physicians in other disciplines.  Residency and fellowship
programs in other medical disciplines rarely provide formal
training in imaging," he said.  The researchers reviewed national 1993 Part B Medicare
Annual Data (BMAD) for three types of imaging procedures:

imaging studies of the brain/head, neck and spine(#      The study compared utilization of the procedures by
radiologists and non-radiologists in hospitals "  including
inpatient and outpatient settings "  and private physician
offices.
<BR><BR>
<H3>Skeletal x-rays</H3>
Data on the 41 most frequently performed skeletal x-ray
exams were gathered for the study.  In private offices, nearly 9
million studies were performed on Medicare patients, of which
less than 21 percent were performed by radiologists and more than
79 percent by non-radiologists.  Non-radiologists performed the
majority of studies in 37 of the 41 codes.  By contrast, in
hospital settings, nearly 7 million studies were performed, of
which radiologists performed greater than 99 percent. 

"There is a striking double standard in the practice of
skeletal radiography.  In hospital facilities, virtually all xrays are interpreted by radiologists.  However, in private office
settings where well over half of all examinations are performed,
the great majority are interpreted by nonradiologists "  at an
annual Medicare reimbursement of $193.4 million," said coinvestigator Vijay M. Rao, M.D., professor of radiology and
associate chairperson for education, department of radiology. "Since virtually no control exists on imaging done in
private offices, questions can be raised as to the quality and
medical necessity of exams performed in this very large segment
of imaging practice," she said
<BR><BR>
<H3>Chest radiology</H3>
Of 23.7 million chest x-rays performed in hospital-based
facilities, radiologists interpreted more than 99 percent.
In private offices, 6.4 million studies were performed, of which
nonradiologists did nearly two-thirds, or 65.1 percent, and
radiologists did 34.9 percent. 
<BR><BR>
<H3>Brain/head, neck and spine</H3>
  The incidence of imaging by non-radiologists was
significantly less in the field of neuroradiology "  imaging of
the brain/head, neck and spine, Dr. Rao said. The researchers examined data on approximately 2.4 million
computed tomography (CT) exams and 642,000 magnetic resonance
(MR) exams of the brain/head and neck.  Radiologists performed 98
percent of CT studies and 97 percent of MR studies in the
hospital setting.  In private offices, 89 percent of CT studies
and 92 percent of MR studies were performed by radiologists. 
Among images of the spine, approximately 342,000 CT and 493,000
MR images were performed.  In this case, radiologists did 99
percent of CT studies and 98 percent of MR studies in the
hospital and 89 percent of CT and 94 percent of MR in the office
setting. "Nationwide, less than 2 percent of these exams performed in
a hospital setting are being done by non-radiologists, compared
to slightly less than 10 percent in the office setting," Dr. Rao
said .Co-authors of a paper on the topic presented by Dr. Levin
and Dr. Rao during the RSNA meeting are C. Spettell, Ph.D.; A.
Flanders, M.D.; J. Sunshine, Ph.D.; and S. Bansal, M.S.

<CENTER><H1>RADIOLOGY TECHNIQUE PROMISES FUTURE SURGERIES WITHOUT INCISION

</H1></CENTER>
<HR><BR>
Chicago. " The days of appendectomy scars may soon be over as
interventional radiologists refine a procedure to perform
appendectomies and other types of surgery without an incision or
general anesthesia.  Results of preliminary research with the
technique were presented here today during the 81st Scientific
Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America (RSNA).      In the procedure, called "endoluminal fullthickness
resection," catheters and other small instruments are inserted
through the rectum to the inside (lumen) of the intestine and,
under xray guidance, are used to remove the appendix or tumors
in the colon, according to James F. McGuckin, Jr., M.D., fellow
in interventional radiology, Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.  The technique was performed
successfully in 20 laboratory experiments and further studies are
under way. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Endoluminal appendectomy</B>
<BR><BR>
     "The procedure may be easier to understand if you imagine
the large intestine as a mitten and the appendix "  which is an
appendage to the cecum [the first part of the large intestine] " 
as the mitten's thumb.  Imagine the thumb is inverted into the
thumb hole of the mitten.  Once you tuck the thumb inside, you
narrow the thumb hole opening, staple it and cut off the thumb
piece," Dr. McGuckin said.  "In our procedure, the base of the
appendix, including a portion of the cecum, is similarly pulled
into the lumen, stapled off and removed," he said.
<BR><BR>
More technically, in the new procedure, instruments are
moved under fluoroscopic guidance through the bowel until they
line up with the appendix.  A snare is used to grab the appendix
and pull it against the bowel wall until the wall envelopes the
appendix.  The appendix "  still enclosed by the wall of the bowel
 is pulled into the large intestine, which is narrowed, closed
with a surgical stapler, and the entire section cut off and
removed, according to Dr. McGuckin.
      "This procedure is more likely to be appropriate for highrisk patients with acute appendicitis who are poor candidates for
conventional surgery requiring a general anesthetic," he said.
<BR><BR>
<B>Treating colon cancers</B>
<BR><BR>
     The procedure is especially promising as a treatment for
early stage sessile cancers (cancers with a broad base on the
wall of the colon) because it would enable the removal of the
entire wall of the intestine where the tumor is located, thus
reducing the risk of leaving cancer cells behind, Dr. McGuckin
said.  It also could be used to remove noncancerous sessile
polyps, which are often precursors of cancer, and other lesions
in the bowel such as vascular abnormalities. Other applications
<BR><BR>
     The procedure also has the potential for performing surgery
through the mouth including:
<UL>
<LI>Treatment of superficial stomach cancers.
<LI>Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, a condition in which
stomach acid travels up the throat.
</UL>
<BR><BR>
<B>Advantages</B>
<BR><BR>
The procedure has a number of potential advantages over
conventional, laparoscopic or endoscopic surgery "  a procedure in
which removal of tumors is performed through an endoscope.  "When
an endoscopist takes a growth out of the intestine, as much as
possible is removed, but endoscopic surgery cannot remove the
wall of the bowel where cancerous tissue may remain."Other potential 
advantages over conventional techniques
include:
<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>It is less invasive than laparoscopic surgery, which
requires several surgical incisions and general anesthesia. 
"Laparoscopic surgery to remove cancers from the wall of the
intestine typically requires multiple incisions to pinpoint
and access the site and a larger incision to pull the
affected section of bowel out, staple and remove it," Dr.
McGuckin said.

<LI>No general anesthesia is required.

<LI>There are likely to be fewer complications.  "In our
preliminary studies, we have had no instance of perforation
of the bowel or leakage through the bowel "  complications
that would require emergency surgical repair," Dr. McGuckin
said.

<LI>Patients will be able to return to normal activities
earlier.
It may be less expensive.

<CENTER><H1> RADIOLOGY STUDY OF BREAST IMPLANTS DISPUTES THAT SILICONE 
"GEL BLEED" IS NORMAL; FINDS SOME POLYURETHANE-COATED
IMPLANTS MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO RUPTURE</H1></CENTER>
<HR><BR>
Chicago.  Silicone gel on the surface of a breast implant points
to implant rupture "  and some implants coated with polyurethane
are more likely to rupture than similar, uncoated implants,
according to studies presented here today during the 81st
Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological
Society of North America (RSNA).     "It should be noted that, in our opinion, silicone 'oil
bleed' on the surface of an implant is normal, as opposed to
silicone 'gel bleed,' which is not," said Michael S. Middleton,
Ph.D., M.D., assistant clinical professor of radiology,
University of California, San Diego.  "It should also be noted at
this stage that our findings are based upon our observations of
patients presenting for magnetic resonance [MR] breast implant
evaluation at our institution," he said.     The studies also offered guidelines for improving the
accuracy of MR imaging of breast implants.  "There are medical,
surgical and legal consequences of diagnosing whether or not a
breast implant has failed," said Dr. Middleton.  "Our role as
radiologists is to approach the problem objectively and describe
as accurately as possible the status of an implant.  The patient
and her physician can then have information about the implants
that may be useful in deciding whether they should be removed.
<BR><BR>
      In a series of papers documenting nearly four years of
research, Dr. Middleton presented the results of MR imaging and a
review of medical records for nearly 1,200 patients.  In 155
operations that were attended personally by Dr. Middleton,
preoperative MR findings for single lumen silicone gelfilled
implants were compared with findings after surgical removal of
the implants.  A single lumen implant has one cavity enclosed by
a single shell.
<BR><BR>
 Silicone Gel Bleed
<BR><BR>
     "Often, implants are called 'normal' when silicone gel is
seen on the surface of the implant, and that gel is referred to
as 'bleed'," Dr. Middleton said.  "In our experience, silicone
gel on the surface of an implant is a sign that silicone gel has
migrated through a hole or tear in the shell, and therefore that
the implant has ruptured.      Dr. Middleton noted that it is normal 
for silicone oil to
bleed through an intact implant shell.  However, silicone oil is
a thin, nonsticky lubricant that can usually be distinguished
from silicone gel at the moment of removal. The researchers examined
 303 single lumen silicone gelfilled breast implants that had been surgically removed with Dr.
Middleton in attendance, and compared the observations at surgery
to the preoperative MR findings.  Of the 107 implants that were
called ruptured on MR on the basis of the presence of silicone
gel outside the implant shell, silicone gel outside the implant
shell was observed at surgery in 103 cases.  Of those, 53 were
diagnosed as 'uncollapsed rupture' by MR.  In 26 of the 53, a
hole or tear in the shell was reliably observed through which
silicone gel could be seen to extrude.  In the remaining cases,
the possibility that an existing shell defect was exacerbated by
the physicians who removed or examined the implants could not be
excluded.  "In many cases, silicone gel on the surface of an implant is
called 'gel bleed' as opposed to rupture.  However, on the basis
of our observations, when we see silicone gel on the surface of
an implant, we conclude that it is most likely to be in a state
of uncollapsed rupture," he said.     "There is also some dispute about the meaning of the term
'implant rupture'," Dr. Middleton said.  "Sometimes an implant
will not be called ruptured unless it is empty of most or nearly
all of the gel it originally contained.  We have observed,
however, that implants can be in a state of uncollapsed rupture
in which they are not yet empty of their silicone gel.  "Most silicone gel has a very heavy consistency, and it
often does not easily flow out of a broken implant.  In our
experience, these cases of uncollapsed rupture are more common
than cases of collapsed rupture. "To call a ruptured but uncollapsed implant 'gel bleed' may
be a disservice to the patient," he said.  "She may want to know
before surgery whether or not the implant has ruptured to help
her decide whether or not she wants it removed, and calling
uncollapsed rupture 'gel bleed' may deny her that information.
 Experience with Polyurethane-Coated Implants
<BR><BR> 
The researchers also observed that some polyurethanecovered
gelfilled implants manufactured after about 1981 ruptured at a 
greater rate than similar, uncoated implants in patients
presenting to their institution for MR breast implant evaluation.
<BR><BR>
     MR imaging was performed on 775 patients with 1,503 single
lumen silicone gelfilled implants, including 179 that were
coated with polyurethane and 1,324 that were not coated.  MR
diagnosis was considered reliable for 168 of the coated implants
and 1,217 of the uncoated implants. 
<BR><BR> 
     An implant was classified as ruptured when silicone gel was
detectable outside the implant shell on MR images.  "The rupture
rate for nonpolyurethane coated implants that had been implanted
for between 10 and 12 years was 31 percent, compared to 91
percent for polyurethanecoated implants of the same age," Dr.
Middleton said.  "We cannot yet say whether our observations are applicable
to all breast implant patients," Dr. Middleton said.  "The rates
we are observing are probably higher than for the general
population of implant patients, since our patients are preselected for having suspected problems.       "Nonetheless, our data suggest that, in general, some
polyurethane-coated implants may be more likely to rupture over
time than are non-polyurethane coated implants." He noted that MR studies that are diagnosed as positive for
rupture are accurate 99 percent of the time, using current
techniques at his institution.
<BR><BR>
 Improving Diagnosis of Implant Failure
<BR><BR>

 Some pitfalls in diagnosis described by Dr. Middleton
<BR>
Not knowing the type of implant being imaged .  "The
appearance of an implant on MR and the determination of whether
or not it is intact can vary depending on the type of implant,"
he said.  "For example, normal single lumen implants can look on
MR exactly like double lumen implants with the saline gone from
their outer lumen," he said.      "Sometimes double lumen implants in which the gel from the
inner lumen has entered the outer lumen  but the gel is still
inside the implant as a whole  can look exactly like a single
lumen implant that has ruptured.       "We have seen a normal triple lumen implant called ruptured
because it was mistakenly thought to be a single lumen implant." 
A triple lumen implant is one in which there is an inner and a
middle gelfilled lumen as well as an outer salinefilled lumen.     &          ,''   
<BR><BR>  
    Dr. Middleton and his coinvestigators have identified 247
different styles of breast implants that have been distributed by
the various manufacturers over the past 35 years, which they
believe constitutes most of the implants that have been
available.  "We have often found it important to obtain the
original medical record and to understand the nature of the
implant so as to properly interpret the MR findings."
<BR><BR>
      Mistaking an underfilled implant with one that has ruptured . 
"Some implants are intentionally underfilled with less silicone
gel than usual to make them softer," Dr. Middleton said. 
"Compared to more fully filled implants, underfilled implants
often have more internal lines seen on MR images, which represent
infolding of the implant shell.  We have seen cases when these
abundant internal lines have been mistakenly interpreted as a
sign of implant rupture.  This normal appearance of underfilled
implants should not be confused with a particular pattern of wavy
internal lines, sometimes dubbed the 'linguini sign' that
indicates reliably than an implant has ruptured and has been
mostly emptied of its gel.
<BR><BR>
       Failure to distinguish soft tissue silicone from other
normal and abnormal breast findings.   "Conditions and/or water-like structures such as inflammation, hematoma, blood vessels, or
breast cysts or masses can mimic the appearance of silicone that
has traveled outside the implant and into soft tissues," Dr.
Middleton said.  "We perform most of our MR imaging with a
technique called 'water suppression' so that silicone appears
bright against a dark background.  If the water suppression
technique fails, which sometimes happens, a 'silicone
suppression' sequence often is useful.  True soft tissue silicone
should appear bright on water suppression images and dark or
nearly the same as surrounding tissues on silicone suppression
images.  Any other appearance indicates that the suspected
abnormality may not represent silicone.
<BR><BR>
      "Breast implant rupture may also be diagnosed using
ultrasound," Dr. Middleton said.  "Ultrasound is a reliable
technique to diagnose collapsed implant rupture, but uncollapsed
rupture can be difficult to detect using that technique," he
said.  "At this time, considering all factors, it is our opinion
that magnetic resonance imaging performed with adequate equipment
and technique is the best way to diagnose breast implants noninvasively, but ultrasound in experienced hands can also be very
good.     "However, ultrasound is very operatordependent and the
learning curve for accurate diagnosis with acceptable sensitivity
is probably long compared to MR.  Co=author of papers and a scientific exhibit on the topic
presented by Dr. Middleton during the RSNA meeting is Michael P.
McNamara, Jr., M.D.  The RSNA is an association of 30,000 radiologists and
physicists in medicine dedicated to education in the science of

<CENTER><H1>MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) IS NOT HIGH COST,
HIGH TECH VILLAIN</H1></CENTER>
 <HR><BR>
Pundits who choose magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as
an example of a high tech villain driving up the cost of health
care better find a new target.  MR actually consumes a fraction
of the nation's health care budget and accounts for only 7.4
percent of the total Medicare payments to physicians for all
imaging procedures performed annually in the United States.
The information, based on Medicare reimbursement data for
1993, was presented here today during the 81st Scientific
Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America (RSNA). The relatively modest cost of MR is more than offset by the
dramatic improvements it affords in both the safety and efficacy
of diagnosing a wide variety of diseases and injuries," said
David Levin, M.D., professor and chairman of radiology, Thomas
Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia. Researchers reviewed data detailing what Medicare paid
physicians for MR exams in 1993 and compared that to similar
payments for other types of imaging studies, according to co-investigator Vijay M. Rao, M.D., professor of radiology and
associate chairperson for education, department of radiology.  "A
total of $370.3 million was spent on the 1.45 million MR exams
performed on Medicare patients in 1993.  By comparison, Medicare
payments for exams such as echocardiography were more than double
what was spent on MR," she said.  "And payments for chest x-rays
were $130 million higher.Echocardiography, an ultrasound exam performed primarily by
cardiologists to diagnose heart disease, cost the Medicare system
$756.2 million, or 15 percent of all physician reimbursement for
imaging studies in 1993.  Chest x-rays cost $503.1 million (10
percent); and noncardiac vascular ultrasound cost $320.2 million
(6.4 percent), according to Dr. Rao. Data in the study were extracted from national Part B
Medicare Annual Data. "It should also be noted that echocardiography and noncardiac vascular ultrasound are often performed by physicians who
selfrefer patients "  a situation that may lead to overutilization of the exams," Dr. Levin said.  "MR rarely is selfreferred."  Approximately onethird of the money spent for all
imaging exams went to self-referring physicians in medical
specialties other than radiology, he said. "Further, literally hundreds of papers have been published
documenting the benefits of MR "  benefits that can save health
care dollars by improving both the speed and accuracy of
diagnosis or avoiding potential side effects from other, more
risky procedures," Dr. Levin said.  "It is the best first-line
tool we have to diagnose many diseases and injuries of the brain
and spine, musculoskeletal system, arteries and other
structures."  Advantages of MR include:
<UL>
<LI>It is noninvasive and has no known risks.<BR>
  "For example, it
used to require opening the skull to clearly see most brain
tumors and determine whether they were malignant or benign,"
Dr. Levin said.  "With today's technology, and especially
MR, we can see brain tumors in great detail and, in most
cases, predict what type of growth they are.  When surgical
removal is required, MR provides a detailed map to guide the
surgeon, which can greatly improve the outcome of delicate
operations.
<LI>It involves no ionizing radiation.<BR>
Unlike conventional xrays, it can characterize anatomy,
especially of soft tissue structures, usually without the
use of contrast media "  dyes that are injected into the body
to improve images.  "Xrays can't distinguish one soft
tissue structure from another.  MR, on the other hand, can
 distinguish organs from each other, tell fat from muscle
from tendons from ligaments from different internal organs,
without injecting contrast media or invading the body in any
way," Dr. Levin said.Co-authors of a paper on the topic presented by Dr. Levin
and Dr. Rao during the RSNA meeting are C. Spettell, Ph.D.; J.
Sunshine, Ph.D.; and S. Bansal, M.S.

<CENTER><H1>PSA TEST ALONE NOT GOOD PREDICTOR OF PROSTATE CANCER SPREAD</H1><CENTER>
<HR><BR> 
Chicago A common blood test for detection of prostate cancer is
not sufficient to determine the extent of disease and should be
combined with radiologic tests to plan the best treatment,
according to information presented here today during the 81st
Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological
Society of North America (RSNA). "Tests for PSA [prostate specific antigen] were insufficient
in correctly staging [identifying the extent of disease] in
nearly 15 percent of men with prostate cancer in our study," said 
William W. MayoSmith, M.D., assistant professor of radiology,
Brown University, Providence, R.I.  The study was performed at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The researchers studied 439 patients with newly diagnosed
prostate cancer from 1990 to 1994.  All patients had been
diagnosed with an elevated PSA by their primary physician and
referred to a urologist who confirmed the presence of cancer by
biopsy, Dr. MayoSmith said.  In the study, all patients underwent radiologic imaging
exams in addition to PSA, including computed tomography (CT) and
bone scans.  A bone scan is a nuclear medicine exam in which a
radioisotope is injected into the body and a special camera used
to measure uptake of the isotope in the bone to determine the
presence of cancer.  Results of the imaging exams were compared
to PSA tests.
"PSA is an excellent screening tool for determining which
men in the general population may have prostate cancer, but it is
inaccurate in pinpointing whether the disease has spread," Dr.
MayoSmith said.     "The average PSA in patients without evidence of metastases
[disease that has spread beyond the prostate] was 15 compared to
47 for patients who had metastases.     "While patients with elevated PSAs tended to have advanced
disease and patients with low PSAs tended not to have advanced
disease, this was not always the case," Dr. MayoSmith said. "If PSA alone were used to stage for disease, 14 of 55
patients with PSAs greater than 20 would have been denied surgery
or radiation therapy because it would incorrectly have been
assumed that their disease had spread.  "Conversely, if a PSA of less than 10 was chosen as a cutoff
for assuming a lack of metastases, 15 of 140 patients would have
undergone surgery or radiation therapy unnecessarily." Co-authors of a paper on the topic presented by Dr. MayoSmith during the RSNA meeting are P. Mueller, M.D.; S. Hu, M.D.;
P. Hahn, M.D., Ph.D.; N. Papanicolaou, M.D.; and A. Althausen,
M.D. The RSNA is an association of 30,000 radiologists and

<CENTER><H1>NEEDLE BIOPSIES TO DETECT BREAST CANCER 
 COULD SAVE NATION $1 BILLION EACH YEAR</H1><CENTER>

<HR><BR>
Chicago.  As much as $1 billion or more in health care costs
could be saved annually in the United States with more widespread
use of a relatively inexpensive needle biopsy technique in place
of surgical biopsy to diagnose breast cancer, according to
information presented here today during the 81st Scientific
Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America (RSNA). An estimated onethird of the U.S. health care budget for
breast cancer is spent on biopsies "  the great majority of them
performed using open surgical techniques.  In the needle
technique, called stereotaxic core biopsy (SCB), an x-ray-guided
needle is used to remove a small core of tissue from the breast. 
It typically costs onehalf to onefourth the cost of open
surgical biopsy.  It is also less painful, much less disfiguring,
requires only local anesthesia and has a very short recovery
time.  "As more and more women have mammograms, more and more
biopsies will be required to determine if the abnormalities seen
are cancer," said Carol H. Lee, M.D., associate professor of
diagnostic radiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New
Haven, Conn.  "In fact, most of the abnormal masses or
calcifications detected by mammography turn out not to be cancer. 
On average, we must perform between three and four biopsies to
diagnose one cancer," she said.  Dr. Lee is author of one study
presented at the RSNA meeting.

<BR><BR>
"If half of the approximately 800,000 biopsies performed
each year were done with SCB, the nation would save $1 billion or
more," said Steven Jay Adler, M.D., author of a second related
study.  Dr. Adler is head of the mammography section, Virginia
 Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Wash.   7 
<BR><BR> 
Seattle study
 Dr. Adler performed SCB on 234 women referred for the
procedure by their surgeons during the first threequarters of
1995.  During that period, only 7 cases were referred for open
surgical biopsy "  a ratio that is not typical, Dr. Adler said. 
"Perhaps it is because the physicians and surgeons at our
institution are salaried that we see such a high percentage of
patients referred for SCB."  Nationwide, open surgical biopsy is
performed in the great majority of cases, he said. In the 234 cases, SCB diagnosed 167 benign lesions and 58
cancers.  The remaining 9 were classified as atypical, or
indeterminate, and went on to surgical biopsy.  In all cases, SCB
was able to obtain a sufficient amount of tissue for pathological
evaluation, Dr. Adler said.   "Of those few classified as atypical and referred for
additional open surgical biopsy, 4 were cancers, 1 was benign and
4 remained atypical and must be followed carefully. In the study, the cost to perform SCB was $1,484 compared to
$4,625 for surgery  a savings of 68 percent.  The total average
cost to diagnose one cancer was $6,505 for SCB compared to
$16,893 for open surgical biopsy a savings of 61 percent. 
Pathology costs for evaluating the tissue sample obtained by
biopsy were figured into costs for both procedures.  Surgical
costs also included operating room and anesthesia fees, needle
localization (an xray technique required to pinpoint the site of
the lesion prior to surgery) and routine preoperative tests 
expenses not incurred by SCB.
<BR><BR>

"Review of the published data shows that our results with
SCB are at least as accurate at detecting cancer as open surgical
biopsy.  At best, surgery still misses 5 percent of cancers. 
Studies have shown that SCB misses as few as 1 percent," he said.
 
<BR><BR>
Yale Study
<BR><BR>
 In the Yale study, stereotaxic core biopsy was performed on
405 breast lesions from July 1992 through February 1995.  The
researchers determined the costs of each diagnosis based on the
type and size of abnormality seen on mammography.  Savings were
calculated using Medicare reimbursement data for 1995, Dr. Lee
said.  Abnormalities were characterized as masses or
calcifications that were indeterminate, suspicious or highly
suspicious for cancer.  The overall average cost savings per case
was $590 with SCB, she said.  The greatest number of women were spared open surgical
biopsies when the lesions were masses rather than calcifications,
according to Dr. Lee.   Overall, 221 women (87 percent of 254) with masses were
saved open biopsy.  "The greatest savings were seen with
indeterminate masses.  In this group of 157 patients, SCB yielded
a definitive diagnosis in 91 percent of cases and saved an
average of $694 per case.  Of 151 women with calcifications seen on mammography, 103
(68 percent) did not require subsequent biopsy.  The lowest
savings were for highly suspicious calcifications.  Of 11 cases
that fit this category, SCB did not yield a definite diagnosis in
6 (55 percent) who required subsequent open surgical biopsy. 
"Nonetheless, 45 percent of these patients were spared
surgical biopsy and, because of the difference in cost between
SCB and open biopsy, there was still an overall savings of $226
per case," Dr. Lee said. 

<BR><BR>
In the Yale study, investigators used the most conservative
cost figures, giving open surgical biopsy the benefit of the
doubt, she said.  Cost figures in her study did not include
charges such as preadmission testing, laboratory work or time
lost from work, all of which tend to be higher with open surgical
biopsy. "The only costs we figured in were the actual costs of the
procedures and "  in cases of nonspecific benign results with SCB
"  the cost of followup mammograms to monitor the status of
lesions in the breast. At Yale-New Haven Hospital, it has become the standard of
care to offer SCB as an alternative to open surgical biopsy.  The
final decision is made by the patient and her physician," Dr. Lee
said. Co-authors of a paper on the topic presented by Dr. Lee
during the RSNA meeting are T.K. Eglin, M.D.; M. Mainiero, M.D.;
L.E. Philpotts, M.D.; and I. Tocino, M.D.

<H1><CENTER>Paracetamol Poisoning.</CENTER> </H1>
</CENTER>
30/10/1995
<HR><BR>


A story of paracetamol poisoning in a 4 year old child, is focusing attention on the hazards of excessive use of medications. Paracetamol is a popular over the counter medications, used by many people to lower fever and ease pains. The recommended dosage is 1-4 times a day according to body weight. Overdose of this harmless medication can cause poisoning, liver damage and even death, says Dr. S.Petlick of the Beilinson Hospital in Petah-Tiqua, Israel.  
Paracetamol can also be allergenic and cause liver failure, rash, diarreaha and pains.
<BR><BR>
The 4 year old girl that suffered paracetamol poisoning was treated for high fever by her mother with paracetamol syrup, which was backed up by the family physician. After 2 days, the girl started vomiting, and the syrup was replaced by suppositories, with no improvement and the mother took her to a hospital. Hepatitis was suggested and IV with paracetamol administered. When a paracetamol poisoning was suspected the girl was transferred to an 
intensive care unit, and treated by a specialist in liver problems in children. After a week treatment the liver and kidney began to function normally and she recovered.
<BR><BR>
The take home message is not to acceed the recommended dosage of paracetamol, or any medication at that, and thus to enjoy the benefit of medications without fear.

<TITLE>video communication line</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>An intercontinental video communication line between medical centers.</CENTER> </H2>

<HR>
<BR><BR>

Recently a video communication line was established between the Baylor Medical Center in 
Houston, Texas, and the Beilinson Medical Center in Petah-Tiquva, Israel. The project is the 
initiative of NASA, which develops a program to treat astronauts in space. NASA is checking 
the credibility of the system in long distance use, and Beilinson Medical Center was 
chosen as one of the partners among others, in Turkey, Italy and Cyprus. The 
Beilinson Center was chosen because it combines a children hospital with a general 
one, same as the one into Houston.
<BR><BR>
The Houston Center transmitted video documentation of medical procedures in real 
time; and the medical teams saw each other on the screens and exchanged ideas while 
operating, on to best treatment methods.
The Israeli team witnessed an operation of a congenital heart defection a child. The 
Israeli team headed by Prof. Bernardo Vidna, head of the children heart surgery in 
Beilinson, suggested an operative approach which was accepted by the Houston team.
Another operation involved a 4 year old girl, suffering from Krohns disease. Prof. 
Gabriel Dinari, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology Institute, recommended a special 
diet treatment for the girl. The Houston team showed interest in the new treatment 
which was not familiar to them.
<BR><BR>
Dr. Hamutal Meiri, one of the owners of "Telemarpeh" in Israel formed the 
connections between Texas and the Israeli firms organizing the event.
So far the direct transmissions included heart ultrasound, heart valve exchange, 
endoscapia and more. The transmission was received simultaneously in Washington, 
D.C. A breakthrough in this area can contribute to the treatment and care of patients in 
hospitals. Another advantage of this communication mode is economic. The cost of 
specialization of physicians abroad is very high, and it can be cut to a minimum using 
this method.

<B>Background: </B>High-grade malignant gliomas have a dismal prognosis.  Only achievement of long-term local control improves overall survival.  Conventional treatments have not been successful, but thermoradiotherapy appears to be a promising new approach to this disease.<BR><BR>

<B>Patients and Methods:</B>  The review addresses the various HT techiniques applied for brain heating, the biological rationale and experimental studies supporting the use of heat in addition to radiotherapy for brain tumors.  Normal brain damage exposed to heat is critically evaluated. Clinical trials implementing HT for tumors of the brain accumulating more than 400 patients are discussed.<BR><BR>

<B>Results:</B> HT is a feasible and effective approach to brain tumors.  Important selection criteria are tumor size (< 6 cm)  and location (supratentorial, peripheral).  Acute treatment toxicity is relatively low and long-term side effects are similar to those observed for RT alone.  In some studies a high response rate and improvement of survival was achieved.  Tumor control and survival depend on histology (anaplastic astrocytoma vs. glioblastoma multiforme), extent of surgery (complete vs. incomplete), tumor status 
(promary vs. recurrent), age and performance status.  Satisfactory heating also correlates significantly with favourable treatment outcome.<BR><BR>

<B>Conclusions:</B>  The encouraging results of clinical trials may be biased by biased by favourable tumor and patient selection.  Randomized clinical trials comparing RT alone versus combined RT-HT for advanced and recurrent brain tumors are justified.<BR><BR>

<B>M</B>alignant gliomas comprise about 40% of all central nervous system malignancies with about 2/3 supratentorial; they also account for 20% of pediatric tumors with about 2/3 infratentorial.  Diagnosis [10-12], surgery [40,41] and radiotherapy [30,47,88,113] have improved and new cytotoxic drugs [49,65,87] are available, but patients afflicted by anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme have a dismal prognosis [16,46,61] which is characterized by local tumor progression or relapse near the original site 
[35,108]. Only 5% yield a 5-year survival in spite of any treatment and rarely a 1-year-survival without treatment [16,61,63,64].<BR><BR>

Radiotherapy (RT) is well established [47,61,64] and clinical data indicate that long-term outcome is directly related to the applied RT dose [107].  However, the risk of ratiation induced brain injury increases beyond 60 Gy [54,81]. This precludes the use of conventional RT for proviously irradiated recurring lesions.  Poor response to RT and development of relapses are probably related to the presence of intrinsically radioresistant cells [26,35,106,108], e.g. in necrotic regions harboring hypoxic cells, or due to 
infiltrating tumor cells outside the CT or MR enhancement [10-12].<BR><BR>

As malignant gliomas tend to deeply infiltrate and are highly proliferative [16, 99], there is a rationale to use intensified local treatment metnolds like conformal, stereotactic or interstitial RT. These techniques allow a higher RT dose to the tumor while sparing sensitive normal brain tissues [30,48, 73].  Radioactive implants (Ir-192 or I-125) in untreated [30] or recurrent tumors [48] have improved survival, but local relapses continue to be the most common mode of failure.<BR><BR>

Hyperthermia (HT) has become an appealing treatment as adjunct to RT, since heat at 41 to 44*C is an effective cytotoxic and radiosensitizing agent if combined with concurrent or sequential RT [69]. The thermal effects are enhanced by a hypoxic, hypovascular, hypometabolic and hyperacidic environment [67]. Thermoradiotherapy (HT-RT) is assumed to enhance cell killing in brain tumors as compared to either modality alone [36, 69, 70, 92]. Herein we review techniques to heat brain tumors, the major rationale and experimental studies and the results of normal brain toxicity and clinical studies.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Heating Techniques for Brain Tumors</B><BR><BR>

Two principle HT methods are available (Table 1): External methods  include radiofrequency (RF), ultrasound (US) and magnetic induciton HT.RF capacitive HT requires bilateral craniectomies for positioning of electrodes to opposing sides of the brain.  The technique claims to heat large mikline tumors, but has the disadvantage of unnecessarily heating intervening normal brain tissue.  Focussed US-HT requires a unilateral craniectomy with a margin of about 2 cm around the underlying tumor and allows better sparing of normal tissue.  The "Magnetrode" technique [90, 91] seems elegant, but from the 
physical point a "cold spot" occurs in the center.<BR><BR>

Interstitial HT methods require placement of applicators directly into the brain tissue.  Heating is achieved by radiating electromagnetic fields using microwave antennas, resistive or capacitive heating using electrical currents passing between paired electrodes, conductive heating from hot sources or 
inductively heated ferromagnetic implants.  Microwave antennas proved the best choice to treat brain tumors, since non-parallel implants and a wider spacing of heat sources are possible than with other techniques to heat the target volume.  Surface-cooled antennas prodeuce a more uniform heating than 
uncooled antennas [60].  Despite each antenna can be individually powered, the heating pattern is less predictable than for simple conductive hot source HT systems.  Different antenna designs have been tested to account for various geometrical conditions [56, 75, 76].<BR><BR>

Hot source HT requires close applicator spacing.  A well predictable and controllable heating pattern is produced [4, 18, 19], but the technique is not useful in highly perfused tissues.  Since hot source techniques are simple and allow easy handling, lon-term HT over several hours and simultaneous HT-RT applications are possible.  The advantage of ferromagnetic implants is their use either as temporaty or permanent implants, which allows multiple HT sessions over several weeks.  The temperature is precisely controlled by the Curie point of the ferromagnetic material [31].<BR><BR>

Radiofrequency HT uses paired metal needles for resistive and specially sedigned flesible electrodes for capacitive HT. Plastic shielding or the use of conductive painted segments or multiple segmented applicators allow to achieve different geating zones along a single applicator.  Resistive RF0HT 
requires parallel orientation and equal length of needles pairs, while capacitive RF-HT can be applied with non-parallel implants and independent power control per each probe.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Experimental Studies</B><BR>

<I>In Vitro Brain Tumor Cell Studies</I><BR><BR>

The first report on thermal sensitivity of human glioma cells dates back to 1981 [27].  In vitro effects of combined HT and RT were anlyzed by Raaphorst et al. [70] in 3 human glioma cell lines which had a large capacity for recovery from potentially lethal damage after application of 2, 4, 6 or 8 Gy (qt 1.3 Gy/min).  Thermal radiosensitization  was observed for HT before and after RT. Its extent was depending on the duration and temperature level of the heat exposure. Repair of potentially lethal damage was completely inhibited after 1 hour of HT at 45&#176;C.<BR><BR>

Several in vitro studies on the effects of combined ChT-HT have been reported [17, 77, 102, 109]. Tanaka et al. [105] studied a human glioblastoma and 3 rat brain tumor cell lines. Various treatment schedules were tested: HT alone (42&#176;C for 60min), ChT alone, or combined HT-ChT with HT applied before, during, or after 1 hour ChT. The tested drugs were nimustine (ACNU), aclarubicin (ACR) or cisplatin (CIS).  Simultaneous HT-ChT yielded the greatest cytotoxicity for all drugs.<BR><BR>

Da Silva et al [17] calculated the thermal enhancement ratio of HT at 42&#176;C for 60 min and ChT in a human glioblastoma cell line. The thermal enhancement ration values were 1.1 for conbination of HT with spirohydantoin mustard; 1,6 for BCNU, 2.0 for cisplatin, and 2.8 for 2,5-diaziridiny l-3, 6-bis [carboxethoxy-amino]-1,4-benzo-quinone combined with HT, respectively.  Thermal enhancement was not only depending on temperature level and duration, but also on specific interactions and cellular mechanisms of heat and the individual cytotoxic drug.<BR><BR>

Salcmann and Ebert [78] studied triple modality HT-RT-ChT analyzing the response to Ht at 44&#176;C for 30 min, to RT of 5 Gy, and to BCNU and cisplatin. HT was applied before or after RT and/or ChT or simultaneously together with cisplatin. All combinations of Rt, Ht and BCNU yielded additive 
effects and enhanced cytotoxicity, while combinations with cisplatin revealed additive effects in human and synergistic effects in canine brain tumor cells.  The sequence of cisplatin and HT had no impact on outcome.  It was concluded that HT could effectively potentiate effects of both RT and ChT.<BR><BR>

Watanabe et al. [109] examined the sensitivity of human malignant hlioma cells to simultaneous HT and ChT under normal oxygenated and chronically-hypoxic conditions: ACNU was equally cytotoxic independent from oxygen condition, while adriamycin and mitomycin C were preferentially cytotoxic to hypoxic cells, at 37C, 42C and 43C; synergism with HT occurred under all oxic conditions. Bleomycin, cisplatin, and vincristin had a higher cytotoxic activity to oxygenated cells, both, at 37 C and at elevated temperatures.  Synergism between cisplatin and HT relied only on well oxygenated conditions.  Adriamycin and mitomycin C had the most enhanced efficacy against hypoxic subpopulations of malignant glioma cells when simultaneous HT was applied.<BR><BR>

This suggests that the thermal enhancement ratio depends on HT parameters, bu also on specific HT-RT and ChT-HT interactions and on physiological conditions at the cellular level.<BR><BR><BR>

<I>In Vivo Brain Yumor Models</I><BR><BR>

In vivo sutdies with different malignant glioma tumors were reported by several groups [15, 42, 57, 82, 101, 105].  Tumor models were produced in dogs, cats or redents by inoculation of malignant glioma cell lines into different body sites. Heat alone was studied by Kobayashi et al.[42] who produced cutaneous tumors in rats by inoculation of rat gliosarcoma cells.  The tumors completely diappeared within 4 weeks after HT of 45C for 1 hour. in another study [43], glioma cells were inoculated intracerebrally into rats; after 10  dats the growing tumors were heated at 45C for 30 min.  Heated animals obtained a significantly longer survival than the contern, histopathological changes, and the BYUdR labelling index 
of growing malignant gliomas after RT alone (44 C or 45C for 30 min) or combined HT-RT. The combined treatment resulted in longer survival and at least additive histological changes in  normal and tumor brain tissue or additive tumor cell growth suppression as compared to the treatments with 1 
modality alone.<BR><BR>

A Norwegian group studied combined HT-ChT in the BT4A brain tumor implanted in the hind leg of rats [15,57].  Heat at 44C for 1 hour and bleomycin or BCNU were applied.  Tumors not controlled by any single modality resolved completely when both modalities were combined.  The same group analyzed the impact of physiological parameters on treatment outcome [82,84] in rat tumors.  HT at 44C for 45 min and BCNU were applied with or without hlucose to reduce the intratumoral pH.  While the glucose administration reduced the effect of BCNU alone,it failed to enhance the effect of HT alone, but it enhanced the cytotoxic effects of combined HT and BCNU.  Thermal enhancement of cis- and carboplatin was also demonstrated [84].  Intraperitoneal ACNU and HT was tested with or without up-front glucose [83].  ACNU with glucose, which was again more effective than HT alone.  In contrast, tumor growth was not affected by ACNU alone or by ACNU after glucose.<BR><BR>

In summary, in vivo studies confirm the thermal enhancement data and the influencing parameters which are known from in vitro studies.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Normal Brain Toxicity Studies</B><BR><BR>

Many animal studies have examined thermal tolerance of normal brain to heat (<A HREF="table2.htm>Table 2</A>). Neurological changes of histological criteria were used as treatment endpoints to describe the effect of combined HT-RT or HR-ChT.  In contrast, functional or (electro-) physiological studies and end-points were rarely examined and revealed diverse results: Harris et al. [32] found a slower electrical activity (EEG) in dogs heated to temperatures above 42C, while the visual evoked response disappeared at 43 to 46C for 10 min. Immediate deleterious changes were found in feline brains at 42 to 42.5C [88] and in rabbit brains at 44.0C [114]. Harris et al. [32] also showed that the limit of heat tolerance in canine brains was 42 to 43C for about 30 min, but no longer periods were tested.  When 1 hemisphere was heated to 44 to 46C for 30 min, the dogs developed hemiparesis, anisocoria and often remained unconsciousless after HT.  None of them survived more than 36 hours of HT.  Ikeda et al.[37] analyzed the acute reaction of normal dog brain to heat alone.  Temperature and time dependent histological changes were observed.  The grey matter was more sensitive to heat than the white matter.
At 43C for 45 min, coagulation necrosis was present in most  grey matter lesions, while in white matter subjected to the same temperature fo 60 min, less severe changes occurred.  The breakdown of the blood-brain barrier occurred at 43C necrosis predominated in both the grey and white matter.<BR><BR>

Silberman et al.[89] induced external HT to the whole rabbit brain and found a steep thermal dose-response relationship.  Animals survived heat <  43.5C for 1 hour, but died within a few minutes when 44.5 to 45C was exceeded.  Break-down of the blood-brainn barrier occurred after HT in rat brain at   >44.3C for 30 min or at 42.5C for 60 min.  MW-HT to canine brain [9] or US-HT to feline brain [50] revealed a threshold for neuronal damage at 42.0 to 42.5C for 1 hour; neuronal cell lysis and cerebral edema occurred byond 43C and a disruption of white brain matter tracts was 
produced at temperatures of 43 to 43.5C.<BR><BR>

Computed tomography (CT) and histopathology in dog brain were examined for interstitial HT at various temperatures [23, 24, 92]. Maximal changes were founs 1 week after HT. CT scans and corresponding histological slices revealed 3 zones: a) a radiolucent central zone representing brain necrosis; b) a small rim of contrast enhancement around the necrosi representing reactive cellular changes, endothelial proliferation and infiltration of macrophages; c) normal brain tissue outside the CT enhancement.  The threshold for the development of brain necrosis was 43.9  1.5C [24]. These 
lesions induced a rapid vascular response and an overall change in the regional cerebral perfusion.  Hoopes et al. [36] analysed corresponding CT and MR scans and histologies after interstitial HT on normal dog brain.  The endpoints included the break-down of the blood-brain barrier and the development of brain necrosis.  A close correlation between CT and MR imaging sutides was found for prediction of the histological lesion size.  Both imaging methods were capable to precisely define the necrotic zone and to predict the extent of vascular necrosis, but underestimated the extent of 
pparenchymal necrosis.<BR><BR>

Minipig studies [22] showed a different histopathological response of normal brain tissue to interstitial RT or HT alone or to their combination.  Irradiation with 90 to 100 Gy Ir-192 induced a small necrosis at 1 mm distance from the radioactive seeds which was surrounded by a zone of 
demyelination, fragmentation and degeneration of neurons.  Spongiosis and interstitial/perivascular edema occurred 1 mm beyond the margin of the necrosis. Doses of 50 Gy produced no changes. Similar ratiation induced changes are known for permanent I-125 [23, 688] an Ir-192 implants [38].  
In contrast, interstitial HT at 44.5C for 1  hour, induced a well defined necrosis reaching twice the diameter of the radiaiton lesion: The cellular degeneration was limited and brain edema was not discernable, but macrophagic cell reactivity was more pronounced after HT than after RT alone.  Temperatures below 43.4C produced only monor damage.<BR><BR>

 In feline brains 4 zones of tissue damage were identified in thermal lesions >10 mm [51]: a) a central coagulative or liquefactive necrosis; b)a sourrounding rim of cellular infiltration and vascular proliferation; c) a margin of astroglia and collagen deposition, and d) a large peripheral edema.  In human malignant brain tumors the importance of morphometric CT analysis for continuous monitoring of brain changes after HT was assessed [62].  The achieved thermal performance and the behavious of the contrast-enhancing lesion correlated with outcome.  The results also suggested that aggressive HT provides at lesat a transient opening of the blood-brain barrier.<BR><BR>

Animal studies suggest a unifrom temperature- and time-dependent impact of heat on normal brain tissue: similiar to the cerebral reaction to other injuries, the coagulative brain necrosis is the ultimate response to a specific "heat dose".  The observed repair mechanisms are limited to a small zone around the induced necrosis.  Surrounding brain tissue expoed to lower temperatures remains unaffected.<BR><BR>

In summary, these findings indicate a steep dose-response pattern for heat between 41.0 and 44.0C. Combined HT-RT seems to enhance and even prolong the cellular reaction of brain tissue which is observed for each modality alone.

<B>Purpose:</B>  In this study, a many component model has been formulated to address the contribution of various biomolecules in radiation induced biological damage and this model is fitted to radiaiton isoeffect data to evaluate the parameter &alpha;/&beta;.<BR>

<B>Material and Methods:</B>  Every living cell contains a number of organic and inorganic molecules which may act as targets to lead radiation induced damage.  During irradiation, many kinds of physical chemical and biological products are produced which are due to active participation of aforesaid molecules.  The many component modetl, hereinafter  called linear-quadratic-cubic (LQC) model,  is an attempt to porvide 
a better mathematical formulation which could demonstrate the contribution of various kinds of biomolecules in biological effect of radiation.  This model has only one independent parameter  &alpha;/&beta;.<BR>

<B>Results:</B>  Three methods, for testing the fit of the proposed model and deriving the values of &alpha;/&beta;, are employed using multifractionation isoeffect data.  These methods, i.e. (log Dm - log Dn) versus (dn - dm) 
plot, SFe-plot and logD versus d plot, provede their respective values of &alpha;/&beta; as 12.50 Gy, 12.51 Gy and 12.54 Gy for spleen, 7.41 Gy , 7.79 Gy and 7.42 Gy for kidney, a15.87 Gy, 15.09 Gy and 14.69 Gy for colon with 3 h interval, 12.50 Gy, 12.84 Gy and 12.45 Gy for colon with 12 h interval and 8.47 Gy 8.84 Gy and 8.51 Gy for colon with 24 h interval. Since other parameters of the model are the derivatives of &alpha;/&beta; therefore can be derived using the values of &alpha;/&beta;.<BR>

<B>Discussion:</B>  Graphical representation of afore said sets of data show that the plotted points have a certain amount of scattering which is not at the wider scale and can be well or less well described by a straight line.<BR>

<B>Conclusion:</B>  This model eliminates the shortcomings of LQ model and provides a satisfactory explanation of various radiobiological processes occurring during and after irridiation.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he formulation of a reliable model of radiation action is to describe the results of radiobiological experiments.  The mechanism of the radioation damage to cell occurs at physical, chemical and biological level which is a complex phenomena.  It is widely accepted  that linear-quadratic (LQ) model is able to explain the above cited radiation actions upto certain extent.  Although the DNA molecule is an important 
and more critical target within the cell but the contribution  of other organic and inorganic molecules towards cell killing, cannot be neglected.  These molecules may also act as a target of the cell.  Therefore, the consideration of 2 targets, corresponding to 2 strands of DNA molecule, within the cell is not an appropriate assumption.  Some of the cell lines have, experimentally, shown that  there are more than 2 targets present within the cell.<BR><BR>

In this communication, we will present an extension of LQ model which will be able to explain phisical, chemical and biological actions occurring in the irradiating tissues.  The present formulation, which we call linear-quadratic-cubic (LQC) model, is based on the ideas given in the literature [3, 8-10].  In this study, we will consider 2 types of radiation damages viz. lethal radiation damage or irrepairable radiation damage and sublethal radiation damage or repairable radiaiton damage. The sublethal damage may cooperate to  lead lethal damage of the cell through mutual interactions.<BR><BR>

<B>Material and Methods</B><BR><BR>

The following mechanisms of the radiation action are assumed to describe various porcesses occurring in the tissue during and after irradiation.  During the irradiation of the tissue, different kinds of physical, chemical and biological products are produced.  The physical products are very short-lived in which excitation and ionization occur through photo-electric effect, Compton effect and pair pproduction.  The excitation and ionization produce water and organic radicals, called chemical products which ract with 
molecules in the  cell causing biomolecular damage.  The biomolecular damage in organic material is relatively longer-lived than phisical and chemical products.  The entire process can also be explained in terms of direct and indirect action of the radiation.  In direct action, when radiation is absorbed in biological material, there is a possibility that it will interact with DNA molecule and nuclear membrane in the cell.  The atoms of  DNA molecule and nuclear membrane itself may be ionized to a biological damage.  While in indirect action, the radiation may interact with other atoms or molecules than DNA molecule and nuclear membrane in the cell, particularly with water molecuels, to produce free radicals that are able to diffuse far enough to reach and damage the DNA molecule or nuclear membrane.  Therefore, it can be stated that even a single molecule of the cell may act as a target of the cell and may lead to the cell death.  The present formulaiton is based on the following assumptions.<BR><BR>

<UL COMPACT>
<LI>1.  Every living cell contrains many number of targets and each of them is responsible to cell death.

<LI>2. Each type of radiation causes 2 different kinds of biological damages which we  call lethal and  sublethal damages. The lethal damage is incapable to rapair which directly leads to the cell death.  While sublethal damage is capable to repair and may also  lead to the cell death (lethal damage) through mutual interaction.
<LI>3. The lethal damage is directly proportional to dose while sublethal damage is a complex power sireies of the dose.
</UL>
Above cited reasons show that survival fraction is not only a simple linear function of dose but also be a 
function of a power series of dose.  Consequently the survival fraction may be represented by

S = exp( -aDebD)				(1)

In which "a" and "b" are 2 constants with specifi units of Gy, Equation (1) can alson bee written as

S = exp[-aD -abD - (ab/2!) D - ...].

With analogous to the LQ model the survival fraction assumes the form

S = exp(-*D - *D - *D -...)		(2)

Where a = *, ab =  *, ab /2! =* and so on.  The frequency of biological  effect can be written by taking  
logarithm of equation (2) from both side

-log(S) = *D  +  *D + *D + ...
        E = *D  +  *D + *D + ...		(3)

To explain various terms of equation (3) we consider many number of targets in the  cell. The first term of 
equation (3) represented by  *D  is corresponding to lethal damage in which all the targets hit in a single 
radiaiton event (track) or simultaneously occurring more than 1 radiation events.  This type  of damage is 
not capable to reprair which we call A type damaga as assumed by Dale [4] in case of   LQ model.  The 
second term represented by  *D   is a repaireable damage where all the targets are being git in 2 distinct 
radiation events,this type of damage we call B type damage.  The third term of equation (3) represented by   
*D  which we call C type damage in which all the targets are being hit in 3 distinct radiation events.  
This type of damage is also a repairagle damage.  The other terms of equation (3) can also be explained in 
similar way. All the terms corresponding to B,C,... type  of damages have to be called sublethal damage 
which are repaireable.  The sublethal damage  may also interact with each other ot produce lethal damage.

The individual values of  *, *, *, ... do not have more significance (as discussed in case of  LQ  model [1]  
) while the ratios like */* , */*,...  are most important  parameters of this model.  Therefore,  in terms of 
these parameters the equation can be written as

E/* = D [1 + (* /* )D + (*/*) D + ...]	(4)

or BED = D [1 + (* /* )D + (*/*) D + ...]	(5)

Where BED = E/* known as biologically effective dose (BED) and bracheted term of equation (5) is 
known as relative effectiveness (RE) per unit dose (as assumed by Fowler [6]  in case of LQ model)

i.e. RE = 1 + (* /* )D + (*/*) D + ...	(6)

For fractionated radiotherapy in which treatment is delivered in "n" number of fra tions with small dose 
"d" per fraction then the equation of survial fraciton can be written as.

S = exp (-andebd)				
					(7)
or S = exp [- n(ad ++ abd  + ( ab/2!)d + ...) ]

or S = exp[-n(*d + (*D  +*d  + ...) ]	(8)

where *, *, *, ... have already been defined above.  Now the equation for fractionated many component 
model may assume the form.

E = n (*d + (*D  +*d ...)			(9)

and the equations for BED and RE can be witten as 

BED = nd [1 +  (* /* )d + (*/*) d + ..)	(10)
 
and R = .1 +  (* /* )d + (*/*) d + ...	(11)

In the formulaiton of the equation of fractionated many component model, it is assumed that equal dose 
per fracitons are isoeffective in nature and there is sufficient time between the fractions to allow full 
recovery of sublethal damage.

It has already been stated that the values of the ratios */* , */*,... have their important significance in the 
estimaiton of the size of dose per fraction instead of the values of individual constants like *, *, *, etc.  
The ratios of these constants are said to be the tissue specific parameters and their values vary from tissue 
to tissue.  To determine the values of these parameters (ratios), n different kinds of isoeffective 
fracitonated schedules with n different values of total doses must be considered to solve n number of 
equaitons, for all the tissue specific parameters which would be an extremely complex exercise.  
Therefore, original  equation of many component model must be used because it has only 1 independent 
parameter */*. Since other parameters are the derivatives of this parameter therefore  can be obrained 
using its value.

E = andexp(bd)
i.e. BED = E/a = ndexp(bd)		(12)

it has already been given that  * = a, *  = ab,  * =ab/2! and so on.
Therefore, b = * /*, b/2! = */*

or (1/2!)  ((* /*)  =  */* , other ratios can also be defined in the same manner.  Equation (12) may 
assume the form,

BED = ndexp [* /*)d]			(13)

Theree methods are proposed to determine the value of */*  raito, which are as follows:



First Method  - (log Dm - log Dn)  versus (dn  - dm) plot:

In this method, 2 fracitonated treatment schedules of total doses Dm and Dn involving m and n number of 
fractions delivered at  dn  and  dm     dose per fraction, respectively, are assumed to be biologically 
isoeffective and alteration in the size of dose per fraction does not change the value of */* ratio (as 
considered by Tucker [11] in case of  LQ model).  BED equations for these schedules can be written as

BEDm  =  mdm exp [* /*)dm  ]
or  log (BEDm)  = log Dm = (* /*)dm

and BEDn  = ndnexp [ (* /*)dn ]
or log (BEDn) = log Dn  + (* /*)dn 

Where Dm  = mdm and Dn = ndn .

Since both the  schedules are isoeffective.  Therefore, we may have
log (Dm) - log (Dn)  = (* /*) (dn  - dm) 		(14)

Equaiton (14) the effects of proliferaiton, incomplete repair of sublethal damage and accumulaiton of cells 
in resistant phase of the cell cycle have not been taken into account.  If time interval between the fractions 
is insufficient to allow full repair of sublethal damage then there is an accumulation of incomplete repair 
and other factors like proliferaiton and accumulaiton of cells in resistance phase of the cell cycle are also 
present then aa nonzero term must be added into equation (14) and may be expressed as

log (Dm)  - log (Dn)  = (* /*) (dn  - dm) + r		(15)

Where "r" is a nonzero term and represents combined effects of above said factors such as proliferaiton, 
imcomplete repair of sublethal damage and accumulation of cells in resistance phase of the cell cycle.

Second Method - (1/logD)  versus  (d/logD) plot or SF-plot:

Although afiresaud method is the most accurate way to calculate */*   ratio and easiest method which 
gives a fairly accurate value but to verify the validity of equation (1) 2 more methods can also be used to 
calculate the value of */* .  These mehtods are illustrated as follows.

Equation (13) may be written as

logBED = logD  + (* /*)d				(16)
or
(1/logD) = (1/logBED)  + [(* /*)/ (logBED) ] [d/logD)]
						(17)

Eequation (17) shows that a plot of 1/(logD) versus d/(logD) gives a straight line with an intercept of 
1/(log BED) on vertical axic and a slope of  (* /*)/(log BED).  The ratio of intercept ot the slope provides 
the value of */* .  This plot is similar to Fe-plot, proposed by Douglas and Fowler [5] to calculate the 
value of */*  ratiio in case of LQ model, and here we call above described plot  as SFe-plot (similar to Fe-
plot).


Third Method - logD versus d plot:

Similarly equation (16) can also be written as

logD = logBED -  (* /*)d				(18)

Equation (18) is also showing that a plot of LogD versus d gives a straight line with an intercept on 
vertical axis and a slope of logBED and  * /* , respectively.  The reciprocal of the numerical value of the 
slope provides an estimate of */*  ratio.  This plot is analogous to D versus dD plot, designed by Boer and 
De [2] to calculate the value of   */* in case of LQ model and here we call it logD versus d plot.

Results

The 3 aforedescribed methods, for testing the it of newly proposed model and for deriving the values of */
*, are illustrated using multifractionation isoeffect data from literature.  These methods are employed to 
determine the values of */* ratio for spleen, kidney and colon pulbished by Withers [13], Jordan et al. [7], 
Tucker et al. [12] and Withers and Mason [14] respectively.


First Method  - (logDm - logDn)  versus (dn - dm) plot:

Figures 1 and 2 show the plots of (logDm - logDn)versus (dn - dm)  for each of the data set for spleen and 
kidney respectively.  These data set, plotted in this manner, have been fitted to straight lines which are 
forced to pass through origin.  In case of spleen, the points lie reasonably close to the fitted regression line 
and its  slope of * /* = 0.08 Gy gives an estimate of * /*  = 122.50 Gy.  While in case of kidney, the 
points are scattered but not widely, and are less well described by a straight line.  The regression line 
fitted to these data has a slope of * /* = 0.135 Gy  with an estimate of */*  = 7.41 Gy.

Summary<BR><BR>

Genetic approaches provide a new insight into the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying blood pressure regulation and hypertension.  Some progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of rare forms of hypertension.  Common forms of hypertension are likely to be due to combinations of DNA vatiants of several genes involved in blood pressure regulation.  Only little progress has been made in the identification of the 
underlyinbg genetic factors, due to the complex nature of this disease.  Experimental crosses of hypertensive rats offer an ideal setting for the genetic dissection of mammalian physiology.  With the opportunity to study inbred rat strains the problem of genetic heterogrneity becomes irrelevant.  Cosegregation studies investigating candidate genes for hypertension have been carried out for a nember of genes.  Moreover, systematic mapping of 
uantitative trait loci involved in blood pressure regulation has recently become possible in genetically hypertensive rat models.  In contrast, genetic studies involving hypertensive individuals are currently limited to the investigation of candidate genes in association and sib-pair analysis.  So far, the angiotensionogen gene is the only locus that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human hypertension in association as well as sib-pair 
analysis. Considering the compplexities of genetic hypertension, animal models will play an imppportant role in the genetic dissection of this disease.  A critical prereuisite for the study of human hypertension is the availability of large patient and family cohorts.<BR><BR>

Primary hypertension in man is one of the most common chronic diseases [9].  It shows a significant  degree of heritability [11, 12, 19] and is commonly recognized as a complex polygenic disorder, with the exception of rare  monogenetic forms [20,30].<BR>

Through the possibility, that one can systematically discover the genes causing ingerited disease without prior clue as to how they funciton, genetic analysis of human diseases has become an important tool.  The method of genetic mapping, by which one compares the inheritance pattern of a disease with the inheritance pattern of chromosomal regions, allows to  identify where a disease gene is located without knowing what it might be.  This approach became feasable with the notion that naturally occurring DNA sequence vatiation provided an almost unlimited number supply of genetic markers to study inheritance in human families [5, 27].  The interest in mapping rare human disease having simple Mendelian ingeritance grew rapidly; recently, two rare monogenetic forms of hypertension have been mapped and theiir underlying mutations identified [20,30].  Unfortunatly, most traits of 
medical relevance do not follow Mendelian monogenic inheritance.  Such complex traits include, among others, susceptibilities to heart disease, htpertension, diabetes, and cancer.<BR><BR>

<B>Characteristics  of  Complex  Traits</B><BR>

The term complex trait refers to any phenotype that does not exhibit classical Mendelian inheritance caused by a single gene.  In general, complexities arise, when the simple correspondance between genotype and phenotype breaks sown, either because the same genotype can result in different phenotypes or different genotypes result in the same phenotype.<BR>

It is typically impossible to fand pperfect cosegregation of a genetic marker with a complex trait, which is due to problems that are essential in understanding why the genetic analysis of a complex disease like hypertension is extremly difficult.  1.  OIncomplete penetrance and phenocopy:  Some individuals who inherit a a predisposing allele may not manifest the disease (incomplete penetrance), while others who do not inherit any predisposing allele may nonetheless get the disease (phenocopy).  The genotyppe at a certain locus therefore affects the probability of disease, but does not fully determine the outcome of the disease.  Penetrance depends on other interacting genes, age, sex, and environmental factors.  2. Genetic heterogeneity:  Mutations in any of several genes may result in identical 
pphenotypes.  Genetic hyterogeneity makes the genetic mapping of the disease difficult, because a chromosomal region may cosegregate with the the disease in some families but not in others. 3. Polygenic ingeritance:  Some thraits may require the simultaneous presence of mutations in multiple genes.  PPolygenic traits may be classified as discrete traits measured by a specific outcome (e.g. death from myocardial infarcion) or quantitative traits measured by a continuous vatiable (e.g. blood pressure).  Polygenic ingeritance complicates genetic mapping, because no single locus is strictly required to produce a discrete trait or high value of a quantitative trait.<BR><BR>

<B>Experimental Crosses  to  Analyse  Complex  Traits</B><BR>

Experimental crosses (e.g. rats)  offer an ideal setting for genetic dissection of mammalian physiology.  With the opportunity to study large cohorts of offspring from inbred rat strains the problem of genetic heterogeneity can be solved and far more complex genetic interactions can be investigated better than ever possible in human families.  Of course, the limitation is that their implication for human disease needs to be established in each case.<BR>

The power of experimental crosses especially lies within the dissection of a quantitative trait into discrete genetic factors, called quantitative trait loci (QTL).  Systematic mapping of quantitative trait loci in the rat has recently become possible with the identification of large amounts of genetic markers in the rat and a suitable approach to analyse the whole genome, named interval mapping.<BR>

Interval mapping uses pphenotypic and genetic marker informaiton to estimate the probable genotype and the most likely quantitative trait loci effect at every point in the genome.  This approach has been applied to study the genetic basis of hypertension in the rat and resulted in the identification of several QTLs, including a chromosomal region that contained the 
angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) [13,16].<BR><BR>

<B>The Challenge  of Finding  the  Genetic  Basis  of  Human  Hypertension</B><BR>

Except for a small number of syndromes in which a simple Mendelian ingeritance pattern is observed, the mode of ingeritance of promary  hypertension appears to be complex.  This impplies that hypertension represents a polygenic trait that shows strong dependence on environmental factors (multifactorial pathogenesis and is heterogeneous with respect to the 
genes involved, as well as their relative importance among different affected individuals or families.  In addition, the nature of hypertension as a quantitative, rather than a dichotomous trait, its incomplete penetrance, and the variable delay of phenotype manifestation make the investigation of its pathogenesis all the more difficult.<BR>

Animal strains that display hypertension as an ingerited characteristic, represent an attractive substitute for human hypertension, and provide a reductionist esprerimental approach which circumvents some of the compplexity of human disease.  Fully inbred animal models expressing a genetically determined disease avoid the pproblem of genetic heterogeneity, which in humans reduces statistical power to a degree that may preclude detection of 
individual genetic factors.  In addition,  animal experimentation allows a much more precise control of environmental factors.  Most importantly, the ability to produce specific cross-bred hybrid populations of predetermined genetic constellation and cohort size provedes a set of extremely  powerful experimental tools for carrying out genetic linkage analyses.<BR><BR>

<B>Rat  Models  of  Hypertension</B><BR>

The development of a genetically  homogeneous (homozygous at all loci) strain exhibiting a phenotype of interest (usually a disease, in this case hypertension)  as a heritable trait is conceptually straight forward.  From a colony of outbred or partially inbred animals,  those displaying the phenotype of interest  (i.t. elevated blood pressure) are used for selective 
breeding over several generations.  Once the trait has been fixed, brother-sister mating is begun and commonly maintained for about 20 consecutive generations to achieve virtual genetic homogeneity, all the while verifying the continued presence of the phenotype of interest. By performing an analogous breeding pprodedure in animals in whom the pathologic trait is absent, a similarly homogeneous, but non-diseased strain may be created. 
Such strains are commonly called "control" strains and have been widely used for comparative studies in which pparticular characteristics are contrasted among diseas strain and "controls".  It is essential that while the two strains will, of course, differ with regard to 
the disease-causing genes, they will also differ in a multitude of additional loci that have been fixed by chance in the process of separating the two strains and that are altogether unrelated to the disease in question.  Yet, in a compparative study, any of these loci may show a perfect correlation with the actual phenotype of interest; in fact, since there are so many more 
disease-unrelated differences between the strains, the odds of identifying a disease-relevant locus or characteristic by this approach are sidcouragingly low,  The term "control" strain is therefor inapproppriate and should be eliminated.  The extent to which disease-relevant differences among the two strainns depends on the degree to which the original colony was inbred.  The only legitimate approach is one trhat relies on the principles of cosegregation and linkage analysis that will be discussed in more detail below. If this approach is used, the question regarding the choice of an appropriate "control" strain becomes irrelevant (see below).  Today, the only possible legitimization of comparative sutdies between disease-carrying and "normal" strains is that "differences"  between the two will point to candidate genes that may subsequently be analyzed in a cosegregation study; in all other respects, they have become obsolete.<BR>

The rat has been used most widely to  investigate hypertension as it combines several practical advantages, namely the feasibility of conducting rather sophisticated hemodynamic investigations, ease of breeding, and relatively short generation times. Also, judging from the substantial number of rat models of genetic hypertension in existence today, the rat may well mirror humans in a relatively high prevalence of alleles that can give rise to hypertension. The characteristics of many of these strains have recently been reviewed [24].<BR>

The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has been used more widely than any other in experiments investagating the pathomechanism of hypertension.  It was developed by selective breeding form a colony of (incompletely inbred)  Westar rats where individual animals were observed to have elevated blood pressures [26].  In the vast majority of investigations using this strain the investigational strategy was to compare any of a large number of measurable physiological, biochemical, pharmacological, etc.  parameters with similar measurements  obtained in a "control" strain for which, aditionally, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat  was most commonly used.  The WKY had been establised as a normotensive, inbred strain from the same colony from which the SHR were originally dereved, but many generations later [23], and shows marked genetic differences (an estimated 50 million base pair differences compared with SHR [18, 31]).  As pointed out above, it is obvious that this degree of genetic divergence between hte two strains renders any comparative study useless.  
Another strain of genetically hypertensive rats shall be mentioned because it is paradigmatic for the multifactorial nature of human hypertension where specific gene-environment (ecognetic) interactions may play an important role: in the Dahl rat strains [8] the interaction with enviroonmental (dietary) factors is critical for hte development of hypertension in the 
salt-sensitive strain, but has no effect in the salt resistant strain.<BR>

Cosegregation and linkage analyses, are the only effective strategies for the investigation of inbred strains. In an intercross population all loci segregate freely, and of all those different among the parental strains only those truly relevant for expression of the phenotype of interest will remain associated with this phenotype in the hybrid progeny (since they are, in 
fact, determining the phenotype).  Thus, these studies can unambiguously test whether a gene is causally involved in the pathogenesis of disease, something quite impossible using comparative (case-control) studies which can only provide a measure of association.  For cosegregation studies the question of a "control" strain becomes moot [22]:  As long as they are inbred, any two strains that differ in a phenotype of interest may be used in such an 
experiment to successfully detect disease-causing loci.  It is important, however, to realize that, depending on the choice of non-diseased strain used ofor performing the  cross, different loci may be detected as pathogenetically important in the same diseased model strain.  In practice, one tests for the presence of cosegregation of phenotype (disease] parameters and one or more "polymorphic markers".  A polymorphic marker represents a difference between the two parental strains based DNA sequence differences.<BR>

Although the futility of simple comparisons between inbred animal models and their "control" strains has been pointed out for some time [22, 28] , only recently a trend towards the application of genetically based strategies in experimental hypertension research is seen, concomitant with recent developments in molecular genetics.  Cosegregation of genotyppe and a phenotyppe trait establishes, with the constraints of linkage analysis, that a causative gene resides in a particular chromosomal region defined by the polymorphic marker used.<BR>

Two concepptually different schemes of linkage analysis have been employed in the study of hypertension genetics in experimental animals:  One, termed the "candidate gene approach" takes advantage of polymorphisms in genes that encode proteins of known or suspeted importance in the regulation of blood pressure, the developmental, or structural aspects of elements of the crdiovascular system.  A positive cosegregation result with such a marker is 
considered string evidence for a pathogenetic role of the particular gene investigated. A second, approach makes use of anonymous polymorphic markers that are widely, and ideally evenly distributed across the entire genome.  Such a "grid" of individual map-points can be used to determine the approximate localization of a disease-relevant gene by linkage analysis; 
therefore, the  name interval mapping.  These anonymous markers are derived from reperitive sequence elements dispersee throughout the genome, based either on short (microsatellites, simple sequence length polymorphisms, SSLPs) or longer (minisatellites, variable number tandem repeats, VNTRs) sequence domains that are repeated as tandem arrays wherever they are found.
<BR><BR>
<B>Genetic  Analyses  in  Human  Hypertension</B><BR>

Given the difficulties faced by dissecting complex diseases as outlined at the beginning, it comes as no surprise that the investigation of the genetic factors operative in polygenic forms of human hypertension has made only vety little progress.  Conceptually, these studies can be executed either in large cohorts of unrelated cases and controls as association sutdies, or in related subjects as linkage analyses. Only the candidate gene approach lends itself to association studies due to the rapid loss of linkage disequilibrium between even relatively closely situated loci in outbred populations.  Presently, only few studies evaluated candidate genes in affected sib-pairs, where the observed degree of coingeritance of a marker is contrasted with the expected frequency given known (identity-by-descent analysis) or unknown (identity-by-state analysis).<BR>

Positive linkage results for the renin[29] and ACE [13, 16] genes in genetically hypertensive rat models have led to the systematic analysis of the components of the renin-angiotensin system in human hypertension.  Based on a study in which both affected sib-pair and association analysis were employed, the angiotensinogen locus has been implicated as playing a pathogenic role in hypertension [17].  Despite the seemingly logical and intriguing connection between particular angiotensinogen genotypes, plasma angiotensinogen genotypes, plasma angiotensinogen levels, and hypertension, it should be emphasized that statistically  significant results in this study were only obtained after a considerable degree of post-hoc re-stratification of patient samples.  Furthermore, apparent discordent trends in, and 
lack of correlation of the data are noted on close review.  1.The association data on the M235T angiotensinogen molecular varient are not correlated with the linkage data.  2.Linkage was observed only in males, not in females, contrasting the correlation of angiotensinogen plasma levels and the M235T angiotensinogen  molecular variant that was stronger in females than males.  Together, it weakens the unifying hypothesis that increased angiotensinogen plasma levels due the M236T angiotensinogen molecular variant underlie 
hypertension in males and females.<BR>

Independent reports by Hate et al [10] and Caulfield et al. [7]alsoimplicated a role of the angiotensionogen in human hypertension.  So far, no convincing pathophysiological mechanism has been ppostulated by which a molecular variant M235T of the angiotensinogen gene might lead to hypertension.  Further investigations need to clarify if the M235T mutant might just represent a marker in close linkage disequilibrium to a yet undefined mutation [21].  Reports of the putative involvement of the angiotensinogen gene in preeclampsia [1,32], do not add to the validation of the M235T angiotensinogen molecular variant as a gene underlying primary hypertension, since the two are considered as distinct etiological entities based on studies showing no increase risk to  develop primary hypertension in women with preeclampsia in their first pregnancy.   No animal to human corroboration has been found, analysing the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat [14].<BR>

Several other genes have been inverstigated as candidate genes in hypertension, montly in association studies with a small number of patients.  The  investigation of the SA gen, angiotensin II  receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were investigated by association and linkage analysis, the same strategy that has been employed for the agniotensinogen gene [3, 4, 25].  The SA gene revealed no evidence of a majur hypertension gene in this study, contrasting the results by Iwai et al. [15], who found evidence for 
association of hypertension with an RFLP.<BR>

The angiotensin II receptor showed evidence for association, but negative linkage data.  Further studies need to clarify this discrepancy.  For the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene both, association and affected sibpair studies were negative.<BR>

An interesting corroberation between the Milan hypertensive rat (MHS) and human hypertension was found. A mutation in the alpha-subunit of the adducin gene was implicated in the pathogenesis of genetic  hypertension in MHS [2].  Moreover, Bianchi et al.[2] demonstrated a modifying effect  of a mutation in the beta-subunit of the adducin gene, which is located on a different chromosome.  Caseri et al. [6] suggested an implication of the alpha-subunit adducin gene locus in human hypertension, based on different  allele frequencies of a genetic marker close to the alpha-subunit adducin gene locus, in 190 hypertensive patients and 126 controls.<BR>

Negative results do not rule out a role of investigated genes in certain individuals or families who may not have been appropriately represented in the populations studied.  In general, the sample sizes used so far in all studies (ranging from less than 100 unrelated individuals to slightly more 
than 200 Sib-pairs) are likely to be inadequate to reach any firm conclusions; given the perceived heterogeneity of the disease, considerably larger collectives will have to be studied.<BR>

<B>Conclusion</B><BR>

Considering the complexities of genetic hypertension, animal  models will play an important role in the genetic dissection of this disease. Information about genetic factors identified in such experimental systems may provide new insights into disease mechanisms that can then be applied to the generation and testing of hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of the disease in humans.  Because disease-causing mutations may occur in many steps in a pathway, animal models may not point to the genes most frequently mutated in human disease. However, they should identify key genes acting on the same physiological system.<BR>

A critical role for the study of human hypertension is the availability of very large patient and family cohorts.  Genetic approaches have been limited to the investigation of a relatively small number of candidate genes.  With the collection of very large populations other genetic approaches, investigating the whole genome, may become possible.<BR>

<p><font size="+2" color="#004080">Fissler builds on buoyant jubilee year as innovation brings success</font>

<p>The new market profile under the motto "Fissler: Quality and Ideas" as well as three new product innovations helped make 1995, the company's 150th jubilee year, a great success. They also gained ISO 9001 certification.

<p>The market leader for saucepans in Germany is looking for further growth in 1996. This is particularly the case in export markets. To support their activities in the Far East, Fissler will set up a new subsidiary in Singapore.

<p>Ahead of their time for 150 years, Fissler has a tradition of manufacturing high quality cookware and combining technological know-how and meticulous production on the one hand with creativity and sensitivity to the market on the other. Now on the threshold of a new millennium, Fissler's product philosophy continues to be directed towards advantages for the consumer.

<H1>SYSTEM OVERVIEW</H1> 
<H2><B>G</B>eneral<B> D</B>escription</H2> 
<P> <B>T</B>he System provides an advaced state-of-the-art audio
solution for the aircraft.</P><P> <B>T</B>he System is based on a
modular concept, using two basic "building block" units:</P><UL>
<LI><B>ACP</B> - Audio Control Panel</LI>
<LI><B>AIU</B> - Audio Interfase Unit</LI></UL> 
<P><B>T</B>he ACP serves as the operator's interfase and conseguentli
is located in the cockpit (see <A HREF="crew.htm">flight crew operation</A>section).
</P> 
<P><B>T</B>he AIU is mounted in the eguipment bay in proximity to the
radios. The AIU is basically an un-blocked audio matrix with gain
control, multiplexing and distribution capability.</P> 
<P><B>T</B>he AIU interfaces with up to 4 ACP's, 4 Radios, 5
Navigation System, as well as with the intercommunication system, 6
discrete input-outputs and recording output. The AIU also contains a
SELCAL board and two 10-watt amplifiers.
</P> 
<P>                                           </P>   
<H2><B>S</B>ystem <B>C</B>ontrol <B>C</B>oncept</H2> 
<P><B>T</B>he AIU's are controlled by the ACP's via the control bus.
All the AIU's and ACP's are interfaced via a digital control bus. This
concept enables direct access of every ACP to every AIU. </P><P><B>T</B>his
concept reduces wire runs and weight and also enables simple future
expansion and flexibility for configuration upgrages.</P><P>The bus is
designed with a double redundancy (2 pairs), built in, so that failure
of any unit does not affect audio system operation. </P> 
<P></P>  
<H2><B>A</B>udio <B>D</B>istribution <B>C</B>oncept</H2>   
<P><B>W</B>hen the desired operation mode is selected by any ACP, the
AIU configures a two-way (TX, RX) Audio Link between the selected
eguipment inputs and the ACP. </P><P><B>T</B>he selected Receive Audio
Signals are connected in the matrix, gain-controlled, multiplexed and
transferred from the AIU to the ACP, via only one Receive pair (RX).</P><P>
<B>T</B>he MIC's Audio Signal outputs are combined in the ACP and
transferred to the AIU via one transmit  pair (TX). The AIU distributes
the Audio Signal to the selected transmiter/intercommunication system.</P><P
><B>U</B>tilizing Audio Unblocked matrix switching and multiplexing
technigues enables simultaneous and independent driving, monitoring and
control of all the audio sources by every air crew operator.</P><P><B>B</B>y
using only 2 pairs of wires between the ACP and the AIU, wire runs in
the aircraft are significantly reduced. In addition, the AIU has a
built-in SELCAL board, two built-in 10-watt amplifiles and a 1020 Hz
Identification  Filter.</P><P><B>A</B>ll of the above consinderations
have a positive impact on the total aircraft wieght and cost.</P>       
   
<H2><B>S</B>ystem <B>C</B>onfiguration</H2>    
<P><B>T</B>he basic configuration consists of one AIU and one to four
ACP's.</P><P><B>A</B> good practice is to mount 2 AIU's in separate
radio eguipment racks.  This configuration enables supporting up to 8
ACP's, 8 Tranceivers, 10 Navigation Systems and 8 Warning Signals, as
well as intercommunication functions.</P><P><B>F</B>urthermore, this
configuration supports 6 independent selective calling channels, two
10-watt Loudspeaker Amplifiers and a 10-watt APU Fire Bell Alarm.</P><P><B>
B</B>y utilizing this configuration, AIU redundancy, as well as wire run
savings, are achieved.</P>

<H1>Flight Crew Operation</H1> 
<P></P> 
<P>Each flight crew member has access to the entire aircraft audio
system capabilities via individual ACP front, as follows: </P><H2><B>T</B>ransmitting
Mode:</H2> 
<P><B>T</B>ransmit over any installed transceiver (up to 8
transceivers).</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>C</B>ommunicate with any member of the flight crew and/or ground
maintenance personnel via the cockpit intercom system.  </P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>A</B>djust side-tone level.</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>C</B>ommunicate with the cabin via the cabin galley phone.</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>P</B>age the cabin area(s).</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>T</B>ransmit using einther the MASK MICRIPHONE (MIC) or BOOM
MIC, with the provision to have HAND MIC operation available at all
times. Three separate PRESS-TO-TALK (PTT) keys are available for each
operator.</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>S</B>election of the MASK control button activates and connects
the MASK MIC into the system. The system automatically enters the HOT
MIC mode (HOT MIC mode can be inhibited by keying the HOT MIC key).</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>S</B>election of the VOX control button enables the operator to
adjust the transmit VOX break level. (it is important to minimize the
breathing noise when the "MASK MIC" is being used, and also to minimize
the background noise in all other modes of operation). </P> 
<P></P> 
<P></P>
<P></P> 
<H2><B>R</B>eceiving Mode:</H2> 
<P><B>M</B>onitor and adjust separately each received audio level for
all combinations of communication and/or navigation (NAV) receivers (up
to 10 NAV receivers).</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>F</B>ilter the identifier code from the appropriate NAV receiver
signals.</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>M</B>oniztor and adjust the audio output over the cockpit
speakers and headphones or headphones only. </P> 
<P></P>  
<P><B>A</B>djust level or received cockpit intercom audio. </P> 
<P></P> 
<P><B>T</B>he MASTER VOL enables the operator to adjust all of the
combined, received, audio signals simultaneously.</P> 
<P></P>   
<H3>In the emergency mode EMG, the Audio system is bypassed. A
preselected tranceiver is connected directly to the operator. The system
enters the EMG mode automatically in case of system failure, or the EMG
mode may by manually selected by the operator. </H3>

<B>Human Brain Hyperthermia Studies</B><BR><BR>

Over the last 2 decades many human brain HT studies have been conducted involving various tumors, HT techniques, treatment schedules and combinationa with ChT and/or RT [6, 13, 14, 29, 33, 34, 44, 45, 52, 53, 55, 71, 72, 77, 85, 86, 90, 91, 93-96, 98, 100, 103, 104, 110-112, 115].  Primary and recurrent tumors and localized metastases were treated. Over 400 patients have been  entered into phase I/II studies, but sofar no randomized study has been published. Tables <A HREF="table3.htm">3</A> and <A HREF="table4.htm">4 </A>summarize clinical HT trials.<BR><BR>

<I>Treatment Concepts</I><BR><BR>

The applied HT methods are summarized on <A HREF="hyprthm1.htm#table1>Table 1.</A>  Interstitial MW-HT has been the prefered technique.  Initially, HT was applied after surgery, while in recent trials interstitial HT was combined with interstitial and external RT and/or ChT.  Various treatment 
schedules were tested. Usually prescribed target temperatures ranged from 41 to 45C, while normal brain tissue was kept below 43C.  In most sutudies at least 1 session of 30 to 60 min at 41&#176; to 44&#176;C was prescribed.  In 1 trial, a short-term HT with 60 to 80 C for 2 to 5min was applied [115]. 
Two studies [25, 52] applied long-term HT (72 to 96 hours 41&#176;C) using hot source or RT-HT techniques which allowed automatically self-control and interaction with continuous low-dose rate or pulsed high-dose rate brachytherapy. The concept is referred to as continuous long-duration moderate HT.<BR><BR>

<I>Clinical Studies</I><BR><BR>

In the first published study [98] 18 brain tumors were heated for up to 40 hours using thermal conduction heating with 1 implanted probe.  Tumor necrosis was observed around the heating probe, while peripheral tumor tissues remained unaffected.  Others have also employed crude HT methods 
and poor thermometry control [6, 14, 33, 34, 77, 90, 91, 110-112, 115). In recent studies, improved HT techniques and thermometry control were used, e.g. in Dartmouth [13, 62, 71, 72, 75, 76], Tucson [29, 95, 96], San Francisco [93, 94], Chesterfield/St. Louis [25, 52, 53) and in several 
Japanese centers [44, 45, 55, 100, 103, 104](Tables <A HREF="table3.htm">3</A> and <A HREF="table4.htm">4</A>).<BR><BR>

Sophisticated interstitial HT and thermometry was reported from Dartmouth [13, 62, 71, 72, 75, 76]: 22 malignant gliomas were treated for 60 min before and after Ir-192 brachtherapy (60 Gy).  Primary tumors received additional external RT (up to 50 Gy).  Thermal mapping was performed at each antenna and 
along an orthogonal catheter.  Follow-up ranged from 3 to 45 monthes. Treatment complications are compiled on <A HREF="table4.htm"> Table 4</A> The achieved temperatures and CT imaging studies were correlated with treatment outcome [62, 75].  The observed minimum (37,2 to 44.3&#176;C) and maximum  tumor temperatures (46.5 to 60.1&#176;C) were  satisfactory, and 71% of all tumor temperatures reached at least 43&#176;C.<BR><BR>

In one Japanese study, 17 patients with glioblastoma multiforme received capacitive HT during operation or postoperatively.  HT was combined with external RH (20 to 50Gy) and ChT (ACNU). Tumor temperatures reached 40 to 46&#176;C, while normal brain temperatures were limited to 38 to 42&#176;C.  A modified technique with stereotactocally placed applicators (1,3 mm OD) alowed HT of small tumors in basal ganglia, cerebelmum and brainstem [103, 104].  In another study [44, 45], 24 malignant gliomas, 88 metastases and 3 other brain tumors received FM-HT and external RT. They were heated 2 to 3 times wiikly for 1 hour. Invasive thermometry included only 1 point within tumor and 1 at an implanted site.  Tumor temperatures at 10 mm distance from the implant reached 42 to 46 C. The response was CR in 4 and PR in 7 patients.  In a recent study, a new interstitial microwave HT technique was aplied which incorporated a cooling system around the microwave antenna [55].<BR><BR>

Long-duration HT was introduced recently [52, 53]. Multiple electrically heated probes were stereotactically implanted at 15 mm distance through a plstic template guide.  The power was contrelled by special  computer algorithms to predict the temperatures around each heating probe and to adjust the power level in real time [4, 188, 19].  HT was applied postoperatively for 72 hours within 4 days, i.e. during 3 of every 4 hours. One hour was used for nursing checks.  No additional treatment was given 
before or after HT.  Fifty patients were treated including 33 with glioblastoma multiforme, 9 with anaplastic astrocytoma and 8 with localized metastases.  One criticism of this study was the lack of thermometry. Median survival was 22 weeks.  The acute and chronic toxicity in this study was diverse, but acceptable (<A HREF="table4.htm">Table 4</A>).<BR><BR>

In a phase-I-study at Hahnemann University Philadelphia, 3 recurrent malignant gliomas were treated with combined interstitial RT and HT. Histology from autopsy brains, pre- and posttreatment CT scans and thermal performance characteristics (minimum teperature ) were correlated with each 
other [86, 87].  All patients tolerated interstitial HT with up to 12 MW antennas and 6 thermometry probes.  Overall survival reached 7 to 15 months  Two autopsy brains revealed no active tumor in the treated regions, but in 1 instrance evident tumor growth in the untreated periphery.  The posttreatment 
conditions of the brain after combined HT-RT indicated, that a postimplant resection could be an additional advisable procedure [39].<BR><BR>

At the University of Arizona, Tucson, scanned focussed US-HT was applied in 10 recurrent and 3 promary malignant gliomas and 2 anaplastic astrocytomas [29].  Up to 4 HT sessions (15 to 60 min) were applied.  Additional external RT for promary (45 to 65 Gy) and recurrent tumors (10 to 40 Gy)  was given. Multipoint thermometry was performed. The best HT session of each patient yielded good minimum (37.3 to 42.7&#176;C) and maximum tumor temperatures (41.1 to 45.9&#176;C).  Survival reached 29 to 57 weeks from diagnosis for promary and 2 to 50 weeks for recurrent tumors.  At  last follow-up, 2 patients were still alive.  At the same institution, FM-HT was employed in 288 patients with primary or recurrent malignant gliomas [95, 96].  Tubes were placed stereotactically at 12 mm distance through an extracranial template.  The implant encompassed a margin of 15 mm beyond the CT contrast-enhancement.  Additional tubes were used for invasive thermometry.  HT was applied for  1 hour before and after brachytherapy (14 to 50 Gy).  Median survival reached 15 monthes for patients with recurrent tumors.  One fatal and 3 major complicaitons were observed (<A HREF"=table4.htm"> Table 4</A>).  Both studies concluded, that HT with external US or ferromagnetic implants is safe and feasible when the tumor volume is  <100 cm.<BR><BR>

At the University fo California San Francisco, 2 studies were initiated [93, 94].  From 1987 to 1990, 48 patients with recurrent brain tumors received HT-RT in a phase- I/II-protocol.  Helical coil microwave antennas with variable heating length were used [80].  It was attempted to heat the target 
volume to a minimum temperature of 42.5&#176;C. Iodine-125 brachytherapy (10 Gy/d at 37 to 70 cGy/h) was applied.  25 hlioblastoma multiforme, 16 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 7 brain metastases were treated.  Median survival reached 49 weeks ( for glioblastoma multiforme) and 140 weeks (for anaplastic astrocytoma). Acute toxicity was acceptable.No treatment related death or onging treatment sequela were observed [94]. Recentlya randomize study for nwely diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme was openedby the Northern California Oncology Group (NCOG protocol  6G-90-2). The treatment incorporates surgery, ChT, external/interstitialRT and randomized interstitial HT. Asof July 1993, 75 eligible patients were entered on this protocol. So far no results are available.<BR><BR>

<I>Treatment toxicity</I><BR><BR>

Although acute toxicity after HT-RT is suprisingly low, only few studies provide detailed data. Assessment of toxicity includes the implantation and removal of the afterloading tubes and the performance of the HT sessions itself.  Usually very few HT sessions were interrupted due to symptoms or 
acute complicaitons and rarely generalized seizures occurred.  Nevertheless, in long-term followww-up aa variety of treatment related sequelae were observed (<A HREF="table4.htm>Table 4</A>):<BR><BR>

Cerebral edema around the treated region represents a reaction of the normal brain to the necrosis which appears about 1 to 3 weeks after HT.  The presence of opment of excessive edema, but also constitutes  a prime medium for infections which subsequently necessitates surgical procedures.  The 
brain edema is probably caused by a ddisruption of the blood-brain barrier in normal brain tissue arround the enhancing brain tumor.  However, the mechanism of blood-brain barrier disruption induced by microwaves or heat isstill not well understood [58,60]. The formaiton of brain necrosis is also observed in patients receiving interstitial R alone [30,48]. Complications requiring surgical intervention after HT-RT are known from several trials: at San Francisco [93, 94] in 38%, at Tucson [95,96] in 11% and at Darmouth [13, 71, 72] in 4%.<BR><BR>

Chronological CT scans revealed changes in the enhancing tumor, the surrounding edema and all necrotic regions after an effective HT-RT treatment [62]. Depending upon the HT performance the volume of hypodensity decreased or increased in size.  This was related tomoderate and quickly reversible (at low temperatures) or severe and long-lasting blood-brain barier changes (at high temperatures).  After HT-RT the CT enhancement increased (representing a disrupted blood-brain barrier) and persisted much longer than after RT alonw. The cause of this persistence is unclear, but possibly the addition of brachtherapy prolonges the temporarily blood-brain barrier opening during 
HT.  Similar changes are known from canine studies [36].<BR><BR>

Useful strategies to avoid cerebral complicaitons are rare. Even advanced HT techniques do not allow to heat the tumor region more selectively.  Moreover, the quesiton of an optimized treatment schedule remains.  It has  been suggested, that incomplete debulking prior to the implantation of seeds can 
trigger postimplant complicaitons; thus the resection of the brain necrosis after completion of HT-RT may be an advisable wat tocircumvent these problems [39].<BR><BR>

<I>Thermal Analysis</I><BR><BR>

A differential heating between tumor and normal brain tissuewas achieved in many sutides [13, 29, 62, 71, 72, 76, 85, 86, 92-95, 102].  Despite poor HT techniques high temperatures were achieved in tumors, while normal brain tissue was well protected form heating.  Thermal performance analysis 
was conducted: a) at Dartnoutn [13, 71, 72, 76] 71% of all tumor temperatures reached 43C (minimum 37.2 to 44.3&#176;C; and maximum 46.5 to 60.1&#176;C);  b) in Tucson [95, 96]  a thersholdd of 42&#176;C  was attained in 61% of the core sensors, in 35% of the peripheral and in 4% of the normal tissue sensors; c) in the US-HT trial [29] minimum (37.3 to 42.7&#176;C) and maximum tumor temperaturess (41.1 to 45.9&#176;C)  were  satisfactory; d) in San Francisco [94] minimum (37.0 to 45.7&#176;C)   and maximum temperatures (39.5 to 51.7&#176;C)  were satesfactory.  A threshold tumor temperature of 42.5  C was reached in 61%.  A thermal dose response was also reported in several 
experimental studies [1, 2, 36, 69, 70, 92].  In summary, recent HT technologies seem to be effective enough to allow for a selective tumor heating without major heat deposition at normal tissues.<BR><BR>

<I>Prognostic   Factors</I><BR><BR>

Histology is an important prognostic factor of malignant gliomas:  Glioblastoma multiforme faired worse than anplastic astrocytoma [29, 52, 53, 94, 96].  Another factor is tumor type:  Primary tumors reach a better median survival than recurrent tumors.  In the UCSF trial, the prognosisi of recurrent tumors was poor (11 months median survival for 25 glionblastoma patients), but still significantly better than previously reported by the same institution for patients treated with interstitial rt alone [30, 48].  
Karnofsky [94] and age [29, 94, 96] were also prognostic factors in univaritreatment outcome [94, 96].  Wxperimental [20,36, 70, 92] and human sutides [93-96] suggest, that outcome (survival, freedom from tumor progression) is also correlated with thermal parameters, i/e/ minimum "thermal dose", minimum tumor temperature and index temperature T90 [93, 94]. In multivariate analysis the actuarial freedom from progression was far better for tumors achieving a T90>41.5&#176;C vs. a T90<41.5&#176;C (p<0.0001).  In contrast, in the Tucson trial, T90 was not a prognostic factor [95, 96].<BR><BR>

<I>Future Perspectives</I><BR><BR>

Clearly, further biological, technical and clinical studies are necessity: Improved techniques are essential to focus heating, individualize power deposition and conform the heating to the irregular target volume.  Laser [3, 5, 66, 74, 97] and US [21] are under research: a) Multi-element tubular US 
transducers can be placed within a catheter surrounded by a coupling fluid or directly into the tissue [21]; power can be controlled separately for each cylindrical segment; b) stereotaxic steering of a heated metallic device through the target volume under CT guidance by means of an externally 
induced magnetic field and 3D planning [28, 59]; c) laser techniques can be used at low temperatures of 41 to 45&#176;C [66, 74, 97] or at high temperatures >60&#176;C [3,5].<BR><BR>

There is poor clinical data on combined HT-ChT.  Lower temperatures may be needed for chemosensitization than for radiosensitization. Triple modality HT-RT-ChT would provide a concept, in which the higher temperatures achieved in the tumor core would be subjected to radiosensitization, while lower temperatures at the tumor margin would still satisfy the conditions of chemosensitization.  Continuous long-duration simultaneous HT-RT (41 to 43&#176;C over 72 to 96 hours) with concurrent RT could yield substantial radiosensitization, accumulate a large "thermal dose" and result  in 
uncomplicated brain tissue tolerance.  Armour et al. [1, 2] observed radio-sensitization in vitro to low-dose rate RT (0.5 Gy/h) by long-duration HT (41.5 C for 36 of 48 hours) and interstitial RT (15 Gy , 3 times during HT).  Long-term results have to be awaited.<BR><BR>

HT has additive and synergistic effects in combination with RT and ChT when using drugs like cisplatin and nitrosoureas, but optimal sequencing of HT and RT or ChT, and the optimal thermal level are still unknown.  On the one hand the tolerance of normal brain tissue to heat is limited [36] and clinical data indicate that the threshold for brain necrosis is at 44&#176;C for 30 min or 43&#176;C for 60 min.  On the other hand, it is also obvious that the "target volume" is still unprecisely defined as malignant glioma cells may be also present beyond the obvious contrast enhancing CT or MR volume [10 to 12]. Thus, the major task of brain HT is to define, induce and control the optimal "thermal window" to the appropriate "target volume".<BR><BR>

<B>Conclusions</B><BR><BR>

The correlation between tumor response and thermal performance is an important finding which is consistently supported by experimental and clinical data.  This suggests a potential benefit in improving local control in brain tumors by means of hyperthermia.  The question, if this complex

<h2>Exciting News in the 1996 Beauty World</h2><br>
Pfeilring presents an exclusive collection of manicure cases made of Yak leather. The look is exotic, with Himalayan Flair. This material from Tibet pulls tightly and is completely durable.
<a href="gifs/4-1-1.gif"><img align=right src="gifs/4-1-1s.gif"></a><br><br>
Solingen. The market-leader in manicure articles, Pfeilringwerk of Solingen, Germany, is introducing this Spring an exclusive series of manicure cases. The sets, which are available in six different sizes and models, are especially eye catching thanks to their very special design: Black leather and a brown 'Yak' emblem beneath it, revealing the origin of the raw material of the soft and supple outer skin. This skin is, of course, the Yak leather, which is found in the 4000-meter Tibetan highlands.<br><br>
Yak is a subspecies of the cow and is used in Tibet as the universal work animal. It replaces motor power in the fields, is a supply of food and even serves as a source of heating fuel. The most special feature is the animal's skin, which when tanned and specially treated, shows a fine scaring, is very soft to the touch, and is nevertheless very strong and durable. This attribute of exceptional durability makes Yak leather an ideal material for the Pfeilring collection. This company, which now celebrates ist 100-year anniversary, is known for its top-notch, first qualitiy products.<br><br>
To bring this product to market, Pfeilring worked with the Lhasa Leather Factory in Tibet through a German development-aid project. The tannery, which for decades produced Yak leather for the shoe industry, was modernized and made internationally competitive with the help of German industry experts. Two goals were accomplished: 'help' evolved into 'self-help', and environmental concerns were addressed. The result is that in Tibet, there is today an efficient firm capable of turning out exclusive products for export.
<br><br>
Joachim Wendel, great-grandson of Pfeilring founder Carl Mueller and director of the company since 1996, sees in the Yak-leather collection new, high-profile possibilities for a traditional product. 'The gift with international appeal and exotic flair that has its own history of origin.' Thanks to this, Wendel sees added value for the customer, and more convincing arguments for retailers and middle-men in the specialized field.

<p><img align="absmiddle" src="jpg/1_8_1log.jpg"> <font size="+3">Inox Collection from Pfeilring</font>

<p>Just launched at the Frankfurt Autumn fair Tendence is the Inox Collection - the new stainless steel manicure series from Pfeilring. The implements have a satin finish and the stainless material is hypo allergenic meaning the range is also suitable for people allergic to nickel-plated material.

<p><a href="jpg/1_8_1.jpg"><img align="right" border="0" src="jpg/1_8_1s.jpg"></a> The line includes the most important items in a manicure collection: nail nippers, cuticle nippers, tweezers, nail cleaner and cuticle pusher. These items are available as single implements or in an elegant and specially designed leather manicure set.

<p>This Inox collection will enlarge the current program of high quality manicure articles offered by Pfeilring, who in 1996 are celebrating their 100th. It will soon be extended to become a complete range which will also satisfy the demands of professional manicure and pedicure salons.

Brush-Know-how is an exciting technical information pamphlet available to dealers and their customers from Lessmann, the wire brush manufacturer from Oettingen, Germany. The folded, standard business-size sheet provides clear information using photos, graphics and text on which brush is right for which job. Instructions as to the recommended speed ranges as well as other useful tips on working with wire brushes are included in the pamphlet.<br><br>

For company president Dieter Lessmann, precise and well prepared information for dealers and their customers is an important service offer. The needs of this target group stand always at the forefront. An inquiry such as What information are you seeking when you purchase wire brushes was therefore an important basis for Brush-Know-how. Dealers  can obtain the new Lessmann pamphlet in packs of 50 pieces, now available with brush delivery.<br><br><br>

<B><BLINK>The New</BLINK> Bosch-Millingsystem KN 94</B><br>
<I>One MIlling-Sustem (Universal) - uncountable applicaitons</I><br>
Due to the diversity and the straightforward operating procedures one can reduce the preparation time and also save due to the general non requirement for special expensive formed tooling.<br>
The most essential characteristic of the KN 94 is the capability to turn the tool arbor through an angle from - 45 to + 45&#176; on both sides, therefore providing a multitude of application possibilities, eg. keyway, bar folding, to groove, to bevel etc, at every angle and with the same standard miller.<br>
The extraordinary stability and the precision built construction (Made in Switzerland), which is mainly out of high quality  aluminium parts, the "1 phase" motor which produces a high torque at low constant r.p.m, leaves very little to be desired in relation to milling performance and low vibration.<br>
The depth of cut is attained by rotating of the motor body. The rotation is controlled by  means of a threaded bushing thus providing a fine adjustment which allows for an optimal clean cut.  The 3 axis-limit stop-system differentiates itself from other already known systems through it's extraordinary construction and stability characteristics.<br>
The limit stops can be placed in four different positions and by means of a central adjusting screw it can be positioned in any direction and firmly clamped. In addition the fine adjustments are also possible in all directions.<br>
Tje individually set "limit stop rods" are clamped to a height gauge, thereby allowing for vertical adjustment in order to reference in a keyway or to bypass / omit a section.<br>

<p>Pfeilring manicure instruments have clear, classic lines and are made from quality materials to the highest standards. The sapphire nail file shown here has one side coarse for filing, the other side is smooth. The use of real sapphire grains mean they do not get round and less effective with age as cheaper materials do. A thick layer of nickel around the grains holds them tightly for life-long usage. The file is finely ground around the edges to achieve smooth filing under the nails and chromium plating gives additional protection against corrosion.

<p>Tweezers come in different designs for a variety of uses: straight, slanted, splinter removal, eyebrow tweezers and automatic professional tweezers. Pfeilring tweezers are produced from steel which gets hardened on the surface through pressing it into its designated form. The tweezers are then ground and polished on all sides and covered with a special nickel or gold plating for superior appearance. When assembled all tweezers are sharpened and individually inspected to ensure that they close at once on the whole length of the mouth - the sign of a quality instrument.

<p>Pfeilring produce a complete line of manicure instruments including sapphire nail files, tweezers, nail and cuticle nippers and scissors as well as a superb selection of manicure sets.

Two of the world's most popular wines, these come from the Friuli region, where there is an ample supply of just the right grapes. Merlot is a brilliant ruby red, with a fool bouquet; a wine whose traditions are very old. Its fragrance is a reminiscent of aromatic woods and brushwoods, its flavor dry, fullbodied and warm. To accompany all meats and well ripened cheese. Cabernet is an internationally known wine made of black grapes which have found a good home in Friuli. A lively, intense warm and harmonious. Goes very well with poultry and red meats, as well as hard, well-aged cheese.<br><br>

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="pict_s.gif">
	Building on the success of the BG-100 for fully automated Blood 
Grouping and 10 years experience of liquid handling automation, Quatro 
have developed the <B>QASAR</B> range of Blood Grouping Systems.
<BR><BR>
	<B>QASAR</B> combines robotic sample processing with unique image analysis based agglutination reading to perform ABO/Rhesus grouping, rhesus and other red cell phenotyping, antibody screening and cross-matching; as well 
as other agglutination assays, such as TPHA. User-friendly software is 
available for all these applications which can easily be customised for 
specialist work.
<BR><BR>
	Three <B>QASAR</B> systems are available and come with a choice of options. 
Modular design enables each system to be tailored to suit individual 
laboratorys workload/budget and can be upgraded to meet future 
requirements.
<BR><BR>

	Each <B>QASAR</B> systems can automate microplate based blood grouping 
assays as well as the four card technologies currently on the market from 
DiaMed, Ortho, Gamma and Diagast. <B>QASAR</B> systems offer the customer the 
freedom to choose both assaytechnology and reagent supplier, allowing the 
flexibility to "mix and match" to suit individual needs.<BR><BR>

	<B>QASAR III</B> is designed to offer maximum automation and data security.<BR><BR>

	Modules include:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>AR-96 Image Analysis Reader
<LI>SP-400 Sample Processor
	  <li>Sample Transport Unit
	 <li>Security Modules for samples, microplates and cards
</UL>
<BR>
	For blood banks needing sample handling automation without the high 
capacity of the SP-400, <B>QASAR II</B> is available with the smaller Quatro
SP-240 Sample Processor.<BR><BR>

	Central to all <B>QASAR</B> systems is the Quatro AR-96. This instrument is 
also available as a stand alone unit for laboratories or specialist units 
requiring a reader specifically designed for blood banking applications.
<BR><BR>
	<UL TYPE=  ><EM><BODY TEXT="#0000FF">QUATRO AR-96:
	Nerve Centre of all QASAR Systems</BODY></EM></UL>
<BR>
	With this integral 486DX66MHz processor and Medusa 2000 software, 
the AR-96 not only reads and interprets agglutination reactions but also 
controls the sample processor and security modules and links directly to 
the central laboratory computer. Additionally, it offers storage and 
retrieval of the actual image for subsequent investigation.<BR><BR>

<HR><BR>

  Latexes are aqueous suspensions of polymer particles prepared by emulsion polymerization. They are well known in industrial applications as thermoplastic binders in paint, adhesives, and paper coatings...<BR><BR>

The dustribution of the Estapor microspheres is controlled exclusively by PROLABO, the french Market leader for the distribution of laboratory chemicals and instrumentation.<BR><BR>  

RH&Ocirc;NE-POULENC, a producer of latex since the 1950`s,has acquired wide experience in emulsion polimerization and enjoys an international reputation in this sector.<BR><BR>

In manufacturing a plastic coating with a conventional latex, the practicles merge into a film and lose their identity. The properties of this film are determined rather by the nature of the polymer then by the size and surface properties of the particles. If, however, the properties of each individual particles are to be exploited, care must be taken to control their size, form and surface characteristics. RH&Ocirc;NE-POULENC has used its expertise to produce its Estapor microspheres since the early 1970`s.<BR><BR>

Estapor microspheres are spherical polymer particles of uniform size. The extraordinary uniformity of these beads <A HREF=detail_a.html>(see fig.1)</A>is often described  by the terms "monodisperse particle" or "calibrated particles". The idea of extreme uniformity is quantified by the value of the standard deviation &sigma;n which characterizes the size range around a number average diameter Dn.  <BR><BR> 

  PROLABO offers grades in which Dn varies from 0.02-1.6 micrometer for the different K series up to 5 micrometers for the L series. The value of the &sigma;n is always lower than 5%, usually around 3%.

  Generally, the polymer used is polystyrene (K and L series), but it may also be styrene-butadiene copolymer (B series), acrylic copolymers (A series), or styrenedivinylbenzen copolymers for crosslinked particles.<BR><BR>

  Magnethic microspheres referenced Estapor M, are composite particles made of polystyrene and finely divided magnetic iron oxide.

  As illustrated in <A HREF=detail_b.html>figure 2</A>, these particles are not calibrated; the magnetic pigment is evenly distributed throughout each particle as fine crystals of 10-200 Angstroms.
The surface of these particles can be modified with various chemical groups. Among the most common are : COOH, ArNH<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>, COOCH<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>, SO<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>-, CH<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>CL, SO<FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT>-, and +N(CH<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>)<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>.<BR><BR>
The nomenclature specifies the nature of the polymer, the surface group, and the nominal diameter. The reference system, along with a list of available product, is given separately.<BR><BR><HR>

4. Robot integration with vacuum forming machine (will be introduced in K'95
show)..
<BR><BR>
5. Robot integration for automatic Fiberglas reinforcement.
<BR><BR>
6. Automatic Plastic Welder that weld any thermoplastic in a matter on 1
minutes.
<BR><BR>
7. 4 station rotary vacuum forming machine.
<BR><BR>
8. Microprocessor controlled dryer for the Polycarbonate and in a matter of
fact for any plastic to enable perfect dry plastic for excellent vacuum forming
process.
<BR><BR>
In the K'95 show, we are going to introduce to the plastic world on the first
time in history of vacuum forming technology, our amazing AVFC (Automatic
Vacuum forming Center):
<BR><BR>
- We will provide the most advanced, 6 axes robot to make any vacuum forming
machine, a complete independent center, working without operator.
<BR><BR>
- The robot will have the capacity of load/unload, triming and stacking. The
basic concept is as follows: the robot, K30 or bigger (depends on machine size
and maximum load to carry) will be used to load filat sheet into ZMD machine,
unload the part holding fixture to stage the part for a robotic trim operation.
In this stage the robot will pick up an air spindle for trimming the formed
part. After trimming the part, the robot will drop off the air spindle and pick
up the vacuum part gripper, pick up the trimmed part, move it to a finished
part stack or to a conveyor.Then return to the ZMD machine and repeat the
process.
<BR><BR>
- The robot is equipped with easy operation system. All teaching, editing can
be reformed on a sophisticated programming pendant to make the robot teaching,
as simple as video game. No programming skills are required.
<BR><BR>
This amazing new development will solve three of the most difficult problems in
operation to thermoforming machines:
<BR><BR>
1. Loading and unloading, in particular big and heavy parts.
<BR><BR>
2. Trimmeng of 3 dimenson complicated parts. The robot will provide minimum of
6 axis and up 32 axis.
<BR><BR>
3. Accuracy at perfect performance. No more human being mistakes caused mainly
by fatigue. Now the process will be repeated again and again without any
failures.
<BR><BR>
The second machine we are going to introduce in the show is a powerful Pressure
Forming machine that capable to maiontain 100 Ton between the platens.
<BR><BR>
During the show we will demonstrate production of Shower Base, including
trimming and stacking by robot. See us at K'95, Hall 9, stand 9B12.

<H1>Tius Elcon Ltd.</H1><BR><H2>Company Profile + Introduction</H2>
<HR><BR><BR>
As the global health care market evolves rapidly, the practice and delivery of
medicine is witnessing a revolution. Home management care is a major factor in
this revolution, as doctors rely more and more on home medical and paramedical
devices to follow up on their patients' conditions.
<BR><BR>
Tius Elcon is the leading Israeli company developing and marketing innovative
over-the-counter medical and paramedical products for the consumer home care
market.
<BR><BR>
The company combines its strong marketing orientation together with world-class
scientific research and development expertise to produce unique, patented
products that enable patients to closely monitor their physical and medical
conditions conveniently at home.
<BR><BR>
All of the company's products are submitted for FDA approval and comply with
applicable European standards. In order to satisfy FDA requirements,
manufacturing is done in compliance to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
regulations. On-site quality control procedures are strictly applied.
<BR><BR>
The company sells its products in the U.S. through its wholly owned subsidiary
Elcon America and around the world through a network of distributors. In
addition, Elcon's products are sold to leading international companies who
market the products under their own tradename.

Tius Elcon Introduces SPIRO
<BR><BR>
PERSONAL ELECTRONIC PEAKFLOW METER
<BR><BR>
Elcon presents during Medica '95 the Spiro Peakflow Meter, a unique device
which will revolutionize the management of asthma.
<BR><BR>
Spiro is a computerized, cost effective device that measures the expiratory
level of the patient and compares it against the personal best value recorded
previously. Spiro's traffic light system informs the patient whether asthma
symptoms are present and in what degree, so medication can be taken, if
necessary.
<BR><BR>
Spiro replaces old user unfriendly mechanical peakflow meters that require from
the patient to meticulously keep a written record of the measurements in order
to calculate the variability from the normal expiratory level. Newer,
electronic models are very expensive and fail to provide the simple, user
friendly features for home management of asthma.
<BR><BR>
Spiro is the only device that provides all the features required by the Asthma
'95 congress for the ideal peakflow meter:
<BR><BR>
1. Retail price competitive with mechanical peak flow meters.
<BR><BR>
2. Measurement of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) in liters.
<BR><BR>
3. Measurement of Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) in liters per second.
<BR><BR>
4. Optimal measurement for morning and night.
<BR><BR>
5. Determination of variability between morning and night.
<BR><BR>
6. Storage of measured data for 30 days, including morning and night
   measurements.
<BR><BR>
7. Automatic display of results by means of a 4 colored traffic light system.
<BR><BR>
8. Option to connect to PC for analysis of results by physician.
<BR><BR>
Because of its comprehensive features, Spiro is expected to become a leader in
the home monitoring of asthma.

Tius Elcon Introduces TEMP-A-SURE - BABY THERMOMETER
<BR><BR>
First Introduction - Medica 95, Dusseldorf, Germany
<BR><BR>
During Medica '95, Elcon introduces a newly redesigned Temp-A-Sure, the unique
pediatric thermometer. Building on its predecessor's unique features of
non-intrusiveness and continuous temperature monitoring with alarm, the
Temp-A-Sure provides a much faster temperature readout and automatic updating
of temperature, with storage capability of 16 readouts over an 8 hours period.
The Temp-A-Sure provides fast, accurate temperature measurement and monitoring
by simply clipping it to the child's diaper or pajama, eliminating the risk of
measurement by intrusive devices.
<BR><BR>
The Temp-A-Sure is the only over-the-counter pediatric thermometer in the world
that provides automatic temperature monitoring and sounds an alarm in the event
that the child's temperature rises above 37.8C, providing peace of mind to
parents and their doctors.
<BR><BR>


Tius Elcon Introduces FERTIMETER - OVULATION PREDICTOR 
<BR><BR>
Elcon presents during Medica '95 the Fertimeter - Ovulation Predictor, that
uses state of the art technology to accurately predict the onset of ovulation.
<BR><BR>
The Fertimeter represents a unique product based on an innovative new concept,
bioclock, developed by Elcon.
<BR><BR>
Fertimeter is a state of the art, hi-tech device with absolutely no side
effects.
<BR><BR>
Fertimeter enables the modern woman to obtain a complete picture of her
menstrual cycle and its progress at any given time.
<BR><BR>
This unique product is the only one in the market that combines the measurement
of two physiological parameters: Cervical Mucus Polarization impedance and
Basal Body Temperature (BBT), to accurately record the characteristics of the
user's menstrual cycle.
<BR><BR>
After two months of daily measurements, the Fertimeter is programmed and ready
to go. No further measurements are required for the user to know the calendar
of her menstrual cycle including the day when ovulation occurs.
<BR><BR>
The Fertimeter substitutes current methods that require continued and messy
measurements and some other common methods that cannot reliably predict the
onset of ovulation.

<h1>Networks of Centres of Excellence</h1>

<h3>Innovative R&D that benefits Canadians</h3>

<p>The federal Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE) program is
an innovative approach to R&D designed to develop Canada's
economy and improve the quality of life of Canadians. Each
Network is a unique multidisciplinary collaboration of top
research teams from across the country. These teams are pursuing
leading-edge research in an area of strategic importance to
Canada, and working with industry to create commercial
opportunities out of the results.    

<p>Since the NCE program was launched in 1990, the Networks have
made scientific advances and built innovative research alliances
between Canadian universities and businesses. Results are
already being applied in the private sector. Phase II of the NCE
program builds upon the research progress and dynamic
partnerships achieved in the initial phase and the goal of the program
places greater emphasis on the benefits to the economy and the
quality of life of Canadians. The program is nearing the end of Phase II
funding by the federal government.  The program is striving to move
into a mode of longer-term planning to achieve its socio-economic goals
and to secure longer-term investments from partners outside the NCE
program. The Networks focus on four specific challenges: 

<ul>
<li>Stimulate leading-edge fundamental and applied research, based
on excellence as measured by international standards, in areas
critical to Canadian economic development;

<li>Develop and retain world-class scientists and engineers in
technologies that are essential to Canada's productivity and
economic growth;

<li>Manage multidisciplinary, multisectorial research programs of
nationwide scope and develop partnerships that integrate the
research and development priorities of all participants; and

<li>Accelerate the exchange of research results within the network
and facilitate the transfer of this knowledge to, and its
absorption by, organizations in Canada that can harness it to
advance Canadian economic and social development.
</ul>

<h3>Teams share knowledge and resources</h3>

<p>The Networks' winning strategy is to foster strength through
collaboration. Each Network is a national R&D team effort that
focuses on research programs targeted to contribute to Canada's
future prosperity. Multidisciplinary teams of research
specialists combine their complementary skills and talents to
work together on common goals. Research centres in universities,
industry and government laboratories across the country are
thereby linked together to forge a whole that is larger than the
sum of its parts. With the emphasis on networking and sharing
research knowledge and resources, the Networks aim to break down
barriers between disciplines and institutions, and maximize
Canada's R&D capability.

<h3>Industry is a dynamic partner</h3>

<p>An important NCE goal is to transform innovative ideas and
technology into commercial opportunities for Canada. To help
achieve this, the Networks are building dynamic partnerships
with industry. Businesses can be directly involved in research
projects and can help establish research priorities by
participating in NCE management and advisory boards. Industrial
participants in the Networks cover a wide spectrum of business
enterprises, from large research- and industry-based consortia
to small and medium-sized businesses as well as individual
consulting firms.  

<h3>Building Canadian expertise</h3>

<p>The future of Canada depends on our ability to stimulate
economic development through innovation. The Networks provide an
excellent training environment for young Canadian talent,
exposing researchers to leading-edge science and engineering and
the exploration of its potential benefits. Graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows work side by side with top investigators on
research projects of social, environmental and economic
significance to Canada. These young researchers are specially
trained in a team environment in which industry is a strong
participant.  

<p>

<p><b><i>Canada's three granting councils -- the <a href="http://www.nserc.ca">Natural Sciences and
Engineering Research Council (NSERC)</a>, the <a href="http://hpb1.hwc.ca:8100">Medical Research Council</a> (MRC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council (SSHRC) -- and the federal department <a href="http://info.ic.gc.ca/ic-data/index.html">Industry Canada</a>,
have linked efforts to support and oversee the NCE initiative.
The councils support research excellence and the training of
highly qualified personnel in Canadian universities: the NCE
mission is closely tied to their endeavours to promote
multidisciplinary research and fund partnerships among the
academic, industrial and government sectors.</i></b>

<title>Rseaux de centres d'excellence du Canada</title>
<img src="/images/g_abo_f.gif"><p>

<h1>Rseaux de centres d'excellence</h1>

<h3>De la R et D innovatrice qui rapporte aux Canadiens</h3>

<p>Le programme fdral de Rseaux de centres d'excellence (RCE)
est une approche novatrice  la R et D visant  contribuer 
l'essor du pays et  amliorer la qualit de vie des Canadiens. 
Chaque rseau runit les meilleures quipes de recherche
multidisciplinaire de partout au pays.  Ces quipes poursuivent
des travaux de recherche de pointe dans des domaines d'importance stratgique pour le
Canada et collaborent avec l'industrie  la mise au point
d'applications commerciales des rsultats.

<p>Depuis la cration du Programme en 1990, les Rseaux ont ralis
des perces scientifiques et ont tabli des alliances de
recherche novatrice entre les universits et les entreprises
canadiennes.  Les rsultats de leurs travaux sont dj mis en
application dans le secteur priv.  La phase II du Programme
mise sur les progrs en recherche et les partenariats
dynamiques crs au cours de la phase initiale, et le programme
met davantage l'accent sur les retombes conomiques et l'amlioration de la
qualit de vie des Canadiens.  Le financement du gouvernement fdral dans
le cadre de la Phase II tire  sa fin, et le programme tente de se tourner
maintenant vers un mode de planification  long terme afin d'atteindre
ses objectifs socio-conomiques et d'assurer des investissements  long terme
de la part des partenaires de l'extrieur du Programme de RCE. Les Rseaux
poursuivent les quatre objectifs suivants :

<ul>
<li>Stimuler la recherche de pointe, fondamentale et applique,
selon des critres d'excellence de calibre international, dans des domaines essentiels au dveloppement conomique du
Canada;

<li>Former des scientifiques et des ingnieurs de calibre
international, dans des domaines technologiques essentiels  la
productivit et  la croissance conomique du Canada, et les
inciter  demeurer au Canada;

<li>Grer des programmes de recherche multidisciplinaire et multisectorielle
de porte nationale, et crer des partenariats qui intgrent les priorits
de tous les participants en matire de recherche et de dveloppement;

<li>Acclrer la communication des rsultats de recherches au sein des rseaux et faciliter le transfert de connaissances et leur intgration par des organismes canadiens en mesure de les exploiter au profit du
dveloppement conomique et social du pays.
</ul>

<h3>Un partage de connaissances et de ressources</h3>

<p>Les Rseaux misent sur la collaboration pour russir.  Chaque
rseau est un effort national de R et D ax sur des programmes
de recherche visant  contribuer  la prosprit future du
Canada. Les quipes multidisciplinaires de chercheurs
spcialiss conjuguent leurs talents en vue d'atteindre des buts
communs.  Les centres de recherche universitaires, industriels
et gouvernementaux des quatre coins du pays sont relis pour
former un tout plus grand que la somme de ses parties.  Le
Programme, qui met l'accent sur le fonctionnement en rseau et
sur le partage de connaissances et de ressources, vise  abolir
les barrires entre les disciplines et les tablissements et 
augmenter la capacit de R et D du Canada.

<h3>L'industrie, un partenaire dynamique</h3>

<p>Un des objectifs importants des RCE est de transformer les ides
et les technologies novatrices en crneaux commerciaux pour le
Canada par l'tablissement de partenariats dynamiques avec
l'industrie. Les entreprises peuvent participer directement aux
projets de recherche et peuvent contribuer  tablir les
priorits en sigeant  un comit consultatif.  Les partenaires
des Rseaux couvrent toute la gamme des entreprises, depuis les
vastes consortiums industriels et de recherche jusqu'aux petites
et moyennes entreprises en passant par les firmes
d'experts-conseils.

<h3>Accrotre l'expertise canadienne</h3>

<p>L'avenir du Canada dpend de sa capacit de stimuler la
croissance conomique en favorisant l'innovation. Les Rseaux
offrent aux jeunes chercheurs canadiens un excellent milieu de
formation qui leur permet de prendre part  la recherche de
pointe en sciences et en gnie et d'explorer ses retombes
possibles. Les tudiants aux cycles suprieurs et les stagiaires
postdoctoraux travaillent conjointement avec des chercheurs de
haut calibre  des projets relis  des aspects conomiques,
environnementaux et sociaux importants pour le Canada.  Ces
jeunes chercheurs reoivent une formation privilgie au sein
d'quipes fortement appuyes par l'industrie.

<p><i><b>Les trois conseils subventionnaires fdraux -- <a href="http://www.nserc.ca">le Conseil de
recherches en sciences naturelles et en gnie (CRSNG)</a>, <a href="http://hpb1.hwc.ca:8100">le
Conseil de recherches mdicales (CRM)</a>, le Conseil de recherches
en sciences humaines (CRSH), ainsi que le <a href="http://info.ic.gc.ca/ic-data/index.html">ministre fdral de
l'Industrie</a>, unissent leurs efforts pour appuyer et administrer
le Programme.  Les conseils appuient l'excellence en recherche
et la formation de personnel hautement qualifi dans les
universits canadiennes.  Le mandat des Rseaux est troitement
li aux efforts des conseils en vue de favoriser la recherche
multidisciplinaire et l'tablissement de partenariats entre les
secteurs universitaire, industriel et gouvernemental.</b></i>

<h2>Canadian Genetic Diseases Network</h2>

<p>The Canadian Genetic Diseases Network is carrying out research on
devastating and common genetically transmitted diseases, as well as
training some of Canada's best young researchers and creating new and
beneficial health care partnerships with Canada's premier universities,
medical centres, companies and the Medical Research Council.

<p>Network projects involve the investigation of genetic predisposition
to diseases such as cancer and heart disease, and the identification of
specific genetic abnormalities that cause diseases. Network researchers
have made major contributions and breakthroughs in understanding devastating
diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, breast cancer, cystic fibrosis,
Huntington's, muscular and myotonic dystrophies, and infectious diseases
such as tuberculosis.

<p>
Network research will have a significant impact on the development of
diagnostics, therapies, and new technologies for the Canadian healthcare
industry. In addition, the Network will provide new receptors and partners
for the commercialization of Network research. "Apoptogen Inc.," a new
Network commercial venture and partnership based on the discovery of genes
implicated in apoptosis, may lead to proprietary treatments for several
diseases including cancer and HIV.

<h2>Canadian Institute for Telecommunications Research (CITR)</h2>

<p>Rapid developments in computer and telecommunications technologies are
creating the possibility of many new, innovative services involving
multimedia information. CITR is exploring advanced technologies that will
enhance Canada's competitiveness in this field and boost the country's
position as a major leader in telecommunications services and manufacturing.
The Network research is aimed at creating a "network of the future,"
providing users with instant and transparent access to any type of
telecommunications service - including voice, image, data and multimedia
services from any fixed or moving location.

<p>CITR brings together over 320 of Canada's leading researchers, research
associates and graduate students in 17 universities and three specialized
research centres. The Network's 20 industrial participants include most of
the country's leading telecommunications and information technology companies.

<H2>Intelligent Sensing for Innovative Structures (ISIS)</H2>

<P>ISIS Canada's principle mandate is to advance, in partnership with and
responding to the needs of the private sector, Canadian civil engineering and
construction capability to a world leadership position through the
development and application of Advanced Composite Material (ACMs) and
Integrated Intelligent Fibre Optic Sensing Technologies.

<p>These structures will be classified as "smart" by virtue of their
integrated fibre optic structural sensing systems, and "innovative"
through the use of advanced composite materials that make them light,
yet strong, and completely resistant to corrosion. Research includes
remote monitoring of structures using optoelectronic chip technology,
intelligent processing of the sensing data and transmission of the data via
telephone or satellite link to a central monitoring station where it is
interpreted to evaluate the status of the structure. The extensive use of
advanced composite materials, in conjunction with the sensing technology,
will extend structure lifetime and substantially reduce the long-term
maintenance costs that are a significant burden to federal, provincial and
municipal budgets. It will also help to establish Canadian competitiveness
to address a $900 billion worldwide demand to repair a deteriorating
international infrastructure.

<title>Mechanical Wood-Pulps Network

<h2>Mechanical Wood-Pulps Network
</h2>

<p>The Network's multidisciplinary teams from university, government and
industry are investigating improvements to mechanical pulping processes that
could give the Canadian pulp and paper industry a competitive edge. The goal
is to make mechanical pulps more suitable for an expanded range of
higher-value grades of paper that will not yellow, is stronger, more uniform
and uses less energy in its production. Broader use of mechanical pulp, which
is the basis of Canada's economically vital newsprint industry, also has an
environmental payoff. Unlike chemical pulping processes that require
chemicals to break wood down into its constituent fibres, mechanical pulping
is largely a matter of grinding up the wood into basic components. It is
cheaper and less polluting, but the problem of yellowing has limited the
paper's potential market. Improved technology offers better effluent control
and more efficient recycling of used newsprint.


<p>With the industrial collaboration of the Pulp and Paper Research Institute
of Canada (Paprican), approximately 210 research supervisors, research
associates and graduate students at 15 universities and one government
laboratory across Canada are tackling scientific and engineering problems in
six major areas; bleaching, chromophores, mechanical pulping, process
control, pulp processing and recycling.

<H2>Sustainable Forest Management Network of Centres of Excellence (SFM)</H2>

<P>SFM will focus on preserving the ecological variability and biodiversity
of Canada's forests while maintaining the nation's forest-based economy. The
network strategy is to bring together the sectors needed to evaluate new
approaches to land and forest management while taking into consideration the
context of the full life cycle of the managed forest, from the land to the
product. This will be accomplished by developing new technologies, knowledge
and strategies for the management and conservation of a valuable renewable
resource. This network will confirm Canada as a leader in environmentally
responsible policies - a leadership that is critical in view of both the
global concern for sustainable forest management and Canada's role as the
world's leading exporter of wood pulp, newsprint and softwood lumber.

<H2>TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence (TeleLearning.NCE)</H2>

<p>TeleLearning.NCE will help address some of the major challenges
that Canada faces in becoming a learning society with a knowledge-based
economy. It is a multimedia approach to learning based on powerful desktop
computers, artificial intelligence, and high-performance networks linked by
the information highway. TeleLearning.NCE is a technological and social
innovation of fundamental importance for education and training in Canada.
The network will take into account the most up-to-date technological
environments and link them to emerging and novel pedagogical concepts. 
It will provide increased access to quality education for all Canadians, 
regardless of their location, age or status.

<title>Networks of Centres of Excellence<br>
Annual Report 1994</title>

<h2>Networks of Centres of Excellence<br>
Annual Report 1994</h2>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>NCEs:</h3>

<p>Nationwide networks, organized around a common area of interest,
such as telecommunications or neuroscience, made up of the best
researchers and research managers in Canadas <a href="indeng.htm">industrial</a>,
<a href="goveng.htm">government</a> and <a href="univeng.htm>academic</a> sectors.
Participants pool resources,  expertise and equipment to work on both long- and short-term
goals that benefit not only the participants but, ultimately,
the nation.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Phase I proved the concept; Phase II pursues its promise</h3>

<p>Phase I of the NCE program proved that productive
university-industry collaborations no longer require contingents
of permanent research staff and expensive buildings rooted in
one geographic location.  The nation-wide NCE approach offers
greater efficiency and flexibility: collaborators in each
network organize research centres at 
existing facilities offering the best resources for each
project, for time periods corresponding to the life of a given
project.

<p>The dynamic partnerships established in Phase I created an
enthusiastic momentum which resulted in proposals for new or
expanded ventures for Phase II.  Building on their experience
and achievements in Phase I, ten NCEs embarked on Phase II in
1994 with a shared goal: to mobilize Canadas research talent in
the academic, private and public sectors, and apply that talent to developing
the nations economy and improving its citizens quality of life.

<p>The NCEs success to date makes the program an intriguing model
for government, business and university decision-makers. 
Recognizing that Canadas economy is expanding from a
resource-based economy to one whose wealth also comes from
knowledge creation, these decision-makers are now grappling with
how best to encourage this transition.  As they observe the
various models followed in Canada and abroad, consensus is
beginning to emerge about how best to accelerate S&Ts
contribution to the economic base.  Among the emerging
recommendations: 

<ul>
<li>Identify the key decision-makers in Canadas most dynamic
industries.

<li>Create a forum for industrial and scientific leaders to
explore areas of common interest and establish national priorities.

<li>Identify new scientific and engineering discoveries that could
contribute to Canadas economic well-being and enhance the quality of our
lives.

<li>Give Canadian industry earlier access to in-progress research.

<li>Provide opportunities for scientific collaboration at the
boundaries of scientific disciplines, where only the combined expertise of two or more
disciplines will produce the breakthroughs that could lead to new applications
with enormous potential for improved economic benefits and quality of life.

<li>Maximize research and development efficiency by collaborative
ventures that enable more efficient use of expensive equipment.

<li>Lever existing resources in innovative ways that will give
cash-strapped universities, businesses and governments alternative investment
approaches for 	supporting research and development.
</ul>

<p>The Networks of Centres of Excellence incorporate all these
principles.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<blockquote><b><i>The lessons learned, and the foundations established during
Phase I of the NCE program have positioned the networks well for
Phase II - just in time to help Canada make the crucial transition to
a knowledge-based economy.</i></b> </blockquote>

<p>Dr. Peter Morand, President, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>The NCE Concept</h3>

<h4>Nation-wide industry collaboration and sharing</h4>

<p>The NCE program is based on the premise that collaboration
between academic, private and public decision-makers to
establish common priorities and goals will accelerate both the
development of technology and its application.

<p>Participation in a network leverages the effectiveness of  all
members.  University participants can pool their expertise and
resources, such as specialized knowledge and facilities, for
major investigations on a scale that could not be attempted by
traditional approaches.  Business participants gain
up-to-the-minute awareness of discoveries and avenues of
exploration that could affect their operations in a future
global market.  

<p>Participants from all sectors gain access to a wealth of
specialized expertise and facilities that complement in-house
resources.

<h3>On to Phase II</h3>

<p>Phase I of the NCE program, administered by the Natural Sciences
and Engineering Research Council, the Medical Research Council
and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, in
partnership with Industry Canada, began in 1990 with the
launching of fifteen networks.  Phase II of the program was
announced in 1993 with a four-year budget of $197 million.

<p>In 1994, after an intensive, peer-reviewed competition, ten
networks were selected to continue into Phase II of the NCE
program.  Each network focusses on a different area of research
having economic and social benefits for Canada, and each has
already proven itself to be a promising source of new industrial
ventures.  Each network is comprised of research teams working in university,
government and industry labs across Canada, on joint projects
that private- and public-sector partners have identified as
priorities for development.

<p>The innovative models of multi-sector research partnerships
introduced in Phase I continue to evolve.  An important feature
of Phase II is increased emphasis on an interdisciplinary
approach involving public- and private-sector collaborations. 
To extend the scope of the NCE program, $48 million of the Phase
II budget has been allocated to develop new networks in five
areas of research selected for their potential economic, social and
environmental benefits to Canada.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Networks are run like businesses</h3>

<p>Together, Phase II networks include over 200 member companies
from different industrial sectors.  Although the degree of their
participation varies, the reasons for involvement are much the
same.  They join because:

<ul>
<li>They applaud the idea that economic benefit be a prime
consideration in prioritizing university-based research.

<li>They seek to influence the content of university-based
research in their areas of interest.

<li>They want access to state-of-the-art research and advice that
could give them a competitive edge in new business opportunities.

<li>They see the potential for strategic alliances with other
network members whose research and product development may
complement their own.

<li>They recognize that the networks are excellent sources of
future employees.

<li>They are reassured by the professional manner in which the
networks conduct business with companies and manage their internal affairs.
</ul>

<p>Because they have to interact with businesses, NCEs are run like
businesses.  The networks are managed by Boards of Directors
with senior executives of companies who hold strong interests in
the activities of the networks.  Other board members include
senior university officials, staff from business and technology
transfer offices, and representatives from the university-based research
community.  The public sector is represented by officials who
provide essential links to federal and provincial policy-makers.

<p>The networks use many standard business tools such as mission
statements, strategic plans, and the setting of short-, medium-
and long-term objectives.  Efficiency is a watchword. 
Administrative staffs are kept to a minimum: most network
administrations employ fewer than five people, some of whom work
part-time. University faculty and business participants do not
receive salaries from the NCE program and, whenever possible,
network activities such as meetings and workshops are combined
with professional events scheduled by member organizations. 

<p>As the networks meet with increasing interest from the business,
science and engineering sectors, a cultural change is taking
place in these communities.  Each community is buying in to
the concept that science, engineering and business, when
combined in carefully focussed collaborations, can result in benefits not
achievable separately.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<blockquote><b><i>The benefits derived by industry from the NCEs are directly
related to the effort that companies put into working with them: in management, 
in program definition and in research interaction.</i></b></blockquote>

<p>Dr. John Elliott, Fellow Emeritus, BNR;<br>
Chairman, the Canadian Institute of Telecommunications Research

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Networks communicate their business</h3>

<p><i>Like their counterparts in the private sector, network managers
(many of whom came from the business world) understand the
essential role that good communications programs play in
successful industrial liaison - the heart of the networks
technology transfer efforts.  The networks organize public
relations vehicles such as workshops, information sessions, and conferences,
and regularly produce corporate brochures and newsletters designed to keep their
members and potential clientele aware of the networks activities.</i>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>NCE Inc?</h3>

<p>Some networks have ventured even further into business culture.  
A number have incorporated, and many have spun off small
companies operated by some of their own participants.  Among the
spin-offs:
<ul>
<li>Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBDN)<br>
	- Micrologix Biotech Inc.<br>
	- SPI Diagnostics<br>
	- NoAb Immunoassay<br>
	- Synsorb Biotech Inc.<br>

<li>Micronet<br>
	- Cadabra Design Laboratories<br>

<li>Institute for Robotics and Intelligence Systems (IRIS)<br>
	- Wavemakers<br>
	- Innovmetric<br>
	- Hexavision<br>
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>NCEs bring world-class science to business ventures</h3>

<p>When asked what they like about the NCE concept, network
researchers give similar replies: 

<ul>
<li>The opportunity to collaborate with their peers in 
other university labs on projects that would be too 
large, or require too specialized an expertise otherwise.

<li>The stimulation of working on projects that call for 
research at the intersection of several disciplines, 
such as engineering and photochemistry, or 
biology and chemical physics.

<li>The communication that the networks promote 
between industries and researchers.  Network 
interactions increase their awareness of the 
research challenges that industry faces.

<li>The networks ability to enhance existing scientific 
infrastructure.  This kind of leverage can come from several
sources: network support for research equipment that builds on
equipment in their own labs; opportunities to share access to other
equipment and technical support (such as technologists and students)
with researchers in other network labs; and contributions of equipment
and research from private companies that are part of the network.

<li>The synergy that exists between their network 
projects and other research activities. 
</ul>

<p>NCE research projects are subjected to rigorous scientific
selection and evaluation.  The participation of Canadas leading
scientists and engineers ensures that each project will be
subjected to careful scrutiny within the network, as well as
external peer review and site visits from experts that include
not only their scientific peers, but also research and business
managers.  

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<blockquote><b><i>What the networks have done is enable some of the countrys
best researchers to work together on challenging problems that they would not
have been able to undertake separately. </i></b></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Michael Smith, Winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry,<br>
President, Protein Engineering Network, Director, Biotechnology Laboratory, U.B.C.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Unparalleled opportunities for S&T apprenticeship</h3>

<p>NCE participants are unanimous in their enthusiasm for the
networkss contribution to training Canadas next generation of
scientists and engineers.
<ul>
<li>Students see the networks as windows that allow them to learn
first-hand about the needs, challenges, and opportunities for industry-related
research.

<li>Universities view the networks as vehicles for providing
students with a 	well-rounded educational environment that exposes them to the
working culture of both the academic and industrial research communities.

<li>Companies value the networks as a source of potential 
employees who understand the industrial environment 
and who will be productive from the first day on the job.

<li>Students, universities and companies welcome 
network opportunities for ongoing professional 
interaction that enables all participants to keep in 
touch and aware of each others needs and advances.
</ul>

<p>Most students are introduced to the networks through
network-supported research that their university or company has
undertaken.  The networks fund post-doctoral fellowships, thesis-related
research for graduate students, and summer research positions.  They work in industry,
government or university labs, acquiring hands-on experience
using the latest equipment and contributing fully as members of
the labs research team.  Team leaders assign focussed projects
designed to help students consolidate the theory and skills
acquired during their formal studies with the business
perspective that comes from working on industry-related goals.

<p>Students seek out NCE experience for the opportunity to obtain
an industry perspective, and to work under the supervision of
top researchers from whom they can learn not only techniques,
but the overall approach to scientific research that these role
models provide.  Another frequently mentioned advantage of an NCE
apprenticeship is the opportunity to compare the academic
research environment with the environment that exists in
industrial labs.  This experience leads many NCE graduates to
pursue industrial, rather than academic employment.

<blockquote><b><i>The Micronet NCE supported my PhD research
at the University of Toronto, gave me exposure to leading-edge Canadian
companies in the microelectronics field, and influenced the direction of my work.
Thanks to this exposure, collaboration and support, Northern Telecom is now
my employer.</i></b></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Sorin Voinigescu, Scientific staff, Northern Telecom

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Outreach programs for students</h3>

<p>Networks take a proactive role in attracting students attention.
<ul>
<li>They invite students to their board meetings, where they often
set aside time for the students to give short presentations of their
network-supported work.  These invitations have several benefits:
business participants are introduced to the networks most promising new talent;
students observe the industrial decision-making process at a level to which they
would normally have no access; and both industry representatives and students have an
opportunity to meet each other.

<li>Many NCEs have developed programs to inform students about
network activities. Conferences, workshops, and on-site visits are common.  These
programs often 	include sessions at which students can present their
network-sponsored research.

<li>Some networks are beginning to extend their outreach even
farther by making presentations to student technologists and technicians in other
training centres, such as community colleges and high schools.

<title>Policies and Guidelines<br>
Networks of Centres of Excellence - Phase II</title>


<h2>Policies and Guidelines<br>
Networks of Centres of Excellence Phase II</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>Each network grant will be administered by the Networks of
Centres  of Excellence (NCE) Steering Committee through a
granting council.  In general, the rules and policies of the
granting council under  whose purview the main thrust of the
network's research falls will  apply to that network. Please
refer to the Awards Guide of the council  in question for
further details. Regulations and administrative policies 
specific to the NCE program are approved by the NCE Steering
Committee  made up of the presidents of the three granting
councils and the Deputy  Minister, Industry and Science Canada
(ISC).

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In 1988, the Government of Canada announced the NCE program as a
major  component of its strategy to link research and
development with wealth  creation.

<p>The Prime Minister announced on November 19, 1992 that the NCE
program,  which we began as a hopeful experiment four years
ago, has proved  a great success. We will make our support
permanent. In his December  2, 1992 Economic Statement, the
Minister of Finance announced that  the NCE program will be
extended... This will ensure that the  most successful of the
existing networks continue to contribute  to competitiveness.
It willalso provide support for new research  networks in
emerging areas of importance.

<p>In July 1993, the federal government approved the details of
Phase  II of the Networks of Centres of Excellence program. This
phase includes  a provision for a competition among existing
networks and a commitment  to hold a competition for new
networks at a later date, if funding  permits. Phase II of the
NCE program builds on the highly successful  initial four years
of operation and moves the program toward a stronger  focus on
multisectorial involvement in all aspects of the networks' 
activities, including strategic planning.

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>The goal of Phase II of the federal Networks of Centres of
Excellence  program is to mobilize Canada's research talent in
the academic, private  and public sectors and apply it to the
task of developing the economy  and improving the quality of
life of Canadians.

<p>This goal will be accomplished by investing in national research
networks  that meet the following objectives:
<ul>
<li>Stimulate leading-edge fundamental and applied
research,  based on excellence as measured by international
standards, in areas  critical to Canadian economic
development.

<li>Develop and retain world-class scientists and
engineers  in technologies that are essential to Canada's
productivity and economic  growth.

<li>Manage multidisciplinary, multisectorial research
programs  of nationwide scope and develop partnerships that
integrate the research  and development priorities of all
participants.

<li>Accelerate the exchange of research results within
the  network and facilitate the transfer of this knowledge to,
and its  absorption by, organizations in Canada that can harness
it to advance  Canadian economic and social development.
</ul>

<h3>Selection and Evaluation Criteria</h3>

<p>To ensure that the program objectives are met, network proposals
will  be assessed during the selection phase, and successful
networks will  be assessed on an ongoing basis during tenure of
the NCE grant against  the following five criteria, which are
weighted equally. To be successful,  a proposal will have to
exceed a threshold of excellence for each  criterion. These
threshold limits must continue to be met as a condition  for
holding the NCE grant.

technology  to lead to new products, processes or services for
commercial exploitation  that will strengthen the Canadian
industrial base, enhance productivity,  and/or contribute to
long-term economic growth.

<li>The extent to which a network creates an environment
that  encourages opportunities for collaboration with the
private sector  in the application of research to technology
and/or in market development.

<li>The potential for technology transfer and growth in
the  technology base of private and public sector partners.

<li>Appropriate mechanisms and plans to:<br>

<li>Evidence of an organizational structure suitable for
the  management of the research and business functions of a
complex multidisciplinary,  multi-institutional program
including:<br>

- presence of effective leadership and expertise in the
business  management function;<br>

- effective research planning and budgeting
mechanisms;  and<br>

- a management and board structure that will allow
significant  resource reallocation	 decisions to be made and
implemented.<br>
</ul>


<h3>Guiding Principles</h3>

<h4>Research Program</h4>

<p>Excellent research, as measured by international standards, is
essential  for funding under this program. The program unites
researchers distributed  over a wide geographic area into
teams having a shared vision of  common purpose and
collaborating on a focused research program, creating  the
critical mass necessary to achieve world-class research results.
The NCE program was established so that Canada's best
researchers  could achieve results that would not have been
possible on their own  or in smaller teams. A coordinated and
integrated research effort  is necessary to achieve the program
objectives. This program not  only requires a collaborative
approach to research, but encourages  researchers to consider
the impacts as well as the economic and  social importance of
their work. The program seeks to change attitudes  and
approaches to research.   

<p>A critical component is the importance of the research to
Canada's  economic and social development. It is important for
the networks  to demonstrate how their activities contribute to
this goal. Significant  factors in determining the strategic
importance of the research pursued  are the impact, or potential
for impact, of this research on Canada's  industrial base, and
health or social systems.

<p>The research programs should anticipate and respond
to problems  and opportunities that relate to Canada's
economy, productivity and  well-being. Network research programs
must therefore be developed  in consultation with all relevant
stakeholders, taking into account  industry, university and
government priorities. 

<p>Network research programs should be anchored in the
pre-commercial  realm, as appropriate to an academic or
institutional setting where  training takes place. However, a
spectrum of research activities should  be maintained, spanning
basic and applied research through to development.  This will
result in:

<ul>
<li>a continuum of research in the network, ensuring that
basic  research feeds new ideas throughout the system;
<li>flexibility to allow users to tap into the network
where  their needs are most urgent and opportunities for
collaboration  are greatest.  
</ul>

<h4>Highly Qualified Personnel</h4>

<p>The training and retention of the next generation of Canadian
researchers  in the networks' non-traditional, problem-oriented,
interactive environments  is an important program objective.
Trainees will benefit from interaction  with network
participants, and will pave the way for increased collaboration 
among the academic, private and public sectors. Networks should
develop  and implement strategies, such as the dissemination of
student profiles,  to market trainees among potential
employers. 

<p>Networks should provide opportunities for new participants to
become  involved in Phase II of the program. Networks are
encouraged to improve  the participation rate of women and all
designated groups for employment  equity; i.e. aboriginal
people, disabled persons and visible minorities.  Network
applications should indicate how many researchers and trainees 
are Canadian citizens or landed immigrants and how many are
foreign  nationals. 

<h4>Networking and Collaborations</h4>

<p>Networking is intended to integrate research teams and research
programs  and to promote effective interactions and partnerships
with the user  sector. Increased linkages and networking should
maximize research  resources through the sharing of equipment
and facilities as well  as through the reduction of redundancies
in our research efforts.  Effective linkages with the user
sector must be established to provide  direction for the
research program and to expedite the transfer of  knowledge and
technology. Linkages to the private sector may take  many forms,
including increased personnel exchanges between network 
researchers and industry, joint participation in projects within
the  network and representation on network boards and
committees. 

<h4>Leverage Funding</h4>

<p>It is important that the networks secure funding from
non-council  sources. The appropriate level of this funding will
vary depending  on the research thrust and the economic
environment in which the network  is functioning. Contributions
from foreign companies must not compromise  the principle that
results are to be commercialized in Canada, for  the benefit of
Canada.

<h4>Knowledge Exchange and Technology Exploitation</h4>

<p>The objectives of the program stress the importance of
developing  new technologies and opportunities that will benefit
the user sector,  including the transfer of knowledge and
technology resulting from  network research, and personnel
trained in the collaborative environment  of the networks.
Outputs resulting in savings in health care and other  social
costs, and in improved quality of life, are important
contributions  responding to the program's objectives. 

<p>To ensure that network research programs are relevant to
Canadian  needs and can contribute to long-term economic
growth, both the  public and private sectors should participate
as full partners in  the networks. This includes participating
in all aspects of the research  program as well as on network
boards and committees, in addition  to providing funding and
other support. 

<p>The program emphasizes benefits to Canada and the exploitation
of  the results of network research in Canada. Where the
receptor capacity  in Canadian industry is limited, it is
incumbent upon the network  to stimulate the development of that
capacity. This may mean adopting  a more targeted approach
toward industry and establishing strong ties  to those in
government responsible for industry development.

<h4>Business Management</h4>

<p>Achieving the business objectives of the network is of critical
importance.  The person responsible for the business management
functions must  have the expertise and experience necessary to
lead this aspect of  the network's operations. The business
manager/executive director  should be recognized in terms of
reporting stature within the network  as being on an equal
footing with the scientific leadership. In addition, 
specialists in marketing, technology management and
communications,  and others with relevant business skills,
should be included within  the network's structure where
feasible.

<h4>Network Management</h4>

<p>Each network is expected to develop a management structure that
will  permit the effective management of an integrated,
multidisciplinary,  multi-institutional program. The network
management structure must  ensure the achievement of the
program's and the network's objectives.  It must also ensure the
effective management of the network's project  portfolio,
including the reallocation of funds within the network  to
ensure the continuing relevance of the research undertaken. The 
management should also ensure that all network researchers
understand  and are working towards the network's research
objectives, and that  the procedures and regulations laid out in
the internal and funding  agreements are followed.

<h4>Communications</h4>

<p>The competent management of communications is critical to the
success  of individual networks and the program as a whole.
Effective internal  network communications are vital to the
network mode of conducting  research. Network activities,
results and accomplishments should also  be conveyed to external
audiences, including potential participants  from all
sectors, public policy makers, the media and the general 
public. Consistency in the message is essential, and therefore
one  individual in each network, with the appropriate expertise,
should  be responsible for coordinating all network
communications efforts.  The network's communications activities
and messages must be consistent  with and support the overall
NCE Program Communications Plan.

<h3>Application and Review Procedures</h3>

<h4>Application</h4>

<p>Network applications will be in the form of strategic plans
detailing  the research and business objectives of the network
over the proposed  funding period. The strategic plans should
address the overall benefits  of, and the value added by, a
network approach to research and research  management.The
strategic plans should show evidence that the priorities  of all
participants have been addressed. The long-term needs of the 
private sector should be central to the planning activities
of  each network. 

<p>The goals and objectives of the network's research plan must be
specified,  and must demonstrate that the research is
focused, innovative and  highly integrated. The research plan
should include project milestones  that are well-defined,
feasible and measurable. The strategic importance  of the
research to Canada and the potential economic benefits must  be
defined.

<p>Like the research objectives, the business objectives of the
network,  including the milestones and targets, must be
well-defined and feasible.  Provisions for establishing links
with public and private sector users  and mechanisms for the
exchange of knowledge and technology must be  articulated.
Private sector participation should be evident in all  functions
of the networks: in the management structure and in research 
projects. The involvement of the private sector should
provide,  where possible, on-site training opportunities
for highly qualified  network personnel and
industry-university exchange programs for  network
researchers. 

<p>Further, each network must provide:

<ul>
<li>the extent of quantifiable support (i.e.
contributions  in cash and in kind) pledged by non-council
sources;
<li>a rationale for the level of support secured, taking
into  account the environment in which the network operates;
<li>an objective for securing additional contributions
from  non-council sources and a plan for achieving this
objective;
<li>budget estimates for planned business activities,
including  the anticipated contribution of industrial partners
to these activities  and details on how this budget is to be
spent;
<li>a description of the network management structure,
defining  the roles, responsibilities and expertise of key
personnel;
<li>strategies for transferring the results of network
research  to the user community, including provisions to manage
the network's  interactions with the corporate sector;
<li>a communications plan with activities designed to
reach  potential participants in all sectors in the interest of
enhancing  their awareness of the benefits resulting from
network research;
<li>an Internal Agreement, with approval in principle by
all prospective  participating organizations. Official
signatures will be required  before Phase II funding
begins. 
</ul>  

<h4><i><b>Regulations Governing Certain Types of Research</b></i></h4>

<p>The network must comply with all applicable regulations
currently  in force with respect to the conduct of research,
including research  involving the use of animals or humans,
biohazards, radioactive  materials, hazardous compounds,
environmental impact and research  in the Yukon and the
Northwest Territories. The appropriate certificates  and
documentation must be provided to the responsible granting
council(s)  and this information must be updated throughout the
grant period if  the research projects change or new projects
are added to the network. 

<h4>Review Procedures</h4>

<p>Each network application will be evaluated by the Selection
Committee  based on the following four primary sources of input:

<ul>
<li>The <b>strategic plans</b> will be assessed against
the  objectives and criteria of Phase II of the NCE program.
<li>The <b>peer review</b> results will be vital in
judging  the past record of the network (where appropriate) and
the potential  for success of the proposed strategic plan.
<li>The <b>external review</b> reports.
<li>The<b> presentation to the Selection Committee</b> by
one  or two network representative(s).
</ul>

<p>Individual proposals will be evaluated relative to the others
and  ranked accordingly.

<h4><i>Network Peer Review</i></h4>

<p>The granting councils will determine the appropriate
membership  on peer review committees necessary to evaluate
network applications  in relation to the selection and
evaluation criteria. For existing  networks, the results from
the 33-month peer reviews will be important  input into the
selection process for Phase II funding. These peer  reviews
assess a network's progress and achievements in relation to  the
original objectives of the program and those of the network.


<h4><i>External Review</i></h4>

<p>Network applications will be distributed to individuals/ groups
with  expertise to position the proposals within the Canadian
economic  context, such as the federal science-based departments
and agencies  (SBDAs) and industry. Assessments received from
these sources will  furnish further background on the potential
economic impact of the  proposals for use by the Selection
Committee. 

<h4><i>The Selection Committee</i></h4>

<p>The membership of the Selection Committee will be determined
jointly  by the granting councils and ISC, and will provide for
the balance  of expertise needed to assess proposals against all
of the selection  criteria. It will consist of scientists,
engineers, industry representatives  and economists or other
social scientists with expertise in research  and research
management, in the Canadian economy and its productive  sectors,
and in economic, trade, industrial and technology policy.  The
granting councils will administer the selection process. ISC 
will observe.

<p>As part of the assessment process, network applicants will be
invited  to send one or two representative(s) on behalf of their
network to  make a brief presentation to the Selection Committee
and to answer  specific questions.

<p>The Selection Committee will submit the ranked proposals to the
Minister  for Science, who will present them to Cabinet for a
funding decision.  The report of the Selection Committee will be
made public. The amount  of funds available for new networks
will depend on the number of proposed  renewals approved by
Cabinet. 

<p>Networks whose proposals for renewal are unsuccessful will be
permitted  to negotiate a phase-down period with NCE management.

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>The organizations eligible to receive funds in Phase II are
universities,  affiliated hospitals and research institutes, and
post-secondary institutions  having a research mandate.

<p>Many other organizations are expected to be involved in the
multisectorial  NCE program. Since eligible costs include the
contracting of services,  such organizations may participate on
a contractual basis. Reimbursement  of travel costs approved by
the networks will be permitted. Further  guidelines are as
follows:

<ul>
<li><b>Industry</b> will continue to be eligible to
receive  network funds to administer networks. However, firms
and private  sector research organizations will not be
eligible to receive research  funds directly since they are
expected to derive competitive advantage  from participation,
and ultimately to capture markets. Such organizations  are
expected to make cash or in-kind contributions to network
research  programs.

<li>In line with the Financial Administration Act and
Treasury  Board guidelines, <b>government researchers</b> will
not be eligible  to receive network research funds directly.
However, increased participation  of researchers from government
labs in the NCE program is desirable.  Networks should ensure
that their research programs have the active  support of the
most senior officials of the relevant government departments 
and agencies, in order to align research priorities and to
strengthen  links to the public sector. Contracts with networks
may be used to  acquire access to specialized facilities and
services provided by  government laboratories. Memoranda of
Understanding (MOUs) that set  up the terms for Specified
Purpose Accounts may be used to support  joint projects
agreeable to the parties involved. Money deposited  into these
Specified Purpose Accounts by networks can come only  from
non-federal funds raised by the networks and not from the
federal  funds for the NCE program.

<li><b>Community college</b> participation should be
encouraged  where appropriate.
</ul>

<h3>Financial Administration and Use of Grant Funds</h3>

<h4>General Principles</h4>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the rules of the granting council
under  whose purview the main thrust of the research falls
will apply  with respect to the administration and use of funds.
Where the network  fails to meet the requirements of the
Guidelines, Terms and Conditions  attached to the network
Funding Agreement, it is no longer eligible  to receive payment
of the grant.

<p>Support is provided for all costs directly related to the
research  as normally allowed by the granting councils,
including the salaries  and benefits of full-time participants.
Costs related to networking  while participating in
network-related activities are also eligible,  including costs
associated with travel and accommodation for network 
personnel as well as members of network boards and committees.
Costs  related to the construction and maintenance of
buildings are not  eligible.

<p>Budgets for networks may include costs for: salaries
and benefits  of network staff, equipment, materials and
supplies, travel, networking,  communications activities,
liability insurance for Boards of Directors  and network
administrators, incorporation costs and up to 50% of the  total
cost of protection for network intellectual property such as 
patents, copyrights, and trademarks provided that the
beneficiaries  of such protection contribute at least the other
half of these costs.  Network budgets may also include
allocations for contracts to provide  necessary services and
expertise not available within the network. 

<p>Budgets may not include costs for existing support services
within  an organization such as administrative, personnel,
financial, library  and building services, space and buildings,
or insurance other than  liability insurance as previously
described.

<h4>Salaries and Stipends</h4>

<p>The regulations of the granting council under whose mandate
the  research falls apply to the payment of stipends for
students and  postdoctoral fellows. For programs that fall
under the mandate  of more than one council, flexibility to
adopt one stipend rate within  a network is permitted, provided
that the rate falls within the prescribed  rates.

<p>The salaries and benefits for participants employed full time on
network  research may be paid from NCE grant funds, however,
their total research  commitment must be dedicated to the work
of the network and funded  through its budget. Such researchers
may supervise graduate students  working on the network
research. Participants receiving salary support  from the NCE
program are not eligible to hold grants from the granting 
councils. Granting council practices would generally apply
concerning  salary levels and limitations on non-research
activities.  

<p>Part-time salary support for participants is not an eligible
expenditure  and may not be claimed as a cost of networking; it
can be supported  with funds contributed to the network from
other sources.

<h4>Payment of Grants</h4>

<p>Following the decisions of the awards, the NCE Steering
Committee  will sign Funding Agreements with the designated
representatives of  the networks. Payments of grants will be
authorized by the NCE Steering  Committee through a granting
council.

<p>For renewed networks, funds will be awarded for 4 years
commencing  April 1, 1994, and will be subject to annual review;
phase-down funding  for a non-performing network will be
negotiated with the network by  the NCE Steering Committee.

<h4>Amount Awarded</h4>

<p>The amount approved for the first instalment of Phase II is
shown  in the Funding Agreement. The amount of subsequent
instalments  will be subject to demonstration of satisfactory
progress as determined  by the annual review process. The sum
of scheduled instalments  shown in the Funding Agreement will be
the maximum amount awarded  to the network.

<h4>Instalments</h4>

<p>Instalments will be approved annually by the NCE Steering
Committee  through a granting council, with the first
instalment for the renewed  networks beginning April 1, 1994 and
contingent upon signature of  the Funding Agreement. Subject
to satisfactory progress, to the  availability of funds and to
the network's continuing compliance with  the program's
guidelines, terms and conditions, subsequent instalments  for
renewed networks will be approved on April 1, 1995, 1996, and 
1997. For networks administered through a university, funds will
be  released to the designated financial administrative unit of
the network,  following normal payment schedules for the
granting councils; in all  other cases, funds will be released
monthly. The financial administrative  unit of the network will
be responsible for the distribution of the  funds among the
participating institutions within the network.

<h4>Second-year Review</h4>

<p>For renewed networks, subsequent to the submission of the second
annual  report on January 1, 1996 and prior to the release of
the April 1,  1996 instalment, an in-depth evaluation of the
network's performance  will be conducted by a site visit peer
review committee. The committee  will make recommendations to
the NCE Steering Committee regarding  the provision of funds for
that network for the period beginning  April 1, 1996. If found
to be non-performing, the network will  be phased down and a
final instalment will be negotiated with the  network by the NCE
Steering Committee.

<h3>Reporting Requirements</h3>

<h4>Progress Report Schedule</h4>

<p>Annual reports for renewed networks will be due on January 1,
1995,  1996, 1997 and 1998. Annual reports must be approved by
the network's  Board of Directors prior to submission to the
granting council(s).

<h4>Contents of Reports</h4>

<p>In addition to NCE appendix tables, annual reports will include
but  will not necessarily be limited to:

<ul>
<li>a description of the research progress and results,
with  reference to specified milestones at the project level;

<li>an update on the network activities with respect to
the  training of highly qualified personnel and the achievement
of training  objectives;

<li>a description of the evolution and impact of
networking  on the network's research and business functions;

<li>a description of the business progress and results,
with  reference to specified milestones for cash and in-kind
contributions  from non-council sources and numbers of
industrial partners and affiliates,  changes in relationships
with industrial partners, technology and  knowledge transfer
and development, impact on the user sector,  and communications
activities, highlighting successes.

<li>an explanation of changes in direction, priorities
and  budget allocations for the research and business
functions since  the last annual report;

<li>an updated and detailed strategic plan for the next
and  subsequent years highlighting proposed modifications and
the rationale  for changes to the current plan, including
revised research and  business milestones.
</ul>     

<h4>Financial Report Schedule</h4>

<p>The network must submit annual balanced statements of
expenditures,  reflecting the use of  NCE funds for the network
as a whole as well  as detailed statements for each participant
at all participating institutions.  These reports will cover
the April 1 to March 31 period of each  year and must be
submitted to the NCE Steering <M%-1>Committee  through a
granting council no later than May 31<D%0> of each year. 
Contributions received by the network from other sources, either
cash  or in-kind, must be reported separately and accompanied by
a short  description of the use made by the network of these
contributions.

<h4>Major Changes</h4>

<p>Upon endorsement by the Board of Directors of the network,
any  major change that would affect the general mission,
research program,  approved budgets or other operations of the
network must be submitted  to the NCE Steering Committee for
approval prior to implementation.

<h3>Guidelines on Management</h3>

<h4>Management Structure</h4>

<p>Each network funded by the NCE Program must have an
administrative  structure capable of managing a complex
multidisciplinary, multi-institutional  program. The particular
structure will vary according to the needs  of the individual
network, but must be detailed by the proponents  in their
Internal Agreement and approved by the NCE Steering Committee.

<p>A Board of Directors must be appointed with a membership that
is capable  of providing advice and guidance to the network, and
that reflects  the interests and concerns of the industrial,
governmental and academic  sectors. The Board will have overall
responsibility for the policy  and finances of the network.

<p>To ensure objectivity, and the perception of objectivity, in
the management  of the network, the Chair of the Board must not
be from any of the  participating institutions that receive
network funds. Further, it  is advisable to have some members on
the Board of Directors who are  not directly affiliated with the
participating institutions where  the research is carried out.
In order to provide input into the direction  of the network
from the perspective of the private and public sector 
organizations that will be the recipients or beneficiaries of
the  network research, at least 50% of the membership of the
Board of Directors  should be from outside the university
community. The perspective of  network researchers who are not
directly involved in the management  of the research is
important. Therefore, the Board should consider  having as a
voting member one researcher from the network who is not  the
Program Leader or a member of any other network committee.

<p>The network must consult the NCE Steering Committee prior to
appointing  the membership slate of the Board of Directors and
in the event of  any changes proposed in that membership during
the course of the Phase  II funding. The NCE Steering Committee
retains the right to name one  member (not a staff member of a
granting council) to the Board of  Directors.

<p>The management of the network research program is a vital aspect
of  the network, requiring an ongoing critical review of the
progress  of all projects in order to provide recommendations to
the Board of  Directors regarding research priorities and
budget allocations.  This function should be carried out by a
Research Management Committee,  which is usually chaired by
the Program Leader and is made up of researchers  from the
network as well as the user sector industry or
government.  The membership of this Committee should reflect the
multisectorial,  multidisciplinary and project orientation of
the research program.

<p>In Phase II of the NCE program, each network must have a senior
manager  with the appropriate background and expertise to direct
the business  and administrative functions of the network. This
network manager/executive  director should provide the
leadership and direction for all of  the business activities
of the network, as well as ensure control  and accountability
on a day-to-day basis.

<h4>Incorporation</h4>

<p>Networks are encouraged to consider incorporation. Costs
associated  with incorporation are an eligible expenditure.
Whether or not the  network is incorporated, the research
agreement requires that networks  respond to the basic
management requirements specified for incorporation  as a
federal not-for-profit corporation. The decision regarding
incorporation  is the responsibility of the network, and
requires approval by the  Board of Directors.

<h4>Internal Agreement</h4>

<p>The organizations participating in the network must prepare
and  sign a separate agreement, the Internal
Agreement, covering  such matters as the responsibilities,
obligations, commitments and  privileges of each organization,
the arrangements and structures governing  the management of the
network, the distribution of funds, the internal  reporting
requirements, the interactions between the participants 
including corporate partners, the ownership and disposition of
intellectual  property, the publication of research results,
conflicts of interest,  title to equipment, insurance, etc. The
Internal Agreement must be  consistent with the NCE program
objectives. Its purpose is to ensure  smooth management of the
network and an understanding of expectations  among all
participating organizations. 

<p>The Internal Agreement must be submitted as an appendix to the
proposal  for Phase II funding. The NCE Steering Committee will
require the  signed Internal Agreement from networks that are
successful in Phase  II prior to the release of funds. The
Internal Agreement must be  updated prior to changes in the
network's operation. This includes  updating the Internal
Agreement with the signatures of new participating 
organizations as they become affilated with the network. No
changes  will be made to the body of the network's Internal
Agreement without  the prior approval of the network's Board
of Directors and the  written consent of the NCE Steering
Committee. 

<p>If the network is incorporated, the requirements of the
Internal Agreement  can be met through the relevant by-laws
of the corporation, through  a separate agreement or through a
combination of these.

<h3>Guidelines on Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>The ownership and disposition of intellectual property
arising  from the research performed under the network is
left to the discretion  of the network and must be governed by
the arrangements described  in the Internal Agreement. These
arrangements must conform to the  following guidelines to
ensure consistency with the NCE program  objectives.

<h4>Dissemination</h4>

<p>Normally, the results of research funded through public sources
must  be published or otherwise disseminated to the community in
a timely  manner. Since the NCE program encourages the transfer
of knowledge  and technology to the user sector, it may be
necessary to obtain protection  for network-generated
intellectual property prior to disclosure in  a public forum.
Provision for reasonable publication delays (usually  not
exceeding six months) or other arrangements may be made to
ensure  that the commercial potential of the intellectual
property developed  under the network's research program is not
jeopardized by premature  disclosure. By developing an internal
screening mechanism to review  network research prior to
publication, networks will reduce the risk  of premature
disclosure.   

<h4>Commercialization</h4>

<p>The contributions of industrial partners to the network must be
recognized  by allowing them preferential access to the
commercial exploitation  of the intellectual property under
terms commensurate with the extent  and level of their
contributions. The arrangements with corporate  partners must
be addressed in the business objectives section of  the
network's strategic plan as well as in the Internal Agreement.

<h4>Sharing of Benefits and Costs</h4>

<p>The arrangements made regarding the ownership and commercial
exploitation  of the intellectual property must take into
account the NCE objective  of creating partnerships. This
implies a sharing of eventual benefits  between the partners
commensurate with the respective contribution  of each, as well
as the sharing of costs to protect the intellectual  property.
NCE funds may be used toward the costs associated with the 
patent protection of intellectual property produced or generated
during  the performance of network research, provided the party
or parties  who will benefit from such protection contribute at
least half of  these costs. The decision to allocate NCE funds
to patent costs is  the responsibility of the network.<R>

<h4>Exploitation in Canada</h4>

<p>Consistent with the program criterion on knowledge exchange
and  technology exploitation, the intellectual property
arrangements of  the network must be such that the network shall
make every reasonable  effort to have the results of the network
research exploited in Canada,  for benefit to Canada.
Contributions to the network from foreign  firms must not
compromise this principle. The network shall take all 
reasonable precautions to preclude prior development and
exploitation  of the results outside Canada. Exceptions to these
requirements will  be very rare and will require approval from
the NCE Steering Committee;  the network is required to pursue
alternatives to offshore commercialization,  including the
possible development of new Canadian receptor companies.  The
network would be required to demonstrate that benefits would
accrue  to Canada from offshore commercialization. 

<h4>Management of Intellectual Property</h4>

<p>The network's Internal Agreement must be clear and
comprehensive  on intellectual property issues. It must be
acceptable to all parties  and contain mechanisms to avoid
and/or resolve potential intellectual  property disputes so as
to ensure that the issue will not endanger  the viability of the
network.

<h3>Role of the Granting Council</h3>

<h4>Participation on Network Board and Committees</h4>

<p>The NCE Steering Committee will, at its discretion, send a staff
member  of a granting council as an observer to meetings of the
Board of Directors  of the network and to meetings of the
network's committees. The NCE  Steering Committee also reserves
the right to name one member (not  a staff member of a granting
council) to the network's Board of Directors.

<h4>Monitoring and Guidance</h4>

<p>The network's activities will be subject to a general overview
and  monitoring by the NCE Steering Committee through a granting
council.  This involvement may include such activities as
participation in the  resolution of technical, financial or
administrative difficulties,  advice and guidance related to the
interpretation of the NCE program's  objectives, rules and
guidelines, assistance with the coordination  of the network's
activities with those of other networks or of other 
government-sponsored initiatives and diffusion of network
achievements.

<h4>Program Evaluation</h4>

<p>The NCE Steering Committee is responsible for evaluating the
effectiveness  of the NCE program and reporting on it to the
Minister for Science.  The program evaluation activities may
involve surveys and interviews  of network participants and
staff. The network and participating organizations  agree to
participate in the evaluation of the NCE program and to make 
information and records available to the program evaluation team
on  request. 

<h4>Peer Review of Networks</h4>

<p>The NCE Steering Committee through a granting council will be
responsible  for establishing a peer review committee to provide
ongoing annual  review of the progress of the network towards
its own stated goals,  as well as the objectives of Phase II of
the NCE program. Based on  the recommendations of this committee
as a part of the annual review  process, the NCE Steering
Committee reserves the right to terminate  support to a
non-performing network. This process would involve a  negotiated
phase-out of financial support for the network.

<p>Les membres du rseau Bton Canada sont  la fine pointe de la technologie
ncessaire  l'tude et  la conception de bton  haute performance (BHP).
Le rseau adapte les proprits du BHP  des utilisations spcialises. Les
retombes de ces recherches comprennent la mise au point de bton plus
rsistant et plus durable pour la construction d'autoroutes et de ponts,
de plates-formes de forage, de centrales hydrolectriques et d'entrepts
de dchets toxiques. Les progrs raliss jouent un rle essentiel dans
l'essor conomique du pays et favorisent les entreprises canadiennes
lorsqu'elles soumissionnent des projets internationaux de construction.

<p>Bton Canada est un effort de recherche multidisciplinaire regroupant
15 chercheurs principaux rputs  l'chelle internationale pour leur
expertise dans les domaines des matriaux, de la technique des structures,
et de la construction. Issus de dix grandes universits et deux firmes
d'ingnierie, ces chercheurs sont seconds par plus de 20 associs de
recherche et plus de 200 ingnieurs, scientifiques, stagiaires postdoctoraux,
et tudiants aux cycles suprieurs. Leur but : dvelopper une nouvelle
gnration de matriaux de construction; concevoir des structures de
bton ultrarsistantes; mettre au point de nouveaux produits et de nouvelles
techniques; et assister  l'laboration de codes de construction, de
conceptions et de mthodes de mise  l'essai,  l'chelle nationale.
Les partenaires industriels de Bton Canada contribuent  dfinir
l'orientation scientifique du programme de recherche et  l'valuation
pratique des rsultats.

<H2>Innovations en structures avec systmes de dtection intgrs</H2>

<p>En partenariat avec le secteur priv et en rponse aux besoins de ce
dernier, ISIS Canada s'est donn pour mandat de hisser les secteurs
canadiens du gnie civil et de la construction parmi les chefs de file
mondiaux, grce  la mise au point et  l'application de matriaux
composites avancs et de capteurs  fibre optique intelligents et intgrs.

<p>Ces structures seront qualifies d'  intelligentes , en raison des
systmes de capteurs de construction  fibre optique qu'elles intgreront,
et  novatrices , grce aux matriaux composs avancs qui les rendront
lgres, solides et compltement rsistantes  la corrosion. Le rseau
concentre ses efforts de recherche sur l'application de la technologie des
puces optolectroniques pour la surveillance  distance des structures, et
sur le traitement intelligent des donnes et leur transmission par tlphone
ou satellite  un poste de contrle central o elles sont interprtes en
vue d'valuer l'tat de la structure. L'utilisation intensive de matriaux
composites avancs, conjugue  la technologie des capteurs, augmentera la
dure des structures et rduira considrablement les cots d'entretien 
long terme, qui grvent les budgets fdral, provinciaux et municipaux. Ces
systmes pourraient galement permettre d'assurer la comptitivit du Canada
en vue de combler la demande mondiale de 900 milliards de dollars engendre
par la dtrioration de l'infrastructure internationale.

<p>Le rseau met  profit son expertise en gnie protique afin d'amliorer
la comprhension des protines et de leurs interactions. En collaboration
avec des entreprises canadiennes nouvelles et tablies, le rseau explore et
dveloppe toute une gamme de produits et d'avenues de recherche dans les
domaines suivants : produits thrapeutiques, vaccins passifs et actifs,
systmes diagnostiques, enzymes industrielles et outils de recherche,
identification de cibles associes aux maladies, laboration de biodosages et
de sites d'expression, peptidothques et systmes d'administration des
mdicaments, structure des complexes inhibant les protines.

 
<p>Plus de 200 chercheurs issus des universits, des instituts de recherche
et des laboratoires gouvernementaux et industriels crent une synergie et des
dbouchs commerciaux, et forment du personnel en vue de dcouvrir et de
mettre au point : des thrapies visant  combattre des maladies chroniques
telles que l'asthme, l'ostoporose et certaines formes de cancer, et des
maladies infectieuses telles que le SIDA et la coqueluche; des enzymes
industrielles destines aux industries des ptes et papier et des produits
de chimie fine; et des technologies protiques pour l'industrie des
biotechnologies.

<H2>Rseau des ptes de bois mcaniques</H2>

<p>Les quipes multidisciplinaires de chercheurs universitaires, industriels
et gouvernementaux du rseau poursuivent des travaux afin d'amliorer la
fabrication de la pte mcanique et la comptitivit de l'industrie
canadienne des ptes et papiers. L'objectif est la production de ptes
mcaniques qui conviennent mieux  une vaste gamme de papiers de qualit
suprieure qui ne jaunissent pas, qui sont plus rsistants et dont la 
fabrication exige moins d'nergie. L'utilisation plus intensive des ptes
mcaniques, actuellement  la base de l'industrie canadienne du papier
journal, est galement bnfique pour l'environnement. Contrairement  la
fabrication de la pte chimique, qui fait appel  des produits chimiques
pour dcomposer le bois en fibres, la fabrication de la pte mcanique
consiste en grande partie  broyer le bois pour en obtenir les composantes
de base. Ce procd est moins coteux et moins polluant que la pte
chimique, mais le problme du jaunissement en a jusqu' prsent limit le
march potentiel. Une technologie amliore permettrait de mieux contrler
les effluents et de recycler plus efficacement le papier journal.


<p>En collaboration avec l'Institut canadien de recherches sur les ptes et
papiers (PAPRICAN), quelque 210 directeurs scientifiques, attachs de
recherche et tudiants aux cycles suprieurs de 15 universits et un
laboratoire du gouvernement, de partout au Canada, se penchent sur des
questions dans six principaux domaines : le blanchiment, les chromophores,
la pte mcanique, le contrle du procd, et le traitement et le recyclage
de la pte.

<title>Rapport annuel 1994</title>

<h2>Rseaux de centres dexcellence<br>
Rapport annuel 1994</h2>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>RCE :</h3>

<p>Ces rseaux nationaux rassemblent autour d'un domaine de
recherche prcis, telles les tlcommunications ou les neurosciences,
d'minents chercheurs et gestionnaires en recherche des secteurs <a href="indfre.htm>industriel</a>,
<a href="govfre.htm">gouvernemental</a> et <a href="univfre.htm">universitaire</a> canadiens.  Les participants mettent en commun
ressources, expertise et appareillage en vue de poursuivre des travaux  court
et  long termes qui engendreront des retombes non seulement pour eux-mmes,
mais aussi pour l'ensemble du pays.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Phase I, validation du modle; Phase II, consolidation
prometteuse</h3>

<p>La Phase I du Programme de RCE a permis de dmontrer quil est
possible dtablir des partenariats universits-industrie
efficaces qui ne dpendent plus dun bastion permanent de
personnel de recherche travaillant dans des installations
coteuses quelque part au pays.  De loin plus efficace et plus 
souple que les approches traditionnelles, le modle national des
RCE permet aux participants de chaque rseau de mettre sur pied
des " centres de recherche " dans les meilleures installations
existantes pour des priodes correspondant  la dure des
projets. 

<p>Le succs remport par les partenariats dynamiques 
tablis au cours de la Phase I a suscit beaucoup denthousiasme
et a jet les bases pour ltablissement de nouveaux rseaux ou
lexpansion des rseaux.  Btissant sur les russites de la
Phase I et sur les leons  tirer de cette premire exprience,
les dix RCE retenus en 1994 pour la Phase II du Programme
partagent un objectif prcis : mobiliser les meilleurs chercheurs des
universits et des secteurs priv et public du Canada pour quils appliquent
leur expertise au dveloppement de notre conomie et 
lamlioration de la qualit de vie des Canadiens.

<p>Un modle qui a fait ses preuves, le programme de RCE propose
une approche indite aux dcideurs du gouvernement, du secteur
priv et des universits.  Reconnaissant que lconomie
canadienne, qui reposait jusquici sur lexploitation des
ressources naturelles, se tourne maintenant vers la cration du savoir pour
demeurer concurrentielle, ces dcideurs sinterrogent sur la meilleure
faon de favoriser cette transition et examinent les divers
modles appliqus au Canada et  ltranger.  De cet examen
merge un nouveau consensus sur la meilleure faon dacclrer
la contribution des sciences et de la technologie  lconomie
du pays.  Certaines recommandations sont particulirement
importantes :

<ul>
<li>Identifier les dcideurs-cls au sein des industries
canadiennes les plus dynamiques.

<li>Crer un forum o les chefs de file des milieux industriel 
scientifique pourront explorer des domaines dintrt commun 
et fixer des priorits nationales.

<li>Dterminer les nouvelles dcouvertes en sciences et en gnie
qui pourraient contribuer  rehausser lconomie canadienne et
la qualit de nos vies.

<li>Permettre  lindustrie canadienne davoir accs  la
recherche plus tt dans dans le droulement dun projet.

<li>Mettre en place les conditions favorisant des partenariats
scientifiques au point o convergent plusieurs disciplines
scientifiques, l o seulement lexpertise combine de deux ou
plusieurs disciplines permettra de faire des perces et de
trouver de nouvelles applications offrant un grand potentiel en
fait de retombes conomiques et damlioration de la qualit de
vie.

<li>Maximiser lefficacit de la R et D par lentremise de
partenariats permettant une utilisation plus efficace
dappareils coteux.

<li>Trouver des faons novatrices dutiliser leffet de levier des
ressources existantes qui offriront aux universits, au secteur
priv et au gouvernement des solutions de rechange pour investir
leurs fonds limits dans la R et D.
</ul>

<p>Ces principes sont au coeur des Rseaux de centres d'excellence.

<blockquote><i><b>" Lexprience acquise et les bases jetes au cours de la Phase
I du Programme de RCE ont positionn favorablement les rseaux
en vue de la Phase II - en fait, au moment opportun pour aider le
Canada  effectuer la transition cruciale vers une conomie axe
sur le savoir. "</b></i></blockquote>

<h3>Modle des RCE</h3>

<h4>Partenariat avec lindustrie et mise en commun des ressources 
lchelle nationale</h4>

<p>Le Programme de RCE repose sur la prmisse quune collaboration
soutenue entre les dcideurs du milieu universitaire et des
secteurs priv et public dans la dfinition de leurs priorits
et leurs objectifs communs contribuera  acclrer autant le
dveloppement de technologies que leurs applications.

<p>La participation  un rseau accrot lefficacit de tous les
participants.  Dabord, elle permet aux chercheurs
universitaires de mettre en commun leur expertise et leurs
ressources, par exemple leurs connaissances et leurs
installations spcialises, en vue dentreprendre des travaux 
une chelle beaucoup plus grande par comparaison  celle que
leur permettrait une approche traditionnelle.  Ensuite, elle
permet aux participants du secteur priv de se tenir au fait des
dcouvertes et avenues de recherche pouvant transformer leurs
activits au sein dun march qui se mondialise rapidement. 
Enfin, elle permet aux participants de tous les secteurs
daccder  une vaste expertise et  des installations 
spcialises qui compltent et enrichichissent leurs propres ressources.

<h3>Feu vert pour la Phase II</h3>

<p>La Phase I du Programme de RCE, administre par le Conseil de
recherches en sciences naturelles et en gnie, le Conseil de
recherches mdicales et le Conseil de recherche en sciences
humaines, en collaboration avec Industrie Canada, a t amorce
en 1990 avec ltablissement de quinze rseaux.  En 1993, on a
annonc la Phase II du Programme,  laquelle un budget de 197
millions de dollars rpartis sur quatre ans a t accord.

<p>En 1994,  lissue dun concours faisant appel  une valuation
rigoureuse par les pairs, dix rseaux ont t slectionns en
vue de la Phase II du Programme de RCE.  Chaque rseau se
concentre dans un domaine de recherche prsentant des avantages
socio-conomiques importants pour le Canada, et chacun dentre
eux a dj dmontr son potentiel prometteur en matire de
nouvelles applications industrielles. Chaque rseau est compos
dquipes de chercheurs de laboratoires universitaires,
industriels et gouvernementaux collaborant  des projets
conjoints dont le dveloppement est jug prioritaire par les
partenaires des secteurs priv et public. 

<p>Les modles novateurs de partenariats de recherche
plurisectorielle mis en place durant la Phase I ne cessent
dvoluer.  Une des nouvelles caractristiques de la Phase II
rside dans limportance accrue accorde  une approche
interdisciplinaire faisant appel  la collaboration des secteurs
public et priv.  En vue dlargir la porte du Programme des
RCE, 48 millions de dollars des fonds consacrs  la Phase II
ont t rservs  ltablissement de nouveaux rseaux dans cinq
domaines stratgiques retenus en raison de leur grand 
potentiel de retombes socio-conomiques et environnementales
pour le Canada.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Un fonctionnement d'entreprise</h3>

<p>Les rseaux retenus pour la Phase II rassemblent plus 
de 200 entreprises membres provenant de divers secteurs de
lindustrie.  Le degr de participation aux rseaux varie dune
entreprise  une autre, mais les raisons incitant chacune delles
 y adhrer sont similaires. En voici quelques exemples : 

<ul>
<li>Elles se rjouissent  lide que les retombes conomiques 
figurent au nombre des principaux critres utiliss dans
ltablissement des priorits en matire de recherche
universitaire. 

<li>Elles y voient le moyen dexercer une influence sur la
recherche universitaire poursuivie dans leur domaine dactivit.

<li>Elles souhaitent avoir accs  la recherche de pointe et aux 
conseils dexperts et obtenir ainsi un avantage concurrentiel et
trouver de nouveaux dbouchs commerciaux.

<li>Elles y voient la possibilit dtablir des alliances
stratgiques avec dautres membres du rseau dont les travaux de
recherche et de dveloppement de produits peuvent tre
complmentaires des leurs.

<li>Elles voient dans les rseaux un excellent bassin de futurs
employs.

<li>La gestion professionnelle des rseaux, leur 
administration interne et la conduite de leurs activits 
auprs des entreprises leur inspirent confiance.
</ul>

<p>Devant collaborer troitement avec les entreprises
participantes, les rseaux fonctionnent  la manire de
lentreprise prive.  Chaque rseau est dirig par un conseil
dadministration auquel sigent les cadres suprieurs des
entreprises fortement intresses aux activits du rseau.  Des
cadres suprieurs des universits, des reprsentants des agences
de transfert technologique et du milieu des affaires, ainsi que
de la communaut des chercheurs universitaires sigent galement
 ces conseils dadministration.  Le secteur public, pour sa part, y est
reprsent par des fonctionnaires qui assurent des liens
essentiels avec les responsables des politiques fdrales et
provinciales. 

<p>Les rseaux ont recours  nombre des outils de gestion utiliss
couramment dans lentreprise prive tels que les noncs de
mission, les plans stratgiques, et ltablissement dobjectifs
 court,  moyen et  long termes. Lefficacit est le mot
dordre.  Le personnel administratif est maintenu au minimum;
les centres administratifs de la majorit des rseaux emploient
moins de cinq employs, dont certains  temps partiel.  Les
professeurs universitaires et les participants de lindustrie
collaborant au sein dun rseau ne reoivent aucune rmunration
du Programme de RCE et, chaque fois que cela est possible, les
activits des rseaux, comme les runions et les ateliers, ont lieu
dans le cadre dautres rencontres professionnelles prvues au
calendrier des organismes membres.

<p>En raison de lintrt grandissant que suscitent les rseaux
auprs du secteur priv et de la communaut des sciences et du
gnie, on assiste  une volution des cultures propres  ces diverses 
communauts.  Chaque communaut est de plus en plus consciente
que lexpertise en sciences, en gnie et dans lindustrie,
regroupe dans des partenariats soigneusement dfinis, peut
engendrer des avantages auxquels elle ne pourrait aspirer sans
un tel partenariat.
<p>

<p>

<blockquote><b><i>" Les avantages que retirent les partenaires de
lindustrie des rseaux sont directement lis aux efforts quils
consacrent  ces partenariats dans la gestion, la dfinition des
programmes et les interactions de recherche. "</i></b></blockquote> 
<p>
<p>John Elliott, Fellow emeritus, BNR,<br>
Prsident de lInstitut canadien de recherches en
tlcommunications (ICRT)

<p>

<h3>Diffusion des activits des RCE</h3>

<p><i>Au mme titre que les gestionnaires du secteur priv, les
administrateurs des RCE (dont plusieurs proviennent du milieu
des affaires) sont conscients du rle essentiel des
communications efficaces pour assurer le succs des activits de
liaison avec lindustrie, vers qui sont dirigs les efforts de
transfert technologique des rseaux.  Les rseaux organisent des
activits de relations publiques comme des ateliers, des sances
dinformation et des confrences.  Ils diffusent rgulirement
des documents promotionnels et des bulletins afin de tenir leurs 
membres et leurs clients potentiels au courant de leurs
activits.</i>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>RCE Inc.?</h3>

<p>Certains rseaux vont encore plus loin sur le plan de la culture 
dentreprise.  Un certain nombre se sont constitus en socits,
et plusieurs ont mis sur pied des petites entreprises exploites
par certains de leurs propres participants.  Voici des exemples de
socits issues de projets de recherche des rseaux :
<ul>
<li>Rseau canadien de recherche sur les bactrioses (RCRB)<br>
	- Micrologix Biotech Inc.<br>
	- SPI Diagnostics<br>
	- NoAb Immunoassay<br>
	- Synsorb Biotech Inc.<br>

<li>Micronet<br>
	- Cadabra Design Laboratories<br>

<li>Institut de robotique et dintelligence des systmes (IRIS)<br>
	- Wavemakers<br>
	- Innovmetric<br>
	- Hexavision<br>
</ul>
<p>

<p>

<h3>De la recherche de calibre mondial aux applications commerciales</h3>

<p>Lorsque lon demande aux chercheurs de commenter leur
participation aux rseaux, voil les principaux avantages quils
associent  ce modle :

<ul>
<li>Les rseaux permettent de collaborer avec dautres chercheurs
universitaires dans le cadre de projets qui, en raison de leur
ampleur ou des connaissances trs spcialises requises, ne
pourraient tre accomplis autrement. 

<li>Les projets  la frontire de plusieurs disciplines, par
exemple entre le gnie et la photochimie, la biologie et la
physico-chimie, sont une grande source de stimulation.

<li>Les rseaux favorisent une meilleure communication entre
lindustrie et les chercheurs.  Les interactions rendues
possibles grce aux rseaux sensibilisent davantage les
chercheurs aux dfis que doit relever lindustrie.

<li>Les rseaux leur donnent la possibilit de rehausser
linfrastructure de recherche. Cet avantage se prsente sous
plusieurs formes :  un appareillage amlior grce au soutien du
rseau, qui permet de complter lappareillage disponible dans
leurs propres laboratoires; la possibilit de partager laccs 
certains appareils et  un soutien technique particulier (par
exemple technologues et tudiants) avec des chercheurs dautres
laboratoires du rseau; et, des contributions des entreprises
prives membres du rseau en matire dappareillage et de
recherche.

<li>Les rseaux stimulent une grande synergie entre les projets 
du rseau et dautres activits de recherche.
</ul>

<p>Les projets de recherche des RCE sont soumis  un rigoureux
processus de slection et dvaluation scientifiques.  La
participation dminents chercheurs et ingnieurs canadiens 
cette valuation fait en sorte que chaque projet est soumis  un
examen minutieux au sein du rseau de mme qu une valuation
par des pairs de lextrieur.  Des visites des laboratoires sont
galement effectues par des experts reprsentant non seulement
la communaut des chercheurs, mais aussi les gestionnaires du
secteur de la recherche et du milieu des affaires.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<blockquote><b><i>" Les rseaux ont permis  certains de nos meilleurs chercheurs
de collaborer  des projets de taille et dunir leurs efforts
dans la rsolution de problmes autrement inattaquables. "</i></b></blockquote>
<p>Michael Smith, Laurat du Prix Nobel de chimie de 1993,<br>
Prsident du Rseau de centres dexcellence en gnie protique<br>
Directeur du laboratoire de biotechnologie  lUniversit de la
Colombie-Britannique
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Des possibilits sans prcdent de formation en S et T</h3>

<p>Les participants des RCE sont unanimes : les rseaux 
contribuent  former la prochaine gnration de chercheurs et
dingnieurs du Canada.

<ul>
<li>Les tudiants voient dans les rseaux une fentre ouverte sur
les besoins, les dfis et les dbouchs que prsente la
recherche industrielle.

<li>Les universits voient dans les rseaux un excellent vhicule
pour assurer  leurs tudiants une formation complte qui les 
initie  la recherche en milieu universitaire et industriel.

<li>Les entreprises voient dans les participants des rseaux une
source demploys potentiels qui saisissent les particularits
de lindustrie et qui seront productifs ds leur entre en
fonction.

<li>Les tudiants, les universits et les entreprises voient 
dans les rseaux un centre de concertation favorisant des 
interactions professionnelles qui permettent  lensemble 
des participants de se tenir au fait des besoins et des 
progrs accomplis par chacun dentre eux.
</ul>

<p>Les tudiants valorisent leur exprience au sein dun rseau,
car celle-ci leur offre la possibilit dacqurir une
perspective industrielle, deffectuer des travaux sous la
direction de chercheurs de haut vol qui non seulement pourront
leur enseigner des techniques, mais galement leur prsenter une
approche densemble de la recherche scientifique.  La
possibilit de pouvoir comparer la recherche universitaire  la
recherche industrielle est souvent cite comme un avantage par
les tudiants ayant fait un stage au sein dun rseau.  Cette
exprience incite galement bon nombre de " diplms " des RCE
 travailler dans le secteur de lindustrie plutt qu opter pour
une carrire universitaire.

<blockquote><b><i>" Le rseau Micronet a appuy mes recherches doctorales 
lUniversit de Toronto, ma mis en contact avec les entreprises
canadiennes de micro-lectronique de pointe et a exerc une influence
sur la naturede mes travaux.  Grce  cette exprience, cette
collaboration et cet appui, je travaille maintenant pour Northern Telecom. "</i></b></blockquote>

<p>Sorin Voinigescu, Chercheur, Northern Telecom
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>Programmes de sensibilisation  lintention 
des tudiants</h3>

<p>Les rseaux adoptent une approche proactive pour susciter
lintrt des tudiants.
<ul>
<li>Les tudiants sont invits aux runions des conseils
dadministration des rseaux, o ils ont souvent loccasion de
prsenter brivement leurs travaux appuys par le rseau.  Ces
invitations servent  plusieurs fins :  elle permettent aux
entreprises participantes de rencontrer les tudiants qui se
distinguent parmi la future relve des chercheurs; elles donnent
aux tudiants loccasion dassister  la prise de dcisions
ayant une incidence sur lindustrie  un niveau auquel ils nont
pas normalement accs, et elles permettent aux reprsentants de
lindustrie et aux tudiants de prendre contact.

<li>Plusieurs rseaux ont tabli des programmes visant  informer
les tudiants de leurs activits.  Des confrences, des ateliers
et des visites des laboratoires sont frquemment organiss. Ces
programmes renferment souvent un volet permettant aux tudiants
de prsenter leurs projets de recherche appuys par le rseau.

<li>Certains rseaux commencent  tendre leurs efforts de
sensibilisation en organisant des prsentations  lintention
des technologues et des techniciens tudiant  dans dautres
centres de formation, tels les collges communautaires et les
coles secondaires.

Rseaux de centres d'excellence - Phase  II</title>

<h2>Politiques et lignes directrices<br>
Rseaux de centres d'excellence - Phase  II</h2>

<h3>Prface</h3>

<p>Chaque subvention sera administre par le Comit de direction
des  Rseaux de centres d'excellence (RCE) par l'entremise d'un
conseil  subventionnaire. En gnral, les rgles et politiques
du conseil dont  relvera le domaine de recherche principal du
rseau s'appliqueront  la subvention. Veuillez consulter le
guide des subventions du  conseil en question pour de plus
amples renseignements. Les rglements  et les politiques
administratives propres au Programme de RCE sont  approuvs par
le Comit de direction des RCE qui est compos des prsidents 
des trois conseils subventionnaires et du sous-ministre,
Industrie  et Sciences Canada (ISC).

<h3>Contexte</h3>

<p>En 1988, le gouvernement du Canada annonait la cration du
Programme  de RCE dans le cadre de sa stratgie visant 
promouvoir les sciences  et la technologie pour assurer la
prosprit du pays.

<p>Le 19 novembre 1992, le Premier ministre a annonc que le
Programme  de RCE, qui avait dbut comme une exprience
prometteuse il y a quatre  ans, a t une russite, et qu'il
bnficierait d'un appui permanent.  Dans son Expos conomique
du 2 dcembre 1992, le ministre des Finances  a annonc que le
Programme de RCE sera reconduit... Cela permettra  aux plus
efficaces des rseaux actuels de continuer de contribuer   la
comptitivit du Canada. De nouveau rseaux de recherche
pourront  galement recevoir une aide dans les secteurs qui
deviennent de plus  en plus importants.

<p>En juillet 1993, le gouvernement a approuv les dtails de la
phase  II du Programme de rseaux de centres d'excellence. Cette
phase prvoit  la tenue d'un concours pour les rseaux dj
existants et un engagement   tenir un concours pour des
nouveaux rseaux  une date ultrieure,  dans la mesure o le
financement le permet. La phase II du Programme  s'appuie sur le
succs de la premire phase de quatre ans et oriente  le
Programme vers une participation multisectorielle accrue 
toutes  les activits des rseaux, y compris la planification
stratgique.

<h3>Objectifs</h3>

<p>La phase II du Programme de rseaux de centres d'excellence vise
  mobiliser les chercheurs canadiens des milieux universitaire,
priv  et public, et  les associer au dveloppement de
l'conomie nationale  et  l'amlioration de la qualit de
vie des Canadiens.

<p>Pour y parvenir, on investira dans des rseaux de recherche
nationaux  dont les objectifs sont de:

<ul>
<li>Stimuler la recherche fondamentale de pointe et la
recherche  applique, selon des critres d'excellence de
calibre international,  dans des domaines essentiels au
dveloppement conomique du Canada;

<li>Former des scientifiques et des ingnieurs de calibre
international,  dans des domaines technologiques essentiels 
la productivit et   la croissance conomique du Canada, et
les inciter  demeurer  au Canada;

<li>Grer des programmes de recherche multidisciplinaire
et  multisectorielle de porte nationale, et crer des
partenariats qui  intgrent les priorits de tous les
participants en matire de  recherche et de dveloppement;

<li>Acclrer la communication des rsultats de
recherches au sein des rseaux et faciliter le transfert
de connaissances  et leur intgration par des
organismes canadiens en mesure de  les exploiter au profit
du dveloppement conomique et social du pays.
</ul>

<h3>Critres de slection et d'valuation</h3>

<p>Afin d'assurer la ralisation des objectifs du Programme, les
propositions  des rseaux seront values au cours du processus
de slection, et  les rseaux choisis seront valus pendant la
priode de validit  de la subvention en fonction de cinq
critres galement pondrs.  Pour tre retenue, une proposition
devra recevoir une valuation  suprieure au seuil tabli
pour chaque critre. Les rseaux doivent  maintenir ces seuils
pour continuer  recevoir leur subvention.

ressources.<br>
</ul>

<h3>Principes directeurs</h3>

<h4>Programme de recherche</h4>

<p>L'excellence en recherche, mesure en comparaison de normes
internationales,  constitue un lment essentiel pour recevoir
un financement dans le  cadre de ce programme. Le
Programme runit des chercheurs  de diffrentes rgions
du pays au sein d'quipes qui partagent  les mmes objectifs et
collaborent  un programme de recherche prcis,  en vue de crer
la masse critique de comptences ncessaires et d'obtenir  des
rsultats de recherche de calibre international. Le Programme 
de RCE a t mis sur pied pour permettre aux meilleurs
chercheurs  canadiens d'obtenir des rsultats qu'ils n'auraient
pu atteindre s'ils  avaient travaill seuls ou au sein d'quipes
plus restreintes. Pour  atteindre les objectifs du Programme, il
faut coordonner et conjuguer  les efforts de recherche. En plus
de faire davantage appel  la recherche  concerte, le Programme
incite les chercheurs  tenir compte de l'importance  conomique
et sociale de leurs travaux de mme que de l'incidence 
ventuelle de ceux-ci. Le Programme vise en outre  changer les
attitudes  et les approches en recherche.

<p>L'importance de la recherche pour le dveloppement conomique et
social  du Canada est un critre essentiel du Programme. Les
rseaux doivent  dmontrer comment leurs activits contribuent 
ce but. Les retombes  relles ou ventuelles pour l'industrie
canadienne et pour les systmes  de sant publique et sociaux
constituent un facteur essentiel lorsqu'il  s'agit d'tablir
l'importance stratgique de la recherche poursuivie  par les
rseaux.

<p>Les programmes de recherche devraient prvoir les problmes et
les  possibilits qui pourraient surgir en ce qui concerne
l'conomie nationale,  la productivit et le bien-tre des
Canadiens, ainsi que les mcanismes  pour y faire face. Aussi,
les programmes de recherche des rseaux  doivent-ils tre
labors en collaboration avec tous les intervenants  cls, et
en tenant compte des priorits de l'industrie, des universits, 
et du gouvernement.

<p>Les programmes de recherche des rseaux doivent se situer  une
tape  prconcurrentielle, comme il convient  un tablissement
universitaire  ou institutionnel qui offre des cours de
formation. Toutefois, il  serait bon de maintenir toute une
gamme d'activits, de la recherche  fondamentale  la recherche
applique, jusqu' l'tape du dveloppement.  Une telle dmarche
assurera :

<ul>
<li>un continuum de recherche au sein des rseaux, la
recherche  fondamentale devant faire natre et rpandre de
nouvelles ides dans  tout le systme;

<li>une souplesse permettant aux utilisateurs de recourir
aux  rseaux pour combler leurs besoins les plus
urgents et lorsque  les possibilits de collaboration sont
les meilleures.
</ul>

<h4>Personnel hautement qualifi</h4>

<p>Un but important du Programme consiste  former et  garder au
pays  la prochaine gnration de chercheurs canadiens
oeuvrant dans un  environnement interactif, non traditionnel,
et ax sur la rsolution  de problmes. Les stagiaires tireront
profit des rapports qu'ils entretiendront  avec les participants
des rseaux et ils ouvriront la voie  une collaboration  accrue
entre le milieu universitaire et les secteurs priv et public. 
Les rseaux devraient laborer et mettre en oeuvre des
stratgies  de promotion (comme la distribution de documents
d'information), afin  de faire connatre les stagiaires 
d'ventuels employeurs.

<p>Les rseaux devraient offrir  de nouveaux participants la
possibilit  de prendre part  la phase II du Programme. Les
rseaux sont galement  encourags  favoriser un meilleur taux
de participation des femmes  et de tous les groupes dsigns en
vertu de l'quit en matire d'emploi,  c.--d. les autochtones,
les personnes handicapes et les minorits  visibles. Enfin,
dans leurs demandes respectives, les rseaux devraient  prciser
le nombre de chercheurs et de stagiaires qui sont citoyens 
canadiens, immigrants reus ou trangers.

<h4>Fonctionnement en rseau et collaboration</h4>

<p>Le fonctionnement en rseau vise  rapprocher des quipes et des
programmes  de recherche de mme qu' promouvoir des changes
efficaces et la  collaboration avec l'industrie. Le
fonctionnement en rseau et l'accroissement  des changes
devraient permettre de tirer le maximum des ressources  de
recherche, grce au partage d'appareillage et d'installations, 
et de rduire le ddoublement des efforts en recherche. Une
collaboration  efficace doit tre tablie avec les utilisateurs
afin d'orienter les  programmes de recherche et d'acclrer le
transfert des connaissances  et de la technologie. La
collaboration avec l'industrie peut prendre  plusieurs
formes : des changes accrus de personnel entre les rseaux 
et l'industrie; la participation de l'industrie  des projets
conjoints  au sein des rseaux et la reprsentation de
l'industrie au sein de  conseils d'administration et de comits
des rseaux.

<h4>Financement externe</h4>

<p>Il est important que les rseaux obtiennent des fonds de sources
autres  que les conseils. Le niveau adquat de financement
d'autres sources  dpendra entre autres de l'objectif de la
recherche envisage et du  milieu conomique dans lequel
fonctionne le rseau. Les contributions  d'entreprises
trangres ne doivent pas compromettre le principe de  la
commercialisation des rsultats au Canada, dans l'intrt du
Canada.

<h4>Transfert de connaissances et exploitation de
technologies</h4>

<p>Les objectifs du Programme soulignent l'importance de la mise au
point  de nouvelles technologies et de la cration de crneaux
dont pourra  bnficier le secteur priv, notamment le transfert
 l'industrie  de connaissances et de technologies rsultant des
travaux de recherche  effectus par les rseaux, et un bassin de
personnel form dans un  contexte de collaboration. Les
rsultats qui mneront  des conomies  dans le domaine de la
sant ou sur le plan social et qui contribueront  
l'amlioration de la qualit de vie, constituent d'importantes
retombes  en accord avec les objectifs du Programme.

<p>Les secteurs publics et privs devraient participer pleinement
aux  rseaux afin d'assurer que leurs programmes de recherche
rpondent  aux besoins des Canadiens et contribuent  la
croissance conomique   long terme du pays. Cette participation
touche  tous les aspects  du programme de recherche, y compris
la participation  des conseils  d'administration et  des
comits, en plus de contribuer au financement  et  l'apport
d'autres sources d'appui.

<p>Le Programme met galement l'accent sur les retombes de la
recherche  pour le Canada et sur l'exploitation des rsultats
des travaux des  rseaux au pays. Dans le cas o la rceptivit
de l'industrie canadienne  est limite, il incombe au rseau de
stimuler cette rceptivit. Cela  peut signifier l'adoption
d'une approche davantage oriente vers l'industrie  et
l'tablissement de liens troits avec les responsables
gouvernementaux  du dveloppement industriel.

<h4>Gestion des affaires</h4>

<p>Il est essentiel de raliser les objectifs d'affaires du rseau.
La  personne qui sera charge des aspects administratifs du
rseau devra  possder l'exprience et les comptences
ncessaires pour s'en acquitter.  Le gestionnaire/directeur
administratif doit tre trait sur un pied  d'galit avec le
directeur scientifique quant  son statut au sein  du rseau. En
outre, il serait bon que des spcialistes en
commercialisation,  en gestion de la technologie et en
communications, ainsi que d'autres personnes possdant des
comptences pertinentes en gestion des  affaires, fassent
partie de la structure du rseau, dans la mesure  du possible.

<h4>Gestion de rseau</h4>

<p>Chaque rseau doit mettre sur pied une structure pour assurer la
gestion  d'un programme multidisciplinaire bien intgr
regroupant plusieurs  tablissements. Une telle structure doit
permettre d'assurer l'atteinte  des objectifs du Programme et du
rseau. De plus, elle doit permettre  de grer efficacement les
diffrents projets du rseau, y compris  la rpartition des
fonds de faon  assurer la pertinence des travaux  entrepris.
Elle doit faire en sorte que les chercheurs comprennent  les
objectifs de recherche du rseau et qu'ils contribuent  les
atteindre.  La structure de gestion doit galement permettre
d'assurer que les  procdures et les rglements stipuls dans
l'entente de financement  et dans l'entente interne soient
respects.

<h4>Communications</h4>

<p>La gestion efficace des communications est essentielle au succs
des  rseaux et du Programme dans son ensemble. Les
communications internes  sont vitales au travail en rseau. Les
activits, rsultats et ralisations  du rseau devraient
galement tre communiqus  des publics externes,  y compris
d'ventuels participants de tous les secteurs, les responsables 
des politiques publiques, les mdias et le grand public. La
cohrence  du message tant essentielle, la coordination de
toutes les activits  de communication devrait tre confie 
une personne comptente au  sein de chaque rseau. Les activits
de communications et les messages  du rseau doivent tre en
accord avec le plan global de communication  du Programme de RCE.

<h3>Prsentation des demandes et modalits d'valuation</h3>

<h4>Prsentation des demandes</h4>

<p>Les demandes de subvention des rseaux prendront la forme de
plans  stratgiques dtaillant les objectifs viss en matire de
recherche  et d'affaires pendant la priode de financement
propose. Les plans  stratgiques devront faire ressortir les
avantages globaux et la valeur  ajoute d'une approche de
recherche et de gestion base sur le fonctionnement  en rseau.
Il doit ressortir clairement que les plans stratgiques 
tiennent compte des priorits de tous les participants. La
planification  de chaque rseau doit s'articuler autour des
besoins  long terme  du secteur priv.

<p>Les objectifs du plan de recherche du rseau devront tre
clairement  noncs et doivent dmontrer que la recherche est
oriente, innovatrice  et largement intgre. Le plan de
recherche doit comprendre des tapes  cls clairement dfinies,
ralisables et mesurables. Il conviendra  de dfinir
l'importance stratgique de la recherche prvue pour le  Canada
ainsi que ses ventuelles retombes conomiques.

<p> l'instar des objectifs de recherche, les objectifs
d'affaires  du rseau, y compris les tapes cls et les buts,
doivent tre clairement  dfinis et ralisables. Il faudra
formuler les dispositions pour l'tablissement  de liens avec
les utilisateurs des secteurs publics et privs, ainsi  que les
mcanismes pour le transfert des connaissances et de la
technologie.  La participation du secteur priv devrait se
reflter dans toutes  les fonctions des rseaux : la structure
de gestion et les projets  de recherche. La participation du
secteur priv devrait comprendre,  dans la mesure du possible,
la formation de personnel hautement  qualifi aux
installations du rseaux ainsi que des programmes
d'changes  entre les chercheurs universitaires et
industriels du rseau.

<p>De plus, chaque rseau devra, dans son plan d'activit :

<ul>
<li>dmontrer l'importance de l'appui quantifiable
(contributions  en espces et en nature) promis par des sources
autres que les conseils  subventionnaires;

<li>justifier le niveau d'aide obtenu, compte tenu du
milieu  dans lequel le rseau fonctionne;

<li>indiquer un objectif en vue d'obtenir des
contributions  additionnelles de sources autres que des conseils
subventionnaires;  et prsenter un plan menant  la
ralisation de l'objectif vis;

<li>inclure les prvisions budgtaires pour les activits
administratives,  y compris la contribution prvue des
partenaires industriels  ces  activits et un budget dtaill
des dpenses;

<li>comprendre une description de la structure de gestion
du  rseau, y compris une dfinition des rles, des
responsabilits et  des champs de comptences du personnel
cl;

<li>noncer des stratgies en vue du transfert des
rsultats  des recherches du rseau  la collectivit des
utilisateurs, y  compris des dispositions rgissant les
relations avec le secteur priv;

<li>comprendre un plan de communication incluant des
activits  visant  sensibiliser les participants ventuels de
tous les secteurs  aux retombes de la recherche des rseaux;

<li>une entente interne, approuve en principe par tous
les organismes qui participeraient ventuellement au rseau.
Il sera ncessaire d'obtenir  les signatures officielles avant
le dbut de la deuxime phase de  financement.
</ul>

<h4><i>Rglements rgissant certains types de recherche</i></h4>

<p>Le rseau doit se conformer, s'il y a lieu,  tous les
rglements  en vigueur concernant la recherche, y compris celle
comportant des  expriences avec des animaux ou des sujets
humains, des bio-risques  ou des substances radioactives ou
dangereuses, de l'incidence sur  l'environnement et la
recherche dans le Yukon et les Territoires  du Nord-Ouest. Les
rseaux devront fournir aux conseils dont ils relvent  les
certificats et documents appropris et devront tenir cette
information   jour durant la priode de subvention au cas o
les projets en cours  seraient modifis ou si de nouveaux
projets sont ajouts au rseau.

<h4>Modalits d'valuation</h4>

<p>Le Comit de slection valuera chaque proposition selon les
quatre  facteurs suivants:
<ul>
<li>Les<b> plans stratgiques</b>, qui seront valus en
fonction  des objectifs et des critres de la phase II du
Programme de RCE.

<li>Les rsultats de l'<b>valuation par les pairs</b>,
qui  seront essentiels pour juger du dossier antrieur du rseau
(au besoin)  et dterminer les chances de succs du plan
stratgique qu'il propose.

<li>Les rapports des <b>examinateurs de l'extrieur</b>.

<li>L'expos d'un ou deux reprsentants du rseau <b>au
comit  de slection</b>.
</ul>

<p>Les propositions seront values les unes par rapport aux autres
et  classes en consquence.

<h4><i>valuation par les pairs</i></h4>

<p>Les conseils subventionnaires seront responsables pour le choix
des  membres des comits d'valuation par les pairs requis pour
valuer  les propositions des rseaux en fonction des critres
de slection  et d'valuation. Les rsultats de l'valuation des
rapports de 33  mois effectus par les comits de pairs
constitueront un lment important  du processus de slection
en vue du financement des rseaux existants  pour la phase II du
Programme. Ces comits de pairs valuent les progrs  et les
ralisations d'un rseau en fonction des objectifs initiaux 
du Programme et de ceux du rseau.

<h4><i>Examen externe</i></h4>

<p>Les propositions des rseaux seront distribues  des personnes
et   des groupes qui possdent les comptences voulues pour
situer  les propositions dans le contexte conomique
canadien, comme les  ministres et organismes fdraux 
vocation scientifique et l'industrie.  Les valuations manant
de ces sources apporteront des renseignements  supplmentaires
sur les ventuelles retombes conomiques des propositions,  que
le comit de slection utilisera.

<h4><i>Comit de slection</i></h4>

<p>Les conseils subventionnaires et ISC choisiront conjointement
les  membres du comit de slection, en veillant  runir les
diverses  comptences que ncessite l'valuation des
propositions en fonction  de tous les critres de slection. Le
comit regroupera des scientifiques,  des ingnieurs, des
reprsentants de l'industrie et des conomistes  ou d'autres
spcialistes des sciences sociales qui connaissent bien  la
recherche et sa gestion, l'conomie canadienne et ses secteurs 
producteurs, ainsi que les politiques conomique, commerciale,
industrielle  et technologique. Les conseils subventionnaires
dirigeront le processus  de slection et ISC agira  titre
d'observateur.

<p>Dans le cadre du processus d'valuation, on invitera les
candidats   envoyer un ou deux reprsentants au nom de leur
rseau  venir faire  une brve prsentation devant le Comit de
slection et  rpondre  aux questions particulires.

<p>Le Comit de slection prsentera ensuite les propositions
classes  en ordre de mrite au ministre des Sciences, qui
les soumettra  au Cabinet en vue de la dcision  prendre sur la
question du financement.  Le rapport du Comit de slection sera
rendu public. Le montant des  fonds disponibles pour de nouveaux
rseaux dpendra du nombre de propositions  dont le
renouvellement aura t approuv par le Cabinet.

<p>Les rseaux dont le renouvellement n'aura pas t approuv
pourront  ngocier une cessation graduelle de leurs activits
avec les administrateurs  du Programme.

<h3>Admissibilit</h3>

<p>Les organismes admissibles  un financement pour la phase II
sont  les universits, centres hospitaliers universitaires et
instituts  de recherche, et tablissements postsecondaires
menant des activits  de recherche.

<p>On s'attend que de nombreux autres organismes participent au
Programme  de rseaux de centres d'excellence, qui s'adresse 
tous les secteurs.  Comme les marchs de services comptent parmi
les cots admissibles,  ces organismes pourront agir  titre de
contractuels. Le remboursement  des frais de dplacement
approuvs par les rseaux sera autoris.  Voici d'autres
lignes directrices:
<ul>
<li>L'<b>industrie</b> demeure admissible  des fonds pour
grer  des rseaux. Les entreprises et les tablissements de
recherche du  secteur priv ne pourront toutefois recevoir
directement des fonds  de recherche, puisqu'ils sont censs
retirer un avantage concurrentiel  de leur participation et,
en fin de compte, accaparer des marchs.  On s'attend qu'ils
apportent des contributions en espces ou en nature  aux
programmes de recherche des rseaux.

<li>Conformment  la Loi sur la gestion des finances
publiques  et aux lignes directrices du Conseil du Trsor, les
<b>chercheurs  du gouvernement</b> ne pourront recevoir des fonds
de recherche directement  des rseaux. Toutefois, une
participation accrue des chercheurs des  laboratoires fdraux
au Programme de RCE est souhaitable. Les rseaux  devraient
s'assurer que leurs programmes de recherche reoivent l'appui 
des cadres suprieurs des ministres et organismes responsables,
et  ce afin d'aligner les priorits en matire de recherche et
de renforcer  les liens avec le secteur public. Des contrats
avec les rseaux peuvent  donner accs aux installations
spcialises et aux services fournis  par des laboratoires
gouvernementaux. Des protocoles d'ententes  (PE) qui dfinissent
les conditions relies aux comptes  fins dtermines,  peuvent
tre utiliss pour soutenir des projets conjoints que  les
parties concernes accepteront. Les sommes dposes
dans ces comptes  par les rseaux ne peuvent provenir que de
fonds non fdraux runis  par les rseaux, et non de fonds
fdraux destins au Programme de  RCE.

<li>Il conviendrait de favoriser la participation des
<b>collges  communautaires</b>, compte tenu des circonstances.
</ul>

<h3>Gestion financire et utilisation des fonds de subvention</h3>

<h4>Principes gnraux</h4>

<p> moins d'indication contraire, les rglements du conseil
subventionnaire  dont relve principalement la recherche
s'appliquent concernant l'administration  et l'utilisation des
fonds. Un rseau qui n'observe pas les exigences  contenues
dans les lignes directrices et les conditions de l'entente  de
financement sera jug inadmissible  recevoir une subvention.

<p>L'appui est accord en vue de payer les frais directs de la
recherche  habituellement allous par les conseils
subventionnaires, y compris  les salaires et les avantages
sociaux des participants  temps plein.  Sont galement
admissibles les cots lis au fonctionnement en rseau, 
notamment les frais de dplacement et d'hbergement
du personnel  des rseaux ainsi que des membres des conseils
d'administration et  des comits des rseaux. Les cots lis 
la construction et  l'entretien  des btiments ne sont pas
admissibles.

<p>Les budgets pour les rseaux peuvent inclure les cots
suivants :  salaires et avantages sociaux du personnel,
appareillage, matriel  et fournitures, dplacements,
fonctionnement en rseau, communications,  assurance
responsabilit civile pour les membres des conseils
d'administration  et gestionnaires des rseaux, frais pour la
constitution en socit  et jusqu' 50% du total des cots de
protection de la proprit  intellectuelle (brevets, droits
d'auteur et marques de commerce),  pourvu que les bnficiaires
de cette protection versent au moins  l'autre moiti de ces
cots. Les budgets peuvent galement prvoir  des sommes pour
des contrats de services ou de consultation dont le  rseau ne
dispose pas  l'interne.

<p>Les budgets ne peuvent inclure les cots associs aux services
normalement  existants dans un organisme tels que les services
administratifs,  de personnel, des finances, de bibliothque
et d'entretien, les  locaux et les difices, et les assurances,
autres que l'assurance  responsabilit civile mentionne
prcdemment.

<h4>Salaires et traitements</h4>

<p>Les rglements du conseil subventionnaire dont relve la
recherche  s'appliquent en ce qui a trait  la rmunration
d'tudiants et de  stagiaires postdoctoraux. Pour les
programmes de recherche qui  relvent de plus d'un
conseil, le rseau peut choisir d'adopter  un seul taux 
condition qu'il se situe dans les taux prescrits.<R>

<p>Les salaires et les avantages sociaux des participants employs
  temps plein pour faire de la recherche en rseau peuvent tre
prlevs  des fonds de subventions issues du Programme.
Cependant, ces personnes devront consacrer tout leur temps
de recherche aux travaux du rseau  qui seront financs  partir
du budget du rseau. Ces chercheurs peuvent  superviser des
tudiants de 2e et 3e cycles qui effectuent  des
travaux de recherche pour le rseau. Les participants qui
reoivent  un salaire du Programme de RCE ne peuvent recevoir
des subventions  des conseil subventionnaires. En gnral,
les salaires et les restrictions  imposes aux activits autres
que la recherche devront tre conformes aux pratiques des
organismes subventionnaires.

<p>Les salaires des participants  temps partiel ne constituent
pas  une dpense admissible et on ne peut en demander le
remboursement   titre de cot de fonctionnement en rseau. On
peut par contre les  payer  partir des fonds obtenus d'autres
sources.

<h4>Paiement des subventions</h4>

<p>Par suite des dcisions de financement, le Comit de direction
des  RCE concluera des ententes de recherche avec les
reprsentants dsigns  des rseaux. Le paiement des subventions
sera autoris par le Comit  de direction des RCE par
l'entremise d'un conseil subventionnaire.

<p>Dans le cas des rseaux dont l'entente sera renouvele, les
fonds  seront accords pour une priode de quatre ans dbutant
le 1er  avril 1994 et seront soumis  une valuation
annuelle; la cessation  graduelle du financement de rseaux non
productifs fera l'objet de  ngociations entre le rseau et le
conseil subventionnaire concern.

<h4>Montants accords</h4>

<p>Le montant approuv pour le premier versement de la phase II
figure  dans l'entente de financement. Le montant des versements
subsquents  sera dtermin en fonction de l'valuation annuelle
des progrs satisfaisants  accomplis par le rseau. Le montant
des versements prvus figurant  dans l'entente de financement
reprsente le montant maximal qui sera  accord au rseau.

<h4>Versements</h4>

<p>Les versements seront approuvs chaque anne par le Comit de
direction  des RCE par l'entremise d'un conseil subventionnaire;
le premier versement   tous les rseaux dont le renouvellement
sera approuv sera pay  le 1er avril 1994, et est
conditionnel  la signature pralable  de l'entente de
financement. Sous rserve de progrs satisfaisants,  de la
disponibilit de fonds, et de la conformit du rseau aux 
lignes directrices et modalits, les versements subsquents
seront  approuvs le 1er avril 1995, 1996 et 1997. Dans
le cas des  rseaux administrs par une universit, les fonds
seront verss au  service d'administration financire dsign du
rseau selon le calendrier  des versements de chaque conseil
subventionnaire; dans tous les  autres cas, les fonds seront
verss mensuellement. Le service d'administration  financire du
rseau sera responsable de la distribution des fonds  entre les
tablissements participants du rseau.

<h4>valuation au cours de la deuxime anne</h4>

<p>Dans le cas des rseaux renouvels,  la suite de la
prsentation  du deuxime rapport annuel le 1er janvier
1996, et avant le  paiement du versement du 1er avril
1996, le rendement de chaque  rseau fera l'objet d'une
valuation approfondie par un comit  de pairs qui effectuera
une visite sur place. Ce comit formulera  des
recommandations au Comit de direction des RCE sur le niveau 
de financement  accorder au rseau en question pour la priode
commenant  le 1er avril 1996. Si le comit juge que le
rseau n'est pas  productif, le financement sera rduit
progressivement et un versement  final sera ngoci entre le
rseau et le Comit de direction des RCE.

<h3>Rapports</h3>

<h4>Calendrier des rapports d'tape</h4>

<p>Chaque rseau renouvel devra prsenter un rapport annuel le
1er janvier  1995, 1996, 1997 et 1998. Les rapports

d'affaires.
</ul>

<h4>Calendrier de prsentation des rapports financiers</h4>

<p>Le rseau doit soumettre chaque anne un bilan des dpenses
dtaillant  l'utilisation des fonds de la subvention RCE pour
l'ensemble du rseau  ainsi que des tats dtaills pour chaque
chercheur et chacun des  tablissements participants. Ces
rapports couvriront la priode  du 1er avril au 31 mars
de l'anne suivante et doivent tre  prsents au Comit de
direction des RCE par l'entremise d'un conseil  subventionnaire
au plus tard le 31 mai de chaque anne. Les contributions  en
espces ou en nature d'autres sources doivent tre indiques
sparment  et accompagnes d'une brve description de leur
l'utilisation au sein  du rseau.

<h4>Changements importants</h4>

<p>Une fois approuv par le conseil d'administration du rseau,
tout  changement important qui pourrait avoir des rpercussions
sur la mission  gnrale, le programme de recherche ou d'autres
activits du rseau  doit tre soumis  l'approbation du conseil
subventionnaire concern  avant d'tre mis en oeuvre.

<h3>Lignes directrices relatives  la gestion</h3>

<h4>Structure administrative</h4>

<p>Chaque rseau financ dans le cadre du Programme de RCE doit
tre  dot d'une structure administrative permettant de grer
un programme  multidisciplinaire complexe impliquant la
participation de plusieurs  tablissements. Cette structure
variera selon les besoins de chaque  rseau, mais devra tre
dcrite en dtail par les auteurs de la proposition  dans
l'entente interne du rseau, et approuve par le Comit de
direction  des RCE.

<p>Chaque rseau doit instituer un conseil d'administration. Les
membres  de ce conseil doivent tre en mesure de fournir des
avis et conseils  et doivent reprsenter les intrts et
proccupations des secteurs  industriel, gouvernemental et
universitaire. Le conseil d'administration  sera responsable
des politiques gnrales et financires du rseau.

<p>Afin que la gestion du rseau soit conduite et perue de faon
objective,  le prsident du conseil d'administration ne doit pas
provenir d'un  tablissement participant recevant des fonds
accords au rseau.  De plus, il est souhatable que le
conseil d'administration compte  des membres qui ne sont pas
directement rattachs aux tablissements  participants o la
recherche est effectue. Pour donner une orientation  au rseau
issue des organismes des secteurs public et priv  qui 
profiteront les travaux de recherche des rseaux, les membres du
conseil  d'administration doivent provenir dans une
proportion d'au moins  50% de l'extrieur de la communaut
universitaire. Le point de vue  de chercheurs qui ne sont pas
directement engags dans la gestion  de la recherche est
important. Le conseil d'administration devrait  considrer avoir
un chercheur du rseau comme membre votant qui n'est  pas le
directeur scientifique ou un membre d'un comit du rseau.

<p>Le Rseau doit consulter le Comit de slection des RCE avant de
nommer  les membres de son conseil d'administration (CA) et
en cas de tout  changement propos  son CA au cours de la phase
II du financement.  Le Comit de slection des RCE se rserve le
droit de nommer un membre  (ne faisant pas partie du personnel
du conseil subventionnaire) au  conseil d'administration.

<p>La gestion du programme de recherche constitue un aspect
essentiel  du rseau et,  ce titre, exige un suivi continu des
progrs de tous  les projets afin que l'on puisse faire des
recommandations au conseil  d'administration quant aux priorits
de recherche et aux affectations  budgtaires. Cette fonction
devrait tre assure par un comit de  gestion de la recherche,
qui est habituellement prsid par le directeur  scientifique et
compos de chercheurs du rseau et du secteur des  utilisateurs
(industriel ou gouvernemental). La composition de  ce comit
devrait reflter le caractre multisectoriel et
multidisciplinaire  et l'orientation des projets au sein du
programme de recherche.

<p>Au cours de la phase II du Programme de RCE, chaque rseau devra
employer  un directeur principal possdant les comptences et
l'exprience ncessaires  pour diriger les activits d'affaires
du rseau. Ce gestionnaire (ou  directeur administratif) du
rseau devrait assumer la direction,  la responsabilit et le
contrle quotidiens de toutes les activits  administratives du
rseau.

<h4>Constitution en socit</h4>

<p>On encourage chaque rseau  envisager de se constituer en
socit,  le cot de cette dmarche tant admissible  la
subvention. Que  le rseau soit constitu en socit ou non,
l'entente de financement  exigera qu'il se conforme aux
exigences de gestion de base applicables  aux organismes
sollicitant une charte fdrale de socit sans but  lucratif.
La dcision de se constituer en socit revient au rseau  et
requiert l'approbation du conseil d'administration.

<h4>Entente interne</h4>

<p>Les organismes participant au rseau doivent rdiger et signer
une  entente distincte, soit l'entente interne, visant des
questions  comme les responsabilits, les obligations, les
engagements et  les privilges de chaque organisme, les
dispositions et les structures  rgissant la gestion du rseau,
la distribution des fonds, les exigences  de prsentation de
rapports internes, l'interaction entre les participants,  y
compris les partenaires du secteur priv, la proprit et la
cession  de la proprit intellectuelle, la publication des
rsultats de  la recherche, les conflits d'intrt, la proprit
de l'appareillage,  les assurances, etc. L'entente interne
doit tre conforme aux objectifs  noncs dans le Programme
de RCE et doit viser  assurer une bonne  gestion du rseau et
une meilleure comprhension des attentes de la  part de tous les
organismes participants.

<p>L'entente interne doit tre prsente en annexe de
la proposition  de financement pour la phase II du
Programme. Les rseaux choisis  pour la phase II doivent
soumettre au Comit de direction des RCE  les signatures
officielles ncessaires  l'entente interne avant le  versement
des fonds. L'entente interne doit tre mise  jour avant  que
toute modification au fonctionnement du rseau ne soit mise en 
oeuvre. En outre, l'entente interne doit tre mise  jour et
paraphe   chaque fois qu'un nouvel organisme devient membre
du rseau.  Aucun changement subsquent ne doit tre apport 
l'entente interne  sans l'approbation pralable du conseil
d'administration et le consentement  par crit du Comit de
direction des RCE.

<p>Si le rseau est constitu en socit, les exigences relatives 
l'entente  interne peuvent tre satisfaites par l'laboration de
rglements,  d'une entente spare ou des deux.

<h3>Lignes directrices en matire de proprit
intellectuelle</h3>

<p>Les dispositions concernant le droit de proprit
intellectuelle  et la cession de cette proprit rsultant de
la recherche du rseau  sont laisses  la discrtion de
celui-ci. Ces dispositions doivent  tre rgies par l'entente
interne et y tre dcrites. Elles doivent  toutefois tre
conformes aux lignes directrices suivantes en vue  d'assurer
leur uniformit avec les objectifs du Programme de RCE.

<h4>Diffusion des rsultats</h4>

<p>Normalement, les rsultats de la recherche finance avec des
fonds  publics doivent tre publis ou diffuss  la communaut
sous une  autre forme au moment opportun. tant donn que le
Programme de RCE  encourage le transfert de connaissances et de
technologie au secteur  des utilisateurs, il peut s'avrer
ncessaire pour un rseau de protger  les rsultats de ses
travaux avant qu'ils ne soient divulgus officiellement.  Des
dlais raisonnables de publication (normalement pas plus de six 
mois) ou d'autres dispositions peuvent tre prvus pour faire en
sorte  que les retombes commerciales ventuelles des rsultats
de travaux  confidentiels poursuivis dans le cadre du programme
de recherche du  rseau ne soient pas compromis par une
publication prmature.  En mettant sur pied un mcanisme de
prslection interne destin   valuer les rsultats de
recherche du rseau avant leur publication,  les rseaux
rduiront le risque d'une publication prmature.

<h4>Commercialisation</h4>

<p>Il y a lieu de reconnatre les contributions des partenaires
industriels  du rseau en leur accordant un accs privilgi 
l'exploitation commerciale  de la proprit intellectuelle,
selon des modalits refltant la nature  et l'importance de
leurs contributions. Les dispositions prises avec  les
partenaires du secteur priv doivent figurer dans la section 
des objectifs d'affaires du plan stratgique du rseau ainsi que
dans  l'entente interne.

<h4>Partage des bnfices</h4>

<p>Les dispositions concernant la proprit et l'exploitation
commerciale  de la proprit intellectuelle doivent tenir compte
de l'un des objectifs  du Programme de RCE, soit l'tablissement
de partenariats. Ceci laisse  entendre un partage des retombes
ventuelles entre les partenaires  dans des proportions qui
refltent la contribution de chacun ainsi  que le partage des
cots de protection de la proprit intellectuelle.  Les fonds
du Programme doivent servir  payer les cots de brevetage 
de la proprit intellectuelle dcoulant de la recherche du
rseau   la condition que les parties qui bnficieront d'une
telle protection  contribuent  payer au moins la moiti de ces
cots. La dcision d'affecter  des fonds au brevetage relve du
rseau.

<h4>Exploitation au Canada</h4>

<p>En conformit avec le critre de la diffusion des
connaissances  et l'exploitation de la technologie, les
dispositions visant la proprit  intellectuelle du rseau
doivent faire en sorte que le rseau favorise  dans la mesure du
possible l'exploitation des rsultats de la recherche  au
Canada,  l'avantage du pays. Les contributions de socits
trangres  ne doivent pas compromettre ce principe. Le
rseau doit prendre toutes  les prcautions raisonnables pour
que la mise en oeuvre et l'exploitation  des rsultats ne se
fassent pas d'abord  l'extrieur du Canada. Les  exceptions 
ces exigences seront trs rares et devront tre approuves  par
le Comit de direction des RCE; le rseau est tenu d'tudier des
solutions de rechange  la commercialisation des rsultats 
l'tranger,  y compris la mise sur pied ventuelle de socits
canadiennes. Le  cas chant, le rseau serait tenu de dmontrer
les avantages, pour  le Canada, de commercialiser les rsultats
de la recherche  l'tranger.

<h4>Gestion de la proprit intellectuelle</h4>

<p>L'entente interne du rseau doit tre claire et dtaille quant
aux  questions de la proprit intellectuelle. L'entente doit
tre acceptable  pour toutes les parties et doit comprendre des
mcanismes permettant  d'viter ou de rsoudre des conflits
ventuels concernant la proprit  intellectuelle, afin que cet
aspect ne compromette pas la viabilit  du rseau.

<h3>Rle du conseil subventionnaire</h3>

<h4>Participation au conseil d'administration et aux
comits</h4>


<p>Il est laiss  la discrtion du Comit de direction des RCE de
dlguer  un membre du personnel du conseil subventionnaire
comme observateur  aux runions du conseil d'administration du
rseau et des comits  permanents du rseau. Le Comit de
direction des RCE se rserve galement  le droit de nommer un
membre (ne faisant pas partie de son personnel)  au conseil
d'administration.

<h4>Contrle et direction</h4>

<p>Le Comit de direction des RCE par l'entremise d'un conseil
subventionnaire  exercera un contrle gnral sur les activits
du rseau. Il pourra,  par exemple, participer  la rsolution
de problmes techniques, financiers  ou administratifs,
conseiller le rseau quant  l'interprtation des  objectifs,
rglements et lignes directrices du Programme de RCE,  aider
le rseau  coordonner ses activits avec celles d'autres
rseaux  ou d'autres activits parraines par le gouvernement et
 faire connatre  ses ralisations.

<h4>valuation du Programme</h4>

<p>Le Comit de direction des RCE est charg d'valuer l'efficacit
du  Programme de RCE et de prsenter au ministre des Sciences un
rapport   ce sujet. Les activits d'valuation du Programme
peuvent comprendre  des sondages et des entrevues menes auprs
des participants et  du personnel du rseau. Le rseau et les
organismes participants conviennent  de contribuer 
l'valuation du Programme de RCE et, sur demande,  de mettre
l'information et les documents ncessaires  la disposition  de
l'quipe d'valuation du Programme.

<h4>valuation des rseaux par les pairs</h4>

<p>Le Comit de direction des RCE par l'entremise d'un conseil
subventionnaire  est responsable d'instituer un comit
d'valuation par les pairs charg  d'valuer tous les ans les
progrs du rseau en fonction des objectifs  noncs dans la
proposition et des objectifs de la phase II du Programme  de
RCE. Compte tenu des recommandations formules par le comit 
par suite de l'valuation par les pairs, le Comit de direction
des  RCE peut,  sa discrtion, mettre fin  la subvention d'un
rseau  non productif. Ce processus fera l'objet de ngociations.

<title>1993 Nobel Prize Laureate, Michael Smith</title>
<img src="/images/g_imp_b.gif"><p>

<h2>1993 Nobel Prize Laureate, Michael Smith</h2>

<p>
Until he won the 1993 Nobel Prize in chemistry, Dr. Michael Smith was one of the best kept
secrets in the Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE).  Dr. Smith, a biochemist at the
University of British Columbia (UBC), was the Scientific Director of the <a href="http://diadem.biochem.ualberta.ca/pence.html">Protein Engineering
Network of Centres of Excellence (PENCE)</a> during the first five years of the network, which depends heavily upon his winning method
in protein engineering. Now all Canadians can take inspiration from Dr. Smith and his
achievements, and from the knowledge that this country has the means to recognize and
support such talent and out- standing research.

<p>
PENCE relies upon Dr. Smith's revolutionary technique in DNA-based chemistry to study the
structure and function of proteins, which are the building blocks of living cells, and to improve
enzymes and other proteins of potential economic benefit. Improved proteins can lead to new
ways of treating cancer and infectious diseases, and can be used as specialized enzymes in the
fine chemical industry and in a variety of industrial products.

<p>
Dr. Smith's genetic engineering technology is also taught to and used by promising young
researchers at the UBC Biotechnology Laboratory. Students involved in
the NCE program also study the method at these advanced laboratories.

<p>
In fact, Dr. Smith's method, called oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis, is now used
by researchers worldwide to understand how cancer and virus genes work, leading to potential
new drugs for diseases.

<p>
The technique makes it possible to reprogram the genetic code using a synthetic fragment of
DNA and this way give rise to a modified gene, and consequently, a modified protein. It has
become a standard building tool in genetic engineering, and can be used to splice bits of DNA
together, remove bits of DNA, or insert DNA fragments. The method has dramatically
advanced genetic and protein engineering. It grew out of painstaking research in the early
1970s by Dr. Smith in synthesizing and modifying oligonucleotides, short DNA fragments.
Further research enabled the Nobel laureate to build an altered DNA fragment into a virus
DNA and deliberately create a genetic mutation. This paved the way to using oligonucleotides
as a tool to modify a gene and to facilitate study on the resulting modified protein structure.

<p>
On December 10, 1993, at the official awards ceremony in Stockholm marking the anniversary of
Alfred Nobel's death, the world recognized the contribution of Dr. Smith, who shared the 6.7
million Swedish kroner (about $1 million Canadian dollars) with U.S. scientist Dr. Kary Mullis.
Dr. Smith donated the prize money to fund research on the biochemistry of the central nervous
system (in particular, research related to schizophrenia) and to promote science among
young people. Dr. Mullis was honoured for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which
makes it possible to reduplicate an individual DNA segment of a more complicated genome
millions of times in a few hours. The method is now being used, for example, to discover HIV
infections or faulty genes in hereditary diseases.

<p>
When the NCE program was officially announced in 1988, Dr. Smith was instrumental in
designing a protein engineering research program for PENCE, which is jointly administered
by MRC and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

<p>
Today PENCE links 260 outstanding scientists, research associates, graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in 13 Canadian universities and 4 federal government labs in a collaborative
venture to advance research of potential economic benefit to Canadians. It is one of 14 networks
currently supported by the NCE program.

<title>"ENHANCERS" FIGHT INFECTIONS</title>
<h2>"Enhancers" Fight Infections</h2>
<p>

Micrologix Biotech Inc., of Vancouver, has acquired worldwide rights to develop powerful new
antibacterial agents that can fight several hospital-acquired infectious diseases. The Canadian
pharmaceutical company, an industrial partner of the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network
(CBDN), is using antimicrobial technology called 'Enhancers' discovered by a team of
Network researchers led by Dr. Bob Hancock at the University of British Columbia. Enhancers
are genetically engineered peptides that have a double advantage: they can act as new
antibiotics and they can also enhance the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics. The peptides
kill disease-causing bacteria by breaking down and destroying the cell wall. This can destroy
the single-cell organism or enable an antibiotic designed to kill the bacteria to enter the
organism. This novel approach is particularly useful against the rising problem of disease-
causing bacteria that have built up a high resistance to drugs (i.e., bacteria that have a cell wall
which cannot be penetrated by the antibiotic). In North America alone, two million people
acquire hospital-derived infections at a cost of $1.5 billion annually in healthcare.
<p>
"Micrologix researchers, in collaboration with CBDN, can use this technology to design more
potent compounds for human therapeutic use. They have developed a prime compound, Nihilin
101, which has shown the ability to kill several of the most dangerous hospital-derived
bacterial infections," said Mr. Kevin Nephin, a vice-president of Micrologix. The company will
conduct pre-clinical trials over the next 12 months on three leading compounds using the
Enhancer Technology. Micrologix is also immediately investing $500,000 to further CBDN's
research on this technology. "Enhancers have the potential for much wider applications in
bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases," explained Dr. William Kay, a CBDN principal investi-
gator and professor of biochemistry and microbiology at the University of Victoria.
<p>
CBDN brings together 44 leading researchers in seven universities across Canada and two
government laboratories. Over 225 research associates, graduate students and technicians work
on CBDN-related research, which involves exploring bacterial attack and host response in very
different biological systems:  humans, animals and plants. The Network has established links
with 12 industrial affiliates. Micrologix was founded in 1986 and has generated sales of over
$1 million in niche market vaccines and diagnostics for humans and animals. According to Mr.
Nephin, the company, which employs 27 people, expects to more than double its staff in the
next three years by developing this technology.

<title>FIGHTING HAMBURGER DISEASE</title>
<h2>Fighting Hamburger Disease</h2>
<p>

A new drug that could prevent the harmful, and potentially deadly, `hamburger disease' has
been devised by researchers with the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBDN).  The drug,
SYNSORB-P, acts as a bait that ensnares and neutralizes potent bacterial toxins before they
can do any damage.  The bacteria (a variety of E. coli) thrives in ground meat, or
unpasteurized milk and milk products.  Hamburger disease has infected at least 400 Canadians
in the last year, usually after they have eaten partially uncooked hamburger meat or come in
contact with an infected person.  The bacteria, which breeds in the digestive tract, causes
vomiting, diarrhea and fever.  Its toxins can cause severe Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS),
which can damage the kidneys and central nervous system.  Recent outbreaks of the disease
have occurred in the Northwest Territories and Washington State.
<p>
Pre-clinical trials are under way to determine the safety of the drug.  "Preliminary results are
very encouraging," says CBDN researcher Dr. Glen Armstrong, of the University of Alberta,
who helped invent the drug.
<p>
This invention is a novel therapeutic application of SYNSORBS, which were originally
developed in the University of Alberta laboratory of Dr. Raymond Lemieux, and by a research
team of the former Chembiomed Ltd., an Alberta high technology company and CBDN
industrial partner.  SYNSORBS are synthetic sugar molecules that bind proteins such as toxins
and lock them within porous particles of single-celled organisms know as diatoms.  Dr.
Armstrong and his team, together with Dr. Murray Ratcliffe, then at Chembiomed, succeeded
in pinpointing a SYNSORB sugar molecule and testing its ability to bind and block the harmful
toxins that cause HUS.  This discovery is now being pursued by the Alberta Research Council,
owners of the technology.
<p>
"The toxins are lured to the sugar that mimics the receptors on host cells.  They then become
trapped inside the SYNSORB that holds the sugar." says Dr. Glen Armstrong.
<p>
Current collaborators with the Network on this project are the Alberta Research Council and
the Canadian Pediatric Kidney Disease Reference Centre, who are participating in the pre-
clinical trials.

<title>New Finding May Prevent Deadly Infections for Cystic Fibrosis
Patients</title>

<h2>New Finding May Prevent Deadly Infections for Cystic Fibrosis
Patients</h2>

<p>A researcher with the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBDN)
has revealed a new biochemical approach that may block the onset
of chronic infections which kill most cystic fibrosis patients.

<p>Sufferers of cystic fibrosis usually succumb to a particular
type of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which invades and
weakens their lungs.  With their breathing pathways already
clogged by an excessive buildup of mucus, the additional stress
of bacterial infection often proves fatal.  The bacteria enter
the body through the mouth, where they stick to the epithelial
cells lining that region.  Secured there, P. aeruginosa can then
reproduce in sufficient numbers to mount a successful assault on
the lungs.  But the introduction of an inexpensive and nontoxic
form of sugar could stop the bacteria from attaching to these
epithelial cells.  Denied the chance to establish themselves
within the body, any subsequent infections would be thwarted and
the lives of many cystic fibrosis patients could be extended.

<p>Dr. David Speert, Head of Infectious and Immunological Diseases
at the University of British Columbia and B.C. Childrens
Hospital, has demonstrated the possibility of this kind of
treatment.  His work has focussed on the action of Dextran, a
class of glucose compounds developed about 50 years ago as a
blood substitute.  In collaboration with Polydex
Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Speert was originally considering Dextran
as a means of enhancing the function of macrophages, white blood
cells that play a key role in the bodys immune response.  He
observed no enhancement, but did note how Dextran inhibited
bacteria from attaching themselves to the macrophages.

<p>A patent application for the use of Dextran to treat patients
with cystic fibrosis has been filed by Dr. Speert and dextran
inventor Thomas Usher.  The next stage in the work will explore
the clinical effectiveness of this potential therapy.

<title>NEW SALMON VACCINE</title>
<h2>New Salmon Vaccine</h2>
<p>
A newly developed vaccine will help the Canadian aquaculture industry to remain competitive
in the global market. Designed to prevent Furunculosis, a prevalent and costly disease affecting
the salmon aqua- culture industry, the vaccine has been co-developed by Microtek R&D Ltd.,
of Victoria, B.C., and two University of Victoria researchers affiliated with the Canadian
Bacterial Diseases Network. The live vaccine, which has been highly effective in laboratory
trials, can be administered by immersion techniques, an important advance in aquaculture
vaccine technology. According to Microtek's Executive Vice-President, Goeff Grant, the
collaboration with the Network has accelerated the development schedule for the vaccine.
Microtek is currently awaiting regulatory approval to proceed to field testing. Furunculosis
costs the B.C. salmon aqua-culture industry $5.4 million annually; losses are $100 million
worldwide.

<title>FIGHTING INFECTIONS</title>

<h2>Fighting Infections</h2>
<p>
A new vaccine that could help people with an impaired immune system fight serious infections
has been developed by Edmonton-based SPI Synthetic Peptides Incorporated and collaborators
in the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBDN). Patents have been filed by SPI for the
new synthetic peptide-based vaccine, which blocks a bacteria known to cause one out of ten
infections acquired by patients after hospitalization. The vaccine is proving to be effective in
preliminary testing. Clinical trials are expected to begin in about two years. Further
investigations by CBDN researchers and SPI indicate that the vaccine might also work against
other disease- causing bacteria, providing opportunities for a broader range of therapeutic
applications. CBDN researchers at the Universities of Calgary and Alberta have discovered that
the vaccine also has a toxin-blocking potential.

<title>NETWORK RESEARCHER DISCOVERS GENES LEADING TO JUVENILE
DIABETES</title>

<h2>Network Researcher Discovers Genes Leading to Juvenile
Diabetes</h2>
<p>
A research team led by Dr. Leigh Field of the Canadian Genetic Diseases Network has
discovered two new genes that play an important part in the development of juvenile diabetes.
The breakthrough is a major step towards pinpointing the cause of this common form of
diabetes, which strikes one in 300 children by the age of 20. The research may lead to the
eventual development by the Network of diagnostic techniques to help identify individuals at
high risk of developing juvenile diabetes. Ultimately the goal is to prevent the onset of this
disease.
<p>
"When we understand which gene combinations are especially likely to produce diabetes, we
will be able to use a simple blood DNA test to identify children who have a high risk of
developing diabetes and give them treatment to prevent the onset of the disease," said Dr.
Field, a professor in the department of Medical Genetics at the University of Calgary. The
team's findings were published in October in the scientific journal Nature Genetics.
<p>
Juvenile diabetes, also known as Type I diabetes, is particularly complex because it is caused
by combinations of several genes. Two of these genes have eluded investigators until now. "I
believe we are very close to knowing how many genes contribute to tile disease and to
identifying children with a high risk of becoming diabetic," said Dr. Field, who has been
investigating juvenile diabetes since 1983 mainly through funding from the Medical Research
Council of Canada (MRC). Through her participation in the Canadian Genetic Diseases
Network since 1990, NCE support enabled Dr. Field to pursue a new direction which
eventually led to the discovery of the two new diabetes-causing genes. Dr. Field used a
"genome screen" procedure that involves searching across all chromosomes, which carry the
genes responsible for people's inherited characteristics, including genetic diseases. The team
studied and compared 100 "marker" genes in 250 families having two or more diabetic
children. After four years of investigation, Dr. Field and her team located one gene responsible
for diabetes at the bottom of chromosome 15, and the other in the middle of chromosome 11.
<p>
An estimated 100,000 Canadians have juvenile diabetes and require daily injections of insulin
to survive. The disease results from a person's own immune system attacking and destroying
the pancreas cells that produce insulin.
<p>
The Network team will pursue the genome screen method to continue to probe for all of the
critical genes associated with this disease and ultimately to prevent its onset. "The Network's
facilities and collaborations across Canada will be crucial to the rapid progress of Dr. Field's
ongoing research," said Dr. Michael Hayden, the Network's Scientific Director. Dr. Field also
credits the "Network's supportive and collaborative environment" as an asset to her research.
<p>
The Canadian Genetic Diseases Network brings together over 330 principal investigators,
research associates and graduate students in eight universities and six hospitals. Dynamic
partnerships and collaborations have been established with eight partner companies. Key
participants since the Network's Inception have been Merck-Frosst Inc. and MDS Health Group
Ltd.

<title>Tracking Huntingtons Disease</title>

<h2>Tracking Huntingtons Disease</h2>

<p>About 3,000 Canadians have Huntingtons Disease, and another
15,000 may be at risk of developing it.  Usually afflicting
people between the ages of 30 and 50, the disease slowly kills
brain cells and results in deterioration of control of movement
and of different psychological functions.  Every child with a
parent with the condition has a 50-50 chance of developing
Huntingtons, which currently has no cure or effective treatment.

<p>Researchers with the Canadian Genetics Diseases Network (CGDN)
have confirmed that a specific genetic error is associated with
almost all cases of Huntingtons Disease.  In an article
appearing in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine,
CGDN Scientific Director Dr. Michael Hayden and his colleagues
report that a specific pattern of DNA changes appears in
patients from 43 different countries and across five racial
groups, and clearly delineates those affected from normal
persons.

<p>This confirmation will help us to predict who will get the
disorder, and to understand the basis for its worldwide
distribution, says Dr. Hayden, who leads a team of researchers
at the University of British Columbia.  The group recently
succeeded in cloning the gene for the mouse version of
Huntingtons Disease, a development that will be important for
understanding the normal function of this gene and the
establishment of a model for the illness.  One of our major
goals is to determine the function of this gene and to determine
how changes in this gene cause illness, says Dr. Hayden.

<p>The cloning achievement, which was published early in 1994 in
the journal Human Molecular Genetics, caps a year of progress
for the Vancouver researchers, who are trying to understand this
inherited disorder.  The Vancouver scientists benefitted from
new gene tracking and screening techniques developed at
Torontos Hospital for Sick Children by a team led by Dr.
Johanna Rommens.

<p>Dr. Hayden credits much of this success to the support of the
Medical Research Council and the Networks of Centres of
Excellence, which has enhanced efforts to understand
Huntingtons Disease and search for effective methods of
treatment."Our collaboration with the Core Technology
Facilities of the Canadian Genetic Diseases Network is essential
to hasten our research goals of understanding the biochemical
cause of this disease," he says.

<title>GENETIC BREAKTHROUGH</title>
<h2>Genetic Breakthrough</h2>
<p>
Dr. Robert Korneluk, a principal investigator in the Canadian Genetic Diseases Network,
played a major role in the discovery of the genetic cause of myotonic muscular dystrophy. One
of the most common inherited neuromuscular diseases, myotonic dystrophy affects about one
in every 7,000 persons in Canada. Dr. Korneluk, whose Network research centre is based at
the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, led the five-year scientific search in collaboration
with an international team from the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States.
According to Dr. Korneluk, the fast exchange of information within the Network helped
accelerate the cloning of the gene. The Network has also allowed his team to move rapidly into
the next important stages of this discovery: determining the characteristics of the gene;
developing new diagnostic technologies; and exploring therapeutic opportunities.

<title>SPEECH CODING</title>
<h2>Speech Coding </h2>
<p>
It takes some sophisticated electronic hardware to squeeze more conversations onto increasingly
crowded cellular phone and radio networks. But as the manufacturers of this hardware are
discovering, such progress calls for some sophisticated analysis as well.
<p>
Algorithms being developed by researchers at McGill University, working through the
Canadian Institute for Telecommunications Research (CITR), are making possible this kind of
improvement In the performance of wireless communications. By reducing the rate at which
information needs to be sent over a link, a process known as speech coding, more bandwidth
is available to accommodate a higher volume of traffic.
<p>
A high quality voice connection over a standard telephone line requires some 64,000 bits of
data to be transmitted every second. CITR's new speech coding algorithm has lowered that rate
to 8,000 bits per second, while maintaining the same voice quality.
McGill electrical engineering professor Dr. Peter Kabal attributes this significant decrease to
the enhanced capabilities of the latest Digital Signal Processing chips, which can handle much
more sophisticated algorithms for speech coding.
<p>
"A few years ago, people would have told us these things are too complex for implementation,"
he says, noting that the communications industry now needs such powerful applications.
Corporate researchers are still looking for the most suitable standards to govern a unified North
American digital cellular telephone system, and Dr. Kabal says his group may be able to make
a useful contribution. "CITR is helping to lubricate this process, making sure we can talk to
industry, and making sure the problems we're working on are of interest to them," he says.

<title>Major Advance in Photonic Systems</title>

<h2>Major Advance in Photonic Systems</h2>

<p>Future telecommunications switching systems needed for the
Information Superhighway will require very large throughput
between Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), 
perhaps as much as several terabits per second.  
A terabit per second can support about 15 million simultaneous
telephone conversations or 330,000 good-quality video
connections.  Since this is beyond the capability 
of conventional electronic technology, a Canadian Institute for
Telecommunications Research (CITR) research team is seeking a
novel solution which uses lightwave technology.  Specifically,
the team is developing techniques for interconnecting PCBs using
two-dimensional arrays of optical channels which propagate in
air over the short distance between the PCBs.  One of the key
advantages of this approach is that it provides very high
communication bandwidths between critical parts of the
electronic system.

<p>Researchers at McGill recently constructed a demonstration
system capable of interconnecting printed circuit boards using
custom optics and optomechanics.  The system demonstrated for
the first time the integration of optics into a standard
electronic backplane chassis, thus showing the feasibility of
integrating free-space optical interconnects into conventional
electronic systems.

<p>"This marks an important milestone toward our long-term
objective of developing the necessary technology for future-oriented
switching systems" said Professor David Plant, who led the
McGill team that built the system demonstrator.  

<p>This CITR research program involves seven professors, a dozen 
postgraduate students and several Research Associates at McGill,
McMaster and TR Labs.  Researchers at NRC are also collaborating 
in the project.

<title>Concrete Savings  </title>

<h2>Concrete Savings  </h2>

<p>A networks range of applications can be very broad.  Concrete
Canadas clients include both the construction and agriculture
industries.  One area of interest to the construction industry
is the use of high-performance concrete for above-ground
installations, such as overpasses and buildings, where it offers
increased durability and lower construction costs.  The industry
is also interested in applications for construction, maintenance
and repair of underwater infrastructure, which in Canada alone
represents billions of dollars.  The photo at right illustrates
the placement of highly fluid, yet washout-resistant,
high-performance concrete to repair damaged structures.

<p>The agriculture industry is beginning to use high-performance
concrete in environments where older forms of concrete pose
problems, such as in animal pens.  Traditional concrete, which
is more porous, often becomes a breeding ground for the bacteria
and parasites that infect animals, resulting in expenses to
growers who must disinfect their barns and may also lose income
due to an animals decreased weight or even death. Pens made
with high-performance concrete are several times less porous,
and so inhospitable to infection-causing bacteria.  The piglets
shown at left, raised in pens with heated, high-performance
concrete floors, suffered significantly fewer infections,
thereby increasing their growers profits.  Preventing
profit-cutting infections is a significant benefit in
agriculture markets: for example, pork export revenues for
Qubec in 1994 were greater than Hydro-Qubecs electricity
exports.

<title>BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE</title>
<h2>Bridge to the Future</h2>
<p>
A new bridge at Portneuf, Quebec, has been designed and built using concrete that offers
greater strength and durability than ever before, thanks to a Canadian Network's leading-edge
research in high-performance concrete (HPC). The bridge, which replaces an old steel bridge
in the heart of Portneuf, is the first of its kind in North America to be designed and built out
of HPC, using the technology developed by the Network of Centres of Excellence on High-
performance Concrete. HPC's high durability and strength makes it ideal for thinner structural
designs. This proved to be the best solution for constructing the Portneuf bridge within certain
space limitations and other physical restrictions: the bridge had to be built across a small river
that could rise fairly high owing to a tide and spring thaw. A thinner deck would help avoid
the rising water. "Without high-performance concrete technology, we could not have
constructed this type of bridge," says Louis-George Coulombe, a structural engineer with the
Quebec Ministry of Transportation.
<p>
This successful project is the outcome of a unique partnership involving the Network and over
20 building contractors, consulting engineers, materials companies, owners and researchers in
Quebec. They have linked up in a technology transfer endeavour called 'Projet Voles Nouvelles
du Bton,' aimed at finding and developing new applications for high-performance concrete.
According to Francois Lacroix, Director of 'Projet Voles Nouvelles du Be' ton,' and the
Quebec Regional Director of the Canadian Portland Cement Association, "the existence of the
Network of Centres of Excellence on High-performance Concrete is what got 'Projet Voles
Nouvelles du Be' ton' under way in 1990. Our aim is to increase the application of HPC and
have experimental projects built to make its use commonplace." After their success with the
Portneuf bridge, the partners are working together to develop specifications for other HPC
projects, including a bridge at Mirabel, and pedestrian overpasses in Laval.
<p>
The Network, which offered its expertise and technology in developing the material for the
Portneuf bridge, has installed sophisticated measuring instruments in the bridge to gather
crucial data for further research.
<p>
The bridge's entire structure, including the deck, is made of 60-MPa silica-fume concrete
(MPa, or Megapascal, is the measurement for the compressive strength of concrete). It has been
built to withstand all types of traffic, including heavy machinery and trucks. Extra
protective materials such as membrane and asphalt on the deck have been eliminated to
confirm research results on the strong performance of HPC under traffic conditions.
Eliminating the need for protective materials could help lower costs for repairing and replacing
Canada's costly infrastructure, and the durability of HPC will help lower the maintenance cost
over the life of the new structure. In Quebec alone, at least $300 million will be spent on
replacing or reinforcing older bridges in the next 10 years.
